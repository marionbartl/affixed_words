Democrats reporting irregularities in 14th District voting machines
Democrats began reporting irregularities in voting late morning today during the 14th District special election in which Republican Jim Oberweis faces Democrat Bill Foster to replace retiring Dennis Hastert .
Justin Major , a voter protection lawyer for the Foster campaign , observed that the word " Republican " flashed on a touch - screen voting booth at Pioneer School at 615 Kenwood in West Chicago as though it was a primary election .
The ballot was normal otherwise and the word came up only on the screen .
Paper ballots were also available , and no problems were reported with the use of paper .

Major said the same problem was reported to him by election judges at St. Andrew 's Country Club on Route 59 in West Chicago , at Faith Community Church at 910 Main St. in West Chicago , and at Wegner School , 1180 Marcella Lane in West Chicago .
" I wonder why the opponent is hitting the jackpot , " Major said .
" It really concerns me because this is such a tight race . "
Major said he was told that technicians from either Diebold , the manufacturer of the touch - screen machines , or from the DuPage Election Commission had been notified .
In one precinct , election judges had placed masking tape on the screen to hide the word Republican .
Amy Tauchman , new political director of the DuPage Democratic Party , said there are only 14 14th - District precincts in DuPage County .
The majority of the district is in Kane County .
" They should shut down the touch - screen booths rather than allow this subliminal advertising , " Tauchman said .

Charlton Heston played holy men , Presidents , and cowboys , but all with the same human strengths and frailties .
His commanding voice and strong presence made him one of Hollywood ’s legendary leading men , while his political beliefs gradually set him apart from most in his profession .
Today he finally joins the rest of the legends in entertainment as well as the holy men and Presidents he portrayed on the silver screen ( via Memeorandum ) :
Charlton Heston , the Oscar - winning actor who achieved stardom playing larger - than - life figures including Moses , Michelangelo and Andrew Jackson and went on to become an unapologetic gun advocate and darling of conservative causes , has died .
He was 84 .
Heston died Saturday at his Beverly Hills home , said family spokesman Bill Powers .
In 2002 , he had been diagnosed with symptoms similar to those of Alzheimer ’s disease .
With a booming baritone voice , the tall , ruggedly handsome actor delivered his signature role as the prophet Moses in Cecil B. DeMille ’s 1956 Biblical extravaganza “ The Ten Commandments , ” raising a rod over his head as God miraculously parts the Red Sea .
Heston won the Academy Award for best actor in another religious blockbuster in 1959 ’s “ Ben - Hur , ” racing four white horses at top speed in one of the cinema ’s legendary action sequences : the 15 - minute chariot race in which his character , a proud and noble Jew , competes against his childhood Roman friend . ….
Late in life , Heston ’s stature as a political firebrand overshadowed his acting .
He became demonized by gun-control advocates and liberal Hollywood when he became president of the National Rifle Assn. in 1998 .
Ironically so , since Heston marched with Martin Luther King in the pre-Civil Rights
Act period of the civil - rights movement .
Hollywood turned its back on one of its biggest icons for the sin of becoming Republican and of supporting gun rights .
Of course , while Hollywood rejected Heston for his stand on the 2nd Amendment , it churned out more and more films dedicated to mass shootings and indiscriminate violence .
Heston could n’t have fired more bullets in his entire lifetime than in a year of Hollywood movies .
Those ironies and hypocrisies amount to little against Heston ’s lifetime of work , on stage and screen as well as in supporting gun rights .
Even Democrats these days do n’t argue for gun control , chastised by national elections and common sense .
The Supreme Court appears ready to acknowledge what Heston had long insisted — that the Constitution guarantees an individual right to gun ownership .
His dedication to the Constitution may well be his greatest work .
But of course , it wo n’t be his most memorable .
Whether in classic movies like The Ten Commandments and Ben-Hur , in science fiction like Planet of the Apes or Soylent Green , or in later , quieter appearances in Tombstone , True Lies , and self - deprecating cameos in Wayne ’s World 2 and the remake of Planet of the Apes , Heston has left a remarkable and diverse body of work that will remain with us long after his ankle - biting critics have returned to Oblivion .
Godspeed , Mr. Heston .
Update : Jennifer Harper was kind enough to include my thoughts in the Washington Times obituary for Charlton Heston .

( LifeWire ) --
Two years ago , Stephanie Kaster of Manhattan set out to plan the birthday party of a lifetime for her daughter .
Granted , little Sophie did n't have many parties under her belt with which to compare it :
She was not yet 3 .
Elisa Strauss ' Confetti Cakes created this $ 1,500 Coach bag - themed cake for a 10 - year - old girl 's birthday party .
" I just thought , ' If I go to another paint - a - ceramic - bowl or stuff - a - bear party , I 'll shoot myself , ' " says Kaster .
So she booked a fondue restaurant , hired a musical troupe to perform as the Wiggles ( her daughter 's favorite group ) and ordered a four - layer cake .
Each guest took home a Fisher - Price guitar and custom CD .
The price tag ?
$ 5,000 .
" I could n't believe that I 'd ended up spending that much , " Kaster says .
Some birthday parties now rival weddings in scale and price -- with some costing tens of thousands of dollars .
Maybe it 's the ever - growing number of millionaires ; maybe it's the conspicuous consumption celebrated on reality shows like MTV's " My Super Sweet 16 . "
Whatever the reason , it 's keeping Corinne Dinsfriend in business .
She owns Over the Top Productions in Orange County , California , a full - service children 's birthday - party planning company .
" We really promote a healthy balance of living year round , " Dinsfriend says , " but it 's OK to indulge your child once a year , because it 's about making a memory . "
Tell us about your parties
$ 1,000 birthday cake
Each
Over the Top party has a theme and is run by a team trained in child development , says Dinsfriend .
Her events -- from tea parties with fine china to military - themed parties led by former Marines -- usually take six weeks to plan and cost as much as $ 10,000 .
That 's small potatoes compared with some celebrations .
FAO Schwarz , the New York City toy retailer , rents out its store several nights a week for parties .
The base cost is $ 25,000 .
Even more extreme is the $ 10 million that former defense contractor David H. Brooks of Long Island reportedly spent in 2005 on his daughter 's bat mitzvah .
That soiree , at the storied Rainbow Room in Rockefeller Center , featured 50 Cent , Don Henley and Aerosmith , among others .
Other trends : lavishly sculpted confections like those by Elisa Strauss , the designer at Confetti Cakes in Manhattan , who charges at least $ 1,000 per cake .
Invitations are custom - made .
And the activities ?
" You can get cotton - candy machines , jumping castles , you can rent a gym or movie theater , or have a real astronaut come , do it at Yankee Stadium ... you can do anything , " says Lyss Stern of DivalyssciousMoms.com .
She recently organized a fair where 40 high - end birthday - party purveyors pitched their services to parents at the private Park East Day School in New York City .
Wrong message ?
Some parents , however , worry that expensive parties for children result in mixed - up values -- and leave many feeling obliged to overspend .
Last year , a group of five parents in St. Paul , Minnesota , started BirthdaysWithoutPressure.org , which promotes simpler celebrations .
" We are trying to raise awareness that lots of parents are feeling pressured to throw bigger parties than they are comfortable with , " says co-founder Julie Printz .
" I have friends who 've spent $ 1,000 on a party and then ( felt ) remorseful .
For me , it was more about the insanity in my head .
I 'd go crazy trying to figure out the perfect craft , special foods , gift bags ... I 'd get caught up in this birthday anxiety . "
Two years ago when her daughter Emily turned 6 , St. Paul stay - at - home mom Laura Forstrom threw her a birthday party for the first time .
Emily invited sixteen friends to celebrate at a Color Me Mine ceramics painting center .
" I did n't think all 16 would come , but they did , and it was $ 15 a person , " she said .
Add in the cake , favors , pizza and soda , and Forstrom spent over $ 1,000 .
" After we got the bill I was like , ' Oh my God ! '
It was more expensive than fixing the dog 's broken leg .
It just got out of control so quickly , " she said .
" There are so many other things we could 've done with the money .
...
We have n't had a birthday party for any of our kids since . "
This year , Kaster decided to try a slightly simpler approach .
For Sophie 's party , she booked a small theater that does plays for children , hand - decorated a sheet cake from the supermarket , and got inexpensive favors from a discount store .
The whole event cost less than $ 500 , " and everyone said it was the best party they 'd ever been to , " Kaster says .
" I want to give my children all I can , but it's not a monetary thing , " Kaster says .
" A $ 500 party does n't mean I love them any less than if they had a $ 5,000 party , as long as they have a good time .
And that 's what it 's all about . "
Parties under $ 50
Lynnae McCoy , of Talent , Oregon , runs BeingFrugal.net and has never spent more than $ 50 on parties for her two children , ages 5 and 10 .
Here 's her advice :
• Do it at home , even if it means more cleanup .
• Make the cake yourself .
Decorating it together can help the kids get excited for their party .
• Limit guests to close friends and family .
• Plan a late - afternoon party to save money on food by serving snacks instead of a meal .
• Find low - cost art projects , like painting pet rocks .
• Use the library as a resource .
You could rent a dance instruction video , for example , and have that be your activity .
On the Web
Here are some sites that offer tips on low - cost party planning for kids :

LifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers .
Anna Jane Grossman is a freelance writer in New York ..
It turns out the story is more nuanced than it first appears .
And for the explanation ( more later ) I 'm grateful to Stephen Hall , the author of a new book , Size Matters : How Height Affects the Health , Happiness and Success of Boys - and the Men They Become .
Society 's prejudice against short people ( they " got no reason to live " Randy Newman sang ) needs to be dismantled .
Unlike discrimination on grounds of gender , age and race , heightism is not acknowledged as a problem .
And yet when academics do the numbers , short people always come up … short .
One study found discrimination against the short was worse than sex and race discrimination .
People unconsciously ascribe nice qualities to the tall .
Even before a tall person utters a word , people think they know something about him or her .
They are deemed more worthy , dependable , intelligent and authoritative , myriad studies show .
In short , they have " stature " .
It once was advantageous to be a short woman .
You were considered cute , perky or sweet ; you had the pick of the overlooked small boys as well as the basketball players and ruckmen .
But these qualities are of diminishing value with age .
They wo n't get you a seat on the board , or the CEO 's job , that sort of thing .
I would be as rich as a tall person if I had a dollar for every time a reader of my columns on meeting me said : " I thought you 'd be taller . "
It seems a person who makes a living through expressing her opinions should have the height to go with it .
That 's because small - minded people confuse a lack of height with a lack of authority .
It is something short men have always known .
Look at how John Howard was mocked for years as " little Johnny Howard " and underestimated by his opponents even though at 176.5 centimetres he is about average height .
His political success is even more fascinating given he has beaten much taller men .
In the US , the taller presidential candidate usually wins .
" What chance does a 5 foot 7 inch [ 170 centimetres ] billionaire Jew who is divorced really have of becoming president ? " the New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently joked .
The subsequent discussion focused on the barrier of his height .
It is Hall 's contention that height affects how boys develop , the way people treat them , the games they play , the spouses they choose , the respect they command and the salaries they receive .
But it is his height at about age 16 , one study found , that later determined a man 's salary .
No matter how tall boys later become , the undersized adolescent may never escape his " inner shrimp " , the cartoonist Garry Trudeau - whose late growth spurt took him over six feet ( 183 centimetres ) - once said .
For some adolescent boys shortness causes emotional anguish .
The growth spurt is too little and too late .
And it is one problem parents can't fix .
Yet it also seems that most short boys develop qualities that carry them through .
Indeed there is evidence it is adults , not children , who have a complex about size .
A major study by the University of Buffalo found a child 's stature had minimal detectable impact on their social standing among their mates in high school .
Even the very short showed no signs of psychological problems .
It is entirely possible short boys , given survival skills they may need to cultivate , turn out to be nicer than the average alpha male .
It is not short men who are lacking .
It is society 's attitude that is the problem ; if women and bosses spurn shorter men for the wrong reasons it 's their loss .
As for the intellectual superiority of tall people , it is not what it seems .
The real story goes like this : height is determined not only by genes but by the nutrition we get in the womb and in early childhood .
A nourishing early environment allows us to reach our genetic potential in height - and in intelligence .
And so someone who is 182 centimetres but might have been 188 centimetres with better early nutrition may be dumber than someone who was healthy and well - fed in childhood , and reached their genetic potential , and stands at 167 centimetres .
All children deserve the chance to reach their optimum height , and if that turns out to be on the small side , the chances are , in spite of society 's prejudices , they 'll thrive .
SAN FRANCISCO –
At least five convicted felons secured management positions at a manufacturer of electronic voting machines , according to critics demanding more stringent background checks for people responsible for voting machine software .
Voter advocate Bev Harris alleged Tuesday that managers of a subsidiary of Diebold , one of the country 's largest voting equipment vendors , included a cocaine trafficker , a man who conducted fraudulent stock transactions and a programmer jailed for falsifying computer records .
The programmer , Jeffrey Dean , wrote and maintained proprietary code used to count hundreds of thousands of votes as senior vice president of Global Election Systems , or GES .
Diebold purchased GES in January 2002 .
According to a public court document released before GES hired him , Dean served time in a Washington state correctional facility for stealing money and tampering with computer files in a scheme that " involved a high degree of sophistication and planning . "
" You can't tell me these people passed background tests , " Harris , author of Black Box Voting : Ballot Tampering in the 21st Century , said in a phone interview .
Diebold spokesman Michael Jacobsen emphasized that the company performs background checks on all managers and programmers .
He said many GES managers – including Dean – left at the time of the acquisition .
" We can't speak for the hiring process of a company before we acquired it , " Jacobsen said .
He would not provide further details , saying company policy bars discussion of current or past employees .
The former GES is Diebold 's wholly owned subsidiary , Global Election Management Systems , which produces the operating system that touch - screen voting terminals use .
Dean could not be reached for comment Tuesday afternoon .
Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - California ) announced a bill last week that would require stringent background checks on all electronic voting company employees who work with voting software .
The bill , which Boxer plans to introduce in January , would toughen security standards for voting software and hardware , and require touch - screen terminals to include printers and produce paper backups of vote counts by the 2004 presidential election in November .
Harris and Andy Stephenson , a Democratic candidate for secretary of state in Washington , conducted a 10 - day investigation in Seattle and Vancouver , where the men were convicted .
Harris and Stephenson released the findings in a 17 - page document online and at a news conference in Seattle .
Also Tuesday , Washington Secretary of State Sam Reed announced legislation that would require electronic voting machines in the state to produce a paper trail .
If the legislature approves it , touch - screen machines in the state would be required to produce paper receipts by 2006 .
Voters would get to see but not touch or remove the receipts , which would be kept in a county lock box .
Computer programmers say software bugs , hackers or electrical failures could cause more than 50,000 touch - screen machines used in precincts nationwide to delete or alter votes .
California Secretary of State Kevin Shelley said last month that touch - screens in the nation 's most populous state must provide paper receipts by 2006 .
UBS just announced another ugly write - down , $ 14 billion and a $ 4 billion loss for 2008 , and that wo n’t be the last of it for the industry .
How can the former CEOs continue to hold their millions when it was based on such bogus business ?
Now that the investigation is moving , will anything come of it ?
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened criminal inquiries into 14 companies as part of a wide - ranging investigation of the troubled mortgage industry , F.B.I. officials said Tuesday .
The F.B.I. said it was looking into possible accounting fraud , insider trading or other violations in connection with loans made to borrowers with weak , or subprime , credit .
The agency declined to identify the companies under investigation but said the inquiry , which began last spring , involves companies across the financial industry , including mortgage lenders , loan brokers and Wall Street banks that packaged home loans into securities .
Best - selling author Mary Roach made a name for herself by exploring the secret lives of cadavers ( in her book Stiff ) and science 's fascination with the supernatural ( in Spook ) .
Now , she 's turned to the often - wacky researchers who are obsessed by exactly what happens when Part A goes into Slot B .
In her new book Bonk : The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex , Roach explores topics ranging from the sexual stimulation of Danish pigs and MRI scanner intercourse to bisexual bulls and the 19th century " penile pricking device " ( do n't ask ) .
What did Roach discover ?
She tells all in an interview with Wired.com .
Wired :
You 've written twice before about death and science .
What made you decide to look at sex and science ?
Mary Roach : I was lying in bed and reading Film Quarterly , which was lying around our house .
There was a reference to [ sex researchers ]
Masters and Johnson making films using a tiny camera and a light source inside a moving phallus – the artificial coition machine .
I remember thinking , Holy shit , they made this camera and that 's how they did their research – they brought subjects into the lab and documented their sexual response from the inside with a little tiny camera in a " penis . "
That 's when I said my next book was about sex research .
I was despairing that I 'd never have another idea , and there it was !
Wired : An artificial coition machine ?
Roach :
That was a humdinger .
It was very innovative .
There were a lot of basic things about female arousal that they did n't know without seeing inside .
They were able to answer a lot of questions about things like lubrication and " vaginal tenting , " which is when the back part of the vagina pulls away .
It was a big mystery , and they were able to literally shine a light on female sexuality .
Wired :
What are some myths about sex that scientists have debunked ?
Roach :
There 's the coital interlocking myth , which goes all the way back to Leonardo DaVinci [ and his drawings of intercourse ] .
The idea was that when people had sex , the penis would go all the way inside the cervix , and the cervix would open like Pac - Man .
There would be this thing like the space shuttle docking .
If you had trouble getting pregnant , you had a bad interlock .
It was n't until [ early 20th - century American gynecologist ]
Robert Latou Dickinson got out his test tube and did some intravaginal spying that he discovered the penis does n't hit the cervix but just goes right by it .
Somebody also did research disproving that the bigger your clitoris , the better your orgasms or the more arousable you are .
Wired :
What was the most surprising thing you discovered in your exploration of sex research ?
Roach :
That women get nocturnal clitoral erections .
The clitoris is sort of like a little tiny penis … I just love that they actually studied it , that they found women with especially big clitorises and got a big strain gauge and figured it out .
You 've got to love scientists .
I was also surprised that so many men have multiple orgasms .
That was new and interesting , as was the fact that the nose has erectile tissue .
Wired :
What did you learn about sex researchers themselves ?
Roach : Everybody 's heard of Masters and Johnson , but I do n't think most people are aware of how thorough they were and just what went on their labs .
Not that there 's anything wrong with what went on their labs .
[ For instance , they ] got a woman to come in and have sex with a machine and record what was going on inside her body .
And there was another study where they matched people up , assigned them to partners and had them have sex .
Wired :
There 's a psychoanalyst mentioned in your book named Princess Marie Bonaparte .
She was a confidante of Sigmund Freud and a great - grandniece of Napoleon – but what was her role in the history of sex research ?
Roach : Marie Bonaparte was extraordinary .
She was n't trained as a physician , but she interviewed all these women , and she measured the distance between the clitoris and the vagina .
She was looking for correlations between their clitorises and whether they had orgasms in the missionary position .
She herself never did .
She thought of herself as a voluptuous sexual woman , but she never got any satisfaction from sex .
Her husband was gay , and that was a complicating factor , but she had a number of affairs and complained about them too .
She knew a surgeon , and to test her theory about the clitoris and the vagina , she had her own clitoris surgically moved closer to her vagina .
It was written up .
But it did n't help .
It 's sad because someone should have taken her aside and said , " Try something else [ sexually ] . "
Instead , she went straight to the operating table .
Those were different times .
Wired :
Sex drives a lot of people bonkers .
Does it do the same thing to scientists who try to understand it ?
Roach : Sexual response is such an individual thing :
There are people who have orgasms when they brush their teeth .
There 's so much individual difference that it's hard to do what science likes to do and make conclusive statements .
Wired :
What do you think science has n't figured out about sex ?
Roach :
That whole question of what makes the difference between a woman who easily has orgasms from intercourse and someone who never does .
What is the variable ?
Is it emotional or mental ?
The G - spot ?
Nobody knows .
There 's probably no answer :
It 's different in different women .
Wired :
Some people say that men's sexuality is like an on - and - off switch , while women's is more like an airplane 's control panel with dozens of gauges and dials .
Is it true that there 's simply a lot more to a woman 's sexuality ?
Roach :
That 's obviously a generalization .
There 's a huge range of individual differences .
But it 's safe to say yes .
Women are much more complicated .
Wired : Give me an example .
Roach :
My favorite line in [ Alfred ]
Kinsey 's work was how when cheese crumbs are spread before a pair of copulating rats , it distracts the female but not the male .
[ With women ] , the phone rings , you 've got to start all over again .
The conditions are more important with women .
Wired :
Is science paying more attention to women now ?
Roach : Big time .
They 've just booted men out on their asses : " We 've made enough money off you [ through impotence drugs ] .
There must be something for [ women ] we can cook up . "
That 's where the attention is now .
Wired :
Do you think it will take awhile before there 's a Viagra – a drug that works so well in so many men – for women ?
Roach :
They 've given up on a female analog for Viagra .
A drug that boosts blood flow down there does n't work : Women do n't perceive themselves as being more aroused , even though there 's more blood flow .
It 's that pesky mind - body disconnect .
Now they 're looking at central nervous - system drugs for low libido .
There 's one called Flibanserin that 's making its way through the FDA pipeline now .
Wired :
You point out that pharmaceutical companies are taking the lead in funding sex research to treat sexual disorders .
Is any kind of sex research getting neglected these days ?
Roach :
No one funds pure anatomical , physiological research anymore , which is sad no matter what field you 're talking about .
The doubtful guest went for a stroll on the beach in New South Wales and stumbled upon , and photographed beautifully :
Bluebottle
1 ) they are not one animal but actually a colony of highly modified and co-operative individuals - the single pneumatophore or float , the stinging dactylozooids which capture the food , the gastrozooids which do the digesting and the gonozooids , in charge of reproduction .
2 ) they really f*cking hurt when they sting .
the most effective relief for the pain is ice .
a most excellent reason ensure you take a well - stocked esky to the beach .
3 ) they live at the mercy of the wind and currents .
the course of their voyage is determined by the curvature of the float and the resistance of the rest of the colony underwater .
the float can project to right or to the left , each form being influenced differently by the wind .
thus the sailing angle of one form may lead to it to be washed up on the shore but others , sailing to the opposite side of the wind may well escape .
4 ) a severe bluebottle sting is no laughing matter , often causing major respiratory distress in humans .
however , the bluebottle colony primarily feeds on teensy - tiny surface floating crustaceans and other planktonic fauna .
5 ) when bluebottle floats dry out in the sun they go all crispy and make a really cool popping noise when you stand on them .
( note : freshly washed up bluebottles also pop nicely but the tentacles have a tendency to flick onto the top of your foot , which hurts like the blazes - definitely not recommended . )

Stanford drops tuition for some students Families that earn less than $ 100,000 a year get big break
In a radical change to its financial aid program , Stanford University will announce today that it will no longer charge tuition to students whose families earn less than $ 100,000 a year .
In addition , the university will waive room and board fees for students whose families earn less than $ 60,000 a year .
University President John Hennessy will make the announcement today on campus , university Provost John Etchemendy confirmed late Tuesday .
The university is making the change in the wake of published reports last month that its endowment had grown almost 22 percent last year , to $ 17.1 billion .
That sum had begun to attract attention from lawmakers who want wealthy institutions to do more to reduce tuition costs .
Financial aid also will increase to families that make more than $ 100,000 a year .
" Thanks to our increasingly generous financial aid program ... attending Stanford will cost less than most private and many public universities , " Etchemendy said .
To pay for the new tuition assistance , the university said it will increase its annual endowment payout to 5.5 percent .
The new plan , which begins in the 2008 - 09 academic year , eliminates the need for student loans for qualifying students .
" We are committed to ensuring that Stanford asks parents and students to contribute only what they can afford , " Hennessy said .
" No high school senior should rule out applying to Stanford because of cost . "
Stanford is among dozens of high - end colleges and universities where tuition has grown faster than the rate of inflation and where tax - exempt endowments have increased by more than 10 percent annually .
Last month , after a report from the National Association of College and University Business Officers called attention to the swollen tax - exempt endowments , a prominent U.S. senator began to question the practice .
" They 're supposed to offer public benefit in return for the privilege of tax exemption , " said Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa , the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee .
" If endowments increase by double digits from one year to the next , it raises the idea that maybe these schools are n't using enough of their endowments to help students afford college . "
Stanford 's endowment is the third largest of any university in the country , behind only Harvard and Yale .
In the past 10 years , tuition alone at Stanford increased from $ 21,3000 to $ 34,800 - roughly $ 7,200 more than if it had held to the rate of inflation during the decade .
The university said 3 out of 4 students currently get some financial aid .
The new program is expected to reduce the average bill paid by a student 's family by 16 percent .
The university said it would continue to take into account a family 's assets and overall situation , in addition to earnings , in determining the financial aid it could receive .
The university said it would continue its " need - blind " admission policy , guaranteeing that students will be accepted to the university regardless of their ability to pay .

Stephen King on videogames
I ’m no fan of videogames ; pretty much gave them up in the late ’ 70s or early ’ 80s , when my kids used to beat me regularly at Pitfall !
( hell , they used to beat me at Pong , and back then our youngest was n’t yet eligible for T - ball , let alone Little League ) .
Sure , I ’ve occasionally plugged quarters into one of the machines in the lobby of my local cineplex and shot at some bad guys , but I always miss the high - value targets and can never remember how to reload .
As for amassing enough points to get bonus time ?
Forget about it .
If I arrive early for the show , I ’m much more apt to stick my money in the nonviolent machine that ’s full of stuffed toys .
You probably know the one I ’m talking about ; you get 30 seconds to maneuver the claw , then drop it .
I won a stuffed dog on one occasion doing that .
Another time I won a rubber frog .
When you squeezed it , the frog made a ribbit - ribbit sound and stuck out its tongue , which I enjoyed ( your uncle Stevie is easily amused , he admits ) .
So , nope — videogames are not my thing .
Nor am I some kind of raving political nutcase .
But when I heard about HB 1423 , which happens to be a bill pending in the Massachusetts state legislature , I still hit the roof .
HB 1423 would restrict or outright ban the sale of violent videogames to anyone under the age of 18 .
Which means , by the way , that a 17 - year - old who can get in to see Hostel : Part II would be forbidden by law from buying ( or renting , one supposes ) the violent but less graphic Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas .
According to the proposed bill , violent videogames are pornographic and have no redeeming social merit .
The vid-critics claim they exist for one reason and one reason only , so kids can experience the vicarious thrill of killing .
Now , what does and does n’t have social merit is always an interesting question , one I can discuss for hours .
But what makes me crazy is when politicians take it upon themselves to play surrogate parents .
The results of that are usually disastrous .
Not to mention undemocratic .
One of HB 1423 ’s cosponsors is Rep. Christine E. Canavan , of Brockton .
” I think this legislation is a good idea , ” she told the Boston Herald .
” I do n’t want this constant barrage of violence on young minds and for them to think it is all right . ”
It ’s a good point … except that it seems to me that the games only reflect a violence that already exists in the society .
Nor will I argue for the artistic value of stuff like God of War , or 50 Cent : Bulletproof , where looting the victims of gang violence is part of the game ( players use the money to buy new Fiddy tunes and music videos — classy ) .
I do , however , want to point out that videogames , like movies , have a ratings system , and ones with the big M or A on the box mean ” Not for you , baby brother . ”
NEXT PAGE : ” What really makes me insane is how eager politicians are to use the pop culture as a whipping boy .
It ’s easy for them , even sort of fun , because the pop-cult always hollers nice and loud .
Also , it allows legislators to ignore the elephants in the living room . ”
And if there ’s violence to be had , the kids are gonna find a way to get it , just as they ’ll find a way to get all - day shooters like No Country for Old Men from cable if they want .
Or Girls Gone Wild , for that matter .
Can parents block that stuff ?
You bet .
But most never do .
The most effective bar against what was called ” the seduction of the innocent ” when this hot - button issue centered on violent comic books 60 years ago is still parents who know and care not just about what their kids are watching and reading , but what they ’re doing and who they ’re hanging with .
Parents need to have the guts to forbid material they find objectionable … and then explain why it ’s being forbidden .
They also need to monitor their children ’s lives in the pop culture — which means a lot more than seeing what games they ’re renting down the street .
If HB 1423 becomes law , will it remain law ?
Doubtful .
Similar legislation has been declared unconstitutional in several states .
Could Massachusetts legislators find better ways to watch out for the kiddies ?
Man , I sure hope so , because there ’s a lot more to America ’s culture of violence than Resident Evil 4 .
What really makes me insane is how eager politicians are to use the pop culture — not just videogames but TV , movies , even Harry Potter — as a whipping boy .
It ’s easy for them , even sort of fun , because the pop-cult always hollers nice and loud .
Also , it allows legislators to ignore the elephants in the living room .
Elephant
One is the ever - deepening divide between the haves and have - nots in this country , a situation guys like Fiddy and Snoop have been indirectly rapping about for years .
Elephant Two is America ’s almost pathological love of guns .
It was too easy for critics to claim — falsely , it turned out — that Cho Seung - Hui ( the Virginia Tech killer ) was a fan of Counter - Strike ; I just wish to God that legislators were as eager to point out that this nutball had no problem obtaining a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun .
Cho used it in a rampage that resulted in the murder of 32 people .
If he ’d been stuck with nothing but a plastic videogame gun , he would n’t even have been able to kill himself .

BBC Middle East correspondent
Falk believes that Israel has been avoiding criticism
The next UN investigator into Israeli conduct in the occupied territories has stood by comments comparing Israeli actions in Gaza to those of the Nazis .
Speaking to the BBC , Professor Richard Falk said he believed that up to now Israel had been successful in avoiding the criticism that it was due .
Professor Falk is scheduled to take up his post for the UN Human Rights Council later in the year .
But Israel wants his mandate changed to probe Palestinian actions as well .
Professor Falk said he drew the comparison between the treatment of Palestinians with the Nazi record of collective atrocity , because of what he described as the massive Israeli punishment directed at the entire population of Gaza .
He said he understood that it was a provocative thing to say , but at the time , last summer , he had wanted to shake the American public from its torpor .
Israeli actions in Gaza are collective punishment , says Falk " If this kind of situation had existed for instance in the manner in which China was dealing with Tibet or the Sudanese government was dealing with Darfur , I think there would be no reluctance to make that comparison , " he said .
That reluctance was , he argued , based on the particular historical sensitivity of the Jewish people , and Israel 's ability to avoid having their policies held up to international law and morality .
These and other comments from Professor Falk are , if anything , even harsher than the current UN investigator , John Dugard , who himself has been withering about Israel 's actions .
A spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry said that Israel wanted the UN investigator 's mandate changed , so that he could look into human rights violations by the Palestinians as well as Israel .
If that were not to happen , the Israeli government may consider barring entry to the new UN investigator .

Marching Toward Hell
America and Islam After Iraq
By Michael Scheuer
FREE PRESS ; 364 PAGES ; $ 27
At this point in President Bush 's " war of terror " ( as Borat , uh , mistakenly put it ) , plenty of writers and political analysts have described this campaign 's historic miscalculations .
Few have done so more lethally than Michael Scheuer , a 22 - year veteran of the CIA who held the unique distinction of directing the agency 's Osama bin Laden unit , until he took early retirement in 2004 .
Scheuer 's latest book , " Marching Toward Hell : America and Islam After Iraq , " his third in a kind of anti-neoconservative trilogy , is no exception .
Born out of frustration with six years of grievous American mistakes , it is the angriest of the three .
As befits someone of his background , Scheuer 's arguments are hyper - practical , almost coldblooded .
To foster what he calls a new America First policy , he believes the United States should stop intervening in trouble spots around the world - even if this means watching hordes of innocents being slaughtered , women 's rights being trampled and Middle Eastern oil going to other countries .
This has led many experts to call Scheuer ( now famous as the anonymous author of the 2004 book " Imperial Hubris : Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror " ) an irresponsible isolationist .
Scheuer does n't care .
Those experts - journalists , academics , civil servants , military officers , pundits , preachers , philanthropists and politicians from both parties - are what Scheuer calls " the governing elite . "
Their collective blindness , timidity and , in some cases , their duplicity are the central targets of " Marching Toward Hell . "
To make his case against foreign entanglements , Scheuer quotes America 's Founding Fathers , the U.S. Constitution and the man he considers our greatest president , George Washington : " [ A ] passionate attachment of one Nation for another produces a variety of evils , " Washington once wrote .
It creates " the illusion of an imaginary common interest [...] and infusing into one the enmities of the other , betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and Wars of the latter . "
To Bush administration leaders , our successful involvement in the 20th century 's two world wars discredits such isolationism .
Scheuer , like many administration critics , considers the comparison false .
If we had responded to 9/11 the way we did to Pearl Harbor - with " a thorough , north - to - south military flaying of our Islamist enemies in Afghanistan , " as Scheuer puts it - and had stopped there , the analogy , at least to World War II , might hold .
The problem , and Scheuer 's chief complaint , is that Bush did n't complete that mission , and instead diluted and bastardized it into a campaign to create the Middle East of his fantasies .
Scheuer derives his view through a painstaking historical account drawn from hundreds of sources , including numerous al Qaeda statements and actions - a record so public that Scheuer can't forgive political leaders for not reaching the same conclusions .
First , he argues , American actions in the Middle East - by all three recent presidents - have sent Muslims an unintended but consistent message :
The United States does not understand the shifting dynamics of modern warfare , and is unsuited to win its battles .
His examples begin with Vietnam and continue with the former Bush administration 's failure to " destroy Saddam 's state when they had the chance , " President Clinton 's failure to act on repeated CIA warnings about terrorists and their plans , and the current President Bush 's half - fought wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq .
Furthermore , bin Laden 's record from 1993 forward suggests , as Scheuer has long argued , that President Bush completely misunderstands al Qaeda 's aims .
The group is not fighting America 's democratic values , or even our pop culture exports .
It is fighting America 's policies throughout the Middle East .
" The Islamists ' indictment sheet against the U.S. , " Scheuer writes , " has been precise , limited , and consistent for more than a decade . "
One of those indictments concerns our protective approach to Israel , a policy that has only recently come under harsh scrutiny , such as in John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt 's book , " The Israel Lobby . "
In both " Marching Toward Hell " and " Imperial Hubris , " Scheuer argues that Israel enjoys a level of American financial and diplomatic support far beyond its strategic value to the United States and far beyond what we extend to Arab countries .
That imbalance , Scheuer writes , has long energized al Qaeda 's recruitment efforts .
So have the presence of U.S. troops on holy Muslim soil ( not just in Iraq and Afghanistan but also in Saudi Arabia ) ; U.S. support for countries that , he writes , oppress Muslims ( especially China , India and Russia ) ; " U.S. exploitation of Muslim oil and suppression of its price " ; and " U.S. support , protection , and funding of Arab police states . "
Unfortunately , Scheuer does n't fully grapple with the implications of some of these arguments .
If Islamists object , for instance , to our support of Israel , would they be happy if the United States dropped that support and its support of the Arab " police states , " too ?
Can we then stay out of the implosion this might cause , given that Israel is the region 's military heavyweight , with its stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction ?
To Scheuer , as long as the United States is not threatened , other nations ' wars are their own responsibility ; all we should do is help the survivors get back on their feet .
There is a logic to Scheuer 's worldview , beyond American self - interest .
It 's similar to the approach taken in Iraq ( of all places ) by the highly respected Marine Maj.
Gen. James Mattis .
After the 2003 invasion , Mattis , according to Thomas Ricks in his book , " Fiasco , " visited Iraqi leaders in every area where he had troops .
" I come in peace , " Mattis told them .
" I did n't bring artillery .
But I 'm pleading with you , with tears in my eyes :
If you f- with me , I 'll kill you all . "
This is tough love , international style .
Even if America 's Middle East policies were to change , aiming for some mutually respectful boundaries , Scheuer believes that two other measures should take precedence .
The first is hard - nosed U.S. border security - namely , fences , trenches , watch towers , armed soldiers , even minefields .
Politically awkward ?
Too expensive ?
Scheuer counters that " the billions of dollars Washington has spent to install electronic - and bio-detection gear at official border crossings , ports and airports is of use only if the Islamists are stupid enough to walk through an official entry point [...] carrying explosives [ and ] al Qaeda identification cards . "
Second , Scheuer argues , the United States must concentrate , full bore , on finding alternatives to foreign oil , ideally through a government - sponsored research and development campaign reminiscent of the Manhattan Project ( the national race , in the 1940s , for the first nuclear weapon ) .
Until the United States is completely energy independent , Scheuer points out , the slightest trouble in the Middle East requires American interference , if only to maintain our economic stability .
Because of that dependent relationship , he writes , " it is foreigners who will decide when the United States goes to war , and to add insult to injury , today 's political environment tends to label Americans who object to this reality as less than loyal . "
As should be apparent by now , the fact that CIA professionals ' analyses have been either twisted or unheeded for many years now does not sit well with Scheuer .
The result , for a reader , is two - sided - one bad , one good .
The negative side is that , in the course of three books , Scheuer sometimes gets stuck repeating his old arguments and old news .
And , occasionally , his fervor leads him to editorialize in ways that overstate or oversimplify his case .
Unfortunately , the editorializing afflicts this new book far more than " Imperial Hubris , " which was an almost uniformly solid body blow to America 's habit of pursuing unrealistic foreign policies .
Still , most of Scheuer 's insights would help correct this syndrome and thus bear some repeating .
The pure positive in Scheuer 's work is that his frustrations , leavened by his decades of experience and razor - sharp intelligence , yield some unusually clever pages in " Marching Toward Hell " where he frames the terrorism challenge in entirely new ways .
One example is a 19 - page section , written as a memo from al Qaeda 's intelligence chief in Washington ( " and we can be sure there is one " ) to al Qaeda headquarters , composed in CIA style .
The memo is simultaneously humorous and believable , embarrassing and galling .
" In this country , thanks to God , criticism of Israel is not allowed , " the hypothetical operative writes .
When it does occur , " men are called anti-Semitic and their careers are ruined . "
( This is no joke .
Witness the near blacklisting of Mearsheimer and Walt . )
At another point , the operative says the Americans ' " will is cracking , Brother , and even President Bush 's father 's friends - the Iraq Study Group - told him that the mujahedin are beating America .
...
Bush has rejected the group 's conclusions .
...
He has now sent five more brigades to Iraq .
Fifty brigades would have been a problem for the mujahedin , but five will make no difference . "
In Scheuer 's view , al Qaeda almost pities our constant flow of mistakes .
Paramount among those is the way U.S. leaders continue to follow al Qaeda 's playbook , the central ( non-satirical ) principles of which are : " Bleed America to bankruptcy " and " Spread out American forces . "
Another clever Scheuer foil is a running scorecard , which describes and tallies al Qaeda 's successful actions against the West since 1996 , and the West 's successes against al Qaeda .
The score , as of 2005 : the West , 77 ; al Qaeda , 130 .
( Scheuer 's most updated list is not in this new book , but in the paperback version of his first , " Through Our Enemies ' Eyes . " )
Scheuer is not optimistic about the future .
He believes Islamist victory will occur first in Europe , largely because of its precipitously low rate of native population growth - 1.4 live births per woman , which is a third below what 's needed for population replacement .
By contrast , the birth rate in surrounding Muslim countries is a bustling 3.7 .
For this reason , and some others , Scheuer sees immigrant Muslims as increasingly ascendent across that continent .
For our own continent , Scheuer 's predictions are n't much better .
" This war has the potential to last beyond our children 's lifetimes , " he wrote in " Imperial Hubris , " " and to be fought mostly on U.S. soil . "
This warning , written nearly four years ago , has mostly been ignored .
No wonder Scheuer wanted to update the indications of our oblivious march toward hell .
The suburban transformation that began in 1946 , as GIs returned home , took almost half a century to complete , as first people , then retail , then jobs moved out of cities and into new subdivisions , malls , and office parks .
As families decamped for the suburbs , they left behind out - of - fashion real estate , a poorer residential base , and rising crime .
Once - thriving central - city retail districts were killed off by the combination of regional suburban malls and the 1960s riots .
By the end of the 1970s , people seeking safety and good schools generally had little alternative but to move to the suburbs .
In 1981 , Escape From New York , starring Kurt Russell , depicted a near future in which Manhattan had been abandoned , fenced off , and turned into an unsupervised penitentiary .
Cities , of course , have made a long climb back since then .
Just nine years after Russell escaped from the wreck of New York , Seinfeld — followed by Friends , then Sex and the City — began advertising the city ’s renewed urban allure to Gen - Xers and Millennials .
Many Americans , meanwhile , became disillusioned with the sprawl and stupor that sometimes characterize suburban life .
These days , when Hollywood wants to portray soullessness , despair , or moral decay , it often looks to the suburbs — as The Sopranos and Desperate Housewives attest — for inspiration .
In the past decade , as cities have gentrified , the suburbs have continued to grow at a breakneck pace .
Atlanta ’s sprawl has extended nearly to Chattanooga ; Fort Worth and Dallas have merged ; and Los Angeles has swung a leg over the 10,000 - foot San Gabriel Mountains into the Mojave Desert .
Some experts expect conventional suburbs to continue to sprawl ever outward .
Yet today , American metropolitan residential patterns and cultural preferences are mirror opposites of those in the 1940s .
Most Americans now live in single - family suburban houses that are segregated from work , shopping , and entertainment ; but it is urban life , almost exclusively , that is culturally associated with excitement , freedom , and diverse daily life .
And as in the 1940s , the real - estate market has begun to react .
Pent - up demand for urban living is evident in housing prices .
Twenty years ago , urban housing was a bargain in most central cities .
Today , it carries an enormous price premium .
Per square foot , urban residential neighborhood space goes for 40 percent to 200 percent more than traditional suburban space in areas as diverse as New York City ; Portland , Oregon ; Seattle ; and Washington , D.C .
It ’s crucial to note that these premiums have arisen not only in central cities , but also in suburban towns that have walkable urban centers offering a mix of residential and commercial development .
For instance , luxury single - family homes in suburban Westchester County , just north of New York City , sell for $ 375 a square foot .
A luxury condo in downtown White Plains , the county ’s biggest suburban city , can cost you $ 750 a square foot .
This same pattern can be seen in the suburbs of Detroit , or outside Seattle .
People are being drawn to the convenience and culture of walkable urban neighborhoods across the country — even when those neighborhoods are small .
Builders and developers tend to notice big price imbalances , and they are working to accommodate demand for urban living .
New lofts and condo complexes have popped up all over many big cities .
Suburban towns built in the 19th and early 20th centuries , featuring downtown street grids at their core , have seen a good deal of “ in- filling ” in recent years as well , with new condos and town houses , and renovated small - lot homes just outside their downtowns .
And while urban construction may slow for a time because of the present housing bust , it will surely continue .
Sprawling , large - lot suburbs become less attractive as they become more densely built , but urban areas — especially those well served by public transit — become more appealing as they are filled in and built up .
Crowded sidewalks tend to be safe and lively , and bigger crowds can support more shops , restaurants , art galleries .
It used to be that a pocket knife was an essential item that a man carried with him .
You had your wallet , your keys , and your trusty pocket knife .

The History of the Pocket Knife
First Century Romans created the first folding pocket knife .
They made for easy carrying for soldiers and other explorers on their journeys and conquests .
However , as the use of sheathed knives became more popular , the use of pocket knives fell somewhat into disfavor .
By the late 16th Century , pocket knives began to regain popularity .
They were especially popular in the American colonies .
From farmers to lawyers , men from all walks of life started to carry them .
The ultimate portable tool , the pocket knife was a useful aid in various tasks , including eating on the go .
Pocket knives have been an essential tool for soldiers throughout American history .
New York and New Hampshire required their militias to carry pocket knives during the American Revolution .
Even George Washington toted one around as he led his troops .
The U.S. Navy began issuing pocket knives to sailors during the Civil War .
During WWII , the pocket knife was standard issue for American GIs .
Men have been carrying pocket knives for centuries .
But with increased security at the airport and other buildings , knives have been disappearing from men ’s pockets .
Yet these minor obstacles are not sufficient reason to give up carrying a knife completely .
The carrying of a pocket knife is a manly tradition that should be continued .
Why a Man Should Carry a Pocket Knife
How many times have you been in a situation where you ’ve said to yourself , “ Damn , a knife would be really handy now ! ”
Here are a few instances when a pocket knife can come in handy or just make the simple things in life more enjoyable :
1. Opening a box .
2. Cutting rope , tags , and string .
3. Cutting an apple .
I love eating an apple that I ’ve cut with my pocket knife , slice by slice .
You feel like a bad ass doing it .
You hold the apple in your non-dominant hand and then make a slice with the knife using your dominant hand .
After you make the slice , pinch it between your thumb and knife blade .
Bring the blade to your mouth and deposit the apple slice .
4. Opening a letter .
Sure , you could use your finger , but using a knife is just more manly .
5. Weapon .
Not the most effective , but it ’s better than nothing .
6. Camping .
How else will you sharpen the point of a stick in preparation for stabbing your prey ?
And by prey I mean hot dog .
7 . You never know when you ’re going to have to MacGyver your way out of a crisis .
Be prepared .
8 . You need something to clench in your teeth when swinging from a rope .
What kind of pocket knife should you get ?
Picking out a knife is a personal thing .
It ’s like picking out a wallet .
It all comes down to personal taste .
Men have a bond with their tools .
Pick something that feels good in your hand , and that you ’ll take pride in and want to carry around .
There are three common designs of pocket knives : the jack knife , the pen knife , and the multi-purpose knife .
We ’ll discuss the features and benefits of each one , in order to help you decide what kind of knife you should get .
Jack knife .
A jack knife has a simple hinge at one end , and may have more than one blade .
The jack knife is popular among hunters , fishermen , and campers .
Pen knife .
A pen knife is hinged at both ends of the handle , and usually has two or three blades at each end .
The pen knife was originally designed to cut or sharpen pen quills for writing .
The pen knife is good if you want more than one type of blade .
It ’s also small and lightweight and wo n’t be noticeable in the pocket of dress clothes .
Multi-purpose knife .
These are probably the most popular pocketknives .
The Swiss Army knife and the Handyman are probably the most well known of the multi-purpose knives .
Boy Scout knives are also multi-purpose knives .
In addition to the knife blade , multi- purpose knives have can openers , scissors , leather punchers , tweezers , or even screwdrivers .
These can come in handy on camping trips .
However , if all you ’re looking for is a sharp blade , the extra features will probably annoy you .
There are variations of these knife designs that you should take into account as well .
Here are few to think about :
Lock blade knife .
The name of the blade explains it all .
When you open the blade fully on this type of knife , the blade locks in place .
Closing the blade requires you to release the blade by pressing down on a lever located near the back of the knife handle to disengage the hook from the notch that keeps the blade in place .
A lock blade is useful for more heavy duty use .
A good example of a lock blade knife is the Buck knife .
Slip joint knife .
On a slip joint knife , the blade does n’t lock , but is held in place by a spring device that allows the blade to fold only if a certain amount of pressure is applied .
Most pen knives or multi-purpose knives use the slip joint blade .
Because the blade is less stable , it should only be used for light jobs .
Friction folder knife .
This is another method of a non-locking blade .
Friction folder knives use friction between the blade and the scales to hold the blade in place once opened .
One - handed opening .
Newer knives have a feature that allows for one - handed opening .
On the top of the blade , there is a hole that enables you to place the pad of your thumb in .
Just press up and BAM , you got an open knife .
This feature makes using a pocket knife much easier , especially when you have your hands full .
Where to Get a Pocket Knife
The best pocket knifes to have are the ones with a sense of history .
I carry around a pocket knife that my father gave to me .
It ’s still in really good shape , and with regular sharpening cuts like new .
It ’s something tangible that reminds me of my father .
One day I hope to pass it down to my son .
So ask your dad if he has an old pocket knife that he can give to you .
I ’m sure he ’ll be happy to pass it along .
If you ca n’t get a hand on an old pocket knife , or the one your dad or grandpa gave you is no longer usable , pick yourself up a new one .
You can find pocket knives at any outdoor store .
Better yet , find a knife store in town so you have a wider selection to choose from .
You can also get the Art of Manliness German - engineered Boker pocket knife !

Delta and Northwest are betting that cost cuts and the benefits of a bigger route network will outweigh the potential operating chaos and labor unrest that can result from airline mergers .
The long - expected Northwest - Delta deal could be quickly followed by another merger , airline executives and industry analysts said .
The leading candidates are United and Continental Airlines , which have explored the idea .
The airlines may now try to get the deal wrapped up within the next 30 days , a person with direct knowledge of the negotiations said Monday night .
He spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private .
One reason for the urgency is that airlines want to get their deals approved by the Justice Department under the Bush administration , rather than risk seeing them stall until a new president takes office .
United ’s chief executive , Glenn F. Tilton , has been eager for a merger , but Continental had resisted , saying it wanted to wait to see if the combination between Delta and Northwest came about .
The chief executive of Continental , Lawrence W. Kellner , called it “ good news ” last month when it appeared that the Delta - Northwest talks had cooled .
But Mr. Kellner could end up running the combined Continental - United , should an agreement take place , this person said .
Such deals would put pressure on others to explore combinations or consider restructuring , analysts said .
American Airlines , which avoided Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier in the decade , may be forced to explore that possibility so that it can rid itself of aging aircraft leases , and reduce its labor costs .
Or , American could seek a deal with a smaller airline such as JetBlue Airways , in order to gain access to JetBlue ’s younger fleet .
Meanwhile , Southwest Airlines , which has been the healthiest of the American carriers , may be forced to explore a deal with a low - fare carrier like AirTran , so that it can maintain its hold on the market for bargain minded travelers .
LIKE everybody else , I support the right of the Tibetan people to independence , or at least autonomy .
Like everybody else , I condemn the actions of the Chinese government there .
But unlike everybody else , I am not ready to join in the demonstrations .
I support the Tibetans in spite of it being obvious that the Americans are exploiting the struggle for their own purposes .
Clearly , the CIA has planned and organised the riots , and the American media are leading the worldwide campaign .
It is a part of the hidden struggle between the US , the reigning superpower , and China , the rising superpower — a new version of the “ Great Game ” that was played in Central Asia in the 19th century by the British Empire and Russia .
Tibet is a token in this game .
What is really bugging me is the hypocrisy of the world media .
They storm and thunder about Tibet .
It seems as if the Tibetans are the only people on earth whose right to independence is being denied by brutal force .
But are not the Kurds in Turkey , Iraq , Iran and Syria entitled to the same ?
The inhabitants of Western Sahara , whose territory is occupied by Morocco ?
The Basques in Spain ?
The Corsicans off the coast of France ?
And the list is long .
Why do the world 's media adopt one independence struggle , but often cynically ignore another independence struggle ?
What makes the blood of one Tibetan redder than the blood of a thousand Africans in East Congo ?
Again and again I try to find a satisfactory answer to this enigma .
In vain .
Immanuel Kant demanded of us : “ Act as if the principle by which you act were about to be turned into a universal law of nature . ”
( Being a German philosopher , he expressed it in much more convoluted language . )
Does the attitude toward the Tibetan problem conform to this rule ?
Does it reflect our attitude toward the struggle for independence of all other oppressed peoples ?
Not at all .
If Immanuel Kant knew what 's going on in Kosovo , he would be scratching his head .
The province demanded its independence from Serbia , and I , for one , supported that with all my heart .
This is a separate people , with a different culture ( Albanian ) and its own religion ( Islam ) .
After the popular Serbian leader , Slobodan Milosevic , tried to drive them out of their country , the world rose and provided moral and material support for their struggle for independence .
The Albanian Kosovars make up 90 percent of the citizens of the new state , which has a population of two million .
The other 10 percent are Serbs , who want no part of the new Kosovo .
They want the areas they live in to be annexed to Serbia .
According to Kant 's maxim , are they entitled to this ?
I would propose a pragmatic moral principle : Every population that inhabits a defined territory and has a clear national character is entitled to independence .
A state that wants to keep such a population must see to it that they feel comfortable , that they receive their full rights , enjoy equality and have an autonomy that satisfies their aspirations .
In short :
That they have no reason to desire separation .
That applies to the French in Canada , the Scots in Britain , the Kurds in Turkey and elsewhere , the various ethnic groups in Africa , the indigenous peoples in Latin America , the Tamils in Sri Lanka and many others .
Each has a right to choose between full equality , autonomy and independence .
This leads us , of course , to the Palestinian issue .
In the competition for the sympathy of the world media , the Palestinians are unlucky .
According to all the objective standards , they have a right to full independence , exactly like the Tibetans .
They inhabit a defined territory , they are a specific nation , a clear border exists between them and Israel .
One must really have a crooked mind to deny these facts .
But the Palestinians are suffering from several cruel strokes of fate :
The people that oppress them claim for themselves the crown of ultimate victimhood .
The whole world sympathises with the Israelis because the Jews were the victims of the most horrific crime of the Western world .
That creates a strange situation :
The oppressor is more popular than the victim .
Anyone who supports the Palestinians is automatically suspected of anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial .
Also , the great majority of the Palestinians are Muslims ( nobody pays attention to the Palestinian Christians ) .
Since Islam arouses fear and abhorrence in the West , the Palestinian struggle has automatically become a part of that shapeless , sinister threat , “ international terrorism ” .
And since the murders of Yasser Arafat and Shaikh Ahmed Yassin , the Palestinians have no particularly impressive leader — neither in Fatah nor in Hamas .
The world media are shedding tears for the Tibetan people , whose land is taken from them by Chinese settlers .
Who cares about the Palestinians , whose land is taken from them by our settlers ?
In the worldwide tumult about Tibet , the Israeli spokespersons compare themselves — strange as it sounds — to the poor Tibetans , not to the evil Chinese .
Many think this quite logical .
If Kant were dug up tomorrow and asked about the Palestinians , he would probably answer : “ Give them what you think should be given to everybody , and do n't wake me up again to ask silly questions . ”

The probe has sent back pictures of a flat landscape with few rocks A Nasa spacecraft has sent back historic first pictures of an unexplored region of Mars .
The Mars Phoenix lander touched down in the far north of the Red Planet , after a 680 million - km ( 423 million - mile ) journey from Earth .
The probe is equipped with a robotic arm to dig for water - ice thought to be buried beneath the surface .
It will begin examining the site for evidence of the building blocks of life in the next few days .
A signal confirming the lander had reached the surface was received at 2353 GMT on 25 May ( 1953 EDT ; 0053 BST on 26 May ) .
Engineers and scientists at Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California clapped and cheered when the landing signal came through .
" Phoenix has landed - welcome to the northern plain of Mars , " a flight controller announced .

The final seven minutes of the probe 's 10 - month journey to Mars were regarded as the hardest part of the mission .
The probe had to survive a fiery plunge through the planet 's thin atmosphere , slowing from a speed of nearly 21,000 km/h ( 13,000 mph ) .
Soft landing
It released a parachute , used pulsed thrusters to slow to a fast walking speed , and then descended the last few metres to the Martian soil to land on three legs .
The Nasa team monitored each stage of the descent and landing process through radio messages relayed to Earth via the Odyssey satellite in orbit around Mars .
" In my dreams , it could n't have gone as perfectly as it did tonight , " said Barry Goldstein , Phoenix project manager at JPL .
Nasa found out more about the landing when pictures from the probe reached the Earth .
The first images showed the " Arctic plain " where Phoenix came to rest - a region of Mars that has never been seen up close before .
Other shots confirmed that the probe 's solar arrays had unfurled successfully , and that it had landed safely on its legs .
Phoenix carries seven science instruments
The spacecraft will begin its three - month science mission in the next few days .
The probe 's solar arrays were unfurled successfully
It will use a robotic arm to dig through the protective Martian topsoil and lift samples of both soil and ice to its deck for scientific analysis .
Dr Tom Pike of Imperial College , London , is part of the British team involved in the project .
" The main goal of the mission is to get below the surface of Mars to where we are almost certain there is water , " he told BBC News .
He said orbiters flying around Mars had surveyed the landing site in great detail and found signs that water ice is buried 10 cm or less below the surface .
" Water , of course , is of critical importance because it is one of the building blocks - one of the essential habitats we need - for life , " he said .
High failure rate Landing on Mars is a notoriously tricky business .
There has been about a 50 % failure rate on all Mars missions since Russia launched the first one in 1960 .
The probe 's feet sat neatly on the surface , according to this picture Phoenix is an apt name for the current mission , as it rose from the ashes of two previous failures .
In September 1999 , the Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft crashed into the Red Planet following a navigation error caused when technicians mixed up " English " ( imperial ) and metric units .
A few months later , another Nasa spacecraft , the Mars Polar Lander ( MPL ) , was lost near the planet 's South Pole .
Phoenix uses hardware from an identical twin of MPL , the Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander , which was cancelled following the two consecutive failures .
The probe was launched on 4 August 2007 on a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida .
Phoenix landed further north than previous missions

What are these ?
Google seems to be dishin ’ out new products and services , left and right .
Some of them make the cut , other ’s do n’t !
There ’s quite the list of services that have n’t been as fortunate as others , like the original Google Video .
What happened to it anyways ?
I ’m talking about the one released into beta back in January of 2005 which was to enable users to “ search the content of television programs from leading TV content providers including PBS , the NBA , Fox News , and C - Span . ”
It ’s been replaced by the Google Video as you know it today , where you are able to watch actual videos , instead of searching the transcripts and content as the initial version offered .
Back in January 2005 , the product manager for Google Video wrote up a short snippet on the Google Blog giving his compelling reason as to why Google Video was needed .
He talked about being stuck in a hotel room for a few days in Wisconsin for a wedding , trying to find something to do , and flipping through channels , “ idly watching some travel show when a thought hit me : surely someone , somewhere must have produced a travel show episode about Wisconsin , maybe even about that cheese factory .
But of course there was no way to find it . ”
Thus Google Video came along .
Above is a screenshot that shows a listing of television shows that matched what you were searching for .
In their press release , Google talked about all of the cool features it was going to have , like :
Preview page : Displays up to five still video images and five short text segments from the closed captioning of each program .

The screenshot above is an example of a result for Nightline with short snippets available at different time increments .
From there , it let you know when the show would be coming on next , and the time it would air based upon your zip code .
These screenshots came from an archive from what used to be the “ Help ” page for the original Google Video .
Unfortunately or fortunately , this service did n’t last too long .
The Google Operating System blog has put together a more detailed list that includes other Google services that just could n’t make it … like :
Google Answers - Recently closed in November , they just could n’t compete with the well established Yahoo !
Answers .
Google X – It was designed to look similar to OS X , kinda cool .. . but Google did n’t want to risk a law suit from Apple .
The link is a mirror of what Google X actually looked like .
Google Compute – Yes , this one put your computer to work for other people when you were n’t using it !
Using the Google Toolbar , Google Compute used your computer to help with calculations and research projects .
Google was going to carefully select “ worthwhile endeavors ” to help , but Google Compute did n’t last long enough to do this .
Google Viewer – This one displayed your Google search results as a Slide Show .
So long , farewell Google services … .

An Impeachment Ad Congress Will Read !
Submitted by davidswanson
We want to run this Impeachment ad on Tuesday , April 29 in Roll Call , the Capitol Hill paper ALL members of Congress and their staffs read avidly .
The ad answers House Speaker Pelosi ’s argument–echoed by many House members ( perhaps your Representative ) –that President Bush and Vice President Cheney will be out of office by January 30 “ so why bother with impeachment ? ”
If House members do n’t “ bother ”  with impeachment , they are permitting all the “ high - crime precedents ”  that Nixon and Bush and Cheney have put in place to be used by future presidents .
And those “ Presidential Precedents ”  will nullify Congress , overthrow the Constitution and democracy ” ” and set up a “ unitary executive ”  dictatorship .
Impeachment NOW will stop these high - crime precedents ” ” cold !!
This 1/4th page ad emphasizes “ Presidential Precedents ”  to Congress .
But it will cost $ 3,715 to appear in Roll Call .
We need contribution NOW to cover that cost so your Congressional Representative will see it on Tuesday , April 29 .
Make your contribution through Paypal.com to this email address : [ email protected ] for credit charge or bank account transfers .
To give by check , make it payable to Democracy for Oregon at 6428 SE 15th Ave , Portland , OR 97202 .

Last we saw the Uno electric unicycle it was looking very much like the prototype it was , but as you can see above , it seems that the teenage engineers behind it have been doing anything but slacking in the ensuing months .
As Motorcycle Mojo reports , the third incarnation of the vehicle recently made its debut at the 2008 National Motorcycle Show in Toronto , with it sporting some custom - made wheels , a stylin ' new body , and a few changes under the hood as well .
That latter bit apparently even included a trip to a robotics and gyro expert in California , who helped to fine tune the two gyros the Uno uses for turning and forward and backward motion ( something you probably want to get right ) .
There 's still no word as to when or if the vehicle might actually enter production , however , but you can at least now get a great look at it courtesy of the generous batch of pics Motorcycle Mojo has provided at the link below .

While the Iraqi government continued its large - scale military assault in Basra , the NPR reporter 's voice from Iraq was unequivocal this morning : " There is no doubt that this operation needed to happen . "
Such flat - out statements , uttered with journalistic tones and without attribution , are routine for the U.S. media establishment .
In the " War Made Easy " documentary film , I put it this way : " If you 're pro-war , you 're objective .
But if you 're anti-war , you 're biased .
And often , a news anchor will get no flak at all for making statements that are supportive of a war and would n't dream of making a statement that 's against a war . "
So it goes at NPR News , where -- on " Morning Edition " as well as the evening program " All Things Considered " -- the sense and sensibilities tend to be neatly aligned with the outlooks of official Washington .
The critical aspects of reporting largely amount to complaints about policy shortcomings that are tactical ; the underlying and shared assumptions are imperial .
Washington 's prerogatives are evident when the media window on the world is tinted red - white - and - blue .
Earlier this week -- a few days into the sixth year of the Iraq war -- " All Things Considered " aired a discussion with a familiar guest .
" To talk about the state of the war and how the U.S. military changes tactics to deal with it , " said longtime anchor Robert Siegel , " we turn now to retired Gen .
Robert Scales , who 's talked with us many times over the course of the conflict . "
This is the sort of introduction that elevates a guest to truly expert status -- conveying to the listeners that expertise and wisdom , not just opinions , are being sought .
Siegel asked about the progression of assaults on U.S. troops over the years : " How have the attacks and the countermeasures to them evolved ? "
Naturally , Gen. Scales responded with the language of a military man .
" The enemy has built ever - larger explosives , " he said .
" They 've found clever ways to hide their IEDs , their roadside bombs , and even more diabolical means for detonating these devices . "

We 'd expect a retired American general to speak in such categorical terms -- referring to " the enemy " and declaring in a matter - of - fact tone that attacks on U.S. troops became even more " diabolical . "
But what about an American journalist ?
Well , if the American journalist is careful to function with independence instead of deference to the Pentagon , then the journalist 's assumptions will sound different than the outlooks of a high - ranking U.S. military officer .
In this case , an independent reporter might even be willing to ask a pointed question along these lines :
You just used the word " diabolical " to describe attacks on the U.S. military by Iraqis , but would that ever be an appropriate adjective to use to describe attacks on Iraqis by the U.S. military ?
In sharp contrast , what happened during the " All Things Considered " discussion on March 24 was a conversation of shared sensibilities .
The retired U.S. Army general discussed the war effort in terms notably similar to those of the ostensibly independent journalist -- who , along the way , made the phrase " the enemy " his own in a followup question .
It would n't be fair to judge an entire news program on the basis of a couple of segments .
But I 'm a frequent listener to " All Things Considered " and " Morning Edition . "
Such cozy proximity of world views , blanketing the war maker and the war reporter , is symptomatic of what ails NPR's war coverage -- especially from Washington .
Of course there are exceptions .
Occasional news reports stray from the narrow baseline .
But the essence of the propaganda function is repetition , and the exceptional does not undermine that function .
To add insult to injury , NPR calls itself public radio .
It 's supposed to be willing to go where commercial networks fear to tread .
But overall , when it comes to politics and war , the range of perspectives on National Public Radio is n't any wider than what we encounter on the avowedly commercial networks .
The documentary film " War Made Easy : How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death , " based on Norman Solomon 's book of the same name , went into home - video release this week and is now available on DVD from Netflix , Amazon and similar outlets .

A senior British Airways pilot reveals today the startling levels of casual racism in the flagship UK company , which once famously claimed to be " the world 's favourite airline " .
Captain Doug Maughan , who has 28 years ' flying experience , including 15 years with BA , says that derogatory remarks about race by his colleagues are so common they are treated as normal .
Mr Maughan , a serving pilot who captains BA aircraft to all parts of the world , has decided to go public with his complaints after struggling to persuade BA 's management to take racism among its senior staff seriously .
He has complained by email to BA 's chief executive , Willie Walsh , but says no action was taken .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
His allegations are an acute embarrassment for the airline which carries 36 million passengers a year ; operates out of airports in every continent ; and could plausibly claim to be one of Britain 's most high - profile companies .
The airline is already threatened with a boycott by Nigerians flying to and from the UK .
Mr Maughan alleges that racism is a " generational " problem – common among middle - aged pilots , but rare among younger pilots .
He lodged his first complaint after hearing a senior training captain use the word " coon " during a training session on a flight simulator – but says that no action was taken .
" There was the time when we set off for Los Angeles with a large party of Saudis on board , who had joined us at Heathrow direct from the VIP lounge , " he added .
" In the cruise , my captain suddenly embarked on an extraordinary rant about ' rag - heads ' .
He got the word out twice before I stopped him by explaining he was going to be short of a first officer for the return sector if he carried on . "
Mr Maughan , who lives in Dunblane , Perthshire , was on another flight when a fellow flight officer complained that there were too many Asians in Britain .
" The captain turned to me and said : ' I do n't suppose there are many of them up your way . '
I replied : ' Well , there 's my wife . '
After that , they had the decency to fall silent , " he said .
He has also complained about abusive emails sent to him by a fellow pilot , who is English .
One of the emails said : " Come separation , will all Jocks F. off to that Welfare State ( paid for by English middle classes ) ???
Please say yes . "
Mr Maughan , 53 , is so exasperated by what he sees as BA management 's refusal to tackle the problem that he is planning a protest at this year 's annual shareholders ' meeting .
" It 's what I 'd call a canteen culture , " he said .
" It seems to be accepted that people are going to make racist remarks and get away with it .
The phrase ' institutional racism ' has been so over - used as to be almost worthless , but I have to say that racism is as prevalent now in BA as it was in the RAF 25 years ago .

" What is common among white flying crew in BA is the use of mildly derogatory , sometimes jokey , language about other races , mainly aimed at black and Asian groups .
Because it 's so common , it 's hard to tackle : it 's ... the norm and rarely even noticed . "
BA said : " All British Airways employees must adhere to our policies concerning dignity at work .
Under these policies we encourage employees to report incidences of racism , sexism or any other behaviour that they deem offensive or inappropriate .
Any reports of such behaviour are taken extremely seriously and investigated as a matter of priority .
Captain Maughan has a duty as an employee to provide details of any alleged inappropriate behaviour direct to the airline . "
Mr Maughan 's revelations come as BA 's treatment of Nigerian passengers threatens to have diplomatic repercussions .
Robert Dewar , the British high commissioner to Nigeria , has been summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be warned that Nigeria expects its citizens to be treated with " dignity " .
And a meeting between BA representatives and the director general of the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority , Harold Demuren , broke up when Dr Demuren objected that BA had slighted him by sending junior managers .
Nigeria 's President , Umaru Yar 'Adua , has ordered an investigation into an incident at Heathrow in which 136 passengers were turned off a BA flight to Lagos .
It developed as immigration officers and BA staff were trying to force a man who was being deported to stay on board against his will .
The deportee , Augustine Eme , is a member of Massob , a banned organisation in Nigeria campaigning for independence for the region of Biafra .
A fellow passenger , Ayodeji Omotade , from Chatham , objected to Mr Eme 's treatment and was arrested .
Mr Omotade 's arrest triggered more protests , until the BA captain ordered every passenger in economy class off the plane .
BA has defended the decision to empty the aircraft saying that it was legally obliged to carry passengers such as Mr Eme .
It said a large number of passengers on flight BA75 on 27 March became disruptive ; that it was not possible to pinpoint which ones were involved ; and that the police and crew agreed it could pose a safety risk to allow them to stay on board .
BA 's other troubles
* TERMINAL 5
BA 's biggest disaster in recent years was the botched opening of Heathrow Terminal 5 on 27 March .
More than 500 flights were cancelled after a hi-tech baggage handlinge system malfunctioned .
The fiasco cost the airline £ 16 m , and , combined with rising oil prices , caused its share price to fall to its lowest level in four years .
Chief executive Willie Walsh resisted calls for his resignation .
* Gate Gourmet
In August 2005 , the catering firm Gate Gourmet , which wanted redundancies among its full - time staff , brought in 130 temporary staff to handle the holiday workload .
The firm 's 600 staff went out on unofficial strike , and were sacked .
About 1,000 BA staff walked out in sympathy .
As a result , 900 flights were grounded and BA lost £ 45 m .
* The crucifix
BA was threatened with a boycott by protesting Christians , after Nadia Eweida , a check - in worker , was suspended for refusing to remove her crucifix at work .
Some unauthorized disclosures of classified information in the press can serve a constructive purpose , Sen. John McCain allowed .
And so he expressed support for a pending press “ shield ” law that would increase reporters ’ legal protection against compulsory disclosure of their confidential sources .
“ Despite concerns I have about the legislation , I have narrowly decided to support it , ” he told the Associated Press Annual Meeting on April 14 .
The bill , the Free Flow of Information Act , is co-sponsored by Sen. Barack Obama and has also been endorsed by Sen. Hillary Clinton .
But Sen. McCain ’s support is noteworthy because it places him directly at odds with the Bush Administration , which strongly opposes the measure .
Even more interesting is the way in which McCain framed the issue :
“ The shield law is , frankly , a license to do harm , perhaps serious harm .
But it is also a license to do good ; to disclose injustice and unlawfulness and inequities ; and to encourage their swift correction . ”
“ I know that the press that disclosed security secrets that should have remained so also revealed the disgrace of Abu Ghraib . ”
In other words , according to Sen. McCain , there are bad leaks of classified information and there are good leaks of classified information .
( The leaked Army investigative report on Abu Ghraib [ pdf ] was classified Secret ) .
This comparatively nuanced view of unauthorized disclosures is a significant departure from the Bush Administration ’s categorical view that any disclosure of classified information is unacceptable .
And it provides some common ground for considering both disclosure and voluntary non-disclosure of classified information by the press .
The text of Sen. McCain ’s April 14 speech is here .
The Washington Post editorialized today in favor of the press shield bill , which is also supported by press advocacy organizations such as the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press .
Jack Shafer in Slate.com demurred .

MINNEAPOLIS — Jesse Ventura says he regrets not asking more questions about the 9/11 attacks when he was still governor of Minnesota .
Ventura tells the nationally syndicated radio host Alex Jones that his skepticism about the official version of events would have then carried more weight .
Among many other things , Ventura questions how the Twin Towers could have fallen so fast and in such a way as to turn so much of the wreckage into dust .
He also says that after watching the Twin Towers collapse in slow motion , it appears to him exactly like the controlled demolition of a Las Vegas hotel .
Ventura spoke on Jones ’ program on Wednesday .
Ventura was elected as an independent in 1998 and left office in 2003 after deciding not to seek re-election .
Jones frequently questions the events surrounding 9/11 and often discusses conspiracies on his radio show and documentary films .

Firefox 3 Beta 5 , Gran Paradiso ’s milestone # 13 is here and the list of features and improvement it brings along is pretty long so let ’s get started .
Oh , for those following Firefox 3 development you may want to jump to the sections marked in green for what ’s new in Beta 5 .
Performance
Firefox 3 gets several performance improvement gains .
Among them , profile guided optimizations ( PGO ) provides an optimized Firefox build based on the way it internally works .
So far it is only available for Windows .
Linux should follow shortly and Mac OS X could also make it before final release .
A very noticeable gain can be seen in JavaScript : it is about three times faster than Firefox 2 implementation .
JavaScript is twice as important for Firefox since it is not only used in a large number of web pages but it ’s also what makes Firefox UI work .
Memory wise , a much needed memory cycle collector is now in place to take care of freeing memory no longer used by modules that requested it but failed to release it properly .
This and other memory oriented tweaks , seem to have paid off so far : a set of tests I recently ran suggests a noticeable increase in memory management efficiency with more memory freed as tabs and windows are closed and no mysterious memory eat up when Firefox is idle as it has been reported several times in the past for Firefox 2 .
Places
A much announced and expected feature is Places , the integrated history and bookmarks manager interface powered by SQLite , a small open source database engine that provides much more robust querying capabilities .
With Places you are able to search your history , tags and bookmarks with a fully fledged search interface .
You can select where to search ( History , Bookmarks Menu , Bookmarks Toolbar , All Bookmarks or the selected folder ) , what to search ( visited date , web address or title ) , combine criteria and then save the search as a Smart Bookmark that updates as your personal web grows and changes .
The Library , Places manager , also adds backup and restore UI so it is easier to recover a damaged file or incorrectly deleted bookmark .
Tagging is a new Firefox feature tightly related with Places and some of the changes to the location bar : click on an empty star icon in the location bar to save the current page as a bookmark .
Click it again and you can specify a folder to save the bookmark to , create a new one ( new in Beta 5 ) and add tags you can later search on .
The Location Bar
The autocomplete list that appears when you start entering letters in the location bar is no longer restricted to web addresses but also looks into bookmark and history page titles and tags which make it more comprehensive .
Suggestions are shown in two different lines and colors for page titles and addresses , which according to studies on human cognition , makes it easier for us to focus on what we are looking for .
So , if the user knows she is entering part of a web address or a page title it will be easier for her to find what sheâ€™s looking for .
Highlighting the match result also helps to direct the userâ€™s attention .
It features adaptive learning so after a few repetitions Firefox will learn what letter combinations you use for what site and will provide better suggestions .
This should address the case where frecency ( a combined frequency and recency index ) did n’t provide the best results .
You can also perform multiword searches , so for example “ firefox downloads ” filters address , titles and tags containing both words but not necessarily in that order .
For Beta 5 , the colors and font sizes have been reviewed and the number of suggestions reduced to six making the menu less obtrusive .
I believe this feature alone is the best Firefox 3 has to offer , justifies Places large resources investment and will become a landmark in Firefox and web browsers in general development .
Once you get used to it , there is no turning back .
Visual Refresh
One of the most visible changes are the theme updates in all platforms .
On Windows XP and Vista , a large part of the planned new XP icons has been added to the main toolbar , the Options window , the Download Manager , here and there .
Beta 5 brings a rounded left cap to the location bar that echoes the keyhole , a slightly modified reload icon ( again with a solid end , * sigh * ) and to many ’s contempt the home button is back to the navigation bar and out of the Bookmarks toolbar .
The Options window on Windows XP with the new icons .
Mac OS
X users get Proto , a new Safari - like theme introduced with Beta 2 .
Linux users also get a very well integrated theme that uses native icons .
The back and forward buttons have been combined in a single keyhole - shaped widget featuring a single history menu and is now featured in all platforms except Linux .
According to the new guidelines , consistency across platforms is obtained through icons shape while OS integration is provided by texture .
In Linux case , it ’s very hard to set one due to the many available distributions and their particular themes .
There ’s an invisible splitter between the location and search bars that you can use to set their width when they are placed next to each other .
Developers are aiming to deliver better operating system integration in Firefox 3 .
This will be most notable for Mac OS X and Linux users who will now get native widgets like text boxes , menus , check boxes , icons , button order and orientation following each OS guidelines .
Mac OS
X users get integration with Growl , a popular centralized notification system , while Windows Vista gets native looking menus and blue icons that blend better with overall Vista look .
See more Windows XP , Vista and Linux screenshots in this recent post .
The Page Information dialog has been reviewed to become more organized and informative and allows to set all site specific preference from a single location .

International
Ireland
Ireland has become the latest in the list of countries that have passed stricter anti-blasphemy legislation in the recent past .
In June of 2009 , new blasphemy legislation was smuggled into the Irish legal system under the guise of defamation law reform .
Under this proposed law , if a person expresses one belief about gods , and other people think that this insults a different belief about gods , then these people can become outraged , and this outrage can make it illegal for the first person to express his or her beliefs . [ 13 ]
India
Recent cases of human rights abuse by the Indian government have garnered much media attention .
One was the arrest of the editor and publisher of The Statesman on reprinting an article that first appeared in the UK .
The second was the case of Ajith D , a 19 year old from Kerala .
The accused was charged under Sections 153A , 506 and 295A of the IPC .
Section 506 is concerned with making intimidating comments and was used in Ajith ’s case .
Section 153A was used against the paper editor and publisher , which states :
Section 153A : Promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion , race , place of birth , residence , language , etc. , and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony . [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
Section 295A states :
Section 295A : Deliberate and malicious acts , intended to outrage religious feelings or any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs .
Whoever , with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class of [ Indian citizens ] , [ by words , either spoken or written , or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise ] , insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class , shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to [ three years ] , or with fine , or with both .
Egypt
In 1990 the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) passed the Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam ( CDHRI ) .
In effect the OIC member nations had signed an agreement declaring Shariah law as the only guide to human rights .
“ Articles 24 and 25 of the CDHRI make all the rights and freedoms stipulated in it subject to Shariah and only to Shariah ” .
Protecting Islamic religion against blasphemy is an integral part of Shariah . [ 16 ]
The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights was presented at the UN in 1992 and was accepted into the Human Rights Commission ’s A Compilation of International Instruments ( vol. II ( 1997 ) , pp. 478-84 ) in 1997 .
Pakistan
A “ Defamation of Religions ” resolution of 1999 was first brought to the U.N.H.R.C. by Pakistan , initially as the “ Defamation of Islam ” resolution .
As a result , Pakistan became the leader of the movement for anti-blasphemy UN legislation .
But Pakistan 's history on free speech is less than clear .
In 1860 the British repealed existing blasphemy laws to allow missionary proselytizing .
From the time after the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947 , till 1982 when Mushtaq Raj published Heavenly Communism , there were few of blasphemy in Pakistan .
During that period no anti-blasphemy laws were in place .
In the aftermath of the Mushtaq Raj case , Section 295C was added to the code in 1986 .
It reads :
Whoever by words , either spoken or written , or by visible representation , or by any imputation , innuendo or insinuation , directly or indirectly defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet Mohammed -
Peace be upon him - shall be punished with death and shall also be liable to a fine .
Not only does one get to die , they also get to pay for your own execution !
In modern day , Pakistan ’s courts follow strict interpretations of the blasphemy laws , usually sentencing guilty parties to death or life in prison .
Much of those convicted and killed are minorities of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community .
The government has ruled that this group is not even allowed to proclaim themselves as Muslims .
Many young kids have been killed by these laws . [ 17 ]
United Nations
For more than 4 years in a row , the General Assembly of the UN has passed a non-binding resolution against “ Defamation of Religion ” , beginning with Yemen ’s introduction of ‘ Combating Defamation of Religions ’ in 2005 .
Resolutions that passed in December 2007 and November 2008 required the Secretary - General to present a report on the implementation of the resolutions , including on the “ possible correlation between defamation of religions and the upsurge in incitement , intolerance and hatred in many parts of the world . ” [ 18 ]
In the Spring of 2009 , the OIC brought up the issue in front of the U.N. Human Rights Council , asking that “ defamation of religion ” be declared as racism .
The proposal was dismissed by the three special investigators appointed to look into it .
The issue was on the table again on June 16th of that year , when the Pakistani delegate Muhammad Saeed Sarwar made an appeal to the U.N.H.R.C. claiming that criticism of Islam , which they labeled as “ defamation of religion ” , is a new form of racism , intolerance and xenophobia , constituting discrimination .
A representative from the International Humanist and Ethical Union , Roy Brown , responded with this statement :
" We were dismayed to hear again in this very debate an attempt to link defamation of religion to racism .
Mr President , if I believe that a particular religion has no merit ; that it is founded on a pre-scientific worldview , and that the application of many of its tenets is contrary to internationally accepted standards of human rights , then that is my opinion and I have the absolute right to express it .
And , Mr President , it has nothing whatsoever to do with racism . " [ 19 ]
The OIC , backed by former communist countries like Cuba and China , continue the push to legitimize such human rights abuses on a global scale .

According to a plane spotter , who was tuning into a high frequency radio broadcast at the time , the pilot " reported that the rumbling noise from the space debris could be heard over the noise of the aircraft .
" He described he saw a piece of debris lighting up as it re-entered [ the earth 's atmosphere ] .
" He was one very worried pilot , as you would imagine .
" Auckland is talking to [ an ] Aerolineas Argentinas [ pilot ] who is travelling [ in the ] opposite direction at 10 degrees further south asking if they wish to turn back to Auckland .
" They have elected to carry on at the moment .
" [ It 's ] not something you come across everyday and I am sure the Lan Chile crew will have a tale to tell . "
The assistant secretary of the Australian and International Pilots Association , Captain Steven Anderson , who flies for Qantas , said that based on the details of the report , the debris could have caused catastrophic consequences had it actually struck the aircraft .
" For [ the pilot ] to have heard it , one of two things - [ the debris ] was a lot closer than he thinks or it was bigger and going at quite a high speed .
" In other words , it 's caused the piece to break the speed of sound which is what he 's heard - the sound barrier . ''
A spokesman for Airways New Zealand , which provides air navigation services across airspace known as the Auckland Flight Information Region , confirmed the incident to smh.com .au this morning .
He said it occurred about 10 minutes after the Lan Chile flight had entered the Auckland Flight Information Region .
Airways New Zealand had been warned by Russian authorities almost two weeks ago that a satellite would be entering the earth 's atmosphere sometime today between 10.30 am and midday [ NZ time ] .
Airways New Zealand then provided that information to airlines and pilots that would be travelling in that region at that time .
They could then decide for themselves whether they wished to fly during that period .
" But clearly there has been a timing issue , " the spokesman said .
" Either the time that was indicated to us was incorrect or the satellite de-orbited early . "
Because the timing was wrong , the coordinates of where the satellite was supposed to enter the Earth 's atmosphere also turned out to be incorrect .
A formal report about the incident has been logged and recordings of conversations between the pilot and air traffic controllers were expected to be handed over to investigators in the next few days , he said .
The Lan Chile flight landed safely at Auckland Airport at 3.55 am today , he said .
The Airways New Zealand spokesman was not aware of the name of the Russian satellite but it was likely to have been the Russian Progress 23P cargo freighter .
The unmanned spacecraft left the International Space Station on Tuesday and was due to burn through the upper layers of the Earth 's atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean about 11.20 am today [ NZ time ] , the Spaceflight Now website reports .
The Russian Progress 23P had docked at the ISS last October to supply fuel , oxygen and repair parts , it said .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - A bomb exploded in a mosque in the southern Iranian city Shiraz on Saturday , killing at least nine people and wounding more than 100 , Iranian media reported .
A bomb exploded in a mosque in the city of Shiraz in southern Iran on Saturday , killing at least nine people and wounding more than 100 others , Iranian media reported .
REUTERS / Graphics
Ambulances rushed to the scene of the blast in a crowded district of the city , state television said .
“ At least nine people were killed and 105 injured in the blast , ” the semi-official Fars news agency quoting a local hospital official as saying .
The death toll was expected to rise because some of the wounded were in critical condition , the official said .
State television urged people in Shiraz to donate blood for the wounded and said that all nurses in the city had been called to report for work .
The official IRNA news agency said the bomb exploded during an address by a cleric in the Shohada mosque in Shiraz .
Fars said that on Saturday nights the cleric usually gave speeches on the Baha ’i faith , an offshoot of Islam considered heretical by the country ’s Shi’ite Muslim establishment .
Its members claim they face discrimination and persecution in Iran .
Iran says that all Iranians , regardless of creed , enjoy the same rights .
No one claimed responsibility for the blast but the deputy governor of the province , Mohammad Reza Hadaegh , told state television an investigation was under way .
Fars quoted a police official as saying the bomb was a “ hand - made ” device and had been planted in the mosque .
A 20 - year - old woman wounded by the blast said there were about 800 people inside the mosque at 1645 GMT ( 12:45 p.m. EDT ) , when the bomb exploded .
“ After we heard an explosion , there was smoke everywhere , ” Saeedeh Ghorbani told Fars .
Security is normally tight in Iran and bomb attacks have been rare in recent years .
Several people were killed in 2005 and 2006 in a string of blasts in the southwestern oil city Ahvaz .
In February , 65 men were arrested and accused of being behind a bombing that killed members of the elite Revolutionary Guards in a southeastern border province which has a minority Arab population .
Tehran has in the past accused Britain and the United States of trying to destabilize the country by supporting ethnic minority rebels operating in sensitive border areas .
Washington accuses Iran of destabilizing Iraq by supporting Iraqi Shi’ite militia groups .
Iran denies this .
The United States is leading efforts to isolate Iran over its nuclear program , which the West fears is a cover for a drive to build nuclear bombs .
Tehran says it wants only to generate electricity .
A 27 - year - old New Zealand man has been charged with assault after using a hedgehog as an improvised ninja star against a 15 - year - old , NZ 's Sunday Herald reports .
Cops allege that Whakatane resident William Singalargh scooped up the unfortunate creature and threw it about five metres at his unnamed target on 9 February .
Senior Sergeant Bruce Jenkins , of Whakatane police , said : " It hit the victim in the leg , causing a large , red welt and several puncture marks .
He [ Singalargh ] was arrested shortly afterwards for assault with a weapon , namely the hedgehog . "
Police declined to say whether the participants in the outrage knew each other , or whether booze was involved .
The Sunday Herald adds : " It is also unknown whether the hedgehog was dead or alive at the time but it was dead when it was collected as evidence . "
Singalargh is up before the beak in Whakatane District Court on 17 April on an " assault with a weapon " rap .
The maximum penalty for the offence is five years . ®
Runbot can adapt to changes in the terrain ( Credit : Manoonpong et al )
Runbot in action
RunBot is a self - learning , dynamic robot , which has been built around the theories of Nikolai Bernstein .
" Getting a robot to walk like a human requires a dynamic machine , " said Professor Florentin Woergoetter .
RunBot is a small , biped robot which can move at speeds of more than three leg lengths per second , slightly slower than the fastest walking human .
Bernstein said that animal movement was not under the total control of the brain but rather , " local circuits " did most of the command and control work .
The brain was involved in the process of walking , he said , only when the understood parameters were altered , such as moving from one type of terrain to another , or dealing with uneven surfaces .
The basic walking steps of RunBot , which has been built by scientists co-operating across Europe , are controlled by reflex information received by peripheral sensors on the joints and feet of the robot , as well as an accelerometer which monitors the pitch of the machine .
These sensors pass data on to local neural loops - the equivalent of local circuits - which analyse the information and make adjustments to the gait of the robot in real time .
Information from sensors is constantly created by the interaction of the robot with the terrain so that RunBot can adjust its step if there is a change in the environment .
As the robot takes each step , control circuits ensure that the joints are not overstretched and that the next step begins .
But if the robot encounters an obstacle , or a dramatic change in the terrain , such as a slope , then the higher level functions of the robot - the learning circuitries - are used .
About half of the time during a gait cycle we are not doing anything , just falling forward
Prof Florentin Worgotter
The latest findings of the robot research study are presented in the Public Library of Science Computational Biology journal .
Four other scientists - Poramate Manoonpong , Tao Geng , Tomas Kulvicius and Bernd Porr - are also involved in the project , which has been running for the last four years .
Professor Woergoetter , of the University of Gottingen , in Germany , said : " When RunBot first encounters a slope these low level control circuits ' believe ' they can continue to walk up the slope without having to change anything .
" But this is misguided and as a consequence the machine falls backwards .
This triggers the other sensors and the highest loop we have built into RunBot - the learning circuitry - and from that experience of falling the machine knows that something needs to be changed . "
Dynamic process
He said human walking was a dynamic process .
" About half of the time during a gait cycle we are not doing anything , just falling forward .
We are propelling ourselves over and over again - like releasing a spring .
" In a robot , the difficulty lies in releasing the spring - like movement at the right moment in time - calculated in milliseconds - and to get the dampening right so that the robot does not fall forward and crash .
" These parameters are very difficult to handle , " he said .
All these big machines stomp around like robots
Prof Florentin Worgotter
RunBot walks in a very different way from robots like Asimo , star of the Honda TV adverts , said Prof Woergoetter .
" They are kinematic walkers - they walk step by step and calculate every single angle , every millisecond .
" That can be handled through engineering but it is very clumsy .
No human would walk like that .
All these big machines stomp around like robots - we want our robot to walk like a human . "
The first step in building RunBot was creating a biomechanical frame that could support passive walking patterns .
Passive walkers can walk down a slope unaided , propelled by gravity and kept upright and moving through the correct mechanical physiology .
Prof Woergoetter said : " Passive walking looks pretty realistic - but that 's level one .
On top of this we have local circuits , nested neural loops , which operate between the muscles ( the joints of the robot ) and the spinal cord ( the spinal reflex of RunBot ) . "
He said RunBot learned from its mistakes , much in the same way as a human baby .
" Babies use a lot of their brains to train local circuits but once they are trained they are fairly autonomous .
" Only when it comes to more difficult things - such as a change of terrain - that 's when the brain steps in and says ' now we are moving from ice to sand and I have to change something ' .
" This is a good model because you are easing the load of control - if your brain had to think all the time about walking , it 's doubtful you could have a conversation at the same time . "
Nervous system
The principle was first discussed in the human nervous system by Russian physiologist Nikolai Bernstein .
Prof Woergoetter said : " He said it made sense that local agents , local networks , do the basic job , but the brain exerted control whenever necessary . "
So using the information from its local circuits RunBot can walk on flat surfaces at speeds of more than three leg lengths per second .
Prof Woergoetter said RunBot was able to learn new walking patterns after only a few trials .
" If walking uphill , the gait becomes shorter , the robot 's upper body weight shifts forward , " he said .
The key lesson from the study , he said , was that the nested loop design first proposed by Bernstein more than 70 years ago " worked and was efficient " .
He said the challenge was now to make RunBot bigger , more adaptive and to better anticipate situations like change of terrain .
Frames 1 - 3 : The robot 's momentum causes the robot to rise on its standing leg and a motor moves the swinging leg into position
Frame 3 : The stretch sensor of the swinging leg is activated , which triggers the knee joint to straighten
Frames 3 - 6 : The robot falls forward naturally , with no motor functions being used , and catches itself on the next standing leg
Frame 6 : As the swinging leg touches the ground , the ground contact sensor in the foot triggers the hip extensor and the knee joint of the standing leg and the hip and knee joints of the swinging leg to swap roles
Just like the title says .
Feminism has given women privileges without responsibility , and men are left with no choice but to pick up the slack .
It 's not fair , it 's not " equal rights " and I wo n't stay quiet about it .
One of the oldest and soundest rules in intellectual life is “ never get in a parsing contest with a skunk . ”
It is a principle that the lively , intelligent , combative cultural critic Lee Siegel forgot in autumn 2006 , when he gave in to the temptation to respond to comments about him posted on his blog at The New Republic ’s Web site .
Some of the comments were anonymous and abusive  featuring allegations of chromosomal deficiencies and pedophilia  and Siegel replied under the pseudonym “ sprezzatura , ” praising his own work and denouncing his critics ( “ You could n’t tie Siegel ’s shoelaces ” ) .
When it emerged that Siegel was sprezzatura , he was pilloried in the blogosphere , suspended by The New Republic and , “ in good American fashion , ” he writes , rewarded with the opportunity “ to write the book on Web culture that I ’d long wanted to write . ”
Under the circumstances , no one would expect that new book , “ Against the Machine , ” to be a valentine to the Internet .
The book describes itself , in its first sentence , as being “ about the way the Internet is reshaping our thoughts about ourselves , other people and the world around us . ”
The view it takes of that reshaping is an angry , dark one .
Siegel sees the Internet as “ the first social environment to serve the needs of the isolated , elevated , asocial individual . ”
“ Against the Machine ” sets out to explore the consequences of that fact .
There is a variety of Luddite cultural pessimist who sees the Internet as inherently trivial , a gigantic nonevent in the history of man .
Most Net naysayers are in that camp , but Siegel is n’t one of them .
In that sense , he agrees with the Net ’s boosters and hucksters .
He thinks that “ the Internet is possibly the most radical transformation of private and public life in the history of humankind . ”
The trouble is that “ from the way it is publicly discussed , you would think that this gigantic jolt to the status quo had all the consequences of buying a new car . ”
Siegel ’s mission is to make his readers think about the negative effects of the Internet  its destructive impact on our culture , on our polity and , perhaps most important , on our sense of ourselves .
The indictment comes with a number of counts .
Siegel argues that the Internet invites people to “ carefully craft their privacy into a marketable , public style . ”
In doing so it creates an environment in which everything is on display all the time , whether on YouTube , on Internet dating sites or in the blogosphere .
This turns the culture into a giant popularity contest , an expanded and never - ending version of high school .
“ You must sound more like everyone else than anyone else is able to sound like everyone else , ” Siegel writes .
Thanks to the Internet , and to shows like “ American Idol , ” we are encouraged to believe in a phony idea of interactivity , as “ all popular culture aspires to full viewer participation . ”
“ Popular culture , ” he argues , “ used to draw people to what they liked .
Internet culture draws people to what everyone else likes . ”
Siegel makes the strong point that “ what the Internet hypes as ‘ connectivity ’ is , in fact , its exact opposite . ”
People sitting on their own in front of computer screens  this once would have been called disconnectedness or atomization .
Siegel is blistering on the “ surreal world of Web 2.0 , where the rhetoric of democracy , freedom and access is often a fig leaf for antidemocratic and coercive rhetoric ; where commercial ambitions dress up in the sheep ’s clothing of humanistic values ; and where , ironically , technology has turned back the clock from disinterested enjoyment of high and popular art to a primitive culture of crude , grasping self - interest . ”
BUSH TEXT ON ECONOMY BUSH TEXT ON ECONOMY President Bush 's remarks Monday in the Roosevelt Room after meeting with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and other economic advisers , as transcribed by the White House : Mr. Secretary , thank you very much for coming by today to talk about the economic situation .
We 'll be meeting later on this afternoon with the President 's Task Force on Financial Markets .
First of all , the secretary has given me an update .
One thing is for certain we 're in challenging times .
But another thing is for certain that we 've taken strong and decisive action .
The Federal Reserve has moved quickly to bring order to the financial markets .
Secretary Paulson has been is supportive of that action , as am I .
And I want to thank you , Mr. Secretary , for working over the weekend .
You 've shown the country and the world that the United States is on top of the situation .
Secondly , you 've reaffirmed the fact that our financial institutions are strong and that our capital markets are functioning efficiently and effectively .
We obviously will continue to monitor the situation and when need be , will act decisively , in a way that continues to bring order to the financial markets .
In the long run , our economy is going to be fine .
Right now we 're dealing with a difficult situation and , Mr. Secretary , I want to thank you very much for your steady and strong and consistent leadership .
Thank you very much .

( AP )  President Bush , trying to calm turmoil in financial markets , said Monday that his administration is " on top of the situation " in dealing with the slumping economy .
" One thing is for certain , we 're in challenging times , " the president said after meeting with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and other senior economic advisers .
" But another thing is for certain : We 've taken strong , decisive action . "
MARKETS : Stocks open lower to begin week The president commended the Fed for its urgent actions over the weekend .
" We 've shown the country and the world that the United States is on top of the situation , " he said .
Bush spoke on a day of turmoil and plunging prices on global financial markets .
Oil prices hit a record in Asian trading , U.S. stock index futures fell sharply and the dollar hit record lows .
The White House moved quickly to raise Bush 's public profile Monday , and he continued to send an upbeat message , even in acknowledging a downturn that keeps roiling the economy and the people as well .
" We agree upon the fact that our financial institutions are strong , and that our capital markets are functioning efficiently and effectively , " Bush said with his economic aides .
Still , Bush said his administration is monitoring economic developments closely .
" When need be , we 'll act decisively in a way that continues to bring order to financial markets , " Bush said .
He did not indicate any other steps his government might take , or when .
" In the long run , our economy is going to be fine , " Bush said .
" Right now we 're dealing with a difficult situation . "
The Federal Reserve , in an extraordinarily rare weekend move , became a lender of last resort for Wall Street investment houses to begin securing short - term emergency loans .
The central bank also approved a cut in its emergency lending rate to financial institutions to 3.25 % from 3.50 % .
Later Monday , Bush was to meet with his Working Group on Financial Markets , which includes Paulson , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox .

Yesterday we launched embedded media ( see an example here ) across the BBC News and Sport sites .
We are starting with just a few stories , but over the next few weeks , we will be converting most of our video and audio to be embedded .
We 're using an embedded media player which , within the BBC , is known by the secret code name of the Embedded Media Player - or EMP .
This is a new site - wide media player built by the Journalism and iPlayer teams .
More about this further down .
" So what does this change on the site ? " , you may ask .
Currently , our audio and video appears in popup windows using Real or Windows Media formats , which you get to by clicking on the Watch / Video or Listen / Audio links that you see in stories .
You can see some examples in this story underneath the main picture .
This approach has served us well , but it was apparent from trials we ran in the middle of last year [ for example , here ] , that in general , people find embedded media easier to engage with .
No surprise there , as the unstoppable march of sites such as YouTube has proven .
However , Pete Clifton also talked about how this may change the way we make video and provide added value to the stories it is associated with .
It has taken some time to put all the pieces in place to make this change , but there are a lot of moving parts to adapt without breaking anything that is being used on the live site .
SAN DIEGO ( Reuters ) - New research shows a sharp drop in U.S. breast cancer cases in recent years was limited to white women , possibly because they abandoned hormone replacement therapy in greater numbers than minority groups .

Many women stopped using hormone replacement therapy after a large study suggested in 2002 that the combination of estrogen and progestin used to treat menopause symptoms raised the risk of breast cancer and heart disease .
White women had been more likely to use hormone therapy , and were also the most likely to abandon the drugs after U.S. regulators warned about the cancer link in 2003 , according to Dr. Dezheng Huo of the University of Chicago and the study ’s lead investigator .
“ The sharp reductions seen in Caucasians aged 50 to 69 years were not seen among other ethnic groups , ” Hou told the American Association for Cancer Research .
According to the American Cancer Society , the overall incidence of female breast cancer fell 3.9 percent a year from 2001 through 2004 .
The researchers said the decline has been mainly among women older than 50 with estrogen - receptor positive cancer .
Using data from the National Cancer Institute ’s database , they calculated breast cancer rates between 2000 and 2004 to determine whether or not the trends were similar across racial and ethnic groups .
The researchers found that in the first two years , the rate of invasive breast cancer among whites was stable .
However , toward the end of 2003 , it started falling by as much as 2.4 percent per quarter while continuing to grow by 0.7 percent per quarter among black women .
Rates for American Indians and Alaskan Natives fell 0.14 percent and among Asian Americans by 0.46 percent .
“ The finding ... suggests that exogenous estrogen serves as a promoter rather than an initiator of breast cancer , ” the researchers said .

One area where religious dogma has encroached into science can be found in public museums :
New Orleans Audubon Aquarium of the Americas
Founded by the Audubon Institute , the Aquarium of the Americas is one of the newest and most impressive aquariums in the United States .
It contains many exhibits including several large shark tanks , a re-creation of an underwater reef at a rig in the Gulf of Mexico , an Amazon rainforest exhibit and more .
Imagine my surprise when I came upon this prestigious aquarium 's educational material on sharks :
As part of their " sharks in popular culture " display there was an interesting blurb about the account of Jonah from the Bible :
I 'm not sure what a scientific museum is doing suggesting that the parable of Jonah and the whale is historically ( or scientifically ) accurate .
Is there any scientific evidence to suggest a human being could survive three days inside the stomach of either a whale or a shark ??
If you would like to express your thoughts on this issue , you can contact the Aquarium of the Americas via this web form or via e-mail to air@auduboninstitute.org .

LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
The Bank of England on Monday announced details of a plan to swap 50 billion pounds worth of U.K .
Treasury bills for high - rated mortgage - backed securities held by commercial banks in an effort to thaw out frozen credit markets .
Under the plan , banks can swap assets at any point during the next six months .
The swaps are set for a one - year term and can be renewed , at the discretion of the Bank of England , each year for up to three years .
The program " is designed to improve the liquidity position of the banking system and raise confidence in financial markets while ensuring that the risk of losses on the loans they have made remains with the banks , " said BOE Governor Mervyn King .
Paradox releases EU engine to community Source code to be made freely available via GamersGate , which will also allow home - made content to be sold

Paradox Interactive , the company behind the popular in - depth strategy titles Hearts of Iron and Europa Universalis , has announced plans to release the source code behind the Europa Universalis II game .
The Europa engine will be made available for anybody to download and edit , while content created using the code can potentially be sold through the GamersGate digital distribution platform .
Theo Bergquist , CEO of Paradox explained the reasoning behind the move .
" In a sense it 's twofold , " he told GamesIndustry .biz .
" On the one hand we have a community of players that have been loyal to us for a very long time , since 1999 , and we feel that we want to give something back to them .
The modding community for our games is huge , and they help us with beta testing , and patches , and so on .
So for us , it 's giving something back to them - we have the new engine now for Europa Universalis III and our upcoming games .
" And the other thing is , the deal with GamersGate , it 's very easy for them to earn a few bucks on the work that they can do , because the basics are there - there 's no risk for them , they can spend whatever hours they want to spend making a game or add - on . "
The source code will enable people to create new games , or add - ons for the company 's existing titles , and while Paradox must approve any content before it 's published , Bergquist stressed that home developers have freedom of choice .
" Price points , and all that - it's in the hands of the guys doing it , " he explained .
" So if they wanted to sell it for USD 1 , they can .
If they want to sell it for USD 100 , they can .
I guess they will find out pretty fast what price point will work for their products .
" We 're basically giving the source code , and it 's open for anybody to change .
If they want to change time period , they can , but they might have to change a few modules , such as AI for the different warfare .
" But we 're giving them the tools to do whatever they want , and the more hours they spend on it , the better the game will be . "
Applications for the license agreement are now being accepted via the GamersGate website .
__1932 : __John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton focus a proton beam on lithium and bust its nucleus .
The era of accelerator - based experimental nuclear physics is born .
Ernest Rutherford , who first postulated the concept of atomic nucleus in 1910 , had called for " a million volts in a soapbox " to advance nuclear research .
Working in a vacant room at Rutherford 's Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University , Englishman Cockcroft and Irishman Walton used spare parts along with some wood and nails to build the world 's first nuclear - particle accelerator in 1929 .
At the heart of the Cockcroft - Walton generator , a system of capacitors and thermionic rectifiers upped the voltages to 600,000 volts .
It was n't a million volts , but it proved sufficient .
The research duo used their new - found juice to accelerate hydrogen nuclei in a discharge tube and have them bombard a layer of lithium .
Sure enough , when the hydrogen nucleus ( one proton ) collided with the lithium nucleus ( three protons and four neutrons ) , the lithium broke into two helium nuclei ( with two protons and two neutrons each ) shooting off in opposite directions .
POW !
First Walton , then Cockcroft , then Rutherford himself observed the results on a zinc sulfide screen : the wave patterns characteristic of the helium nucleus – the alpha radiation Rutherford had discovered .
It was n't changing lead into gold , as the medieval alchemists had dreamt .
But it was the first nuclear transmutation of one element ( lithium ) to another ( helium ) under full human control ( as opposed to using natural radiation , as Rutherford had already done ) .
Even better , Cockcroft and Walton measured the total kinetic energy of the helium nuclei .
It was greater than that of the original hydrogen and lithium nuclei .
But they also observed a loss in the total mass of the nuclei .
This provided confirmation of Einstein 's law ( E = mc2 ) on the equivalence of mass and energy .
The initial computations were subject to experimental error , but later scientific work in this vein confirmed the equation in detail .
Particle accelerators advanced rapidly in power and design – like Ernest Lawrence 's circular accelerator , or cyclotron .
( Earnest researchers , these chaps : Rutherford , Walton , Lawrence . )
Cockcroft and Walton received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1951 .
The citation from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said their work had " opened up a new and fruitful field of research which was eagerly seized upon by scientific workers the world over ... profoundly influenced the whole subsequent course of nuclear physics [ and ] stands out as a landmark in the history of science . "
The Cockcroft - Walton circuit is still used to supply voltage in large particle accelerators .
The very word atom is from the Greek for indivisible .

Facebook Finland , a country with a high number of guns but a low rate of gun violence , appeared stunned by a school shooting that left eight people dead and may consider revising its accommodating gun laws , Finnish experts said Wednesday .
" This is quite a low - crime society in general , " said Jan -Olof Nyholm , executive chief superintendent for the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation .
" This type of tragedy has n't happened ( often ) . "
AFTERMATH : Finland mourns victims of school massacre SHOOTING : Finnish school shooter dies after killing 8 Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen said the government will review its gun laws .
" Definitely this will impact opinions about handguns , " he said .
An 18 - year - old entered Jokela High School in Tuusula on Wednesday and killed seven students and the school 's principal before killing himself .
Jukka Savolainen , a criminologist at the Finnish Ministry of Justice , said gun crime is so rare in Finland because most of the country 's firearms are hunting weapons .
There are far fewer handguns , he said .
Savolainen , now a visiting professor at the University of Minnesota , compares gun ownership in Finland to gun ownership in the rural USA .
He said many U.S. shootings are in urban centers , where the drug trade and gangs escalate violence .
" I 'm from Helsinki , and I do n't know anybody who owns a gun , " he said .
In Finland , anyone age 15 or older can apply for a gun license with local police if they are able to offer a valid reason .
The easiest way to obtain a license is by joining a shooting or hunting club , as the Jokela gunman did in October .
" Ownership of guns is quite liberal in Finland , and mostly it 's a question of people who are hunting who have the guns , " Nyholm said .
Gun violence is rare .
Finnish media reported that the last school shooting was in 1989 and involved a 14 - year - old boy who killed two other students apparently for teasing him .
The USA has seen far more school shootings , but it is also much larger .
Finland 's population is 5.3 million , compared with about 300 million in the USA .
The latest multiple shooting in the USA was in April , when a student killed 32 people and then himself at Virginia Tech .
In both the Virginia Tech and Finland shootings , the gunmen recorded videos of themselves that anticipated the crimes to come .
Nyholm said it was too early to say whether one inspired the other .
" How people are affected … by things that happen overseas , other people will have to guess .
But the world has gotten smaller , and things that happen elsewhere can have an affect here , " he said .

When you hit your 60th birthday , most of you will guzzle down your hormone replacement therapy with a glass of champagne and wonder if you have become everything you dreamed of in your youth .
In a few weeks , the state of Israel is going to have that hangover .
She will look in the mirror and think – I have a sore back , rickety knees and a gun at my waist , but I 'm still standing .
Yet somewhere , she will know she is suppressing an old secret she has to face .
I would love to be able to crash the birthday party with words of reassurance .
Israel has given us great novelists like Amos Oz and A.B. Yehoshua , great film - makers like Joseph Cedar , great scientific research into Alzheimer's , and great dissident journalists like Amira Hass , Tom Segev and Gideon Levy to expose her own crimes .
She has provided the one lonely spot in the Middle East where gay people are not hounded and hanged , and where women can approach equality .

But I can't do it .
Whenever I try to mouth these words , a remembered smell fills my nostrils .
It is the smell of shit .
Across the occupied West Bank , raw untreated sewage is pumped every day out of the Jewish settlements , along large metal pipes , straight onto Palestinian land .
From there , it can enter the groundwater and the reservoirs , and become a poison .
Standing near one of these long , stinking brown - and - yellow rivers of waste recently , the local chief medical officer , Dr Bassam Said Nadi , explained to me : " Recently there were very heavy rains , and the shit started to flow into the reservoir that provides water for this whole area .
I knew that if we did n't act , people would die .
We had to alert everyone not to drink the water for over a week , and distribute bottles .
We were lucky it was spotted .
Next time ... "
He shook his head in fear .
This is no freak : a 2004 report by Friends of the Earth found that only six per cent of Israeli settlements adequately treat their sewage .
Meanwhile , in order to punish the population of Gaza for voting " the wrong way " , the Israeli army are not allowing past the checkpoints any replacements for the pipes and cement needed to keep the sewage system working .
The result ?
Vast stagnant pools of waste are being held within fragile dykes across the strip , and rotting .
Last March , one of them burst , drowning a nine - month - old baby and his elderly grandmother in a tsunami of human waste .
The Centre on Housing Rights warns that one heavy rainfall could send 1.5 m cubic metres of faeces flowing all over Gaza , causing " a humanitarian and environmental disaster of epic proportions " .
So how did it come to this ?
How did a Jewish state founded 60 years ago with a promise to be " a light unto the nations " end up flinging its filth at a cowering Palestinian population ?
The beginnings of an answer lie in the secret Israel has known , and suppressed , all these years .
Even now , can we describe what happened 60 years ago honestly and unhysterically ?
The Jews who arrived in Palestine throughout the twentieth century did not come because they were cruel people who wanted to snuffle out Arabs to persecute .
No : they came because they were running for their lives from a genocidal European anti-Semitism that was soon to slaughter six million of their sisters and their sons .
They convinced themselves that Palestine was " a land without people for a people without land " .
I desperately wish this dream had been true .
You can see traces of what might have been in Tel Aviv , a city that really was built on empty sand dunes .
But most of Palestine was not empty .
It was already inhabited by people who loved the land , and saw it as theirs .
They were completely innocent of the long , hellish crimes against the Jews .
When it became clear these Palestinians would not welcome becoming a minority in somebody else 's country , darker plans were drawn up .
Israel 's first Prime Minister , David Ben-Gurion , wrote in 1937 : " The Arabs will have to go , but one needs an opportune moment for making it happen , such as a war . "
So , for when the moment arrived , he helped draw up Plan Dalit .
It was – as Israeli historian Ilan Pappe puts it – " a detailed description of the methods to be used to forcibly evict the people : large - scale intimidation ; and laying siege to and bombarding population centres " .
In 1948 , before the Arab armies invaded , this began to be implemented : some 800,000 people were ethnically cleansed , and Israel was built on the ruins .
The people who ask angrily why the Palestinians keep longing for their old land should imagine an English version of this story .
How would we react if the 30 m stateless , persecuted Kurds in the world sent armies and settlers into this country to seize everything in England below Leeds , and swiftly established a free Kurdistan from which we were expelled ?
Would n't we long forever for our children to return to Cornwall and Devon and London ?
Would it take us only 40 years to compromise and offer to settle for just 22 per cent of what we had ?
If we are not going to be endlessly banging our heads against history , the Middle East needs to excavate 1948 , and seek a solution .
Any peace deal – even one where Israel dismantled the wall and agreed to return to the 1967 borders – tends to crumple on this issue .
The Israelis say : if we let all three million come back , we will be outnumbered by Palestinians even within the 1967 borders , so Israel would be voted out of existence .
But the Palestinians reply : if we do n't have an acknowledgement of the Naqba ( catastrophe ) , and our right under international law to the land our grandfathers fled , how can we move on ?
It seemed like an intractable problem – until , two years ago , the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research conducted the first study of the Palestinian Diaspora 's desires .
They found that only 10 per cent – around 300,000 people – want to return to Israel proper .
Israel can accept that many ( and compensate the rest ) without even enduring much pain .
But there has always been a strain of Israeli society that preferred violently setting its own borders , on its own terms , to talk and compromise .
This weekend , the elected Hamas government offered a six - month truce that could have led to talks .
The Israeli government responded within hours by blowing up a senior Hamas leader and killing a 14 - year - old girl .
Perhaps Hamas ' proposals are a con ; perhaps all the Arab states are lying too when they offer Israel full recognition in exchange for a roll - back to the 1967 borders ; but is n't it a good idea to find out ?
Israel , as she gazes at her grey hairs and discreetly ignores the smell of her own stale shit pumped across Palestine , needs to ask what kind of country she wants to be in the next 60 years .

During the last debate when Edwards condescendingly called Dennis or his reasoned comment " cute " he showed us a rare view as to just how unimpressive he is .
( Does anyone remember how he already won the Vice Presidency once , but did n't cry foul ? )
For those of you still under the impression that John Edwards is a real leader with Wisdom of his Own , I 've linked below to a post Dennis put up on his site :
Edwards ’ pro-war posture in ’04 raises serious credibility questions .
MANCHESTER , NH -- Revelations in today ’s New York Times regarding John Edwards ’ staunch pro-war stance as a Vice Presidential candidate in 2004 “ raise serious questions about the credibility of his positions on every issue being debated in this Presidential campaign , ” Ohio Congressman and Democratic Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich said today .
“ Voters have every right to ask , ‘ Were you telling the truth then , John , or are you telling the truth now ? ’
And Senator Edwards has a responsibility to answer , ” Kucinich said .
In a major story today about the relationship between Edwards and Massachusetts Sen .
John Kerry during the 2004 campaign , the Times reported , “ Mr. Kerry had increasing doubts about the war .
But Mr. Edwards argued that they should not renounce their votes — they had to show conviction and consistency . ”
Edwards was a co-sponsor of the 2002 war authorization resolution , along with Sen. Joseph Lieberman .
“ Mr. Kerry yielded to his running mate , ” according to the Times story , and told reporters early in the 2004 campaign that he would still have voted for the 2002 war authorization even knowing that Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction .
Six weeks later , in a speech at New York University , he reversed himself , over the objections of Edwards , the Times reported .
A year later , in an opinion piece published in The Washington Post , Edwards reversed his own position , a move that some Kerry aides described as “ politically expedient ” in the planned run-up to the 2008 Presidential campaign .
“ John Kerry was hammered by the Republicans and by many in the media for changing his positions on the war and other issues in the 2004 campaign , ” Kucinich noted .
“ The fact of the matter is that he wanted to come out against the war in 2004 , and John Edwards argued against it . ”
“ Now , ” Kucinich continued , “ we have a candidate who voted for the war and voted to fund the war , but says he against it .
He voted for the Patriot Act , and now he complains about its abuses .
He voted for China Trade in 2000 knowing that Americans would be hurt , and now he ’s decrying the unsafe products pouring into this nation from China .
He supported nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain , now he ’s against it .
” “ Will the real John Edwards please stand up ? ” Kucinich said .
here 's the Times article ( another serial offender )

She is one of our brightest hopes for Olympic glory after winning two golds at the recent World Cycling Championships in Manchester .
Now Victoria Pendleton has disclosed the secrets of her success – and confided that although sex can damage men's sporting prowess , she believes it boosts a woman's .
But Victoria , 27 , adds that even though she sees a man for regular dinner dates , she is so devoted to her sport that he will always be second in her life .
In an interview with The Mail on Sunday , Victoria says she does not believe in the sex bans imposed on athletes before major competitions .

Victoria Pendleton confided that although sex can damage men's sporting prowess , she believes it boosts a woman's .
" We are sensible athletes – we know what is healthy and what is unhealthy , " she says .
" I was recently speaking to someone involved with coaching athletes .
He said he knows when his athletes are in a relationship because the guy 's performance goes down and the girl 's performance improves .
It 's quite funny – the guy is thinking about it too much . "
She says her dreams of winning gold in Beijing in August have made it impossible to consider settling down .
" I have a guy I have an arrangement with , " she says .
" He takes me out to dinner and I spend a lot of time with him when I can .
He is from outside the sport .
We are not allowed to have relationships with other cyclists , even if we wanted . "
As she is away competing for nine months a year , Victoria , from Stotfold in Bedfordshire , says she cannot commit to a relationship like " normal " people .
" The guy I see is second on my list and he knows that , " she says .
" I do n't want my parents to think less of me because I am not settled down with somebody – but I am not interested in that .
I 've got other priorities that far , far exceed me needing Mr Right . "
She says she recently posed naked for pictures on her bike because " I wo n't look like this for ever and I thought it was a great way to store that image for the rest of time .
" I 'm not in bad nick and represent a good body image .
I 've worked hard for my muscles and I 'm proud of the way my legs look " .
She insists : " I was topless but I came into the studio in a robe and I was wearing a thong – although that was airbrushed out . "
Sir Paul McCartney roused ISS Expedition 12 commander Bill McArthur and flight engineer Valery Tokarev early Nov. 13 , 2005 EST during live concert broadcast to the International Space Station .
During his tour , the former Beatle also paid tribute to NASA 's STS - 114 shuttle astronaut crew .
NASA will beam The Beatles ' song , " Across the Universe , " into deep space Monday in an unprecedented long distance dedication by the U.S. agency .
NASA 's Deep SpaceNetwork will transmit the song at 7:00 p.m. EST ( 0000 Feb. 5 GMT ) on Feb. 4 in honor of several cosmic - themed anniversaries .
Monday marks the 40th anniversary of the day the song wasrecorded .
This year also marks the 50th anniversary of NASA 's founding and theinception of The Beatles .
Two other milestones also are being honored including , the 50th anniversary of Explorer 1 , the first U.S. satellite , and the 45th birthdayof the Deep Space Network , an international network of antennas that supportsmissions to explore the universe .
Thetransmission is aimed at the North Star , Polaris , 431 light - years away fromEarth , travelling at a speed of 186,000 miles per second ( 300,000 kps ) .
" Acrossthe Universe , " though credited to " Lennon / McCartney , " wasprincipally written by Beatle JohnLennon , and the lyrics speak of " limitless undying love which / shinesaround me like a million suns . "
" Amazing !
Welldone , NASA ! " said former BeatleSir Paul McCartney in a message to the space agency .
" Send my love to the aliens . "
Lennon ' swidow , Yoko Ono , commented : " I see that this is the beginning of the newage in which we will communicate with billions of planets across the universe . "
NASA hasused Beatles music before , notably in November 2005 , when McCartney performedthe song " Good Day Sunshine " during aconcert transmitted to the International Space Station .
" Here Comesthe Sun , " " Ticket to Ride " and " A Hard Day 's Night " havealso been played in wake - up calls to astronaut crews in orbit .
The publicaround the world has been invited to participate in the event by playing thesong at the same time it is transmitted by NASA .
Many of thesenior NASA scientists and engineers involved consider themselves among thegroup 's biggest fans .
[ Ed. note :
What we would like to know , of course , is if McCartney 's group Wings ' hitsingle , " Venus and Mars , " will be beamed towards Venus and / or Marsanytime soon . ]
The Bush administration ’s announcement Tuesday that it would put the foreclosure process on hold for 30 days to rescue struggling homeowners came several weeks too late for Mike Salgado .
And he ’s not even a homeowner .
Salgado , 40 , is one of many renters who have found themselves homeless after their cash - strapped landlords stopped making mortgage payments and their houses or apartment buildings were foreclosed upon .
The California Apartment Assn. , the state ’s largest organization of rental property owners , estimates that as much as a quarter of all foreclosed single - family residences are occupied by renters .
The number of renters ensnared in the foreclosure fiasco is even larger when duplexes and other multi-unit buildings are factored in .

And the evictions show no sign of abating .
Total foreclosures of single - family homes statewide rose more than 400 % to a record 31,676 in the fourth quarter from a year earlier , according to DataQuick Information Systems .
“ It ’s definitely happening , ” said Phyllis Rockower , president of the 850 - member Real Estate Investors Club of Los Angeles .
“ People e-mail me all the time with the saddest stories . ”
Rockower ’s own daughter is facing eviction from a rented home in Colorado .
Eileen Bronchick , 39 , said she received notice last month that the landlord of her town house had missed mortgage payments and that she might have to move if the property is foreclosed upon .
For many such people , this can mean even steeper rents because the wave of foreclosures has spurred greater demand for rental housing -- a blessing to landlords who do n’t have banks breathing down their necks .

Sixty percent of Los Angeles residents are already renters , according to the National Multi Housing Council , an industry group .
That compares with a nationwide average of 32 % .
State and local officials say that many evictions could be avoided if people knew the legal protections available to them .
However , few lenders and property managers make such information available during the eviction process .
“ The whole thing is terrifying , ” said Michaelyn Jones , general counsel to the Santa Monica Rent Control Board , which oversees some of California ’s toughest rent - control rules .
“ It ’s something a number of jurisdictions have been discussing because it ’s a growing problem . ”
Many now - foreclosed properties had been purchased by real estate speculators taking advantage of dirt - cheap loans , who rented the properties to tenants before falling behind on mortgage payments .

To help remedy the situation , the Bush administration and six major lenders said they would “ pause ” foreclosures for troubled homeowners .
The plan , dubbed Project Lifeline , is intended to give lenders time to work out more - affordable terms for borrowers .
Delores Conway , director of USC ’s Casden Real Estate Economics Forecast , said it was difficult to measure the number of tenants affected by foreclosures because more people were renting directly from owners of houses and condos .
This “ shadow market ” of renters is n’t being tracked by organizations that compile statistics on established rental properties , Conway said , adding that the number of such renters has grown in the Inland Empire .
Karen Fricke , executive director of the Apartment Assn. Greater Inland Empire , an organization of rental property owners , said it was no secret among landlords that many renters were getting caught up in the mortgage meltdown .

“ I ’m getting a lot of phone calls from members of our association saying they ’re going into foreclosure and asking what to do about their tenants , ” she said .
Salgado , who works as service manager for a San Bernardino boat dealer , returned to his rented Hesperia house Jan. 23 to find a notice from his property manager , Century 21 Fairway Realty , informing him that the property had been foreclosed upon .
The notice offered an “ assistance check ” in the amount of $ 1,250 if Salgado would agree to get out of the house by Feb .
5 .
“ It is to your benefit to accept this assistance check , ” it said .
“ Please keep in mind that the eviction process has started . ”

Offering financial inducements is a common practice when renters are being pushed to vacate a foreclosed property .
It ’s called “ cash for keys ” and can involve payments of as much as $ 1,500 , ostensibly to help a tenant resettle but also to get him or her to waive any claims to the rental property .
Salgado was told by Century 21 that if he did n’t agree to the deal right away , his resettlement money would be slashed to $ 750 within a week and then to $ 500 a week after that .
Then it would drop to nothing , and he ’d still have to move out .
“ I felt very pressured , ” Salgado recalled .
He said he agreed to the $ 1,250 payout and moved himself and his two kids -- ages 2 and 3 -- to a nearby motel .
His dog and cat were put in a kennel .
It was , to say the least , a less - than - ideal situation .

State officials said that under California law , existing rental agreements are essentially wiped out when a property is foreclosed upon .
All that ’s required is that a tenant be given at least 30 days ’ notice that he or she is being evicted .
But those officials also said that state law can be trumped by local rent - control statutes , which often provide tenants with more far - reaching protections .
These “ just cause ” provisions of many municipal rent - control laws limit the ability of landlords to evict tenants , even those on month - to - month leases .
They also include cases in which ownership of a property changes hands , such as a foreclosure .
“ Tenants can not simply be evicted , ” insisted Adam Radinsky , who heads Santa Monica ’s consumer protection unit .
“ There ’s no question about that . ”
Advertisement
Actually , it depends on where you live .
Cities with “ just cause ” provisions include Los Angeles , San Diego , Santa Monica , Thousand Oaks , West Hollywood and Glendale .
However , not all “ just cause ” provisions are created equal .
San Diego ’s requires that a tenant occupy a property for at least two years before the provision takes effect .
Glendale ’s allows an eviction to proceed if the landlord plans to remove the property from the rental market or have a relative move in .
Moreover , not all rental properties may fall under a city ’s rent - control protections .
In such cases , state law would probably apply , which would allow a foreclosure - related eviction to go ahead .
“ In that case , the tenant may be in a really lousy position , ” said Al Shelden , chief of consumer law in California Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown ’s office .
“ There may not be many rights to begin with . ”

That was the predicament Salgado found himself in .
Hesperia has no rent - control law and no “ just cause ” provision .
State law thus allows him and his family to be thrown out on their ears .
Salgado said he was told by Century 21 that he ’d receive his check right away .
So he immediately found another house to rent in the vicinity .
But no check arrived .
And as the days in the motel passed , Salgado said he quickly ran out of money .
He moved his family and pets to his mother ’s Beverly Hills apartment this week .
He has to commute about 150 miles a day to and from work .
A spokeswoman for Century 21 said Tuesday that she expected Salgado to receive his check by the end of the day .

If you are a renter and receive a notice from a bank or property manager saying your rented home has been foreclosed upon , contact City Hall to find out what rent - control rules may exist in your area and whether the property is protected .
Salgado said he hoped that once he got his check , he ’d be able to relocate his family to a new home in Hesperia .
All in all , he added , everyone ’s taking things in stride .
“ Except our cat , ” Salgado said .
“ He ’s really freaking out . ”

When Torrence James was finished serving a federal prison sentence for dealing cocaine in 2004 , he took one of the few white - collar jobs then still available to convicted felons .
He became a mortgage broker .
Last week , Chief U.S. District Judge Edward W. Nottingham sentenced James to 12 years in prison for mortgage fraud .
James , 44 , of Centennial , was part of a ring that fleeced several mortgage companies out of $ 3.7 million by taking out fraudulent loans .
Many of the luxury properties that James and six other defendants skimmed became party pads as they fell into foreclosure , devastating local property values .
Crime and punishment .
Law and order .
Justice served .
But how does a convicted dope peddler become a mortgage broker and get instant access to millions of dollars in the first place ?
One of the companies James and his crew defrauded was New Century Financial Corp. of Irvine , Calif. , which is now under federal investigation for fraud itself .
It ’s the same old story .
New Century is in bankruptcy after paying its executives millions in bonuses and stock options .
Its three founders made more than $ 40 million selling stock between 2004 and 2006 as the company apparently made loans to anyone with a pulse .
When the company is liquidated , its shareholders will receive a penny to 25 cents on the dollar .
New Century had a “ brazen obsession ” with making subprime loans , turning “ a blind eye ” to a “ ticking time bomb , ” according to an independent report released last week that was commissioned by the Justice Department .
New Century wrote $ 357 million worth of mortgages in 1995 , the year it was founded .
In 2006 it wrote $ 60 billion .
How did it grow so fast ?
Liar loans .
Lending standards were so lax that all some borrowers had to do was fill out a form stating incomes that would never be verified .
It was just this easy .
New Century , like every mortgage lender , did not have an incentive to think about loan quality .
The loans would usually become somebody else ’s problem once they were sold .
But how does a publicly traded company get away with such fiscal slop ?
Does n’t it have an auditor ?
The 580 - page report from examiner Michael Missal , which was more than five months in the making , concludes that New Century ’s auditor , KPMG , failed to exercise due care in reviewing the books , leading to misstated financial results .
KPMG has said it “ strongly disagrees ” with the report ’s findings .
“ It ’s an Arthur Andersen re-do , ” said Lynn Turner , the former chief accountant for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , who now sits on the U.S. Treasury ’s committee on the auditing profession .
“ We ’re right back where we were in pre-Enron days . ”
Remember all those Arthur Andersen guys who lost their jobs after Enron blew ?
Well , many of them found new jobs at KPMG .
Not that KPMG needed their help screwing up the books .
As KPMG responded to the New Century report last week , it also announced that the firm would pay $ 80 million to settle up for accounting restatements at Xerox Corp. that occurred in 2000 .
The firm denied wrongdoing , saying it settled to avoid litigation costs and distraction .
Here ’s 80 million bucks .
Forgetaboutit .
It was a long time ago .
What can anybody say ?
“ Some things blow up occasionally , ” said John Bazley , a professor at the University of Denver ’s Daniels College of Business .
“ People make mistakes . ”
In the case of New Century , KPMG may have had to constantly re-value complex securities stuffed into Byzantine portfolios , Bazley explained .
The financial instruments that giant investment banks create these days are so convoluted nobody understands them .
Often it ’s difficult to calculate all the risks and see who is taking them — which explains why one day an 85 - year - old firm like Bear Stearns looks OK and the next it needs a $ 30 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve , just to be liquidated .
“ It ’s a Wall Street issue more than an accountants ’ issue , ” said Bazley .
And a very complicated one at that .
Meantime , it ’s a good thing they got that Torrence James guy .
What a menace to society he was .

thx , while it took me damn long it still made a lot of fun to build it@levellord : " Are those LED 's still multi-colored or green only ? " yeah , their changing vom green to red if you turn down the fans ( the left dims the lights ) @sn85 : " did you have to sand the inside of ur case " no , no sanding .
but i had a lot of problems with dust so the surface doesnt look so good i think@lozaning : " any chanche we could get some shoots of the side pannel of and some wider angle shoots , id like to get the whoel picture " ah sure , but what do you mean with " whole picture " ?
my room ?
just found some other pictures from the psu mod and the power rail unit : the last two were made before polishing , the first one is already polished !
and here some more pics from the work in progress : and finally something that i planned earlier but never went realized : that should also explain the color theme

They are all famous faces - and yet almost unrecognisable , lost under a welter of savage bruises .
This is the shocking new campaign from Women 's Aid using celebrities to highlight domestic violence , which sees two women a week killed by current or former partners .
Here , a former national newspaper editor says domestic violence must not be ignored , and reveals - for the first time - her own experiences at the hands of a violent man .
Domestic violence is the guilty secret that no one likes to confess .
Being beaten up by a husband or partner fills women with shame , not the anger the crime deserves .
Even though the police receive 1,300 calls a day from women saying they have been physically abused , even though a horrific two women a week are being killed by their partners , there is still a stranglehold of shame and guilt that hangs over the crime .
Why ?
Because if you beat someone up for long enough , promising yet more beatings if they dare to open their mouths to complain , that person begins to believe that is what they are really worth .
This vicious cycle only gets worse .
The new Women 's Aid campaign , showing celebrities made up to look as though they have been battered , literally hits you in face .
Honor Blackman with her eye bruised and bloodied .
Fiona Bruce with her mouth puffed up and swollen .
It says , loud and clear , that domestic violence can happen to anyone .
Even the rich , powerful and famous can fall victim to a man 's fist .
I remember when Chiswick Women 's Refuge opened , in 1971 , a year before we started the feminist Spare Rib Magazine .
I remember , too , my jaunty , cocky , overconfident self going for a visit .
Till that moment , I naively believed that the main task of the feminist movement was to improve the working opportunities for women , transforming them from stayat - home mothers into workplace dynamos .
Now I was confronted by young mothers , with bruised cheekbones and swelling black eyes , huddled together on the few sticks of furniture and mattresses that the centre had scraped together from locals who cared .
They clutched their little ones to them , clearly scared , but also relieved .
For the first time , they had somewhere safe to go with their children , where their stories of domestic violence back home would be believed .
In those days , the police never wanted to intervene in ' domestics ' and many a woman told a tale of being turned away by the police .
I remember one saying to me that the policeman she complained to more or less told her to go home , stop nagging and make sure she got a good hot dinner on the table before her husband came home .
Her situation , she told me , was made so much worse because her husband was a popular man , liked by his friends , affable and civilised to everyone but her .
Thankfully , the attitude of the police has changed .
Now , they do listen and they will arrest a man who thinks his wife or partner is his to abuse .
Sadly , though , the staggering extent of domestic abuse continues .
In the early Seventies , it was incredibly hard for women , who had never had a job and who were wholly financially dependent on their partners , to leave home with their children .
But even though it is now far easier for a woman to bring up her kids on her own , the cycle continues .
Staggeringly , one in four women experience domestic violence at some point heir lives .
It can happen to any of us - regardless of our age , wealth , race or religion .
It can range from verbal abuse to full - scale physical violence and rape .
It happened to me in one relationship I had in my 20s ; my partner 's periodic drunken rages flared into fists smashed into my eyes .
I remember being scared , but mostly I remember being ashamed .
The first time it happened I told everyone that the black eye I was hiding behind dark glasses was the result of a suitcase falling off the top of a cupboard .
The second time it happened , the excuse sounded increasingly feeble .
The third time , I did n't go out until make - up could cover up the fading bruise .
The fourth time , I left him .
And still I did n't talk about it .
I loved my boyfriend .
We were living in America and planning to get married .
I suspected he was seeing another woman and after the first time he thumped me , I stayed silent about his savage assault , somehow convinced that it was my fault , that something I had done had brought on this rage ; that I had , perversely , invited the beating .
I can see now how absurd that was .
I was intelligent and financially independent .
I 'd founded a feminist magazine .
I was ashamed that this had happened to me and I remember thinking that maybe this was what victims of torture felt when they said that their abuse made them feel guilty , as though in some way they had asked for it .
Yet when it comes to domestic violence , that is often the way that society thinks .
' She asked for it , she is always nagging him , ' goes the warped opinion of those who would excuse such assaults .
When it happened to me , I found myself vowing inwardly not to nag , and even believed my boyfriend the mornings after he'd hit me , when he'd ply me with ice packs and kisses and apologies , vowing that it would never , ever happen again .
Stupid me , I let him convince me , I suppose because I wanted to be convinced , and hoped that he would never do it again and that we could be happy .
But by keeping silent , I colluded with his behaviour , giving him the licence to go on and do it again and again .
Outwardly , we may have seemed a charmed couple : he was gregarious , the life and soul of the party .
How could I dispel this false picture which I so wanted to believe in by telling my friends and my family that he was a beast ?
Surely , I reasoned , people would think less of me , too , if they knew I 'd chosen to be with such a man .
My silence was not unusual .
It 's what victims of domestic violence do : ashamed at what has happened to them , desperate to believe it wo n't happen again , perversely anxious to try to please your tormentor , because then , if you never nag and always have dinner ready , do everything in your power to please and placate your partner , then maybe it wo n't happen again .
But while women behave like this - like I did - the problem will only continue and it will never be confronted .
No one has a problem saying their bag was stolen in the street , but to say your husband has smashed your face in is a whole other issue .
The time has come to rip away the veil of secrecy that surrounds the issue of domestic violence .
Only by talking about it and owning up to it will we ever change the situation .
No one , absolutely no one , deserves to feel frightened in their own home .
No child should ever have to grow up to see his dad hit and abuse his mum - but 750,000 children witness such scenes every year .
Even though 570,000 women report incidents of domestic violence to the police annually , it is reckoned some 60 per cent of cases go unreported .
That 's a damning statistic of which we should all be ashamed .
So what can we do ?
For a start , support Women 's
Aid with the funds they urgently need to ensure that there is always someone at the end of a phone who will listen , and a place for women in trouble to go with their children .
Raise the issue when and where you can , and , if you suspect that a friend or relative of yours is suffering , ask her and see if you can help .
We will only combat this by speaking out and confronting the facts .
Until we do , another two women will carry on dying every week , as what we like to call our civilised society continues to turn its face the other way .

Local Media Outlet Finally Reports on the Stunning Allegations in William Singer 's Whistleblower Suit , Local Election Officials Respond With the Same Old , Disingenous , Long - Ago Debunked Nonsense ...
Brad Friedman Byon
4/13/2008 , 7:22 pm PT
In Aurora , Illinois , today , Beacon News ' Dan Campana files a very good report on the federal fraud suit filed against Austin , Texas , based voting machine company Hart InterCivic .
The suit , alleging dozens of false claims and fraudulent activities by Hart in order to receive federal Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) money , was filed originally by former employee turned whistleblower William Singer back in 2006 , but did not become unsealed until March 27th , when The BRAD BLOG covered it , along with posting the full stunning complaint [ PDF ] .
Beacon News is based in Kane County , IL , which uses the faulty Hart voting systems in question .
Campana 's report today --- which quotes yours truly in a number of places --- is the only corporate media coverage of the lawsuit in the nearly three weeks since the case was finally unsealed .
Until now , there 's been the fairly extensive coverage found on this blog , an item on the same day the case was unsealed filed by Kim Zetter at WIRED 's " Threat Level " blog ( which we replied to here ) , and a very short squib from AP on the same day , which , according to a quick Google News search , was carried by only a single news outlet , CBS 4 in Denver .
( For the record , our extensively detailed and sourced report on Hart 's attempted takeover of Sequoia late last week has been picked up by nobody , other than ComputerWorld where we , ourselves , filed a short summary report .
That , despite officials from both Hart and Sequoia having confirmed the accuracy of our report , and the fact that Hart , which controls some 8 % of the voting market in this country , is about to swallow up Sequoia Voting Systems , which controls 20 % of it , to become the nation 's second largest e-voting machine vendor .
We 'll know by Tuesday at the latest , most likely , if Sequoia was able to save itself from Hart 's hostile takeover . )
So with a dearth of coverage anywhere but here , we can heartily recommend Campana 's report on Singer 's suit .
His article includes comments from us ( as mentioned ) , one of Singer 's attorneys , Hart spokesperson Peter Lichtenheld ( who shamelessly plays the tired old " conspiracy theory " card ) , some Election Integrity advocates from the non-partisan Illinois Ballot Integrity Project , and some state and local Kane County election officials who have deluded themselves into believing their Hart machines are safe for use in American democracy .
When Campana interviewed us for his story , we suggested he ask any of the election officials he planned to interview for a single piece of evidence to prove that any single vote , ever cast during an election on a Hart DRE ( Direct Recording Electronic ) voting machine in the county , has ever been recorded accurately , as intended by a voter .
Though Campana references our challenge in his report ( " Friedman contends no government officials can prove the votes cast on electronic machines can be accurately linked to tallies " , ) he does n't quote any of the officials as being able to offer such evidence .
Little surprise , because they can't produce such evidence .
It 's strictly impossible .
Yet they continue to use these machines anyway .
But he does manage to get a few amusing and wholly unsupportable statements from some of those deluded officials .
We 're delighted to spend our Sunday dismantling them --- both the statements , and the officials ...
The bulk of officials interviewed for the piece , as Campana reports , believe the Hart system is " well worth the money as it brought greater speed , security and accuracy to the process . "
Speed , perhaps , but their claims of added " security and accuracy " are evidence - free hogwash .
State Board of Elections Director Dan
White believes all is well on the Hart voting systems because , he claims , " there have n't been any reports of problems " since the state certified them .
Elections Director Jay Bennett says " Hart would n't have gotten past the first door " if Singer 's claims were accurate .
" We test the living daylights out of them , " he 's quoted as saying .
Really , Mr. Bennet ?
Where are the results of those tests ?
Do they test for the system failures Singer alleged in the complaint ?
And how do you explain the dozens of vulnerabilities found in Hart 's machines when scores of world - class computer scientists and security experts actually did test the living daylights out of them in CA SoS Debra Bowen 's " Top - to - Bottom " review ?
Kane County Clerk John Cunningham said , " I 'm pleased with the equipment we bought ... We welcome anybody to put a magnifying glass on it . "
Really , Mr. Cunningham ?
Anybody ?
I 'm sure the folks at the Illinois Ballot Integrity Project --- who meet the criteria of " anybody , " we 'd think --- would be happy to take you up on that offer !
When can they swing by to pick up a machine to put that magnifying glass on it ?
Not that we do n't trust you , Mr. Cunningham , but you have exhibited exceedingly bad judgment in the past , such as when you hired John Bruun to be country Election Director .
Bruun was found guilty of swindling hundreds of thousands of dollars " from a disabled man , " and several others , as The Daily Herald told us in 2003 , before being hired as Kane County 's Election Director after being " turned down for jobs as a teacher , bus driver and real estate agent because of his criminal record . "
But we digress ... and while we 're waiting for Mr. Cunningham to make one of those
Hart machines available so that the citizens forced to use them can put them under a magnifying glass as he promises , luckily , someone else has already put the same systems under such a magnifying glass , and imagine what they found ?
The expert reviewers commissioned by CA SoS Bowen last year at the University of California found , as described in her decertification of the system [ PDF ] , when examining the daylights out of the Hart InterCivic eSlate and eScan systems , that " the physical and technological security mechanisms provided [ were ] inadequate to ensure accuracy and integrity of the election results . "
They reported that the system " contain [s ] serious design flaws that have led directly to specific vulnerabilities , which attackers could exploit to affect election outcomes . "
Specifically , the Source Code review [ PDF ] team found that Hart 's voting system , among other problems :
" [ C] ontains design features that can be used in a fashion for which those design features were not intended , including network interfaces that are not secure against direct attack "
" Fails to check the correctness of inputs from other Hart voting system components and uses those inputs in unsafe ways , potentially enabling an attacker to use voting system components to reprogram voting system units throughout the county with malicious code that would affect a subsequent election "
" [ E ] xhibits a notable lack of the use of cryptographic security protocols to secure network communications , and where cryptography is used , [ it can be done in a way ] that could allow a person to forge ballot information and election results in multiple locations "
Among the findings of the CA SoS' " Red Team " ( hack testers ) [ PDF ] , it was discovered --- without them having access to the source code --- that the Hart voting system was vulnerable to :
" electronic ballot box stuffing attack . "
The ability to " overwrite [ Hart ] software "
" violat[ing ] a voters right to privacy by linking voters to their vote selections . "
" overwrit[ing ] ... ballots with records containing votes for a candidate [ an attacker ] does want to be successful . "
" altered vote totals that can only be detected in the event of a manual recount of eSlate VVPAT [ Voter - verifiable paper audit trail ] records "
In conclusion , the hack team found they were " ... able to discover attacks for the Hart system that could compromise the accuracy , secrecy , and availability of the voting systems and their auditing mechanisms .
That is , the Red Team has developed exploits that absent procedural mitigation strategies can alter vote totals , violate the privacy of individual voters , make systems unavailable , and delete audit trails . "
Other than that magnifying glass , we 're sure Illinois " tested the daylights out of them . "
We look forward to those referenced Illinois test results seeing daylight soon , as they have in California .
Until then , you 'll have to color us dubious ( to put it nicely ) .
And while we 're waiting for that , we hope Campana , and the rest of the media in Illinois , will continue to report on this matter and hold some feet to a long - overdue fire .
Oh .. and the folks in Cook County , IL , ( such as County Clerk David Orr ) --- who chose to do business with Sequoia instead of Hart --- might want to ask a few more questions than they already have of their friends at Sequoia about Hart 's impending takeover , since we do n't suspect the fine folks of Cook meant to go into business with a company facing federal fraud charges , and we know for a fact that Sequoia has n't told its good clients in Cook what 's really going on .
Or maybe nobody cares .
We 'll see .

I just discovered that drunk girls get 10 times the attention as non-drunk girls .
Check out the picture below .
This is a screenshot I took from Break.com , a popular video site .
The video on the left was submitted to the site 1 month ago .
It features a very creative dance routine orchestrated by two talented girls in bikinis to the tune of Daft Punk .
The video on the right was submitted only 4 days ago .
It was an attempt by two drunk girls to copy the first video .
Both videos contain very similar situations .
2 girls in bikinis , doing a dance routine to Daft Punk .
Other than the heads showing , the only big difference seems to be that the girls on the right are drunk .
But check out how many times each video has been viewed .
I was pretty surprised .
KO OLINA , Hawaii  Chad Johnson stood outside the lush JW Marriott Ihilani Resort , home of the Pro Bowlers , on a picture postcard morning , overlooking the turquoise - colored Pacific Ocean on the near horizon .
Johnson 's mood concerning a season of discontent and an uncertain future with the Cincinnati Bengals did n't match the view from paradise .
He spent Pro Bowl week venting frustration concerning what he perceives to be a deteriorating relationship with the Bengals .
JOHNSON TO WASHINGTON ?
Ocho Cinco rumors persist
From his comments made here and elsewhere this offseason , Johnson seems bent on orchestrating a divorce and thinks a trade would be in everybody 's best interest , even though he has four years remaining on a six - year , $ 35 million - plus deal .
For those into non-verbal hints , he wore a Baltimore Ravens baseball cap during Saturday 's AFC Pro Bowl practice at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu .
After a season in which he felt scapegoated for the 7 - 9 Bengals ' disappointing finish — despite 93 receptions and a career - high 1,440 receiving yards for the franchise 's all - time leader in catches and receiving yardage — Johnson is asked , " What will make you happy ? "
" Winning .
Making the playoffs , " responds Johnson , who has one career postseason appearance .
At that moment , Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis , who doubles as Johnson 's friend and mentor , walks past .
Johnson calls out to the veteran player whom he has leaned on .
" When I was going through tough times during the season , this is who I would call — Ray Lewis , " Johnson says .
Johnson broadens his conversation with a reporter to include Lewis .
" This reporter asked me what is it going to take for me to be happy , Ray . "
Johnson then gives Lewis a recap .
" Winning more games during the regular season .
Playing in the playoffs and getting a ring , " Johnson rehashes for Lewis .
" Because I remember you told me , ' No matter what 85 ( Johnson 's jersey number ) does , until he gets a ring , he is n't anything . ' "
Lewis laughs heartily , enjoying the retelling of his advice .
" You have to win the ring .
Case closed , " Lewis says .
" And you wonder why I am how I am right now ? " Johnson says .
" He 's just emotional , " Lewis says .
Lewis smiles and motions to Johnson to stay calm .
" I 'm going to slow down , " Johnson says as Lewis walks away .
On the field and off , Johnson is as close as ever with running mate T.J. Houshmandzadeh , his former Oregon State teammate who earned his first Pro Bowl honor after a 112 - reception season , tied for tops in the league with the New England Patriots '
Wes Welker .
" It 's a fine line when a guy does n't want to be there , " Houshmandzadeh says .
" Do you keep somebody who does n't want to be there and have it hurt the morale of the team ?
I 'm not sure what 's going to happen .
If he 's still there , Chad will do whatever it takes to play football . "
But Johnson seems to feel he'd be happier elsewhere despite coach Marvin Lewis ' insistence he has no intention of trading the dynamic playmaker .
" I 've talked to the team , " says Johnson 's agent , Drew Rosenhaus .
" As far as approaching them about a trade , I 've done that .
But I prefer to work behind the scenes .
There 's obviously some issues that need to be addressed . "
Can Johnson have a reconciliation in Cincinnati if he 's back next season ?
" I do n't know , " Rosenhaus says .
Says Johnson : " Do n't let the celebrations and all the trash talking fool you .
That 's what it 's always been about : winning , getting to the playoffs and getting that ring . "
Those may be the goals , even if some people think Johnson is more interested in self promotion with his creative on - field antics .
" There 's people 's perceptions , " he says .
" ( But ) have I ever caused controversy ?
Think about it .
Never got in trouble on the field or off the field .
" But I get in trouble for having fun .
My motive was to play the game the way I was brought up ; play the game how I was raised back in Miami , playing around the ( University of Miami ) Hurricanes .
Have fun . "
Johnson wo n't point fingers inside his own locker room , and he does n't intend to hold out .
But he 's not afraid to speak out .
" There 's all kind of stuff I had to deal with this season , someone saying I was ' too flamboyant , outlandish . '
I 've always played the game with passion . "
Johnson says he can't stop being himself , which includes adopting children from an impoverished village in Africa he visited last offseason .
" When we 're losing , then I can't be me , " he says of some of the criticism he endured .
" Nobody wants to hear about the good I do .
They 're waiting for me to mess up . "
Does he have to go elsewhere to find happiness ?
" I do n't know what I can do ? " he says .
" I need to continue to be competitive and want to be the best at what I do .
Whether it's in Cincinnati or in the Arena League , you 're going to get the same Chad — the same hardworking , bust - his - butt Chad . "
Johnson is asked if he'd ever demand a trade out of Cincinnati .
" I 'd never do that , man , " Johnson says .
" That 's not my job .
I just play .
I 'm under contract with the B , " he says , pointing to the bright orange , striped B representing the Bengals on his shoulder pads .
" If I 'm back in Cincinnati , you 're going to get the same Chad Johnson you got in 2001 , ' 02 , '03 , ' 04 , '05 , ' 06 , ' 07 , " he says .
" You 're going to get the same outlandish , flamboyant , Chad .
I 'm not changing . "
Johnson then asks a question of his own .
" What wins championships ? "
" Defense , " he is told .
" Looking at the Giants , it 's defense .
That 's another thing I do n't like , " Johnson says of the Bengals ' situation .
He is told Baltimore safety Ed Reed , one of the league 's top defensive difference - makers , has been lobbying for him to join the Ravens if he can't reconcile with the Bengals .
" Everybody 's lobbying for me , " Johnson says .
" It 's funny that the outsiders have so much respect for me ; players and other coaches love me to death .
And I do n't get that same feeling — the love ain't the same on the inside with the Bengals . "
Bottom line :
What does he think happens in 2008 ?
Would it be in everyone 's best interest if Johnson moves on , if things can be worked out to satisfy all parties ?
" That would be a good ending to the story , " Johnson says .
Rosenhaus helped Terrell Owens move on to a happy , productive home with the Dallas Cowboys after his bitter divorce with the Philadelphia Eagles .
And Johnson and Owens just happen to be good friends .
Think of the teams that can use an upgrade at wide receiver : the Ravens , Eagles , Washington Redskins , New York Jets and Miami Dolphins are just a few .
Consider how the additions of Randy Moss and Welker helped the Patriots revamp their offense into a record - setting unit .
But there 's another bottom line newly elected Hall of Fame receiver Art Monk wonders about .
" Today 's players seem more worried about free agency and money , " Monk says .
" I took great pride in being a Redskin my entire career .
I watch today 's receivers , and they 're so talented , but sometimes the grass is n't always greener . "
It 's something Chad Johnson might come to quickly realize if he no longer has quarterback Carson Palmer throwing his way or Houshmandzadeh keeping opposing defenses honest .

LAS VEGAS ( Reuters ) - Amid growing worries about a worsening of the U.S. economy , Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama proposed a $ 75 billion economic stimulus plan on Sunday that includes worker tax credits , a one - time pension supplement and help to homeowners facing foreclosure .

The plan would include an immediate $ 250 tax credit for workers , which could double if the economy worsens , a one - time $ 250 supplement to Social Security payments , a $ 10 billion fund to help homeowners facing foreclosure and a $ 10 billion fund to assist states facing budget shortfalls amid lower tax revenues .
“ We need that middle - class tax cut now more than ever -- not five months from now or five weeks from now , but now , ” Obama said in a statement .
“ I ’m announcing a plan to jump - start the economy by putting money in the pockets of those who need it most and will spend it quickly . ”
If he won his party ’s nomination and then the November election , Obama would take office in January 2009 .
The Illinois senator ’s office unveiled the proposals at the start of a day of campaigning in Nevada , which holds the next contested Democratic primary on Saturday .
The “ goal would be to help the U.S. economy from going into recession , ” his economic advisor Austan Goolsbee told reporters .
Obama ’s leading rival , New York Sen.
Hillary Clinton , on Friday unveiled an economic stimulus package she said would be worth $ 70 billion .
Her plan placed more of an emphasis on helping families unable to make mortgage payments -- a major issue in Nevada where “ for sale ” signs are common on homes around heavily populated Las Vegas .
“ There are some similarities , ” Goolsbee said of the two plans .
The biggest difference with Obama ’s plan is that “ the absolutely most imperative thing is to get the money into the people ’s hands immediately so they can spent it . ”
“ The stimulus does increase the deficit in the immediate term , ” the economic adviser said , adding that preventing a recession could have “ profound ” budget implications .
The Obama plan also includes a $ 10 billion extension of unemployment insurance to help those who have been unable to find a job for more than six months .
The foreclosure help plan would be aimed at “ responsible homeowners ” who live in their primary residences , Goolsbee said .
Las Vegas has been hit hard by the subprime loan crisis , but many of those suffering bought additional houses hoping that fast rising prices amid a prosperous local economy would lead to easy money .
Last year , Obama proposed tax credits of up to $ 500 for 150 million workers .
His revised economic plan calls for $ 250 of that to come in an immediate credit , and the rest as soon as three months later if the nation ’s unemployment rate worsens .

Apparently animals find it mesmerizing , too .
It is said that thousands of moths and spiders are literally drawn to the flame .
By night , the light is really bright and it can be seen from a long distance .
Moreover , it is really hot when you get close to the crater , so people can only stand next to it for a few minutes .

If someone dumped 99 tons of sand on you , and you were n’t in good shape , you ’d collapse , too .
The National Transportation Safety Board has released its fifth update of its investigation of the collapse of the I - 35W bridge in Minneapolis , Minn. , that killed 13 people and injured 145 .
The NTSB says it has not yet identified a specific cause for the collapse , only contributing factors .
NTSB chair Mark V. Rosenker ( speaking as cautiously as federal officials everywhere ) , said only “ significant progress continues to be made in the investigation . ”
The board expects to issue a final report by year ’s end .
What is known :
â€¢ In January Mr. Rosenker announced the discovery of “ critical ” design flaws , noting that 16 undersized gusset plates were found at eight of 112 joints on the main truss of the bridge .
â€ ¢
The board ’s reconstruction of the collapse shows the location and weight of every car , truck and piece of construction equipment that was on the bridge including 250 pounds each for two portable toilets , for a total load of 630 tons .
That included 99 tons of “ sand in four mounds … , each 12 feet wide and stretching about 55 feet , in a lane between the four operating traffic lanes . ”
Experts say that load was not excessive for a well - designed bridge , The Times reported .
But “ [ s ] tress at one of the two weakest points was 83 percent more than it could have handled , according to an interim report released earlier by the Federal Highway Administration , ” said the newspaper .
â€ ¢
The NTSB wo n’t conduct a hearing on the I - 35W collapse .
Said The Times :
On Monday , the safety board voted not to hold a hearing on the collapse , but two of the five members dissented .
â€ œWe recognize that a political debate is raging in Minnesota about the maintenance this particular bridge received , â€ wrote the two members , Deborah A. P. Hersman and Kitty Higgins , in a statement .
A well - run hearing , they said , could separate the engineering problem from the political dispute and contribute to a healthy national debate about the state of highway infrastructure .
â€¢ On Jan. 15 , the NTSB recommended , on the basis of the discovery of flawed gusset plates , to the Federal Highway Administration that it require bridges of that design to be inspected nationally .
S&R calls to the press office of the FHWA regarding the percentage of inspections done , the cost to do them and the influence of the I - 35W bridge collapse on the proposed fiscal 2009 federal budget have not been returned .
Two weeks ago , the highway administration said it would provide an additional $ 195 million in emergency relief funding to rebuild the I - 35W bridge .
That brings the total federal payout to $ 377 million .
The Senate Committee on Banking , Housing , and Urban Affairs conducted a hearing this month on the Dodd - Hagel National Infrastructure Bank Act of 2007 ( why it ’s a bad bill ) .
David Mongan , president of the American Society of Civil Engineers , told the panel “ it would take an investment of $ 1.6 trillion by 2010 to bring the nation ’s existing infrastructure into good working order . ” [ emphasis added ]
The fiscal 2009 federal budget proposes a total of $ 40.1 billion for the Federal Highway Administration to face its “ challenge … to preserve and improve the 160,000 - mile National Highway System , which includes the Interstate System and other roads of importance for national defense and mobility , while also improving highway safety , minimizing traffic congestion , and protecting the environment on these and other key facilities . ”
The Department of Transportation would receive $ 68 billion if the budget is adopted .
H.R. 3400 , Rebuilding America ’s Infrastructure , introduced in the House by Rep. Dennis Kucinich , was referred in August to five different subcommittees of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure , and then to the House Finance and Budget committees .
Since Aug. 4 , no further action has occurred .
Meanwhile , interstate highway closures may continue as engineers find flaws in road supports .
The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation closed I -95 in Port Richmond after engineers found a 4 - foot - long crack several inches wide in a 15 - foot - tall concrete column ( pictured above ) .
Enjoy your commute , people .

Is Barack Obama elitist ?
Will his middle name harm his campaign ?
Are voters turned off by his lack of bowling prowess ?
Did he give Hillary the finger during a speech in Raleigh , North Carolina ?
When he picks his nose , which digit does he use ?
And what does that say about him ?
The first four questions were genuinely posed by US TV news over the past few weeks .
The nose - picking question was n't .
But it 's no more puerile and pointless than the ones that were .
The answers to the real questions , incidentally , run roughly as follows :
1. Is Obama elitist ?
Of course he is .
He 's running for president .
It does n't get much more elitist than that .
Still , in terms of privilege , he'd have to go a long way to beat the ding - dong incumbent .
Bush hails from a family of oil barons , billionaires , CEOs , former presidents , Scrooge McDuck and Daddy Warbucks .
He 's slept in a gigantic rustling money nest every night since the day he was born .
And he 's got an uncle made of gold .
But since he also looks like Alfred E Neuman and talks like he 's ordering ribs , he 's viewed as a straight - talkin ' , down - home regular Joe , albeit one with so much blood on his hands it 's surely in danger of caking and congealing and turning his fists into heavy balls of scab , each one the size of a cabbage , good for thumping against desks and doors but not much else .
Although even if that did happen , even if Bush called a press conference on the White House lawn and stood there demonically beating out a funeral march with his scabby orbs on a nightmarish drum fashioned from human bones and skin - even under those circumstances , you sense he 'd somehow get away with it .
Because that aw - shucks grin looks good on camera .
2. Will Obama 's middle name - Hussein - harm his campaign ?
Depends how often and how insidiously you pose the question , really .
3 . Are voters turned off by Obama 's lack of bowling prowess ?
Hard to say .
While campaigning in Pennsylvania , he took part in a photo opportunity at a bowling alley .
It did n't go so well .
He bowled a miserable 37 ; half his balls sailed into the gutter .
In summary , he looked like a dick .
The clip immediately entered heavy rotation on the TV news channels , becoming one of those modern snatches of footage that instantly take on iconic status by sheer dint of repetition ; looping hypnotically , repeating ad nauseum against a soothing background of dull pundit birdsong , permanently stitching themselves into the fabric of your mind 's eye .
And the hosts ask whether this makes him look elitist , and the pundits umm and ahh over whether it does , and the word " elitist " is bandied about again and again over the image of Obama looking like a dick , an elitist dick , an elitist can 't - bowl dick , and it all starts to feel like brainwashing , albeit inadvertently , albeit only because they 've got a simple , juicy clip and 10 billion hours of airtime to fill .
So yes , voters might be turned off by Obama 's lack of bowling prowess , because it 's been shoved in their faces and smushed around like an oily rag .
4. Did Obama give Hillary the finger during a speech in Raleigh , North Carolina ?
This one 's easy .
The answer is no .
Of course he did n't .
While discussing his opponent during a campaign speech , Obama momentarily scratched his face using his middle finger .
That 's all .
But hang on : we 've still got a lot of airtime to fill , so let 's loop it again and again while we try to work out if it might 've been a deliberate gesture , or a subconscious giveaway , or nothing at all .
Was it nothing at all ?
This .
Look at this .
Was this nothing at all ?
Here it is again .
What about this time ?
And this time ?
And this ?
When you stand at a distance and survey this level of nitpicking idiocy , taking in the full landscape of stupidity and meaningless analysis , it 's hard not to conclude that 24 - hour rolling news is the worst thing to befall humankind since the Manhattan Project .
The focus on conjecture and analysis has reached such an insane degree that pundits are chasing some kind of meaning in the way a presidential candidate scratches his face .
This is what lunatics do when they think people on television are sending them personalised messages .
Where the rest of us see Vernon Kay hosting a gameshow , they see evidence of a conspiracy , and they scan every wink , nod , and eyebrow twitch for veiled threats or coded instructions .
Except the lunatics have an excuse : they 're lunatics .
Lunacy is what they do .
It 's in their job description .
News networks are supposed to offer news .
Instead they serve little but loops and chatter .
They may as well show footage of passing clouds and invite their pundits to speculate on which one looks most like a kettle and which one looks most like a pony and let the race for the presidency be settled by a bowling match .

Wake Up America Un-endorses Hillary Clinton
On March 14th I endorsed Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama for the Democrat nomination .
This was not easy for me to do , and I have felt dirty ever since .
After Obama ’s pastor ’s videos surfaced on the internet I could no longer route for him to beat Hillary .
I found his anti-American hatred to be troubling to say the least .
Naturally I was n’t endorsing Hillary for president , I was just urging Democrats to vote for her over Obama .
As I have written before , watching Hillary ’s downfall in the primaries is slightly erotic but the eroticism was tempered by the fact that someone who may be as anti-American as Obama ( judging by the man he considers his spiritual leader and great friend ) would be the beneficiary of a Hillary defeat .
Last week Hillary made the absurd claim that when her helicopter landed in Bosnia in 1996 she came under sniper fire .
This was immediately disproved by video of her and Chelsea hugging children and in no danger .
She was using this trip to Bosnia , and the sniper fire she encountered as proof that she is ready to lead on day one .
We all know that the Clinton ’s have make an art out of lying , this comes as no surprise .
But the sheer arrogance of this woman is astounding .
She lied about an experience that she knew was being filmed for public relation reasons and either thought she would n’t be caught or figured the American people were to stupid to care .
If she would lie about something as easy to disprove as something like this , what else would she be willing to lie about ?
Nothing that the former first lady says can be trusted .
The Clinton ’s will stop at nothing to regain the power they so desperately crave , including “ misspeaking ” about something so easily disproved as a trip we are supposed to believe qualifies her to be president .
I still ca n’t figure out exactly how this trip makes her qualified to be president .
I also ca n’t understand how she thinks we are so stupid to think that we would believe that the president of the United States of America would send her into a region that she claimed was as unstable as Bosnia if there was a threat of sniper fire .
We are to believe that Bill Clinton would send his wife to a place that was too dangerous for him to go personally .
And would also okay his daughter to visit if it was this unsafe ?
I can no longer endorse , no matter how flimsy my endorsement was , a woman who holds the intelligence of the American people so low .
It is with great pleasure that I now un-endorse Hillary Clinton for the Democrat nomination .
I feel cleaner already .
FOCUS ON WHITE SMOKERS FOCUS ON WHITE SMOKERS Scientists who discovered a genetic link to smoking addiction and lung cancer have calculated smokers ' cancer risk based on whether they have certain genetic variations .
The study only covered white people of European descent .
Studies of other populations will be done soon and may yield different results .
The study found that white smokers have a : 23 percent chance of getting lung cancer if they inherited these genetic differences from both parents .
23 percent chance of getting lung cancer if they inherited these genetic differences from both parents .
18 percent chance of lung cancer if they inherited the genetic differences from one parent .
14 percent chance of lung cancer without the genetic variations .
In general , people who have never smoked have less than a 1 % chance of getting lung cancer .
The scientists ' findings on non-smokers with these genetic variants are contradictory .
Researchers say they need to study a larger number of non-smokers .
Three independent research teams have found genetic variations that increase the risk of lung cancer , a finding that may help explain why some smokers develop the disease and others do n't .
People with one of the gene variants have a 30 % higher risk of lung cancer , and those with two have an 80 % higher risk , says Paul Brennan , lead author of one of the papers .
They were released today in Nature .
Another study , also in Nature , finds the same variations also make people more likely to get addicted to tobacco and smoke more .
The other reports do not strongly link the variations to smoking .
But the scientists agree the variations are located in an area that includes genes that make up the building blocks of nicotine receptors — docking stations that allow nicotine to latch onto cells .
Research shows nicotine can spur cells to reproduce without dying and can cause tissue to form new blood vessels , says Christopher Amos , the main author of a third paper published in the journal Nature Genetics .
Fewer than 20 % of smokers or former smokers develop lung cancer , Amost says .
It 's possible that genetic factors protect some people but put others at greater risk , says Amos of Houston 's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center .
Nora Volkow , director of the National Institute for Drug Abuse , says the studies could one day lead to ways to treat nicotine addiction .
The National Cancer Institute 's Stephen Chanock , who wrote an accompanying editorial in Nature , says the studies are still preliminary .
Researchers have not yet mapped the genes , for example .
Many other genetic variants probably are involved in a disease as complex as lung cancer , Channock says .
He also notes that smoking causes many deadly conditions , including heart attacks , strokes and emphysema .
" This is n't telling us who can get away with smoking and who can 't , " he says .

Researchers say there is a genetic underpinning that makes some more likely to become addicted to smoking .

Rated R. In Theaters .
Written and Directed by Joen & Ethan Coen .
Based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy .
Starring Josh Brolin , Javier Bardem , Tommy Lee Jones , Kelly MacDonald & Woody Harrelson .
.
No Country for Old Men is the type of film that cinéastes want so desperately to love that it ends up with more credit than it deserves .
Oftentimes people like a movie precisely because they want to like it so much , especially when there is a “ theme ” that implies a deeper meaning to the film .
It is a pet peeve of mine when someone dismisses criticism with a “ you just did n’t GET it ” type of attitude implying the intellectual superiority of their viewpoint , almost as if it is a badge of honor to share their viewpoint .
There is a definite elitist feel to some of those who have hailed the film , and specifically the controversial third act , which I will not detail here ( I will in the comments if anyone wants me to ) because it would definitely spoil it for those who have n’t seen it .
Needless to say , while I can appreciate an alternative narrative structure , or an unconventional ending , I felt like No Country ‘s final act derailed a potentially extraordinary film .
The film begins with Llewelyn Moss ( Josh Brolin ) hunting deer and stumbling upon a grisly crime scene and a briefcase full of money that the psychopathic Anton Chigurh ( Javier Bardem ) has been hired to track down .
Tommy Lee Jones is the sheriff on both of their trails , and to reveal more of the plot is somewhat unnecessary .
Both Brolin and Bardem give career - defining ( and award - worthy ) performances and I particularly liked Kelly MacDonald as Moss ’ wife in the few scenes she was in .
The film is very well - done with great acting , directing and cinematography , with the lack of a score and effective use of silence amping up the tension .
Then came the final act , which essentially ruined the film for me — I realize they were being faithful to their source material , but the kind of ruminating they aim for works better in literary form , film is obviously a more visceral medium and the end destroyed the tone and style of the first part of the movie .
Also , there was absolutely no indication of the type of movie it would become in the first two - thirds , and there is not skill in fooling a captive audience .
What bothered me more than this sort of “ fuck - you ” to the audience was that the unsatisfying ending was done in service of a theme that I thought was shallow and straight out of Philosophy 101 .
But therein lies the main problem with No Country For Old Men — this is not an ambiguous Blade Runner “ Is Deckert a replicant ? ” kind of debate , the ending is actually pretty straightforward , without much of an argument I can see over the filmmakers ’ intent .
In fact , the Coens kind of beat you over the head with the “ theme ” , which sort of undermines the “ you did n’t GET it ” argument .
I got it , but I did n’t like it , and I did n’t like that it sacrificed the brilliant first two acts to get there .
I maintain that they could have satisfied both camps — those who wanted a deeper meaning ( but not too deep … something that they could understand easily ) and those who wanted a kick - ass conventional ending — if they had set it up better from the start of the film .
There are other , less important flaws in the film , including the absolute waste of Woody Harrelson ’s character , who apparently plays a much more prominent role in the book .
In the film his character is just a distraction and while there is a great scene that he is involved in , the role his character plays does n’t end up making much sense .
There is also an out - of - place comic relief character ( Moss ’ mother - in - law ) , thrown in there as if to remind you that this was , in fact , a Coen brothers movie .
Ultimately and unfortunately , No Country For Old Men has to rank as one of the most disappointing films I ’ve ever seen , if only because of how great the first 2 /3rds are .
And goddamn , was it great — with one of the best standoff sequences I ’ve ever seen and some other tense , suspenseful , memorable scenes .
If the film had finished the way it started , it would definitely crack my all - time top 10 .
It ’s too bad that I ’ll remember the film for what it could have been rather than for what it was .
Grade : B

The recent earthquake that was felt across Israel was the result of the " homosexual activity practiced in the country " , Knesset Member Shlomo Benizri said Wednesday .
During a special Knesset session on Israel 's preparedness for the possibility of another earthquake hitting the region , the Shas member said " the Gemara refers to earthquakes as disasters , but you are searching only for the practical solutions how to prevent and repair .
" But I no of another way to prevent earthquakes ; the Gemara mentions a number of causes of earthquakes , one of which is homosexuality , which the Knesset legitimizes , " Benizri said .
An earthquake registering 5.3 on the Richter Scale was felt by residents across Israel at 12:36 pm Friday .
The trembling lasted for 19 seconds and shook structures in many major towns and cities .
Reports of shaking were received from Nahariya in the north down to Beersheba .
Magen David
Adom emergency services said there were no reports of injuries , but several people suffered from shock .
Last month fellow Shas member Nissim Ze'ev stirred controversy when he referred to the local gay movement as a " plague that could destroy Jewish Israel , " adding that it should be treated " just as the Health Ministry dealt with the bird flu epidemic . "
Mike Hammel , chairman of the Israeli Gay , Lesbian , Bisexual and Transgender Association commented on Benizri 's remarks saying " it is sad that a religious MK in Israel does n't think earthquakes are God-made .
" On the other hand , I suppose we should be flattered he attributes us with such magical powers , " he added .
" One must wonder why Shas MKs are so obsessed with the gay community … we can all recall the case of the American senator who fiercely spoke out against gays until it was found he himself was gay . "
File this under futuristic ( and perhaps a little scary ) :
In a step toward one day perhaps deciphering visions and dreams , new research unveils an algorithm that can translate the activity in the minds of humans .
Scientists from the University of California , Berkeley , report in Nature today that they have developed a method capable of decoding the patterns in visual areas of the brain to determine what someone has seen .
Needless to say , the potential implications for society are sweeping .
" This general visual decoder would have great scientific and practical use , " the researchers say .
" We could use the decoder to investigate differences in perception across people , to study covert mental processes such as attention , and perhaps even to access the visual content of purely mental phenomena such as dreams and imagery . "
The scientists say that previous attempts to extract " mental content from brain activity " only allowed them to decode a finite number of patterns .
Researchers would feed image to an individual ( or ask them to think about an object ) one at a time and then look for a corresponding brain activity pattern .
" You would need to know [ beforehand ] , for each thought you want to read out , what kind of pattern of activity goes with it , " says John - Dylan Haynes , a professor at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Berlin and the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences that was not affiliated with the new work .
" The advance brought forward here , " he continues , " is that they have set up a mathematical model that captures the properties of the visual part of the brain , " which can then be applied to previously unseen objects .
Researchers used functional magnetic resonance images ( fMRIs ) to record activity in the visual cortices of a pair of volunteers ( two of the study 's co-authors ) while they viewed a series of images .
They examined the brain by dividing the regions into voxels ( volumetric units , or 3 - D pixels ) and noting the part of the picture to which each section responded .
For instance , one voxel , or slice , might respond in a certain pattern to , say , colors in the upper left - hand corner of the photo , whereas another voxel would be set off by something in a different portion of the picture .
Haynes says the team could " go back and infer what the image was that a person was seeing " by monitoring the activity in each brain section and deciphering what sort of information would most likely be found in the corresponding part of the visual field , or photograph .
When the volunteers scanned a new set of 120 images — depicting everything from people to houses to animals to fruit and other objects — the computer program correctly identified what they were looking at up to 92 percent of the time ; when the image pool was upped to 1,000 , the algorithm was successful 80 percent of the time .
Naturally , its accuracy decreased as the number of possible pictures grew , but even at a quantity 100 times greater than the number of images indexed on the Internet by Google , according to the scientists , the model would be successful greater than 10 percent of the time .
( This far exceeds the success rate of random guessing . )
" This indicates , " the researchers wrote , " that fMRI signals contain a considerable amount of stimulus information and that this information can be successfully decoded in practice . "
Haynes says the method is limited to deciphering information that can be mapped out in space , such as sensory inputs ( where a sound is coming from ) or motor function ( what action one 's arm has performed ) .
The challenge , he says , is that it cannot " be easily applied to cases where you do n't have a clear mathematical model , " such as memories , intentions and emotions .
" High - level thoughts would be a bit tricky to get a hold of without such a mathematical model , " he adds .
So , you can keep that tinfoil helmet in your closet for now .
These algorithms still can't read our innermost thoughts — at least not yet .

Who I Am My name is Tom Locke .
I 'm not poor ; I 'm not rich .
I 'm just an average guy .
In fact , who I am is actually irrelevant to this experiment .
I just figured I 'd introduce myself for the sake of formality .
How This Started I was sitting around one day , skimming through a pile of bills that I needed to pay .
I looked over at a new , unopened roll of stamps that I had sitting in front of me , and I thought to myself , " $ 39 ... for a roll of stamps ?
Geez ...
You can't get much for $ 39 nowadays .
Or can you ...? "
The Idea
The way I looked at it , if I took $ 39 and went to buy groceries , I would n't be able to get all that much .
On the flipside , if I took $ 39 to a casino and lost it all , I would n't be all that upset .
With that said , I decided I was going to try something — I was going to take my roll of stamps and send 100 letters to 100 different companies , asking for free stuff .
I figured that I could n't do any worse than blowing the $ 39 at a casino , and who knows ... maybe a few of these places would actually send me something good .
My Initial Goal
My initial goal was a little different than what I actually ended up doing .
When I started this experiment , I 'd planned on walking around my house , grabbing various products ( 100 total ) , and pulling the mailing address off of each one .
Easy , no ?
No .
This proved to be way more difficult than I 'd anticipated .
First off , most of the products I picked up had the company 's city , state , and zip code on them , but no actual address .
When I was lucky enough to find a product with an address on it , it ended up being an address I already had — 90 % of the products in my bathroom were made by either Colgate - Palmolive or Procter & Gamble , and most of the stuff in my kitchen was made by Kraft , Nestle , or Hershey .
It became obvious pretty early that finding 100 products around my house with 100 different addresses was n't going to be as easy as I thought it was going to be .
I needed to change my plan a bit ...
My Modified Goal
By about the " 60 address " mark , I fell into a slump .
I had exhausted every product in my house .
I was amazed at how many different products were made by only a small handful of companies .
I realized that if I wanted to get 100 company addresses , I was going to have to think outside of my house .
So , I broadened my scope and starting pulling addresses of other companies — fast food joints , hotels , car rental companies , auto manufacturers ... that sort of stuff .
I figured , " Hey , a freebie 's a freebie . "
I 'm not a fast food lover , but this experiment was less about getting free stuff and more about seeing which companies would actually send me free stuff .
The Finished Product About ten hours ( over the course of two days ) and exactly two bloodshot eyes later , it was complete .
I had 100 letters to 100 different companies — stuffed , sealed , stamped , and ready to go .
I put all 100 letters into the mail on Friday , February 24 , 2006 at 9 AM .
Now all that was left to do was sit back and wait for a response ( or two ? )
Random Conclusions
Once I had all 100 letters , I reviewed my work and came to a few random conclusions : A surprising number of companies ( mostly big companies ) have no mention of their company address anywhere — not on their products , not on their websites , nowhere ...
I guess big companies do n't use snail mail these days .
Of the products which did have company addresses on them , most were either products from small companies — or pet products .
Almost every bag of dog treats that I looked at had a company address on it , whereas not one human snack product that I looked at did ...
I guess they 're not afraid of dogs writing in and complaining to them .
The majority of " cosmetic " products ( soaps , detergents , toothpastes , cosmetics , cleaning products , etc. ) that I looked at were made by one of only three or four companies .
I plan to start using shampoo as mouthwash and shaving cream , being that they all come from the same general place .
Some company addresses were so difficult to find , it almost seemed intentional .
In a few cases , I had to resort to a consumer advocacy site like my3cents.com or a site like CNN Money to find a company address .
The List
It was at about this point when I decided that it would be fun to put this experiment online for others to check out .
Below , you 'll find all 100 actual letters that I sent out to the 100 different companies I 'd selected .
You 'll notice that I " tested the waters " a bit in some of the letters — some of them are simple and to the point , while others are way more off - the - wall .
I think as I went along , I started to get a little more " ballsy " , and I started to have more fun writing the letters .
I 'm curious to find out which " style " of letter does better , in terms of actually bringing in free product .
As any responses or free product come in , this list will be updated .

A free jar of Carmex Dear Sir or Madam :

Either way , I love it .
I slather virtually half of my face with it prior to bed each night ( I do n't wear it during the day , because I do n't like feeling the least bit greasy ) .
Anyway , I just wanted to tell you that I love Carmex .
I once forgot to bring my Carmex with me on business trip , and I was stuck buying an over - priced ChapStick in a hotel lobby .

Thanks in advance ,
Tom Locke , Carmex enthusiast Gillette ( # 14 ) Razors No Dear Sir or Madam :

Mach 2 , Mach 3 , Turbo , Sensor , Sensor XL , the list goes on and on .
Can you send me a free sample of each type of razor you produce ?
If that 's not feasible , perhaps you can send me what you personally consider the best Gilette razor ?
Right now , I shave my face with my wife 's brand of leg razors .
You know , those " 50 for a dollar " pink junk things that only remove hair as a side effect of removing a layer of your skin with it .
Those razors are n't very good .
Thanks for your help ,
Tom Locke , shaving enthusiast Safeway ( #15 ) Wholesale grocer ( Costco ) OOPS !
Kindly told me that I wrote to the wrong company Dear Sir or Madam :
A while back , I purchased a two - pack of frozen vegetable lasagna from Costco .

During my recent trip back to Costco , I found that no vegetable lasagnas were in stock , and nobody had information as to when they 'd return .
Would you please send me a tray of this vegetable lasagna ?
If you 're leery about sending a frozen lasagna through the mail , I understand .
Costco also has a bag of dried Shitake mushrooms that I love .
I 'll take some of those , instead .
I used them in a homemade mushroom bisque .
It was heavenly .

I love the roast chicken breast .
Can I get some freebies ?

I usually get that chicken corn chowder soup , a mini chocolate bundt cake , and a bottle of water to finish the meal .
Your food quite simply rocks .

Whatever you got , I 'll take !
Thanks well in advance ,
Tom Locke , health and wellness enthusiast Biore ( # 24 ) Nose strips REJECTED !

I love trying out new products !

A " minty fresh " dog chew toy Dear Sir or Madam :
My dog ( a random mutt ) loves your " Healthy Edibles " bones .
I wanted to name the dog " Bonecrusher " , but my wife ended up naming him " Rudy Huxtable " .
What a stupid name for a dog .
Anyway , your bones are the only thing that stops this dog from molesting my leg while I 'm working on the computer .

My dog – and my leg – would greatly appreciate it !

I absolutely love your " chicken gouda " sausages .
I buy the big packs from Costco , and I eat them daily .
I usually cook up two fried eggs , and two sausages .

Better yet , my dog , Dirty Nelly ( a shar - pei ) , is a fussy , fussy eater , and he loves your sausages !
Any chance of getting a free sample or something ?

Whatever you can do would be most appreciated !
Thanks well in advance ,

Three $ 1 gift certificates Dear Sir or Madam :
With my birthday rapidly approaching ( in August ) , I was wondering if you'd be so kind as to send me a coupon for a free Dairy Queen treat .

Two coupons for Nestle candy Dear Sir or Madam :
I love Nestle , and I love free stuff , so I thought writing this letter was the perfect idea .

With that said , please send me samples of other interesting products – especially those which you think may surprise me when I learn that they are made by Nestle .
And I 'm sorry , but I can't find out how to make that mark over the " e " , so I just have to say " Nestle " .
Thank you well in advance ,

Three $ 1 coupons Dear Sir or Madam :
My wife watches so much television , I sometimes forget that she 's not physically and permanently attached to my couch .
Anyway .
It came to my attention yesterday that I own eleven – yes eleven – remote controls .
Absurd , I know .
I was wondering if you'd be able to help me , by sending me some free batteries – AA in size .
If I can't un - glue my wife from the television , at least maybe I can cut down on the cost of keeping her around by getting a few free batteries to keep the eleven remote controls operative .

Told me " no " — sent me chili recipes instead Dear Sir or Madam :

Tom Locke , gadget enthusiast Responses & Free Stuff
All 100 letters were put in the mail on Friday , February 24 , 2006 at 9 AM .
On Thursday , March 2 , 2006 , the free stuff started rolling in .
Check the updates section to see what 's come in thus far .
My Personal Favorites
Of the 100 letters , it 's hard to pick a single favorite , but I 'd say my top five ( or six ) would be # 13 ( Carmex ) , # 25 ( Nylabone ) , # 32 ( PowerBar ) , # 35 ( Energizer ) , # 71 ( Long John Silver 's ) , and # 74 ( Kentucky Fried Chicken ) .
Maybe the weirdness alone of those letters will " win " me some freebies ...
Getting Technical
If you want to get technical , this experiment actually cost more than $ 39 .
The roll of stamps alone was $ 39 .
The envelopes cost $ 6 or $ 7 , because I splurged and used the fancy , self - adhesive kind , to avoid gluing my tongue to the inside of my mouth ( as would have happened if I had licked 100 of the cheap kind of envelopes ) .
Throw in 100 sheets of cheap , white paper and the cost of the domain name , and you 're looking at the $ 52 experiment .
Since the stamps were still the most expensive part of the equation , however , I opted to call this the $ 39 Experiment .
Contacting Me
If you 've done something similar and want to tell me about it , or if you just want to tell me what a fat , lazy slob / bum / mooch I am , feel free to e-mail me at tom@the39dollarexperiment.com .
( Ed : Tom is getting older , fatter , and lazier and as such is no longer accepting email ) .
If you have anything interesting to say , I 'll add it to a " comments " section of the site — once I add one , of course .
The Government is looking at a law change requiring telcos to record and store text messages so Police can access them with a warrant .
I have some nervousness over this .
It is one thing to have a law which requires telcos to record the content of text messages * after they receive a search warrant targetted at a particular individual .
But this is about having the telcos store every single text message we send or receive , so it can then be accessed .
The precedent this would set is that ISPs should also keep a copy of every e-mail message you ever send or receive , in case the Police should ever want it .
And then how about also requiring them to keep track of every website you have ever visited .
Telcos and ISPs should co-operate with the Police * after * a warrant has been served requiring interception or recording of data which a Judge / JP has authorised as necessary for a criminal investigation .
But that is very different to having them forced to store personal communications on every NZer , so that law enforcement authorities can access them at some later date if they wish .
Why not also have the teclso record every voice call , just in case they are also needed ?

With all our problems down here on Earth most people do n’t think about space junk very often , but there is more of it to think about than most people realize .
An estimate 50,000 pieces exist that are large enough to do significant damage on collision with an operational space craft or satellite .
Over 90 % of the stuff we currently have in space is useless trash – with less than 10 % being operational / useful .
Some pretty strange and interesting things have been lost in space and some of it has turned back up on Earth .
A cattle rancher in Australia came upon a giant twisted ball of metal mesh in his backyard – not a common site far out in the flat deserted backwaters Down Under .
It was concluded that this space scrap likely fell from a rocket launched half a world away at Cape Canaveral , Florida .
While most of this happens out of the public eye and has to be guessed at after the fact , you can actually watch an astronaut losing her camera in the video above .
So what are your chances of being hit by space chunk ?
As of right now , about one in six billion : only one woman on the planet has been knowingly hit by a piece of space debris .
Still , space junk has very nearly caused some very serious problems .
In 1991 a space shuttle had to change course to avoid large debris and even an American commercial plane flight had to detour around an intentionally junked piece of a Russian spy satellite in 2006 .
Vanguard I , the fourth satellite launched and the first one that was solar - powered , is the largest and oldest significant piece of space junk still orbiting the planet .
Other prominent space junk includes lost gloves , wrenches , tooth brushes and cameras that will likely never be recovered ( but would probably be worth quite a bit to collectors ! ) .
So can anything be done about this dangerous orbital debris ?
While there is no real ‘ environmental ’ impact on Earth per say plans to clean up this trash for safety reasons have been explored , including ‘ sweeping ’ the junk into controlled areas and then intentionally sending it back to burn up in orbit .
So , while this is n’t an issue of sustainability in any traditional sense it still is an environmental problem that deserves to be dealt with .
We just featured the largest wind turbine in the world , now here ’s something at the opposite end of the spectrum : a household wind turbine .
In the last few years , we ’ve seen a lot of mini - wind turbines that have n’t turned out to be very useful .
But the Windspire turbine from Mariah Power sounds interesting .
The Windspire has a propeller - free vertical - axis design , and is expected to produce about 1800 kilowatt hours per year in 11 mph average wind conditions .
That amount of wind power is roughly 25 % of a typical household ’s energy ( or much more if you are particularly energy efficient ) .
The Windspire is 30 feet tall with a two foot radius , sized below typical residential zoning restrictions .
Guidelines for installation sites are generally half an acre of land and relatively windy locations .
The Winspire has just passed the ETL safety certification , which means it ’s ready to go to market .
It is expected to be released this spring , and priced at $ 3,995 .
Windspire features a fully integrated , plug ‘n produce design , including a high efficiency generator , integrated inverter , and wireless performance monitor .
The integrated design allows for simple installation ( estimated to cost around $ 1,000 ) .
It incorporates a slow speed giromill rotor for virtually silent operation and improved safety and durability .
It connects to the household power supply , offsetting electricity use and at times running the electricity meter backwards .
You can also get this wind turbine painted any color you like , to match the surroundings , to stand out as piece of functional art .
It has become obvious that the Bush administration will never come clean about any of the injustices it has committed .
It has fought tooth and nail to avoid the release of information that rightfully belongs to the American public , ignoring legitimate Freedom of Information requests , and even going so far as to classify information that had already been openly available for years .
It is equally apparent that the Justice Department has little will and no intention of conducting thorough , unbiased investigations into any of the myriad violations of law by the executive branch .
That may change in 2009 , when Mr. Bush abandons the rotted , sinking ship of his ruinous presidency to slink back in shame to his Crawford ranch .
But I do n't want to wait that long .
Justice delayed is justice denied
While I have no doubt that new revelations of wrongdoing will be found when the next president embarks on the daunting task of rebuilding the democratic republic that Bush has done his level best to destroy with his doctrine of " Shock - and - Awe , " and the recently revealed Cheney Doctrine of " So ? " , I have little faith that a former president will be held to account for his crimes by a citizenry which just wants to be rid of him .
A majority of Americans now say they want the administration to answer for its illegality , but when the nightmare is finally over , most of us have a natural tendency to want only to forget the nightmare .
But forgetting would be the worst thing we could do .
To forget would be to effectively condone , which would set a terrible precedent for which our children and grandchildren would most likely come to despise us .
And a new president , still riding the wave of exultation after a hard - fought victory , might suddenly have feelings of magnanimity and graciousness .
Even if the public cried out in anger for justice , a president flush with brand new power might falsely feel himself or herself merciful in pardoning the past wrong - doings of a used - up politician , already gone out to pasture to cut brush where he can do no more harm -- as Ford did with Nixon .
But there can be little doubt that the pardoning of Richard Nixon has largely contributed to our current problems in dealing with a Chief Executive who believes himself to be all - powerful and above the law .
We must set an example now if we hope to avoid making kings and dictators of future presidents .
If the wheels of justice are in motion before Bush leaves office , it would be much more difficult for a new president to pardon his crimes .
When you want something done right ...
So what do good , patriotic Americans do when their Justice Department , Congress , and Judiciary will not uphold their oaths to defend the Constitution and preserve their rights ?
They do it themselves .
As the crimes of this presidency are numerous and widespread , there are hundreds of people out there who know just what those crimes are .
Some of them have complied with illegal orders out of fear , or out of a sense that if the President of the United States says something is " necessary , " it must be the right thing for the country .
After all , he 's the president , right ?
Many of those folks have come to the realization that this particular president has no concept of right and wrong , nor any clue about what is best for the nation .
Those are the people I want to speak to .
The only way to guarantee justice is for you to speak up and expose so much evidence that the Justice Dept. can not ignore it .
Many of you are probably reluctant to come forward .
You think that we , your brothers and sisters , wo n't understand , that we will condemn you and hate you .
Or you might be afraid of the government , that if you speak out you will be harassed , fired , prosecuted or worse .
But if you expose a serious crime , you need not fear the ire of your fellow citizens .
We will embrace you , and thank you for doing one of the most moral , patriotic things you could ever do for your country .
If you have any doubt of that , look to the examples of Jim Comey and Jack Goldsmith .
Mr. Comey , as acting Attorney General , took a stand to stop a program of surveillance so invasive and illegal that several Justice Department officials and employees threatened to quit if the President continued it .
Mr. Goldsmith , as the new head of the Office of Legal Counsel , discovered secret legal opinions by his predecessor that were so outrageously illegal that he rescinded them , writing new opinions that infuriated the administration and exposed such atrocities as John Yoo 's infamous " Torture Memo , " which advised that detainees could be abused in whatever depraved way the President desired , as long as it did n't cause organ failure or death .
Neither Mr. Comey nor Mr. Goldsmith was ridiculed or condemned by the public when their stories came out .
They were hailed as heroes and champions of the rule of law .
They were viewed as courageous patriots who would not allow an overreaching president to completely enslave and torture people .
They were praised by representatives and senators .
And while I applaud their actions , truth be told , they did n't do anything extraordinary -- they only did their duty as Americans .
They only told the truth .
That is all I ask of you .
Some of you are employed by the government , from simple staffers to high - level appointees .
Some of you are in the military or intelligence agencies .
Some of you are private citizens or contract employees who have done work for the government , such as Mark Klein , the AT&T technician of 22 years who revealed the existence of a special room in which whole trunk lines of fiber - optic cables carrying all foreign and domestic telephone and data communications were intercepted and collected for illegal government eavesdropping .
Evidence of serious crimes cannot be classified for the purpose of concealing them
You may have knowledge of information that the government has determined to be " classified . "
As we all have learned , much " classified " information should never have been classified in the first place .
Much of it is simply embarrassing , and still more is kept secret only to hide lawbreaking .
Americans need to know a few things about " classified " information .
Classification is only proper when it is absolutely necessary for the national security of the United States .
It is never proper to classify information that is only embarrassing .
And it is illegal to classify information for the purpose of concealing a crime .
Let me try to put this in perspective .
Many German citizens after WWII were said to have been unaware of Hitler 's state - sanctioned crimes against humanity .
Hitler kept their existence relatively secret , and there is no doubt the information was officially " classified " on the grounds that public knowledge could endanger national security .
Would anyone today think it acceptable to keep such a secret only because of a false claim that its revelation would jeopardize security ?
The U.S. certainly did n't think so when we tried and hanged Nazi officers who never personally committed those crimes , but had knowledge of them and chose to keep them secret .
We convicted them under a legal concept known as " command responsibility . "

NEW YORK — Steve Tarpin can bake a graham cracker crust in his sleep , but explaining why the price for his Key lime pies went from $ 20 to $ 25 required mastering a thornier topic : global economics .
He recently wrote a letter to his customers and posted it near the cash register listing the factors – dairy prices driven higher by conglomerates buying up milk supplies , heat waves in Europe and California , demand from emerging markets and the weak dollar .
The owner of Steve ’s Authentic Key Lime Pies in Brooklyn said he did n’t want customers thinking he was “ jacking up prices because I have a unique product . ”
“ I have to justify it , ” he said .
The U.S. is wrestling with the worst food inflation in 17 years , and analysts expect new data due on Wednesday to show it ’s getting worse .
That ’s putting the squeeze on poor families and forcing bakeries , bagel shops and delis to explain price increases to their customers .
U.S. food prices rose 4 percent in 2007 , compared with an average 2.5 percent annual rise for the last 15 years , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
And the agency says 2008 could be worse , with a rise of as much as 4.5 percent .
Higher prices for food and energy are again expected to play a leading role in pushing the government ’s consumer price index higher for March .
Analysts are forecasting that Wednesday ’s Department of Labor report will show the Consumer Price Index rose at a 4 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year , up from last year ’s overall rise of 2.8 percent .
For the U.S. poor , any increase in food costs sets up an either - or equation : Give something up to pay for food .
“ I was talking to people who make $ 9 an hour , talking about how they might save $ 5 a week , ” said Kathleen DiChiara , president and CEO of the Community FoodBank of New Jersey .
“ They really felt they could n’t .
That was before .
Now , they have to . ”
For some , that means adding an extra cup of water to their soup , watering down their milk , or giving their children soda because it ’s cheaper than milk , DiChiara said .
U.S. households still spend a smaller chunk of their expenses for foods than in any other country – 7.2 percent in 2006 , according to the USDA .
By contrast , the figure was 22 percent in Poland and more than 40 percent in Egypt and Vietnam .
In Bangladesh , economists estimate 30 million of the country ’s 150 million people could be going hungry .
Haiti ’s prime minister was ousted over the weekend following food riots there .
Still , the higher U.S. prices seem eye - popping after years of low inflation .
Eggs cost 25 percent more in February than they did a year ago , according to the USDA .
Milk and other dairy products jumped 13 percent , chicken and other poultry nearly 7 percent .
USDA economist Ephraim Leibtag explained the jumps in a recent presentation to the Food Marketing Institute , starting with the factors everyone knows about : sharply higher commodity costs for wheat , corn , soybeans and milk , plus higher energy and transportation costs .
The other reasons are more complex .
Rapid economic growth in China and India has increased demand for meat there , and exports of U.S. products , such as corn , have set records as the weak dollar has made them cheaper .
That ’s lowered the supply of corn available for sale in the U.S. , raising prices here .
Ethanol production has also diverted corn from dinner tables and into fuel tanks .
Soybean prices have gone up as farmers switched more of their acreage to corn .
Drought in Australia has even affected the price of bread , as it led to tighter global wheat supplies .
The jump has left people in the food business to do their own explaining .
Twin Cafe Caterers in lower Manhattan posted a letter on its deli cooler : “ Due to the huge increase of the gas , the electricity , the water and all the other utilities , we had to raise the prices a little bit . ”
It went on to say that all its food prices have risen , too .
Wonder Bagels , in Jersey City , N.J. , posted a letter from its wheat supplier , A. Oliveri & Sons , saying the recent situation was unprecedented .
“ The major mills across the country are using words like ‘ rationing ’ and ‘ shortages ’ if things continue , ” it said .
“ We will sweat out the summer together , hoping there will be some flour left to purchase at any price . ”
The letter called for an immediate halt to exports and a change in farm policy , “ stop paying farmers NOT to grow crops . ”
A new farm bill , stalled in Congress , would expand farm subsidies if it passes , however .
For some Americans , the resulting increases might be barely perceptible .
The Cheesecake Factory raised prices by 1.5 percent at the end of February , Applebee ’s by 3 percent .
But for the poorest U.S. families , the higher costs may mean going hungry .
A family of four is eligible for a maximum $ 542 a month in food stamps , which never lasted the whole month before , Food Bank of New Jersey ’s DiChiara said .
“ Now food stamps go fewer and fewer days of the month , ” she said .
The Food Bank recently got a letter of its own from a key vendor .
Its grim message : Sorry , but the prices they charge the Food Bank would be increasing 20 percent , due to food inflation .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
You know things are very very bad on Wall Street when a guy like Henry Paulson -- Treasury secretary , solid Republican , and former Goldman Sachs CEO -- joins the crowd calling for more regulation over the financial markets .
Paulson spared no one in his criticism Thursday of the excesses of deregulation that has now created the worst global financial crisis in a generation , threatening the health of the U.S. economy , the savings of millions of Americans , and the survival of some of the biggest financial institutions in the world .

Superdelegates take note :
McCain would prefer to go up against Clinton in the general election , insiders reveal .
He has instructed his campaign staff to “ chill out ” on countering Hillary Clinton ’s torrent of claims and promises as primary voting comes to an end over the next 6 weeks .
McCain made the tactical decision to downplay Clinton ’s tale of Bosnia sniper fire , leaving some McCain staffers frustrated and perplexed .
Instead , the critical focus has been on Barack Obama .
McCain ’s official website features 14 press releases taking on Obama since the first of the year , only 3 for the former first lady .
So who will be the first in the blogoshphere to prove they can lick their elbow with their tongue ?
C’mon , you know you want to see if you can do it .
I am about 3 tongues short of reaching my elbow so I am not one of the chosen few .
My Cousin who is 12 years old can lick his elbow with his tongue so apparently this calls for some intensive research on my part as to whether a human being can physically do this since he is obviously human .
According to the Govt .-
It is impossible -
According to my own extensive research you in fact CAN do it if you are double jointed in your shoulder and your neck .
Supposedly only one in a million can do it !
Below are some people who show you they can do it .
I am waiting for a picture of my cousin doing it and he has witnesses who watched him do it .

Dan Froomkin observes that Bernard Lewis " hinted in an Aug. 8 , 2006 , Wall Street Journal op - ed that Ahmadinejad might be planning a nuclear attack on Israel just two weeks later , on the date in the Islamic calendar when the Prophet Muhammad made his mystical journey to Jerusalem . "
But so what ?
There 's a lot of garbage printed in the WSJ opinion pages .
Well , it just so happens that Vice President Dick Cheney went on Hugh Hewitt 's radio show last week and explained that this kind of forecasting is guiding his approach to Iran policy :
I mean , if I look at what [ Ahmadenijad 's ] beliefs supposedly are , the allegation that the return of the 12th Imam is something to be much desired , and that the best contribution that a man can make is to die a martyr facilitating that return , and all that goes with it , I always think of Bernard Lewis , who has said that mutual assured destruction during the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviets meant peace and stability and deterrence .
But mutual assured destruction in the hands of Ahmadinejad may just be an incentive .
Matt Duss notes that there are some other respects in which Lewis ' foreign policy advice seems to have gone awry , but at a minimum one would think that this particular prediction would have caused some to doubt the wisdom of relying on his forecasting of the role Shi'a mysticism plays in Iranian foreign policy .
The specifics of Lewis aside , I always find it odd that hawks prefer to rely on this kind of a priori analysis of likely Iranian behavior when the regime in question came into being over two decades ago and has never previously shown any proclivity for deliberately seeking its own destruction .

Did John McCain travel all the way to Selma , Alabama , today so he could bask in the glory of a civil rights hero with whom he has no connection and who endorsed Barack Obama ?
Apparently so .
As I noted elsewhere :
Speaking at the site of a critical civil rights clash , McCain described in detail that turning point in America ’s history : Forty - three years ago , an army of more than five hundred marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge ; an army that brought with them no weapons , which intended no destruction ; that sought to conquer no people or land .
He went on to cite , in much detail , the heroic actions of John Lewis , who led that protest and who today is a Democratic congressman supporting Obama :
At the head of the column , dressed in a dark suit , white shirt , tie and tan raincoat , marched a twenty - five year old son of Alabama sharecroppers , John Lewis .
They had planned to march from Selma to Montgomery , but they knew they would never reach there …..
On the other side of the bridge , row upon row of state troopers in blue uniforms and white helmets , many on horseback , prepared to charge and stop with violence the peaceful army , intent only on conquering injustice .
John Lewis took the first blow , a baton thrust to the stomach that shoved him back on the marchers behind him .
He took the second blow , too , a hard swung club to his head , leaving a permanent scar where it struck .
Blood poured from the wound , darkening his raincoat .
He tried to struggle to his feet , and then collapsed unconscious , his skull fractured .
McCain went on to note that millions of Americans “ watched brave John Lewis fall . ”
He referred to Lewis and his comrades as “ the best kind of patriots . ”
He quoted Lewis .
( “ When I care about something , I ’m prepared to take the long , hard road . ” )
He cited Lewis ’ adherence to Martin Luther King Jr. ’s concept of the “ beloved community . ”
McCain said all this to make a political point : he would be “ traveling to places in America that are n’t enjoying the prosperity many other parts of America enjoy ” and would be listening to those Americans .
You know , he would be a compassionate conservative .
It was odd : McCain wrapping himself in the bloody shirt of John Lewis .
Especially since McCain is hardly recognized as a leader in the fight for civil rights .
In fact , in 1983 , he was one of 77 Republican House members to vote against the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday .
This was more a speech about John Lewis than John McCain .
And Lewis is a high - profile Obama supporter .
Lewis was surprised by the speech .
But he took the high road , issuing a statement that he was “ gratified that Sen .
John McCain would take the opportunity to recognize what happened 43 years ago on the Edmund Pettus Bridge .
Bloody Sunday was a turning point in the struggle for voting rights and equal justice in America . ”
So the obvious point has to be left to others to state : McCain was expropriating someone else ’s heroism .
During his talk , McCain hailed “ free markets ” and small government , neglecting to mention that the goal of Lewis ’ nonviolent army in Selma was to enhance the power of the federal government so it could end racial discrimination .
McCain also said that as part of his campaign he would be “ going to places where they are still fighting for change ; to make us a better country .
I am going to meet and learn from patriots . ”
Maybe he can learn from these encounters that he ought to be selling his own efforts to bolster civil rights and social justice in the United States ( if he has any to boast of ) , not exploiting those of others .
DIGG THIS
Recently , photographic portraits of nine World War I vets ( all 105 or older when taken ) were unveiled at a Pentagon ceremony .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates then noted that , when it comes to their war , “ There is no big memorial on the National Mall .
Hollywood has not turned its gaze in this direction for decades . ”
If true , that is little short of a miracle — as Nick Turse indicates below .
Hollywood has n’t been able to keep its gaze off either war or the Pentagon since “ the war to end all wars ” began in 1914 ( and the favor has long been returned ) .
In fact , Hollywood and the Pentagon have been in an intricate dance of support and cross-promotion for almost a century , from a time when the Department of Defense was still quaintly — if more accurately — known as the War Department .
Today , however , without leaving Hollywood behind , the Pentagon has branched out into the larger universe of entertainment .
Video games , TV , NASCAR racing , social networking , professional bull riding , toys , professional wrestling , you name it and the military - entertainment complex has a hand in it — and do n’t forget about the Pentagon ’s links to Starbucks , Apple Computer , Oakley sunglasses , and well , gosh … in one way or another , directly or indirectly , just about everything that looks civilian in ( or out of ) your house .
In fact , there ’s a remarkable new book that looks into all of this , while doing the best job around of updating the old military - industrial complex , a term whose hard - edged simplicity an ever - expanding Pentagon long ago left in the dust .
Whatever you do , do n’t miss Nick Turse ’s The Complex : How the Military Invades Our Everyday Lives .
It ’s an eye - opener on the degree to which we are , without realizing it , a militarized society ; it is , as well , the latest spin - off book from Tomdispatch.com , where some of its parts were initially tested out .
But let me just quote Chalmers Johnson on The Complex : “ Americans who still think they can free themselves from the clutches of the military - industrial complex need to read this book .
The gimmicks the Pentagon uses to deceive , entrap , and enlist gullible 18 to 24 year olds make signing up anything but voluntary .
Nick Turse has produced a brilliant expos of the Pentagon ’s pervasive influence in our lives . ”
In honor of its publication , I ’m posting an adaptation of one small section of The Complex , its only Pentagon - themed “ game . ”
Amid all the weaponry , military bases , and contractors , it ’s certainly one of the book ’s lighter moments .
In it , Turse shows that just about every actor to appear on screen from Charlie Chaplin ’s brother Syd to Dakota Fanning and Oscar - winner Gwyneth Paltrow can be linked to the Pentagon in one way or another .
Oh , and by the way , you can even check out a brief Tomdispatch video interview I did with Turse ( with , as you ’ll notice , a silent “ Sigmund Freud ” looking on ) by clicking here .
It was produced by freelance documentary filmmaker Brett Story , a new staff addition to Tomdispatch .
Expect more Turse in the near future .

Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon , Pentagon - Style
By Nick Turse
In the late 1990s , Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon — a game in which the goal was to connect the actor Kevin Bacon to any other actor , living or dead , through films or television shows in no more than six steps — became something of a phenomenon .
Spread via the Internet ( before becoming a board game and a book ) , Six Degrees has taken its place in America ’s pop culture pantheon among favorite late - night drunken pursuits .
Here is a new variant of the game :
The goal is to connect Kevin Bacon to the Pentagon .
A commonsense approach would be to consider Bacon ’s military roles — the ROTC cadet in his first feature film , the 1978 comedy classic Animal House , for example , or the Marine Corps prosecutor , Captain Jack Ross , in the 1992 film A Few Good Men .
But the game is n’t as easy as it looks .
Animal House was hardly a pro-military project and the Department of Defense actually denied A Few Good Men access to its facilities .
The script , the Pentagon claimed , reinforced “ the conclusion that not only is criminal harassment a commonplace and accepted practice within the Marine Corps , but that it requires a sister military service to uncover the wrongdoings … ”
A spokesman for the film understood why : “ It is certainly not a recruiting film , ” he commented .
So does that mean game over ?
Perish the thought .
In reality , there are no degrees of separation between Bacon and the Pentagon because the actor began his career in a “ recruiting film ” — a real one .
As Bacon recalled : “ After the [ Vietnam ] war was over in [ 19]75 , I was already thinking about becoming an actor and I got sent out on this Army recruiting film .
It was a soft - sell kind of thing .
I was a guy getting out of high school who did n’t know what he wanted to do with his life , so I took the gig .
It was my very first paying acting job . ”
As it happens , however , the military puts Bacon to shame when it comes to connections in Tinseltown .
The Pentagon might , in fact , be thought of as the ultimate Hollywood insider — a direct result of the ever - expanding military - corporate complex or “ The Complex ” as I call it in my new book , The Complex : How the Military Invades Our Everyday Lives .
So let ’s play a new version of the game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon , with the military standing in for Bacon .
The object is to follow a few of the thousands of linkages and connections between Hollywood and the military that have made the Department of Defense a genuine legend of the silver screen , from the Silent Era to the ramped - up military - movie complex of today , ending with — who else ? — Kevin Bacon .
Just sit back with a big bucket of popcorn and enjoy the show …
Thirty Seconds Over Hollywood
Let ’s go back to 1915 , when , in response to a request for assistance , U.S. Secretary of War John Weeks ordered the army to provide every reasonable courtesy to D. W. Griffith ’s pro—Ku Klux Klan epic Birth of a Nation .
The Army came through with more than 1,000 cavalry troops and a military band .
The film featured George Beranger , who would go on to star with Humphrey Bogart and Glen Cavender in San Quentin ( 1937 ) — in which a former Army officer is hired to impose military discipline on the infamous prison .
Cavender had also appeared alongside actor / director Syd Chaplin , Charlie ’s brother , in A Submarine Pirate ( 1915 ) , for which the Navy provided a submarine , a gunboat , and the use of the San Diego Navy Yard .
( The film was even approved to be shown in Navy recruiting stations . )
Syd Chaplin later starred in the non-military A Little Bit of Fluff ( 1928 ) with Edmund Breon , who appeared in the 1930 World War I aviation epic The Dawn Patrol .
That film was written by John Monk Saunders , who penned another World War I drama , Wings ( 1927 ) , featuring Gary Cooper .
Wings received major support from the War Department ( back in the days before it was called the Defense Department ) and won the first Academy Award for Best Picture .
Gary Cooper provides the link to Sergeant York , a 1941 film directed by World War I Army Air Corps veteran ( and The Dawn Patrol director ) Howard Hawks that was denounced by many as war - mongering propaganda .
Hawks went on to direct actor Ray Montgomery in Air Force ( 1943 ) , a Warner Brothers ’ film about a bomber crew serving in the Pacific , which received assistance from the Army Air Corps .
In fact , the War Department even fast - tracked a review of the script because the film was deemed “ a special Air Corps recruiting job . ”
That same year , Montgomery also played a bit part , alongside Humphrey Bogart , in Warner Brothers ’ Action in the North Atlantic ( assistance from the Navy ) .
Bogart additionally starred with Lloyd Bridges in Columbia Pictures ’ 1943 Sahara , a World War II epic made with the full cooperation of the U.S. Army .
Bridges would go on to appear with both Van Johnson and Spencer Tracy in the non-military Plymouth Adventures ( 1952 ) .
But long before that , both Johnson and Tracy took off in Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer ’s Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo , a film celebrating the 1942 “ Doolittle Raid ” — a U.S. terror - bombing effort that decimated civilian sites including factories , schools and even a hospital in Japan — made , of course , with the assistance of the War Department .
Van Johnson fought his way through another MGM production , Battleground ( 1949 ) , which not only featured tanks and trucks loaned by the Army , but , as extras , twenty members of the 101st Airborne Division .
Battleground co-starred John Hodiak , who , that same year , played alongside Jimmy Stewart in the World War II adventure film Malaya .
Stewart actually enlisted in the Air Force in World War II , then served in the Air Force Reserve , and retired as a brigadier general .
While in the Reserves , he flew high in Strategic Air Command ( 1955 ) , a film conceived at the urging of Curtis LeMay , the actual commander of the Air Force ’s actual Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) .
Even with Cold War —era demands on its equipment , SAC provided Paramount with B - 36 bombers , B - 47 jet bombers and a full colonel as a technical adviser .
But that was just one of SAC ’s ( and LeMay ’s ) connections to Hollywood .
The 1963 film A Gathering of Eagles , for example , received SAC ’s wholehearted support .
Written by Battleground screenwriter Robert Pirosh and featuring matinee idol Rock Hudson , it was praised for its realism by none other than LeMay .
Rock Hudson later starred with John Wayne in The Undefeated ( 1969 ) , but not before “ the Duke ” made his military - entertainment masterpiece The Green Berets ( 1968 ) , which enjoyed the full backing of the Vietnam - embattled Department of Defense .
With loads of military input , The Green Berets proved to be , said Variety , a “ whammo ” and “ boffo ” box - office success .
Critics , however , almost universally panned it .
One New York
Times film reviewer went so far as to call it “ so unspeakable , so stupid , so rotten and false in every detail … vile and insane . ”
Wayne ’s Green Berets costar , George Takei ( better known as Mr. Sulu on TV’s Star Trek ) , was no stranger to the military - entertainment complex , having appeared in the 1960 Marines Corps - assisted Hell to Eternity and the 1963 film version of John F. Kennedy ’s PT 109 .
( For which the Navy provided a destroyer , six other ships , and a few sailors . )
Takei , who would be “ beamed up ” in the Navy - supported 1986 film Star Trek IV : The Voyage Home , also once starred with Grant Williams , an actor who later showed up in Tora ! Tora ! Tora ! ( 1970 ) , a then - unbelievably big - budget ( at least $ 25 million ) Twentieth Century Fox film .
For that movie , the Department of Defense provided research assistance , stock footage , a technical adviser , an old airplane hangar ( which the film blew up ) , and the use of Navy ships at Pearl Harbor .
Demonstrating a new willingness to go above and beyond for Hollywood , the Navy even loaded thirty “ Japanese ” airplanes onto the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown for the attack .
In Rehab Mode , the Military Goes Civilian
Military - Tinseltown cooperation obviously goes back a long way .
But in the 1970s , a new , amped - up relationship was launched , largely in response to a growing negative impression of the U.S. military brought on by the Vietnam War — and by the daunting prospect of having to field an all - volunteer military .
The Pentagon was hungry for help in rehabilitating its image — even lending support to “ civilian ” flicks — and the film industry was happy to oblige .
Take Twentieth Century Fox ’s 1974 collaboration with the Navy on the non-military The Towering Inferno ( 1974 ) .
The Navy lent helicopters , and the studio said thanks in the form of an acknowledgment in the credits .
The film featured longtime military - entertainment stalwart William Holden , who had already appeared in I Wanted Wings ( an army - aided 1941 propaganda flick ) and The Bridges at Toko - Ri ( made with Navy assistance in 1955 ) .
He had also co-starred in 1948 ’s Man From Colorado with Glenn Ford , who acted alongside Charlton Heston in Midway ( 1976 ) , a production that was allowed to use the USS Lexington aircraft carrier for two weeks of filming .
Heston , in turn , went on to star in Gray Lady Down — a 1978 submarine thriller that benefited from the use of a real submarine , ships , and sailors , all courtesy of the Navy .
Gray Lady Down featured actor Stacey Keach , who starred in 1980 ’s TV movie - adaptation of Philip Caputo ’s A Rumor of War .
The Marine Corps provided an adviser ( who tempered some of the more disturbing portions of Caputo ’s memoir ) , the use of military facilities , and 30 marines .
Brian Dennehy , who also starred in A Rumor of War , would act alongside Scott Glenn in the 1985 western Silverado .
But before he became a cowboy , Glenn played the part of Navy test pilot and NASA spaceman Alan B. Shepard in The Right Stuff ( 1983 ) .
That film was partially shot at Edwards Air Force Base and used various types of aircraft and equipment as well as Air Force personnel as extras .
Ed Harris , who blasted into orbit as astronaut John Glenn in The Right Stuff moved from the space capsule to the NASA control room in the 1995 blockbuster drama Apollo 13 ( Air Force extras and equipment loaned by Vandenberg Air Force Base ) .
Beside him in the co-pilot seat was none other than …
Kevin Bacon .
Apollo 13 also featured Bill Paxton , who , a year earlier , had been in the Arnold Schwarzenegger blockbuster , True Lies , which benefited from Marine Corps assistance .
Paxton had also acted in 1990 ’s Navy Seals ( helped by the Navy ) and , in 2000 , would dive below the surface in the Navy - supported submarine action - drama U - 571 .
True Lies was but another link in the military - entertainment matrix .
The film ’s co-star , Tom Arnold , shared billing in Exit Wounds ( 2001 ) with Steven Seagal ( whose 1992 film Under Siege and 1996 film Executive Decision received , respectively , Navy and Army cooperation ) and Bruce McGill , who would appear with Morgan Freeman in 2002 ’s The Sum of All Fears .
Shot on location at Whiteman Air Force Base and Offutt Air Force Base , The Sum of All Fears featured numerous USAF aircraft and enjoyed the input of multiple Air Force technical advisers .
Freeman ’s costar in The Sum of All Fears , Ben Affleck , had a lead role in the 2001 historical drama Pearl Harbor .
Produced with the backing of the Navy , the film had its premiere on the deck of a nuclear - powered aircraft carrier .
Affleck was joined in Pearl Harbor by Cuba Gooding Jr. ( who also starred in 2000 ’s Navy - aided Men of Honor ) , Tom Sizemore ( from 1991 ’s Navy - aided Flight of the Intruder ) and Josh Hartnett .
That same year , Hartnett and Sizemore appeared in Ridley Scott ’s blockbuster Black Hawk Down , made with the full cooperation of the Army .
The Pentagon sent the film eight helicopters and 100 soldiers , including members of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment .
Pearl Harbor co-star Tom Everett appeared in Air Force One ( 1997 ) , starring Harrison Ford , which used USAF aircraft , Air Force personnel as extras , and was filmed at both the Rickenbacker and Channel Islands Air National Guard bases .
Its director , Wolfgang Petersen , also directed the George Clooney / Mark Wahlberg Air Force - aided weather drama The Perfect Storm ( partially filmed at the Channel Islands base as well ) .
Wahlberg had a bit part in the 1994 Danny DeVito comedy Renaissance Man ( made with Army involvement ) .
In fact , the Oscar - winning , military - themed Forrest Gump received only limited help from the Army , in part because Renaissance Man and another 1994 comedy , In the Army Now , starring Pauly Shore and David Alan Grier , sucked up so much military attention that year .
Grier went on to appear in the non-military The Woodsman ( 2004 ) with Benjamin Bratt , who had previously been cast in the 1994 Army - aided thriller Clear and Present Danger and would star in the ABC TV series E - Ring , a self - proclaimed “ pulsating drama set inside the nation ’s ultimate fortress : the Pentagon . ”
Its producer and co-creator Ken Robinson had worked in the actual Pentagon over “ a couple decades . ”
At Bratt ’s side in the non-military The Woodsman was not only Grier but — you guessed it — Kevin Bacon .
The Pentagon , the Sequel
In fact , one could take many ( if not all ) of Bacon ’s non-military roles and quickly find connections that lead directly to the Pentagon .
For instance , have a look at Bacon ’s distinctly unmilitary Wild Things ( 1998 ) and you ’ll find movie veteran Robert Wagner , who was featured not only in such Navy - supported fare as The Frogmen ( 1951 ) and Midway ( 1976 ) , but also in the Marine Corps — aided Halls of Montezuma ( 1950 ) , Stars and Stripes Forever ( 1952 ) , and In Love and War ( 1958 ) ; the Army - assisted Between Heaven and Hell ( 1956 ) ; the Air Force - supported The Hunters ( 1958 ) ; and finally The Longest Day ( 1962 ) , an epic about World War II ’s D - Day landings made with the cooperation of the Army , Navy , and Marine Corps .
When it comes to military - entertainment connections , the point is : Bacon is n’t special .
Almost any current actor — from Academy Award - winner Gwyneth Paltrow ( in 2008 ’s upcoming Air Force - aided Iron Man ) to young actress Dakota Fanning ( at the side of top - gunner Tom Cruise in the Army - aided , Steven Spielberg - directed 2005 remake of War of the Worlds ) — could be linked to the military .
The reasons are simple .
As David Robb , the author of Operation Hollywood : How the Pentagon Shapes and Censors the Movies , observed :
“ Hollywood and the Pentagon have … a collaboration that works well for both sides .
Hollywood producers get what they want — access to billions of dollars worth of military hardware and equipment — tanks , jet fighters , nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers — and the military gets what it wants — films that portray the military in a positive light ; films that help the services in their recruiting efforts . ”
But recruiting is just part of the equation , and the phrase “ a positive light ” is even a little soft .
At the movies , the military gets sold — at least in those legions of Pentagon - aided films — as heroic , admirable , and morally correct .
Often , it can literally do no wrong .
This , of course , is no accident .
Something must be exchanged for the millions of dollars in otherwise unavailable high - tech weapons systems and equipment , not to speak of personnel and military advisors , necessary to make the sort of “ realistic , ” eye - catching war , action , and sci- fi movies that Hollywood ( and assumedly its audiences ) demand .
Speaking about the big- budget , live - action blockbuster Transformers ( 2007 ) , Ian Bryce , one of its producers , characterized the relationship this way , “ Without the superb military support we ’ve gotten … it would be an entirely different - looking film …
Once you get Pentagon approval , you ’ve created a win -win situation .
We want to cooperate with the Pentagon to show them off in the most positive light , and the Pentagon likewise wants to give us the resources to be able to do that . ”
On the military side , Air Force master sergeant Larry Belen spoke of similar motivations for aiding the production of Iron Man : “ I want people to walk away from this movie with a really good impression of the Air Force , like they got about the Navy seeing Top Gun . ”
But Air Force captain Christian Hodge , the Defense Department ’s project officer for Iron Man , may have said it best when he unabashedly predicted , “ The Air Force is going to come off looking like rock stars . ”
On the Silver Screen , you can be sure of three things : the Complex is forever ; the Pentagon has no equal ( sorry Kevin ! ) , and there will , most definitely , be a sequel …
The Best of Tom Engelhardt
There has been much buzz about the water - purifying machine that Segway inventor Dean Kamen demonstrated on the Colbert Report last week ( even taking on the bag of Spicy Sweet Chili Doritos that Colbert added ) .
Everyone has been trying to find out more about his claim that " you stick a hose into anything that looks wet … and it comes out … as perfect distilled clean water . "
So far as I can tell however , it ’s true .
( Note : I still have n’t worked out if it can handle volatile organics like gasoline and benzene . )
So what follows are the numbers behind the hype .
True to form they are distilled from a number of articles and interviews over the last six years .
The most informative being Kamen ’s talk at TED in 2002 .
It is designed to supply a village with 1,000 liters / day of clean water .
( Colbert Report )
You can use any water source — ocean , puddle , chemical waste site , hexavalent chrome , arsenic , poison , 50 gallon drum of urine .
( Colbert Report ) Vapor compression distillation is not new .
Doing it in such an incredibly efficient way such that it takes only 2 percent of the power of convention distillers is new .
( R&D World and Gizmodo commenter )
The are no filters to replace , no charcoal , no anything disposable ( just distillation ) .
( Colbert Report ) The Slingshot ( as its called ) can use half the waste heat ( 450 watts ) from a sterling engine electrical generator ( prototype also being designed by Kamen ’s company ) to boil its water .
( TED )
The heat put into the water is recovered with a " counter - flow heat exchanger " and recycled to heat the next batch of water ( that is part of the novel bit ) .
( TED and Gizmodo commenter ) Slingshot will be less then 60 lbs .
( TED )
The prototype slingshot was hand - built for $ 100 K .
The goal is to get production units down to $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 .
( CNN )
The sterling engine , used as an electrical generator , can produce about 200 watts of power ( it will never be more then 20 percent efficient ) and 800 watts of waste heat ( the waste heat that slingshot uses ) .
TED
Later sources say the sterling engine can generate 1 kilowatt or enough power for 70 high - efficiency light bulbs .
( CNN )
The sterling engine can run on anything that burns , propane or even cow dung .
( CNN )
The slingshot is a David and Goliath reference aimed at putting water and power back in the hands of the individuals .
( AP )
The most interesting comments I came across were to the effect that inventing something great is only half the problem .
The other half is getting it to the people who need it in a way that works .
Luckily , as Gizmodo commenter enginblue points out , if units came down to $ 1,000 each , this new wave of micro-lending could have people pooling money to purchase units for groups of entrepreneurs wanting to bring this to their village .

UK interest rates have been cut to 5 % from 5.25 % by the Bank of England in an attempt to spur the economy in the face of the global credit crunch .
It is the central bank 's third cut in interest rates since early December .
The Bank said that disruption in financial markets and tighter credit conditions could lead to a slowdown in the wider economy .
The largest mortgage lenders say they will pass on the cut to their mortgage customers who pay variable rates .
Decision welcomed Business groups welcomed the decision and called for further cuts to shore up growth .
" It is vitally important to ensure that problems in the financial sector and in the housing market do not damage wealth - creating businesses , " said David Kern , economic adviser to the British Chambers of Commerce .
The re-emergence of tensions in UK money markets , combined with evidence of a sharper deceleration in the housing market , has spurred the MPC into action
Stuart Porteous , RBS
Read Stephanie Flanders ' analysis Mortgage market moves Rate cuts and you " Undue delay in acting threatens to reduce the effectiveness of interest rate cuts that the MPC itself has anticipated already . "
The cut had been widely forecast by economists .
" So far the Bank 's gradual approach to cutting rates has been the right one , " said Martin Temple , chairman of the EEF manufacturers ' group .
" But , given how quickly the situation is changing , there are now greater risks to business and consumer confidence . "
Mortgage rates
The UK 's biggest mortgage lenders responded quickly , saying they would cut their standard variable mortgage rates by the full quarter of a percentage point .
Their mortgage rates which track the Bank of England 's base rate will be cut automatically also .
HAVE YOUR SAY Irresponsible lending is the cause of most of our current financial issues Clive , Woking , UK The lenders that have said they will do this are the Halifax , Nationwide , Bank of Scotland , Britannia , Lloyds TSB , Cheltenham & Gloucester , First Direct , Royal Bank of Scotland , NatWest and Woolwich .
Most of the rest say they say they will take from a few days to two weeks to decide how to respond .
Despite this widely anticipated move by the Bank of England , many mortgage lenders have in recent weeks had to withdraw their most competitive deals for new customers .
Obtaining funding from the money markets has become more costly for banks as a result of the uncertainty in financial markets and a shortage of funds caused by the global credit crisis .
" This is good news for those borrowers with mortgages tracking the Bank base rate , " said Michael Coogan , director general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders .
" But in these dysfunctional market conditions , the base rate is not in itself a good guide to the cost or availability of funds to lenders . "
Before the rate decision , Alliance & Leicester said it was raising rates on its entire mortgage range for the second time this week .
Nationwide said it was raising interest rates on some of its fixed - rate products by between 0.12 % and 0.32 % from Friday .
Inflation risk BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders says that the quarter of a percentage point rate cut indicates that the state of the UK economy is broadly in line with the Bank 's expectations .
That translates as slowing annual economic growth of between 1.5 % and 1.75 % this year , but not a recession , although inflationary pressures would still remain a problem .
Credit conditions have tightened and the availability of credit appears to be worsening
Bank of England
Read the comments in full The Bank said inflation could remain above the government 's target of 2 % , but should fall back , even if the price of oil and other commodities remain at their current high levels .
It did not mention the housing market in its statement , but analysts said recent downbeat news on property prices had influenced the nine - strong MPC .
The Halifax , the UK 's largest lender , said on Tuesday that house prices fell by 2.5 % in March , the biggest monthly decline since September 1992 .
" The re-emergence of tensions in UK money markets , combined with evidence of a sharper deceleration in the housing market , has spurred the MPC into action , " said Stuart Porteous , head of economics at RBS .

What are these ?
Nicole posted a clip yesterday showing FOXNews bringing on the wingnuts who are simply apoplectic over past inflammatory statements made by the former pastor of Barack Obama 's church , Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
It comes as no surprise to anyone that Chris Wallace continued the same line of attack this morning on Fox News Sunday .
Download Download
Wallace interviewed Senators Chris Dodd and Chuck Schumer about Rev. Wright 's comments and he absolutely refused to let go of the notion that people should be scared of Obama because he attended Wright 's church for 20 years , and hey , after all the time they MUST agree on everything , right ?
Dodd calls him out on his veiled assertions :
" Well , I would certainly disagree with this individual , we 've all been in situations like that , but the idea somehow that this is deeply involved and ingrained , that this is really who Barack Obama is , what you 're suggesting , or those who are making these accusations , is this is really who Barack Obama is .
Anyone who knows this man , who 's worked with him , who 's spent time with him would say this is totally unlike him , it 's not him at all .
And so the suggestion somehow that this is really who this candidate is is really an unfair accusation . "
Schumer agrees with Dodd that this is a distraction from the real issues that Americans are concerned about , and brings up John McCain 's welcomed endorsement from anti-Catholic religious zealot , John Hagee , although he does n't mention him by name .
Regardless of the fact that Obama has rejected Wright 's statements and he's no longer a member of his campaign , Wallace never relents from the FOXNews theme -- Americans should be frightened of Obama because he 's really a closeted , anti-American , black militant .
If you think about it , this was the only move for Fox .
The whole Obama is a Muslim meme is n't working out so well and since they 're being forced to report that he really is a Christian , they have no choice but to attack his church .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
In two bestselling books , " Fooled by Randomness " and " The Black Swan , " Nassim Nicholas Taleb has explored the ways people misunderstand randomness and risk .
At the heart of his thinking is the idea of a " Black Swan " - an unlikely but not impossible catastrophe that no one ever seems to plan for .
In an e-mail and telephone exchange with Fortune 's Eric Gelman that began with Taleb in the Yucat�n for the equinox , the New York City - based former trader turned scholar and essayist expounds on the role of Black Swans in the current market crisis .
What is a Black Swan ?
What I call a Black Swan is a surprise event - like the discovery of the black bird in Australia , which was unpredictable because swans in the Old World were all white .
But unlike the bird , my Black Swan carries large consequences .
There are two types of businesses : those that are exposed to Black Swans and those that are relatively insulated from them - not because Black Swans cannot occur , but because their impact is not going to be monstrous .
Your dentist 's income will not disappear on a single day :
No single event will carry big consequences for her .
But trading profits can all be lost by a single transaction .
So some businesses are insulated , some ( like technology ) are exposed to positive Black Swans , and others are exposed to negative ones .
Most people seem to have been caught off - guard by the subprime crisis , yet such an event was not only predictable but also inevitable .
It was a Black Swan , yes ?
The Black Swan is a matter of perspective .
A turkey is fed for 1,000 days - every day lulling it more and more into the feeling that the human feeders are acting in its best interest .
Except that on the 1,001st day , the butcher shows up and there is a surprise .
The surprise is for the turkey , not the butcher .
Anyone who knows anything about the history of banking ( or remembers the 1982 Latin American debt crisis or the 1990s savings and loan collapse ) will tell you that the subprime crisis was so bound to happen .
Banks are exposed to such blowups .
Bankers have been the turkey , historically .
So I call these crises " gray swans . "
I 've been telling anyone willing to listen that banks have a tendency to sit on time bombs while convincing themselves that they are conservative and nonvolatile .
I gather you do n't have a lot of respect for the effectiveness of Wall Street 's " risk management . "
It is the " science " of risk management that effectively turned everyone involved into a turkey .
If the Food and Drug Administration monitored the business of risk management as rigorously as it monitored drugs , many of these " scientists " would be arrested for endangering us .
We replaced so much experience and common sense with " models " that work worse than astrology , because they assume that the Black Swan does not exist .
Trying to model something that escapes modelization is the heart of the problem .
We like models because they do not require experience and can be taught by a 33 - year - old assistant professor .
Sometimes you need to say , " No model is better than a faulty model " - like no medicine is better than the advice of an unqualified doctor , and no drug is better than any drug .
The idea that catastrophe can strike without warning does not seem particularly hard to understand .
Why does n't Wall Street ever seem to allow for that possibility ?
And why does n't it learn from past catastrophes ?
Let me blame business schools and the financial economics establishment - they have a vested interest in promoting models and devaluing common sense .
I worked on Wall Street for close to two decades in trading and risk management of derivatives .
I noticed that while portfolio models got worse and worse in tracking reality , their use kept increasing as if nothing was happening .
Why ?
Because in the past 15 years business schools accelerated their teaching of portfolio theory as a replacement for our experiences .
It looks like science , and they have been brainwashing more than 100,000 students a year .
There is no way my experiences can be transmitted to the next generation because of these schools .
We 've had fiascoes in finance that they need to neglect because they contradict their models .
The problem may also be the Nobel in economics that gave a stamp to these junky theories .
Someone needs to make the Nobel committee account for this , for the damage to society - and I hope to do so .
Banks thought they were hedging their bets in the mortgage market .
Clearly they were wrong .
Would there have been a way to participate in the mortgage bond market in a prudent way ?
Of course , in a less leveraged manner .
But greed pushes bankers to take the maximum amount of " hidden risks " - those risks that do not show on a regular basis because the models miss it , but end up causing blowups .
Banking is a very treacherous business because you do n't realize it is risky until it is too late .
It is like calm waters that deliver huge storms .
You can tell that there will be another blow - up , another Black Swan , but you can't tell me where it will occur - or can you ?
I do n't know where it may occur .
But if you look at balance sheets and contingent liabilities , it is easy to know who may be exposed to negative ones and who may be exposed to positive ones .
Furthermore , some banks and hedge funds are more resistant than others to the Black Swan - we need to discriminate between them .
Is there any way to prevent drastic shocks to the financial system ?
Occasional blowups are good if they are small and recurrent .
When you live in Manhattan , you notice the quality of the food is high because restaurants are rapidly punished for their mistakes .
But unfortunately we have been experiencing the opposite : rare but deep and systemic blowups .
Is there something fundamentally wrong with the structure of the U.S. financial system ?
What can be done to fix it ?
In the past , the financial world had a very diversified ecology : banks going bust on a steady basis .
They were not all homogeneous .
Today the entire banking system is dominated by a few monster banks , and almost all have the same exposures .
So the system became less and less volatile while becoming riskier and riskier .
So we moved from the more resilient ecology to a more concentrated architecture .
I used to say , " You trade with a bank , you end up trading with J.P. Morgan ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) . "
Well , it turned out to be true with the Bear Stearns ( BSC , Fortune 500 ) rescue .
Did your personal portfolio benefit or suffer from the subprime crisis ?
I prefer not to answer that , as I am trying to avoid talking about my nonintellectual activities .
The Gauntlet : Barry ’s Dangerous Truths
April 20 , 2008
In what is becoming an increasingly alarming trend of federalizing local and state law enforcement through grant programs , we see a symptom of this disease flaring up in grand fascist fashion .
Operation Sudden Impact took Memphis , TN by storm .
The symbolism of this city being selected is pretty obvious ; being a municipal city that is more or less in 3 states required cooperation between multiple states .
Essentially , the program served as a city - wide anti-crime and anti-terrorism shakedown ( in the form of unconstitutional methods such as roadblocks ) .
Over 400 people were arrested , 100 some - odd of which the news claimed were “ fugitives ” .
I ’m assuming this meant they had a bench warrant for some reason .
Realistically speaking , there were not 100 some - odd dangerous prisoners escaped from the jails , loose on the streets of Memphis .
In reality , the 100 some - odd “ fugitives ” they picked up off of the streets probably had warrants for Failure to Appear for a minor offense , or something mundane of that nature .
Either way , here can be seen footage of the crackdown being sold as “ to our benefit ” on the local news .
The law enforcement officials in charge of this operation , Homeland Security , are trying to remind Memphis , TN that lesser crimes often lead to terrorist acts !
Memphis definitely needs this type of training , you know , with all the terrorism going on there .
Clearly Memphis has proven time and time again that without the help of Homeland Security , rampant terrorism will destroy the lives of everyone in America .
After all , a whopping NO people fell victim to acts of terrorism in Memphis last year , a huge rise from the previous - year total of ZERO acts of terror .
Memphis currently sits on the deadliest fault line in America , one which scientists are convinced has a 100 % chance of bursting and destroying the entire city by 2040 , with no earthquake proofing of any kind , and the federal government is intervening to protect Memphis from terrorism , which is as likely to kill a resident of Memphis as shark attack or a lightning storm .
It is clear that the War on Terror has now become the excuse for a direct war on you .
They now feel that someone not wearing a seatbelt or not having insurance when they drive might be a symptom of the disease of terrorism .
If Homeland Security actually believes this , and actually feels that enormous resources should be put to linking these things , then they are stupid .
If they do n’t actually believe it , then something much worse is afoot : a War on YOU .
Now you run a risk of being associated with terrorism because you do not have proper car insurance .
A mis-association or categorization of a citizen as a terrorist or enemy combatant now qualifies you for a trip to Gitmo without a trial .
Memphis , I am disappointed in you for putting up with this .
This should ’ve been a showdown .
You let the rest of America down by allowing it .
This was a situation where the cartridge box or a series of lawsuits were necessary to keep the Republic .
That reminds me of a conversation I had in Chattanooga about the cameras which are installed all over the city in public there now .
I reminded them that it was East Tennessee .
“ Break the damn things ” .
Seriously , your in the mountains of East Tennessee .
Break one camera , and the rest will disappear .
If your elected officials wo n’t stand up for you , then stand up for yourself .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp has made progress in getting its Windows software to work on a low - cost laptop computer for poor children that currently runs on rival Linux software , an executive said on Thursday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The world ’s largest software company is now working to adapt a basic version of Windows XP so it is compatible with the nonprofit One Laptop per Child Foundation ’s small green - and - white XO laptop .
“ We ’re spending a nontrivial amount of money on it , ” Microsoft Corporate Vice President Will Poole said in an interview on Thursday .
“ We remain hopeful with our progress to date , we still have significant work ahead to finalize our analysis and testing processes , ” he said .
“ At the end of the day , there ’s no guarantees . ”
The One Laptop per Child Foundation , a spin - off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , plans to start producing the $ 188 machines in China next month and eventually manufacture millions a year for elementary school children in developing countries in Asia , Africa and Latin America .
The foundation is also selling the machines in the United States and Canada for $ 400 apiece through a fund - raising campaign .
The laptops were designed specifically to run Linux programs .
If the machines run only Linux , Microsoft will lose an opportunity to expose tens of millions of children worldwide to its Windows system .
If the foundation is able to meet its goal of producing millions of laptops for school children around the world and they are all loaded with Linux software , then they would end up being more comfortable with those programs than with Windows , said Wayan Vota , who publishes a blog that monitors the project .
( olpcnews.com / ) .
“ People will realize there is an alternative to Windows and they might like it better , ” Vota said . ”
But the new laptop uses some technologies developed by the foundation that have n’t previously been used in personal computers , Poole said .
“ We still have plenty of work to do in determining if the highly constrained performance , power , and memory in the first generation XO laptops will be compatible with Windows and popular Windows applications , ” he added .
Originally dubbed the $ 100 laptop , which is the group ’s target price for the machine , the XO features a string pulley to charge its battery , a keyboard that switches between languages , a digital video camera and wireless connectivity .
The laptop ’s designer , Mary Lou Jepsen , said in an interview earlier this month she expects the price to drop in the first quarter of next year because prices of memory tend to fall dramatically during that period .
The computer requires just 2 watts of power compared with the typical laptop ’s 30 to 40 watts and does away with hard drives , relying instead on flash memory and four USB ports to add memory devices .
The XO laptop ’s component makers include Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Software maker Red Hat Inc helped develop the device .
Quanta Computer
Inc will manufacture it .
The foundation will start taking orders for its Give 1 Get 1 campaign on November 12 at www.laptopgiving.org.
A while back we noted that top Clinton advisor Harold Ickes had admonished the press not to use the phrase “ super delegates ” but instead to employ what he claims is the more accurate “ automatic delegates . ”
The Clinton campaign has pushed for this change of phrase on the thinking that calling them “ super delegates ” carries a negative connotation that somehow they ’re more powerful or privileges than other delegates .
And that ’s important because their path to the nomination will almost certainly have to rely on super delegates going overwhelmingly for Clinton despite Obama ’s having the majority of pledged delegates .
Got that ?
Anyway , has the AP gotten the message ?
In tonight ’s AP report about Obama ’s new delegates in Iowa reporter Mike Glover has adopted the Clinton campaign “ automatic delegate ” formulation .
Now , sometimes spinning campaigns come up with phrases that are so heavy - handedness and tendentious that it ’s just ridiculous — the “ death tax ” , “ personal accounts ” for Social Security privatization , etc .
In this case , I think you ’ve probably got to have your head pretty deep in the delegat - ology weeds to have any sense of whether it matters to use one term over another .
But I think it ’s a good journalistic principle not to switch terminology in the midst of an election campaign or public policy debate at the bidding of one party or another , unless someone makes an extremely good case that the existing word choices are patently misleading .
And doing it at the behest of one party to the dispute is almost always bad practice .
Otherwise the journalists whose job it is to sift through the spin become its messengers , wittingly or not .

Hillary Clinton has beaten rival Barack Obama in a critical vote in the state of Pennsylvania as the two battle to be the Democrats ' presidential candidate .
Speaking after her solid nine - point win , she said Americans deserved " a president who does n't quit " .
Although this victory keeps her campaign alive , Mrs Clinton still faces an uphill battle to overtake her rival , correspondents say .
Mr Obama said he had done well to gain ground on Mrs Clinton in Pennsylvania .
With 99 % of returns counted , Mrs Clinton was leading Mr Obama by 54.7 % to 45.3 % .
No quitting
The former first lady told cheering supporters at a victory rally in Philadelphia that she had beaten a " formidable opponent " who had outspent her three - to - one .
" Some people counted me out and said to drop out , but the American people do n't quit and they deserve a president who does n't quit either , " she said .

" Because of you , the tide is turning . "
She also appealed for more donations to her campaign war chest , saying it was the only way she could continue to compete with a rival who was outspending her " massively " .
Mr Obama congratulated Mrs Clinton as he addressed a rally in Indiana , one of the next states to hold a primary vote , but also said his campaign had done better than expected in Pennsylvania .
" There were a lot of folks who did n't think we could make this a close race when it started , " he said .
" Six weeks later , we closed the gap .
We rallied people of every age and race and background to our cause . "
The BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington says Mrs Clinton has gained a clear victory that keeps her presidential hopes alive .

While her win is not enough to turn the tables on her rival , who still retains the overall lead and has much more cash to spend , it suggests her perseverance and resilience is paying off , our correspondent adds .
Exit polls for US media suggest Mrs Clinton won by taking the votes of blue - collar workers , women and white men , the Associated Press reported .
Women - who have tended to favour Mrs Clinton - made up 60 % of Democratic voters in the state , according to the exit polls .
Mrs Clinton also won the support of six out of 10 of those who decided which of the pair to back within the last week - a period during which campaign rhetoric sharpened .
The economy once again emerged as the most important issue for voters , with more than 80 % of those surveyed saying the nation was already in a recession .

With four million registered Democrats , and 158 pledged delegates to the Democratic Party 's nominating convention in August , Pennsylvania was the last of the big states to hold a primary .
Although Mrs Clinton is behind in the delegate count and in the total votes cast , she has won most of the big state contests .
With the delegates split in proportion to the vote , neither candidate is expected to win sufficient pledged delegates to seal the nomination in the remaining primaries , and the two are courting 800 or so unelected " super- delegates " .
Mrs Clinton 's argument - which she hopes will sway the super - delegates - is that only she will be able to secure wins in critical large states come November 's presidential election .
Mr Obama has dismissed the big - state argument , saying there was " no chance " of the Democrats losing New York or California in the presidential election , no matter who the candidate was .
The Republican Party also held a primary in Pennsylvania on Tuesday , with presumptive nominee John McCain set to take all the delegates on offer .
Mr McCain spent the day in Ohio - expected to be a key battleground state in November - where he spoke of the need to create new opportunities to replace lost blue - collar jobs .
Iran warning On Tuesday , Mrs Clinton emphasised what she says is a strength - her leadership ability and foreign affairs credentials .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Let them fight it out , I do not care who wins ; either candidate will be a strong contender Wayne , Idaho
As the contenders appeared on the US morning talk show circuit , Mrs Clinton was asked how she would respond if Iran launched a nuclear attack on Israel , and replied with a stark warning .
" If I 'm the president , we will attack Iran ... we would be able to totally obliterate them , " she told TV network ABC .
" That 's a terrible thing to say , but those people who run Iran need to understand that , because that perhaps will deter them from doing something that would be reckless , foolish and tragic . "
In response , Mr Obama said : " Using words like ' obliterate ' - it does n't actually produce good results , and so I 'm not interested in sabre - rattling . "
He said only that Iran should know he would respond " forcefully " to an attack on any US ally .
The US fears Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons , and could use them against Israel .
Iran insists its nuclear programme is solely for power generation .

Diet may impact on sperm quality
Researchers found high dietary folate was linked to lower levels of sperm with the wrong number of chromosomes .
Folate , also protective against birth defects , is found in leafy green vegetables , fruit and pulses .
The study , by the University of California , Berkeley , features in the journal Human Reproduction .
This study is the first to suggest that paternal diet may play a role after conception in the development of healthy offspring
Professor Brenda Eskenazi
University of California , Berkeley
It is estimated that up to 4 % of sperm in a healthy man carry either too many or too few chromosomes - a condition known as aneuploidy .
Aneuploidy is linked to failure to conceive , miscarriages , and children born with conditions such as Down 's syndrome , Turner 's syndrome and Klinefelter 's syndrome .
However , the reason why sperm become mutated in this way is poorly understood .
The Berkeley team analysed sperm samples from 89 healthy , non-smoking men , and quizzed them about their intake of zinc , folate , vitamin C , vitamin E and beta carotene .
Folate either came from the men's diet , or in the synthetic , folic acid form , which is found in dietary supplements .
The researchers found a statistically significant association between folate intake and lower sperm aneuploidy .
Dose effect
Men who consumed the most folate - between 722 and 1150 micrograms a day - had 20 - 30 % lower levels of several types of aneuploidy than men with low folate intake .
The story so far suggests that dietary factors wo n't help you make any more sperm , but good diet might just improve the quality of the ones that are made
Dr Allan Pacey
University of Sheffield
The researchers stressed they had not proved that folate had a direct impact on sperm quality , merely that there was an association between the two .
They say more work is needed to investigate cause and effect .
Researcher Professor Brenda Eskenazi said while the importance of maternal diet on reproduction was well known , the research suggested paternal diet might also be important .
She said : " In previous studies , we and others have shown that paternal micronutrient intake may contribute to successful conceptions by improving the quality of the sperm .
" This study is the first to suggest that paternal diet may play a role after conception in the development of healthy offspring . "
Professor Eskenazi said that if the findings were confirmed the current recommended daily folate intake for men of 400 micrograms might have to be revised upwards for men trying for a baby in order to reduce the risk of chromosomal abnormalities in their children .
Mounting evidence
Dr Allan Pacey , an expert in male reproduction at the University of Sheffield , said evidence was mounting that diet affected sperm quality .
" The story so far suggests that dietary factors wo n't help you make any more sperm , but good diet might just improve the quality of the ones that are made . "
But he added : " Before couples run out to the chemist and stock up on supplements , I would suggest that they just lead sensible lives and stop smoking , moderate alcohol intake and eat sensibly , making sure they get their five portions of fresh fruit and veg each day .
" And because it takes three months to produce sperm , any lifestyle changes should take place well in advance of any attempt to conceive . "
A decision on whether folic acid should be added to bread and flour in the UK is due next year .
Campaigners say it would significantly cut the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida , but those against the move say some research has raised concerns that folic acid may be linked to an increased risk of cancer .
Mutualist Blog Studies in Mutualist Political Economy Online Edition

Affiliated with the Voluntary Cooperation Movement INTRODUCTION
Mutualism , as a variety of anarchism , goes back to P.J. Proudhon in France and Josiah Warren in the U.S.
It favors , to the extent possible , an evolutionary approach to creating a new society .
It emphasizes the importance of peaceful activity in building alternative social institutions within the existing society , and strengthening those institutions until they finally replace the existing statist system .
As Paul Goodman put it , " A free society cannot be the substitution of a ' new order ' for the old order ; it is the extension of spheres of free action until they make up most of the social life . "
Other anarchist subgroups , and the libertarian left generally , share these ideas to some extent .
Whether known as " dual power " or " social counterpower , " or " counter - economics , " alternative social institutions are part of our common vision .
But they are especially central to mutualists ' evolutionary understanding .
Mutualists belong to a non-collectivist segment of anarchists .
Although we favor democratic control when collective action is required by the nature of production and other cooperative endeavors , we do not favor collectivism as an ideal in itself .
We are not opposed to money or exchange .
We believe in private property , so long as it is based on personal occupancy and use .
We favor a society in which all relationships and transactions are non-coercive , and based on voluntary cooperation , free exchange , or mutual aid .
The " market , " in the sense of exchanges of labor between producers , is a profoundly humanizing and liberating concept .
What we oppose is the conventional understanding of markets , as the idea has been coopted and corrupted by state capitalism .
Our ultimate vision is of a society in which the economy is organized around free market exchange between producers , and production is carried out mainly by self - employed artisans and farmers , small producers ' cooperatives , worker - controlled large enterprises , and consumers ' cooperatives .
To the extent that wage labor still exists ( which is likely , if we do not coercively suppress it ) , the removal of statist privileges will result in the worker 's natural wage , as Benjamin Tucker put it , being his full product .
Because of our fondness for free markets , mutualists sometimes fall afoul of those who have an aesthetic affinity for collectivism , or those for whom " petty bourgeois " is a swear word .
But it is our petty bourgeois tendencies that put us in the mainstream of the American populist / radical tradition , and make us relevant to the needs of average working Americans .
Most people distrust the bureaucratic organizations and lobbyist parties that control their communities and working lives and bend the rules and laws to fit their needs .
Just take as an example online gambling – a billion - dollar industry that gave opportunity to the talented and intelligent people to thrive and created a list of notable self - made men .
But , hey , do n't touch the one - percenters !
Las Vegas managed to get its way in congress ( wonder how ) and in 2006 the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement
Act of 2006 was passed , prohibiting all transactions to and from online gambling sites which resulted in most operators leaving the American market .
Thankfully , since then , some states like New Jersey have passed their own bills to legalize remote gambling and more are expected to follow suit .
If you want to find out more about online gambling and are looking for the best online casino on the market just visit www.bestcasinosites.net and take a pick out of the top 10 real money games operators on the Internet .
Screw you Las Vegas !
This is just an example why people want more control over the decisions that affect them .
They are open to the possibility of decentralist , bottom - up alternatives to the present system .
But they do not want an America remade in the image of orthodox , CNT - style syndicalism .
Mutualism is not " reformist , " as that term is used pejoratively by more militant anarchists .
Nor is it necessarily pacifistic , although many mutualists are indeed pacifists .
The proper definition of reformism should hinge , not on the means we use to build a new society or on the speed with which we move , but on the nature of our final goal .
A person who is satisfied with a kinder , gentler version of capitalism or statism , that is still recognizable as state capitalism , is a reformist .
A person who seeks to eliminate state capitalism and replace it with something entirely different , no matter how gradually , is not a reformist .
" Peaceful action " simply means not deliberately provoking the state to repression , but rather doing whatever is possible ( in the words of the Wobbly slogan ) to " build the structure of the new society within the shell of the old " before we try to break the shell .
There is nothing wrong with resisting the state if it tries , through repression , to reverse our progress in building the institutions of the new society .
But revolutionary action should meet two criteria : 1 ) it should have strong popular support ; and 2 ) it should not take place until we have reached the point where peaceful construction of the new society has reached its limits within existing society .
PRESCOTT , Wis. --
Richard Sanders had n't given much thought to roadkill until a buddy came across a very large bear on the roadside near Hudson .
The animal was bigger than any trophy bear the friends had bagged over the years , and they thought it deserved a better fate than rotting by the road .
" It is not their fault they were hit by a car or truck , " Sanders said .
" They should n't go unnoticed . "
Recognized big game record books , such as those kept by the Pope & Young and Boone and Crockett clubs , wo n't list roadkill animals because they were n't taken by bullet or bow .
To remedy that , Sanders created an alternative online : The Road Kill Record Book Club .
The roadkill bear , which is now at the taxidermist , will have its place on the Web site and in his friend 's den .
The Road Kill Record Book Club
Web site includes a gallery and registry for bears , cougars , elk and other animals killed by vehicles .
It also offers memberships and merchandise .
But Sanders cautioned that the Web site should not be seen as promoting accidents or glorifying roadkill .
He plans to provide information on peak danger seasons for vehicle - deer collisions and tips on reporting roadkill .
" The Web site is written in a serious vein , because it is a touchy subject , " he said .
The friend who helped him start the Web site dropped out after receiving flak about it , said Sanders , 60 , of Prescott , a marketing consultant for hunting - related clients .
Lou Cornicelli , big - game program coordinator for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources , scoffed at the idea of a Web site devoted to roadkill .
" I thought I had seen everything , but I had n't until now , " Cornicelli said .
He added , " I do n't see it serving a purpose , but if he wants to have a Web site for animals smacked by Buicks , more power to him . "
Wisconsin wildlife officials were more charitable .
" It certainly is a novel idea , " said Keith Warnke , Wisconsin 's Department of Natural Resources big - game specialist .
" I suppose it could serve an educational purpose , especially if they provide information on peak seasons and what to do if you see a deer in the road . "
Mark Burmesch , an Eau Claire - based regional DNR warden , cautioned that people must get permission from the DNR and pay a claiming fee before picking up roadkill .
The fee starts at $ 10 and depends on species and condition .

Making Real Money With Fake Clouds
Bad Money : Reckless Finance , Failed Politics , and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism
By SEAN POULTER
Last updated at 13:00 18 April 2008
The true , devastating scale of rising prices is revealed today - by the new Daily Mail Cost of Living Index .
It shows that families are having to find more than £ 100 a month extra this year to cope with increases in the cost of food , heat , light and transport .
According to the Consumer Price Index , inflation is running at only 2.5 per cent .
Yet the Mail 's index finds that food costs alone are rising at 15.5 per cent a year - more than six times the official rate .
And there are double - digit increases in other " must - pay " essentials such as petrol , gas and electricity .
Many families need to find more than £ 1,200 extra a year just to stand still .
Once higher mortgage costs are added , millions are having to pay out at least another £ 2,000 a year to keep their heads above water .
The Bank of England 's chief economist Charlie Bean admitted last night that higher food and energy costs are likely to push the Consumer Price Index over 3 per cent this year .
Yet this rate fails to reflect the real problems in homes up and down the country because it includes the cost of luxury items such as flat - screen TVs , whose prices are falling .
It also fails to take increased housing costs into account .
The Mail 's new index has been compiled in association with the price comparison websites uSwitch.com and MySupermarket.co.uk .
It will be published monthly to chart the burden of " must pay " bills as families struggle to keep afloat in the midst of an uncertain economic period .
The figures suggest that a household spending £ 100 a week on food in 2007 will now have to find another £ 66 a month or £ 800 a year .
Scroll down for more ...
Unleaded petrol is up by 16.5 per cent while diesel has soared by 23.3 per cent in a year - putting up the annual cost of motoring by an average of more than £ 200 .
Gas and electricity are up by more than 12 per cent , adding an average of £ 100 a year to the cost of keeping the lights on and staying warm .
Increases in train fares , council tax , water and insurance for home and car threaten to tip household budgets into the red .
Uswitch director of consumer policy Ann Robinson said : " We are feeling the strain of food and petrol prices rising at their fastest rate since records began .
" It 's crunch time for UK households as we face a downturn in the economy , below inflation pay rises and the reality of having less money in our pockets .
" We are working harder , but are certainly not getting any wealthier .
" We have less spending money than at any time over the last ten years , yet bills are rocketing . "
Grain and rice prices have doubled in little over a year on international markets , amid shortages which have provoked riots in some countries .
Supermarkets claim they are protecting UK consumers against the worst effects of global food price rises .
However , huge increases are being pushed through in the price of pasta and bread while , because grain is used widely for animal feed , meat prices are climbing .
A chicken could be bought for £ 2 a year ago .
The figure is now £ 3.54 .
A pack of English butter is up by 36 p to 94 p - 62 per cent ; a dozen free - range eggs up 70 p to £ 2.45 - 40 per cent ; and a pack of frozen peas is up 46 p to £ 1.52 - 43 per cent .
The organisation 's second inflation measure is the RPI - Retail Price Index - which fell from 4.1 per cent in February to 3.8 per cent in March .
It includes more items than the CPI , specifically mortgage interest payments , rent , council tax and the BBC licence fee , but it relies on the same weighting system .
Economist Andrew Brigden , of Fathom , said : ' You could certainly argue the CPI understates the cost of living because it excludes housing costs .
" I am sure the ONS accurately measures a representative basket of goods , but the problem is that no one consumes exactly the same basket of goods .
For pensioners and others , food is going to take up a greater proportion of spending , but they wo n't be buying a lot of flat - screen televisions . '
Help the Aged argues that the official inflation figures are " stuck in fantasy land " .
Special adviser Mervyn Kohler said : " Pensioners are bewildered that the official inflation rate is plodding along at a benign rate when the things they need to buy are rising at a much faster pace .
" The income of the pensioner population is very modest .
They are much more affected by what happens on food and energy than things like furniture or plasma TVs , which may be falling .
" The average pension rose by 3.9 per cent this month - around £ 3.40 a week .
" That goes nowhere near matching the higher bills .
Household budgets are going into the red . "
The latest figures from the AA show an average litre of unleaded petrol is 108.1 p , up by 16.5 per cent in a year .
Diesel has soared by 23.3 per cent in a year to 117.4 p a litre .
AA spokesman Luke Bosdet suggested the £ 5 gallon of unleaded - 110 p a litre - would become commonplace within a matter of weeks .
Falls in " must - pay " bills are relatively - hard to find .
In theory the cost of mortgages should be coming down following cuts in the Bank of England base rate .
However , the reality is that many deals are are going up as mortgage firms cover their diminishing margins in the face of the credit crunch created largely by their own risky lending .
Fixed - rate loans are considerably more expensive than a year ago , adding hundreds of pounds to annual outgoings .
NY Times ' bracing for bloodbath , ' columnist says RAW STORY
Published : Friday April 25 , 2008

Print This Email This " The New York Times newsroom is bracing for a bloodbath in the next 10 days . "
So says NY Post columnist Keith Kelly .
The word from inside is that approximately 50 unionized journalists have accepted the buyout proposal , and only another 20 non-union editorial employees have gotten on board .
That means the ax could fall on as many as 30 editorial people in the company 's first - ever mass firing of journalists in its 156 - year history .
Executive Editor William Keller had said originally that he was looking to cut 100 people from the Times staff in response to the dismal newspaper advertising environment ...
With just 70 people stepping forward for buyouts , it is very likely that 30 newsroom staffers will be forced out in coming days .
A Times spokesman tells RAW STORY that no decisions have been made yet regarding lay offs .
" The details of the staff reduction are still under discussion internally , and no decisions have yet been reached on the scale of the buyouts , " said Abbe Ruttenberg Serphos , the Times public relations director , in an e-mail Friday afternoon .
Kelly says the Times does n't intend to make cuts at the business or national desk , because of competitive pressure from the Wall Street Journal , owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation .
The Metro desk , he says , is expected to take most of the cuts .
Tuesday was the deadline for employees choosing to accept buyout packages , which offer three weeks of severance for each year worked .
Management and other non-unionized employees were to have accepted their buyout offers by Monday .
Anthony Napoli , a Newspaper Guild representative , said his office was not sure how names were turned in .
" The process is not finalized , " he said .
" We 're waiting for the Times to tell us how many have been returned and how many have been accepted . "
' Hunters & Shooters ' endorse Obama , group says he supports gun rights Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday April 16 , 2008

Print This Email This Less than a week after coming under fire for saying small - town Pennsylvanians " cling to " gun rights , Barack Obama picked up the endorsement of a pro-gun association that has backed Democratic candidates in the past .
The American Hunters & Shooters Association said Obama 's views of the 2nd Amendment have been unfairly criticized and its endorsement comes as Obama 's opponents are characterizing him as an " elitist " and condescending towards gun-owners .
The group sets itself apart from the " more extreme " elements of the pro-gun lobby like the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of America .
Unlike them , AHSA favors some gun-control measures like background checks and required safety courses for concealed weapons permits .
( The NRA has accused the group of being a front for the anti-gun lobby . )
Ray Schoenke , the hunters association 's president , cited Obama 's support of an amendment to a Department of Homeland Security funding bill that would prevent the government from confiscating citizens ' guns during an emergency .
Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) , Obama 's opponent in the Democratic primary , and 16 other senators voted against the amendment .
" She turned her back on America 's gun owners , " Schoenke said during a conference call organized by the Obama campaign Wednesday .
Schoenke said the group reached out to the Obama campaign several weeks ago , before the recent controversy surrounding his comments about small - town voters .
In announcing their support in the midst of the controversy , though , the group hoped to " set the record straight , " about Obama 's support of an individual 's right to gun ownership , he said .
" We understand that the gun issue is going to be very important in this election , " said Bob Ricker , the group 's executive director , citing an ongoing Supreme Court case regarding a handgun ban in Washington , DC .
" Up until this time , the candidates have n't really been willing to talk about guns . "
It was only hours after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg finally made it clear he was not running for president that his chief political guru , Kevin Sheekey , publicly floated the notion that he would be the perfect running mate for Senator Barack Obama .
So Mr. Bloomberg ’s highly orchestrated introduction of Mr. Obama at a speech at the Cooper Union this morning quickly resuscitated speculation that the billionaire mayor could end up in the White House after all .
( The Caucus has a roundup of the blog commentary . )
But despite a few jokes and a stiff embrace , the men seemed nothing like two peas in the same political pod , destined to share a ticket .
In presenting Mr. Obama , Mr. Bloomberg pointedly noted that he has not endorsed a candidate , saying that now was the time for people to listen to the candidates ’ ideas .
Referring to the ostensibly private breakfast the two men shared at a Midtown coffee shop in November with a throng of news media pressed against the window , Mr. Bloomberg joked that it was his pleasure to introduce him , “ and not just because he picked up the check . ”
Mr. Obama had kind words for Mr. Bloomberg as well , saying that he had “ demonstrated extraordinary leadership . ”
He joked : “ The reason I bought breakfast is because I expected payback .
I ’m no dummy .
The mayor was a cheap date that morning .
There are some good steakhouses in this city . ”
But during the speech , Mr. Bloomberg sat on the side near an exit without applauding , maintaining a stance of political neutrality by keeping his hands in his lap as Mr. Obama went after Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , the Democrat from New York , and John McCain , a Republican Mr. Bloomberg counts as a friend .
Still , with recent meetings with Al Gore and Chuck Hagel , interest in Mr. Bloomberg ’s future has been running high , at least among the political consultants and the media who wonder if Mr. Bloomberg could make a back - door run at the presidency by teaming up with Mr. Obama or Mr. McCain , or if a cabinet position , like Treasury Secretary , will be in the offing .
Stu Loeser , Mr. Bloomberg ’s press secretary , sought to dampen the vice presidential notion , saying , “ He ’s trying to shape and influence the campaigns , he ’s not trying to join one . ”
Still , Mr. Bloomberg gained in another way , as Mr. Obama endorsed his congestion pricing proposal .
Michael Powell contributed reporting .
Never keep your emotions bottled up
Last week I was considering the purchase of a piece of software .
I went to the vendor 's website for pricing .
It was n't there .
Annoyed , I filled out the form so that I could be contacted by one of their sales people .
The following day I got a response :
Thanks for considering ( product name deleted ) .
Please write back to me with your phone # or call me at the # below -- we can discuss pricing as I learn about your application and how you plan to use ( product name deleted ) for development .
So I sent an email with the following response :
Hi ( name deleted ) ,
OK .
Please bear with me for just a moment while I vent .
#ifdef FRUSTRATED_RANT
First , I hate the fact that you guys do n't put pricing on your website .
I looked up the old version of your site using archive.org , so I 've got a ballpark idea of what the pricing was around six months ago .
Mostly I just want to know if anything has changed .
Second , it 's absurd that when a customer asks for pricing , you wo n't give it to them .
Instead , you answer the question with a question .
I 'm not even the slightest bit interested in telling you about our application and how we plan to use ( product name deleted ) for development .
I just want to know your pricing and your license terms .
And for the hat trick , it 's incredibly frustrating that you want to do this by phone .
I hate phones with a passion , especially when they 're completely unnecessary .
Bottom line : I 'm interested in buying your product .
The only obstacle in my way is YOU .
If your product did n't have such a great reputation , I would give up right now .
#endif
OK , sorry about that .
I figured if I get all this off my chest then I 'll have a much better chance of getting through our phone call without saying anything rude .
Please call me at 217 - XXX - YYYY .
I promise to be nice . :-)

Fortunately , my " vent before the call " strategy worked out very well .
The sales person called me and we had a very pleasant and cordial conversation .

( Check out our complete guide to Banksy Art and Graffiti . )
Banksy is probably the most popular , yet most mysterious , urban street artist in the world – and he works at incredible extremes .
He has become an internationally known as a subversive graffiti artist – yet manages to maintain a secret identity .
He is a counter - cultural prankster , but has art in major cosmopolitan galleries around the globe .
Banksy ’s work has sold to Hollywood celebrities for over a half - million dollars a piece , but much of his subvertising is freely ( and illegally ) drawn on public surfaces .
He works against the mass media establishment , but has been featured in local , national , international news .
He is on some level clearly a geek at heart but at the same time his art is always on the cutting edge .
The following seven examples illustrate the fascinating range of Banksy ’s life and works through his most controversial and compelling projects .
Banksy in the Streets : Banksy is a household name in the UK , perhaps best known for his compelling stencil graffiti , found throughout major cities on walls and billboards .
He avoids the abstraction of traditional tags , instead creating ( often photo - realistic ) urban street art images that respond to a given context and contain some form of social commentary .
Of course , these are all highly illegal , which is part of the reason Banksy shields his identity .
Banksy in Museums : Banksy has been an internationally notorious figure since covertly adding his own works onto the walls of major museums in both the UK and the US .
He managed to sneak in and install a fake prehistoric cave painting into the British Museum .
This piece went unnoticed for days , and was later added to the museum ’s permanent collection !
Banksy also slipped subversive and satirical painted works onto the walls of four major New York museums – two of these four pieces remain in place .
Banksy on the West Bank : Braving threats and even warning shots from Israeli security forces , Banksy managed to make a statement through his works on the West Bank barrier .
Reactions were mixed to his contributions to the wall , but the coverage certainly raised global attention .
This kind of work shows the development of Banksy from a local subversive to an artist with a global political agenda , reminiscent of the amazing political murals of Belfast , Northern Ireland .
Banksy on Paris Hilton : Despite the gravity of some of his work , Banksy is no stranger to subverty pop culture icons .
In one of his most famous stunts , Banksy replaced 500 copies of a Paris Hilton CD with his own remixes and cover art .
Perhaps even more amazing : it was reported that no one who accidentally purchased Banksy ’s version of the CD returned it .
Banksy ’s fame has grown as has taken on more attention - grabbing subjects , from international relations to pop icons .
Banksy for Sale : Works of the elusive Banksy have sold for over $ 500,000 a piece .
Among his fans are Hollywood hotshots Brad Pitt , Angelina Jolie , Keanu Reeves and Christina Aguilera .
One family in Bristol – Banksy ’s home town – went so far as to list their house for sale as a mural with a building attached , to find buyers interested in preserving the art on the side of the structure .
Bansky gets Stolen : Unfortunately , with Banksy ’s fame has come a price for curators and communities who have and enjoy his work .
Popular pieces have both been stolen from museums and dissappeared from the urban landscape , only to be resold for profit .
The former is to be expected , perhaps , but the latter is a real blow to communities that know and appreciate Banksy ’s contribution to their neighborhood .
Banksy for Free : On Banksy ’s website , images of his work are sold for free and he humorously encourages ‘ buyers ’ to print it out “ on gloss paper using the company printer ink when everyone else is at lunch . ”
However , the works mentioned here and the pieces shown on his site are only a fraction of his contributions .
To learn more , buy one of Banksy ’s books – or better yet , take one from the library , replace the dust cover , keep the book and return something provocative in its place !
This video provides a great introduction to the mysteries surrounding Banksy .
His work remains more controversial than the leave - no - trace types of urban street art , such as light graffiti , projection bombing or other unusually legal street art .
Though his work is sometimes legal and sometimes not , he remains an anonymous trickster , evading identification by the public and the law much like the anonymous subvertisers and culture jammers of the street art world .
Despite a reduction in violence over the past 15 months , “ the U.S. risks getting bogged down in Iraq for a long time to come , with serious consequences for its interests in other parts of the world , ” according to a new assessment by the same group of experts who advised the bipartisan blue - ribbon Iraq Study Group ( ISG ) in 2006 .
The assessment , which was released on the eve of critical congressional testimony this week by Washington ’s ambassador and chief military officer in Iraq , concludes that the decline in violence has resulted in very little progress toward achieving national reconciliation and that gains in security remain “ fragile and dependent on the presence of U.S. forces . ”
“ Political progress is so slow , halting , and superficial , and social and political fragmentation so pronounced , that the U.S. is no closer to being able to leave Iraq than it was a year ago , ” according to the report released by the U.S. Institute of Peace ( USIP ) and entitled “ Iraq After the Surge : Options and Questions . ”
“ Lasting political development could take five to 10 years of full , unconditional U.S. commitment to Iraq , ” it concluded , noting that such a commitment already “ carries a massive cost , both human and financial , in addition to the global interests the U.S. is sacrificing to its commitment in Iraq .
Even if progress in Iraq continues , the results may not be worth the cost , ” it warned .
The report , which lays out three possible options for U.S. policy in Iraq over the next year or so , comes just two days before Ambassador Ryan Crocker and Gen.
David Petraeus are to ask that Washington suspend its current drawdown of U.S. “ surge ” forces in Iraq at the anticipated 140,000 - troop level by the end of July to ensure that security gains achieved over the past year can be sustained .
At the height of the surge several months ago , Washington had about 170,000 troops in Iraq .
That recommendation , which appears to enjoy the backing of U.S. President George W. Bush , is likely to be hotly disputed by Democrats in Congress who favor continuing to withdraw combat troops at the rate of about 5,000 a month through the end of the year  a position privately shared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who have fretted publicly that maintaining high levels of deployment in Iraq is taking an unsustainable toll on both the morale of U.S. ground forces and their readiness to deal with other potential military crises .
The new USIP report , which represents the views of scores of military and regional experts who advised the bipartisan , congressionally appointed Iraq Study Group ( ISG ) two years ago , will almost certainly give the dissenters ammunition in their questioning of Crocker and Petraeus .
The ISG , which was co-chaired by former Secretary of State James Baker and former Democratic Rep. Lee Hamilton , had called in December 2006 for withdrawing all U.S. combat troops by April 2008 , leaving the remaining troops  around 80,000  to focus on training and equipping Iraqi security forces , conducting operations against al - Qaeda in Iraq , and protecting U.S. civilian personnel .
Bush , however , rejected that recommendation and opted instead for a surge strategy that increased U.S. troop strength by about 30,000 in hopes that the additional forces would substantially reduce sectarian violence in and around Baghdad and encourage Iraq ’s warring political and religious factions to make the compromises necessary for national reconciliation .
While the strategy has made major advances on the security front , progress toward reconciliation has been largely consisted of “ tactical horse - trading ” designed above all to satisfy minimum U.S. “ benchmarks ”  such as revenue sharing and a reform of the de-Ba’athification laws  to ensure Washington ’s continued support , according to the report .
“ [ T ] hough positive as far as it goes , [ it ] has not alleviated the underlying causes of political instability in Iraq or facilitated the emergence of a truly national polity , ” the report concluded , noting as well that “ much of [ the ] success [ of the current strategy ] is due to factors that are outside U.S. control and therefore subject to change . ”
Among those factors are a cease - fire by the Moqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army and the willingness of former Sunni insurgents “ stridently opposed to the [ Shia - led ] Iraqi government ” to cooperate with U.S. forces against al - Qaeda in Iraq .
The report suggests two possible alternatives to the current policy of an “ unconditional ” U.S. commitment to Iraq .
The first , an echo of the 2006 ISG report , calls for a “ reduced , conditional commitment ” that would tie future U.S. support for the government in Baghdad to a few minimal goals  creating a mechanism for oil - revenue sharing , holding provincial elections to formalize a decentralized power structure , and professionalizing a nonsectarian army to “ guard the state and police factional violence . ”
If Baghdad failed to make meaningful progress toward these goals by the end of this year , then the U.S. would withdraw its forces according to its own timetable .
If it did make such progress , Washington would still reduce its forces and focus on training and equipping the Iraqi army and helping it prevent factional violence .
A second option would be an “ unconditional , near - total reduction of the U.S. military commitment ” coupled with “ an enhanced security presence in the region , an invigorated diplomatic effort [ directed primarily at Iran and Saudi Arabia ] , and continuing political support for the Iraqi government . ”
Each of these options , including the current strategy of unconditional commitment , carries different risks and possible benefits for U.S. interests in Iraq , the region , and beyond , according to the report , which identifies five “ paramount interests ” affected by U.S. policy in Iraq .
They include preventing Iraq from becoming a haven or platform for international terrorists ; restoring U.S. credibility , prestige , and capacity to act worldwide ; improving regional stability ; limiting and redirecting Iranian influence ; and maintaining an independent Iraq as a single state .
The report addresses the possible impact of each of the three scenarios on the five interests .
Maintaining the current strategy , it concludes would have a “ major negative impact ” on Washington ’s capacity to act worldwide ; a reduced , conditional commitment would , on the other hand , have a “ positive ” impact on that capacity , while an unconditional , near - total reduction of commitment would have a mixed impact by , on the one hand freeing up U.S. military capacity , while , on the other , risking the “ perception of U.S. defeat . ”

A lawyer who sent out hundreds of thousands of threatening letters demanding that alleged file - sharers pay 400 euros , has been banned from operating for 6 months .
Elizabeth Martin , who had been working with Swiss anti-piracy outfit , Logistep , was condemned by the Paris Bar Council .
For anti-piracy company , Logistep , life is becoming more and more difficult by the day .
They have been deemed to be operating illegally in Italy and have been slammed over privacy issues in the home country , Switzerland .
Now , according to a report – and to add further insult to this growing pile of misery – a lawyer they ’ve been working with in France has just found herself in an awful lot of trouble .
Lawyer Elizabeth Martin had been demanding 400 Euros from hundreds of thousands of file - sharers who Logistep say had been infringing the rights of software company Techland , on their game ‘ Call of Juarez ’ .
In her letters she warned alleged file - sharers that should it be necessary to take anyone to court , the costs would be substantial .
File - sharers were also led to believe that should they be found guilty , they would not only be responsible for their own costs , but those of the other side – with an indication that the decision against them would mount to “ hundreds of thousands of euros ” .
Of course , none of these letters are complete without some threats and intimidation .
Elizabeth Martin – just like the UK’s Davenport Lyons – finishes up with with a threat totally disproportionate to any petty copyright offense .
“ If you are not able to pay the damages ordered by the court , our client will seek to gain the amount by the sale of your goods ” .
This wording is very similar to other letters received all across Europe , including those received from UK lawyers Davenport Lyons , who are also working with Logistep in exactly the same manner .
Their version is “ In the event that you were not able to pay whatever sums the court may direct , our client would have no option but to take steps to enforce the debt against your property . ”
Unfortunately for Elizabeth Martin , it ’s not just the general public who are disgusted by her actions .
She has been the subject of a Conseil de l ’Ordre du Barreau de Paris disciplinary investigation – and subsequent condemnation – by none other than her own peers .
How embarrassing .
The disciplinary board decided that “ By choosing to reproduce aggressive foreign methods , intended to force payments , the interested party also violated [ the code ] which specifies that the lawyer cannot unfairly represent a situation or seriousness of threat . ”
In addition , the lawyer also violated the code by cashing payments into a private account , not the usual dedicated litigation account , known as a ‘ Carpa ’ .
Martin also refused to reveal how many payments had been received from file - sharers .
For these serious breaches , Elizabeth Martin was ordered by the disciplinary board to suspend her activities as a lawyer for 6 months .
Furthermore , she was banned from belonging to the National Council of the Bars ( CNB ) and other such professional associations for a period of 10 years .

At the same time , prices set in international rice trading now have an increasingly important effect on prices within countries .
This has been particularly true in an age of Internet and mobile phone communications when even farmers in remote areas can learn about distant prices and decide whether their own buyers are giving them a fair price .
Even before governments imposed restrictions this week , trading companies in exporting nations had become increasingly reluctant to sign contracts for future delivery as they wait to see how high prices will go .
“ The market has pretty much ground to a halt for the past few weeks , ” said Ben Savage , the managing director for rice at Jackson Son & Company , a commodities trading firm in London .
Soaring prices are already causing hardship across the developing world .
In a crumbling covered market in an old neighborhood of Hanoi , Cao Minh Huong , a ceramics saleswoman , said that rising food prices , especially for rice , were forcing her to change her diet .
“ I ’m spending the same amount on food but I ’m getting less , ” she said .
Together with rising prices for other foods , like wheat , soybeans , pork and cooking oil , higher rice prices are also contributing to inflation in many developing countries .
Retail rice prices have already jumped by as much as 60 percent in recent months in Vietnam , trailing increases in wholesale prices but leading a broader acceleration in inflation .
Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung of Vietnam announced Wednesday that the government ’s top priority now was fighting inflation .
Overall consumer prices are more than 19 percent higher this month than last March . .
The inflation rate has nearly tripled in the last year .
Rice is unusual among major agricultural commodities in that most of the major rice - consuming countries are self - sufficient or nearly so .
Only 7 percent of the world ’s rice production is traded across international borders each year , according to figures from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome .
Nguyen Van
Bo , the president of the Vietnam Academy of Agricultural Sciences , which oversees government farm research institutes , said in an interview that the government expected rice production to rise further by 2010 despite the rapid expansion of residential housing and factories into what had been prime rice - growing land .
But the government needs to train farmers to alternate corn with rice to defeat rice pests like the virus , he said .
HEALTH INSURANCE CRISIS HEALTH INSURANCE CRISIS
$ 12 M fine sought against insurer over cancelled policies Fewer small firms offer health insurance Employer - provided insurance continues to decline Seniors must shop as Medicare drug premiums rise Texas struggles with most uninsured South lags in report card on health care More
The percentage of people with health insurance through their employers — traditionally the way most people get coverage — is continuing to shrink , raising anxiety among workers and invigorating a debate about whether insurance should be tied to jobs .
Many of those who get their coverage through their jobs are becoming less secure that those benefits will always be there .
YOUR THOUGHTS : How would you make sure those who needed care could afford it ?
" It 's going to disappear , " says Angela Ruggiero of North Port , Fla. , who lost her insurance when she and her husband changed jobs .
" There 's no way employers can continue to pay premiums if they continue increasing . "
Her concern is reflected in the ongoing discussions among policymakers , politicians and some business leaders over whether to alter the link between employment and insurance .
Several ideas have been floated , including a range of proposals in Congress .
The measures can be lumped into differing philosophies about the direction the USA should move : either toward a health insurance market in which people buy policies on their own while armed with tax credits or deductions , or one in which people are able to buy insurance through group - like " exchanges , " with some government oversight .
Some of the plans likely would encourage employers to drop coverage because the employers would lose all or part of their ability to write off insurance as a business expense .
Federal legislation is unlikely this year .
But the chatter about fundamental changes in health insurance comes as a declining percentage of employers are offering coverage .
That 's fueling concern among consumers such as Ruggiero who say the system is n't working and is poised to leave rising numbers of people — particularly those with health problems — struggling to get insurance :
• The percentage of all employers offering health insurance in the past eight years peaked in 2000 at 69 % and has fallen steadily since , hitting 60 % this year , according to an annual survey of employers by the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation .
Among small firms of three to nine workers , the percentage offering insurance has dropped even more — from 58 % in 2001 to 45 % this year .
• From 2001 to 2005 , the number of uninsured U.S. workers rose by 3.4 million .
Almost 19 million workers — 17 % of all employees — were uninsured in 2005 , according to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured .
" I do n't think people realize " how easy it is to become uninsured , says Ruggiero , 41 , who says she used to think " the only uninsured Americans were the homeless . "
Three years ago , she and her husband , John , left jobs with health benefits in New York to move to Florida to strike out on their own : John as a real estate agent and Angela as an office manager for an financial planner .
Neither job came with health insurance .
Then they learned how difficult it is to buy health insurance outside of employment , mainly because they both had some minor health conditions .
They were hopeful about an " open enrollment " period allowed each year under Florida law .
During that time , insurers must offer coverage to sole proprietors and may not exclude those with medical problems .
But for the Ruggieros , the cost of coverage was out of the question : $ 1,500 a month to cover the couple and their 11 - year - old son , Jared .
So they remained uninsured until last January .
When the real estate market tanked , John took a job as a package handler for a shipping firm , a position he still holds part time because it provides his family with health insurance .
Eventually , John quit real estate sales and took another full - time job in a warehouse .
The warehouse job offers health insurance , but his share of the monthly premiums would have been $ 300 , or about 10 % of his income , so he declined .
Insurance from his part - time job does n't cost anything out of his paycheck .
" It 's a lot of juggling , " says Angela Ruggiero .
Paying more for coverage Like the Ruggieros , most people with insurance get coverage through their jobs .
Among people with health insurance , the Census reports that 59.7 % got it through their jobs in 2006 , down from 60.2 % in 2005 .
And they 're paying more for it .
The average amount workers pay toward the premium for a typical family policy rose from $ 129 a month in 1999 ( about $ 160 in today 's dollars ) to $ 273 this year , a jump of 70 % when adjusted for inflation , the Kaiser survey of employers shows .
The increases come mainly because premiums have soared , rising at several times the rate of inflation in most years .
In many cases , cost - cutting employers have increased the share of the premiums that workers pay .
For years , Lyle Kenaga , president of Business Cards Tomorrow in Nashville , paid 100 % of the premiums for his 15 - employee firm .
But two years of 20 % rate increases from his insurer forced him to reduce the amount his company pays toward coverage .
This year , the firm pays 70 % of the premium cost ; workers pick up the rest .
If huge increases in premiums continue , " We 'll have to consider whether or not to continue providing coverage , " he says .
Premiums continue to go up , although the rate of increase has slowed in the past couple of years .
This year , the average increase faced by employers was 6.1 % , according to the Kaiser survey , well below the recent peak increase of 13.9 % in 2003 .
Such premium increases weigh heaviest on lower - income workers .
For example , a household earning $ 40,000 this year would have to pay 8 % of its pretax income to cover the average share paid by workers — $ 3,281 — for a typical family policy offered by employers , which this year cost $ 12,106 .
That does n't include deductibles and co-payments that those with coverage must pay .
" People should be nervous , " says Len Nichols , an economist at the Washington think tank New America Foundation .
" People are n't so afraid of losing their jobs as ( of ) not being able to afford health insurance even with a good job , " he says .
For many small employers , years of premium increases have given them few options :
Raise the amount workers pay , drop coverage or reduce benefits .
" When they hit us with another 25 % increase for this year , we had to re-evaluate , " says Howard Chanin , president and co-owner of 17 - employee Butler Mortgage in Kissimmee , Fla .
Chanin asked his workers whether they 'd rather have higher deductibles or higher premiums .
They wanted the lower premiums .
So the annual deductible — the amount workers pay , in addition to premiums , for medical care before their insurance coverage begins — went from $ 500 a year to $ 2,500 .
" We 're taking it year by year , " Chanin says .
Looking for answers
Many large employers are uncomfortable with the growing cost of health insurance , but few want to get out of offering coverage entirely .
" They see it as a way to compete for skilled workers , and they do sense that they have a compact with the employee not to walk away from it , " says Robert Laszewski , president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates , a consulting firm that works with insurers and other health care clients .
Many small employers also say they want to continue offering benefits .
" I ca n't imagine not offering insurance , " says Diane Dearing , owner of Display Structures in Troy , Mich .
Because of rising costs , Dearing had to change insurers this year — and put more than half of her 20 employees into an HMO , which has a specific list of doctors and hospitals that it covers , rather than a more expensive preferred - provider organization with a wider choice of doctors .
Her workers pay 25 % of the premium .
" It 's a huge expense , " Dearing says .
" But even if I had to go to something like a high - deductible major medical plan , if we 're in business and making anything at all , we will still provide insurance . "
The idea of separating insurance from employment has been raised before .
" Even in the height of a strong economy , people were talking about it , " says Paul Fronstin of the Employee Benefit Research Institute , which published a book in 1999 called Severing the Link Between Health Insurance and Employment .
" Now it 's taking on a new life . "
Among other things , critics of the current system say it grants tax breaks to corporations that offer coverage , and tax - free benefits to the workers who get coverage .
At the same time , low - wage workers who do n't get insurance through their jobs not only do n't have coverage , but also do n't get the tax break .
" The employer - based system is fundamentally unjust , " says Guy Clifton , a professor of neurosurgery at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston who is in Washington as a Robert Wood Johnson health policy fellow .
Proposals to modify the health insurance system — or sever it from employment — are gaining currency across the political spectrum , from presidential candidates to Congress to business groups .
Some of the proposals now under debate would encourage people — armed with tax credits or deductions — to buy their own insurance on the private market , but would not require anyone to buy it or insurers to sell to all who apply .
Other proposals would require all individuals to have coverage and would create " exchanges " in which groups of residents and employees could buy health insurance , regardless of where or if they work .
Insurers would be required to sell policies even to applicants with health problems .
In Congress , a bipartisan bill — unusual for a health - reform effort — has been proposed by Sens. Ron Wyden , D - Ore. , and Bob Bennett , R - Utah .
It would have employers drop coverage and give workers raises , then create exchanges that would allow everyone to buy insurance .
Even the president of the Service Employees International Union , Andrew Stern , has said that employer - based coverage is dead and an alternative should be found .
" It 's a terrible idea to rely on the individual market as it's presently constituted , " says Jacob Hacker , professor of political science at Yale , mainly because those with medical conditions find it difficult to get coverage and insurers fear that people wait until they know they need health care to buy it .
Sara Horowitz , founder and director of the Freelancers Union — whose members are independent workers in finance , non-profits , domestic services , publishing , advertising and health care — says something needs to change , because the working world has .
" The nature of work is changing : Jobs are much more short - term and flexible , " Horowitz says .
" That 's why we need to think about new kinds of models … and start building a portable benefits network . "
Change is not likely soon , however .
Efforts to revamp health insurance have begun in a few states — including Massachusetts , Vermont and Maine — but no big changes will occur nationally until well after the November 2008 election .
And although it 's eroding , employer coverage is n't going to end suddenly .
" Employer coverage wo n't go away overnight , unless there 's a major change to federal legislation that oversees health insurance , " says the employee benefit institute 's Fronstin .
" Employers do n't have to offer it , but they see a business case for offering it , and they do n't ( currently ) see a viable alternative . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Supreme Court justices questioned on Tuesday whether federal judges in the United States can block U.S. military officials in Iraq from turning over Americans to Iraqi authorities for trial or punishment .
A general view of Baghdad 's Camp Cropper Theater Internment Facility where more than 4,000 detainees are held by Coalition Forces , is seen in this undated Department of Defense handout picture released February 12 , 2008 .

Several justices appeared concerned about extending the reach of U.S. courts to Iraq in a case that could significantly affect the legal rights of American civilians who have been captured during the Iraq war .
Bush administration lawyer Gregory Garre argued U.S. courts lack the authority to intervene in the cases of the two Americans , who are being held by U.S. soldiers at Camp Cropper near Baghdad International Airport .
Mohammad Munaf , an Iraqi - American with dual citizenship , was convicted in Iraq and sentenced to death for his suspected role in the 2005 kidnapping of three Romanian journalists .
His conviction was later overturned by an Iraqi court and his case sent back for further investigation .
The other case involved Shawqi Omar , an American - Jordanian citizen who is accused of being a senior associate of the late insurgent leader Abu Musab al - Zarqawi .
Lawyers for the two men say they might be tortured or even killed if they are transferred to Iraqi custody .
The United States has about 158,000 troops in Iraq after it led an invasion five years ago .
The number of U.S. military personnel killed in Iraq passed 4,000 earlier this week .
Garre argued the two men are being held under the auspices of multinational forces in Iraq , of which the U.S. contingent is only a part .
But Joseph Margulies , the lawyer for Omar and Munaf , disagreed .
‘ BUCK STOPS WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT ’
He said the two men clearly were under the control of the U.S. military and should have access to U.S. courts to challenge their detention .
“ The buck stops with the United States government when it comes to these detentions , ” he said .
Margulies faced a number of skeptical questions from the court ’s conservative justices .
“ To say that the whole world has rights under the U.S. Constitution is extravagant , ” Justice Antonin Scalia said .
Chief Justice John Roberts asked Margulies for a “ bright line ” that determines if U.S. courts have jurisdiction .
He expressed doubt that military control over someone in the middle of a zone of hostilities in a foreign nation would establish jurisdiction .
Justice Samuel Alito expressed concern that thousands of non-U.S. citizens being held in Iraq might be able to file petitions in U.S. court so they could not be turned over except under the terms of the extradition treaty between the United States and Iraq .
A ruling is expected by the end of June .
The justices also heard arguments on whether Ahmed Ressam , the would - be millennium bomber accused of plotting to blow up Los Angeles International Airport , was properly convicted on one of the nine charges on which he was found guilty .
A U.S. appeals court reversed his conviction on the one count of carrying explosives while committing the felony of lying on a customs form .
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey argued the conviction should be reinstated but faced skeptical questions from the justices and he used up only about half of 30 minutes of time .
Traditionally , the attorney general argues at least one Supreme Court case , but President George W. Bush ’s first two attorneys general , John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales , did not argue before the court .

Well , a girl can dream .
But this prosthetic hand , inspired , I kid you not by spiders ' legs , has scored highly in tests .
Currently a prototype , Fluidhand is battery - powered , with five electric motors — one in each finger .
Soren Wolf , an 18 - year - old patient at Heidelberg University Hospital was the first person to try out the device , alongside the iLIMB , which , unlike the Fluidhand , is controlled using myoelectric signals from the stump of the arm .

The Fluidhand works on different principles , and its digits are based on the biological principle of the spider leg — elastic chambers in the joints are pumped up by miniature hydraulics , thus allowing flexibility .
This allows each individual digit to be moved independently .
Perhaps the most astonishing thing about the device is that it gives feedback to the stump , which allows the wearer to sense just how strong the grip is .
Of the two hands , Soren said that the Fluidhand just had the edge over the iLIMB .
It is currently only a prototype , but the inventors are looking for investment .
Maybe George Lucas would be interested .

A backlog of up to 28,000 bags formed after problems at T5 The luggage of a passenger who died on a British Airways flight was among items lost during Terminal 5 baggage problems , BA has confirmed .
The man collapsed and died on a flight from Hong Kong to Heathrow airport on 2 April .
His luggage is among thousands of unreturned bags at the new T5 .
His son said : " To lose the luggage of a dead person is unforgivable . "
A BA spokesman said they were doing their " utmost " to return the man 's baggage to his family .
Writing on pilot and cabin crew website Pprune , the man 's son - an ex-BA employee - said his father collapsed after coming out of the toilet on flight BA26 .
" If we could have his bags back ( including hand baggage ) , that would be nice , " he said .
" I have no energy left to get angry about this . "
' Very distressed '
Problems with the baggage system at T5 meant hundreds of flights had to be cancelled after it opened on 27 March , and a backlog of up to 28,000 bags formed .
Many items of luggage have been sent to Milan , Italy , and Memphis in the US to be sorted .
A BA spokesman confirmed that the man died during the 2 April flight .
" The cabin crew did everything they could for him and were very distressed following the incident , " he said .
" We have been in constant touch with his family and have been doing our utmost to return his baggage to them . "
The man 's son asked any crew members to tell him exactly what happened at the time of his father 's death .
" I 'm certain that everything possible was done for him and he was left for the remainder of the flight in dignity , " he said .
" I just want to know if he had any last words and if he was in pain . "

What are these ?
Flowers make people happy .
And while that might seem obvious , there has n't been much research to prove the point until now .
A trio of new studies by Rutgers University scientists supports the notion pretty strongly , and the experts go on to speculate that flowers have flourished on this planet , with their beauty evolving in recent millennia , partly because humans are so attached to them .
The first study involved 147 women .
All those who got flowers smiled .
Make a note : all of them .
That 's the kind of statistical significance scientists love .
Among the women who got candles , 23 percent did n't smile .
And 10 percent of those who got fruit did n't smile .
Okay , that 's just one study .
Let 's try another .
In an elevator , 122 men and women were given either a flower , a pen , or nothing .
Those who got flowers smiled more , talked more , and -- here it gets interesting -- stood closer together .
Finally , in another test , bouquets were delivered by florists to 113 men and women in a retirement community .
All 113 got flowers and a notebook , but some got them earlier and received a second bouquet when the others got theirs .
By now you can guess the outcome .
The more flowers , the more smiles .
From there , it 's a bit of a leap to the idea that flowers are prolific because we love them .
But the results got the scientists to thinking about how the flower industry of today has evolved into growing things that serve no other purpose than emotional satisfaction .
Nature wo n't even pollinate many of the domesticated flowers .
Just among roses , there are so many types conjured by humans that , clearly , flowers are n't what they used to be .
But it 's likely our collective hand has played a role longer than you might think .
Rutgers geneticist Terry McGuire suggests that nature 's prettier flowers got to survive and thrive because people did n't destroy them when they cleared land for agriculture .
Instead , they cultivated them and have been doing so for more than 5,000 years .
" Our hypothesis is that flowers are exploiting an emotional niche .
They make us happy , " McGuire says .
" Because they are a source of pleasure - a positive emotion inducer - we take care of them .
In that sense they 're like dogs .
They are the pets of the plant world . "
Here 's one way it might have worked :
Many species of flowers that are now cultivated used to sprout only when the ground was disturbed , McGuire explains .
" As humans moved into agricultural settings these flowers would have been weeds , " he told LiveScience .
" These flowers might have been tolerated because of their beauty .
The seeds would have been preserved -- perhaps initially because they were mixed with crop seeds -- and replanted .
Humans would have become the seed dispersers .
Over time , the best of these flowers might have been selected and the seeds more carefully preserved . "
The idea is detailed in the journal Evolutionary Psychology .

Life expectancy has long been growing steadily for most Americans .
But it has not for a significant minority , according to a new study , which finds a growing disparity in mortality depending on race , income and geography .
The study , published Monday in the online journal PLoS , analyzed life expectancy in all 3,141 counties in the United States from 1961 to 1999 , the latest year for which complete data have been released by the National Center for Health Statistics .
Although life span has generally increased since 1961 , the authors reported , it began to level off or even decline in the 1980s for 4 percent of men and 19 percent of women .

Ironically , the Sony does n't have an HDMI HDCP input , but it can upconvert all Blu-ray and HD DVD content to 4,096 x 2,160 in analog .
There 's also a secondary projector , if you 're just dying for the olden days of " full HD . "

The sound system is 8.8 channel , though I can't figure out why it 's not 9.16 , or even 11.16 , given the fact that there are eight Snell THX towers spaced all around , plus three Snell center - channel speakers , all powered by a combination of solid - state and tube amplifiers .
As I hinted , the low end is handled by 16 Snell subwoofers .
( I guess this means Snell makes the best speakers money can buy — I 'll just file that away for ... never . )
All of this is crowded into a room that 's not ginormous by any means , just 26.5 x 33 feet , with a single three - cushion menage - a- trois couch as the focal point for all 11,315 watts of juice .
( Fun Fact :
That 's like 11,215 more watts than anything I own . )
Want one ?
Well , you 're in luck , cuz Jeremy Kipnis is selling this design , along with an even bigger one called the Alpha Ciné and a tinier one called the Gamma Ciné .
That 's right : $ 6 million does n't even get you the Alpha ; it gets you the Beta .

The Age of Autism : The Amish anomaly
By Dan Olmsted
UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
Lancaster , PA , Apr. 18 ( UPI ) -- Part 1 of 2 .
Where are the autistic Amish ?
Here in Lancaster County , heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country , there should be well over 100 with some form of the disorder .
I have come here to find them , but so far my mission has failed , and the very few I have identified raise some very interesting questions about some widely held views on autism .
The mainstream scientific consensus says autism is a complex genetic disorder , one that has been around for millennia at roughly the same prevalence .
That prevalence is now considered to be 1 in every 166 children born in the United States .
Applying that model to Lancaster County , there ought to be 130 Amish men , women and children here with Autism Spectrum Disorder .
Well over 100 , in rough terms .
Typically , half would harbor milder variants such as Asperger 's Disorder or the catch - all Pervasive Development Disorder , Not Otherwise Specified -- PDD - NOS for short .
So let 's drop those from our calculation , even though " mild " is a relative term when it comes to autism .
That means upwards of 50 Amish people of all ages should be living in Lancaster County with full - syndrome autism , the " classic autism " first described in 1943 by child psychiatrist Leo Kanner at Johns Hopkins University .
The full - syndrome disorder is hard to miss , characterized by " markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests , " according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders .
Why bother looking for them among the Amish ?
Because they could hold clues to the cause of autism .
The first half - dozen articles in this ongoing series on the roots and rise of autism examined the initial studies and early accounts of the disorder , first identified by Kanner among 11 U.S. children born starting in 1931 .
Kanner wrote that his 1938 encounter with a child from Mississippi , identified as Donald T. , " made me aware of a behavior pattern not known to me or anyone else theretofore . "
Kanner literally wrote the book on " Child Psychiatry , " published in 1934 .
If Kanner was correct -- if autism was new and increasingly prevalent -- something must have happened in the 1930s to trigger those first autistic cases .
Genetic disorders do not begin suddenly or increase dramatically in prevalence in a short period of time .
That is why it is worth looking for autistic Amish -- to test reasoning against reality .
Largely cut off for hundreds of years from American culture and scientific progress , the Amish might have had less exposure to some new factor triggering autism in the rest of population .
Surprising , but no one seems to have looked .
Of course , the Amish world is insular by nature ; finding a small subset of Amish is a challenge by definition .
Many Amish , particularly Old Order , ride horse - and - buggies , eschew electricity , do not attend public school , will not pose for pictures and do not chat casually with the " English , " as they warily call the non-Amish .
Still , some Amish today interact with the outside world in many ways .
Some drive , use phones , see doctors and send out Christmas cards with family photos .
They all still refer to themselves as " Plain , " but the definition of that word varies quite a bit .
So far , from sources inside and outside the Amish community , I have identified three Amish residents of Lancaster County who apparently have full - syndrome autism , all of them children .
A local woman told me there is one classroom with about 30 " special - needs " Amish children .
In that classroom , there is one autistic Amish child .
Another autistic Amish child does not go to school .
The third is that woman 's pre-school - age daughter .
If there were more , she said , she would know it .
What I learned about those children is the subject of the next column .
PART 2 : The Age of Autism : Julia
UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
Leola , PA , Apr. 19 ( UPI ) -- Part 2 of 2 .
Three - year old Julia is napping when I arrive at the spare , neat , cheerful house on Musser School Road near the town of Leola in Lancaster County .
She is the reason I have driven through the budding countryside on this perfect spring day , but I really do not need to meet her .
In the last column , I wrote about trying to find autistic Amish people here in the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country , and noted there should be dozens of them -- if autism occurs at the same prevalence as the rest of the United States .
So far , there is evidence of only three , all of them children , the oldest age 9 or 10 .
Julia is one of them .
I found out about her through a pediatrician in Richmond , Va. , Dr. Mary Megson .
I had been asking around for quite some time about autism and the Amish , and she provided the first direct link .
Megson said she would give my name to this child 's mother , who could call if she chose .
A few days later the phone rang .
It was Stacey - jean Inion , an Amish - Mennonite woman .
She , her husband Brent and their four children live simply , but they do drive a vehicle and have a telephone .
After a few pleasantries , I told her about my trying to find autistic Amish .
Here is what she said , verbatim :
" Unfortunately our autistic daughter -- who 's doing very well , she 's been diagnosed with very , very severe autism -- is adopted from China , and so she would have had all her vaccines in China before we got her , and then she had most of her vaccines given to her in the United States before we got her .
" So we 're probably not the pure case you 're looking for . "
Maybe not , but it was stunning that Julia Inion , the first autistic Amish person I could find , turned out to be adopted -- from another country , no less .
It also was surprising that Stacey - jean launched unbidden into vaccines , because the Amish have a religious exemption from vaccination and presumably would not have given it much thought .
She said a minority of Amish families do , in fact , vaccinate their children these days , partly at the urging of public health officials .
" Almost every Amish family I know has had somebody from the health department knock on our door and try to convince us to get vaccines for our children , " she said .
" The younger Amish more and more are getting vaccines .
It 's a minority of children who vaccinate , but that is changing now . "
Did she know of any other autistic Amish ?
Two more children , she said .
" One of them , we 're very certain it was a vaccine reaction , even though the government would not agree with that . "
Federal health officials have said there is no association between vaccinations and autism or learning disabilities .
" The other one I 'm not sure if this child was vaccinated or not , " she added .
During my visit to their home , I asked Stacey - jean to explain why she attributed the first case to vaccines .
" There 's one family that we know , their daughter had a vaccine reaction and is now autistic .
She was walking and functioning and a happy bright child , and 24 hours after she had her vaccine , her legs went limp and she had a typical high - pitched scream .
They called the doctor and the doctor said it was fine -- a lot of high - pitched screaming goes along with it .
" She completely quit speaking , " Stacey - jean said .
" She completely quit making eye contact with people .
She went in her own world . "
This happened , Stacey - jean said , at " something like 15 months . "
The child is now about 8 .
For similar reasons , Julia Inion 's Chinese background is intriguing .
China , India and Indonesia are among countries moving quickly to mass - vaccination programs .
In some vaccines , they use a mercury - based preservative called thimerosal that keeps multiple - dose vials from becoming contaminated by repeated needle sticks .
Thimerosal was phased out of U.S. vaccines starting in 1999 , after health officials became concerned about the amount of mercury infants and children were receiving .
The officials said they simply were erring on the side of caution , and that all evidence favors rejection of any link between Autism Spectrum Disorders and thimerosal , or vaccines themselves .
Julia 's vaccinations in China -- all given in one day at about age 15 months -- may well have contained thimerosal ; the United States had stopped using it by the time she was born , but other countries with millions to vaccinate had not .
Stacey - jean said photographs of Julia taken in China before she was vaccinated showed a smiling alert child looking squarely at the camera .
Her original adoptive family in the United States , overwhelmed trying to cope with an autistic child , gave Julia up for re-adoption .
The Inions took her in knowing her diagnosis of severe autism .
I tried hard -- and am still trying -- to find people who know about other autistic Amish .
Of the local health and social service agency personnel in Lancaster , some said they dealt with Amish people with disabilities , such as mental retardation , but none recalled seeing an autistic Amish .
Still , I could be trapped in a feedback loop :
The Amish I am likeliest to know about -- because they have the most contact with the outside world -- also are likeliest to adopt a special - needs child such as Julia from outside the community , and likeliest to have their children vaccinated .
Another qualifier : The Inions are converts to the Amish - Mennonite religion ( Brent is an Asian - American ) .
They simply might not know about any number of autistic Amish sheltered quietly with their families for decades .
It also is possible the isolated Amish gene pool might confer some kind of immunity to autism -- which might be a useful topic for research .
Whatever the case , Stacey - jean thinks the autistic Amish are nowhere to be found .
" It is so much more rare among our people , " she said .
" My husband just said last week that so far we 've never met a family that lives a healthy lifestyle and does not vaccinate their children that has an autistic child .
We have n't come across one yet . "
" Everywhere I go ( outside the Amish community ) I find children who are autistic , just because I have an autistic daughter -- in the grocery store , in the park , wherever I go .
In the Amish community , I simply do n't find that . "

MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann made an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman , and the conversation turned to one of the best arguments for how screwed up our campaign process is and how public financing could allow us to put our money towards other priorities .
Letterman :
It ’s just god awful .
If you think about it , if you compare those amounts of money — and I heard this statistic the other day — to maintain , to maintain status quo of world starvation — that means not improve it …
Olbermann : Yup …
Letterman : … but just for people to hang on , we need $ 700 million .
And these two , have generated more than that already and still people are going hungry .
Olbermann :
It would be great , and it would be ideal if we paid for everything .
The government would just sort of said , alright , we ’re going to give each candidate , who you know met some sort of minimum amount of support gets this much money and gets this much free television time , which is what it ’s really all about .
I mean , that ’s what happened in Pennsylvania , you know where he went from being down by 20 to losing by 10 .
That ’s a pretty good result for him , by spending a lot of money on TV time .
But if you just gave away the television time , well , all the networks would get very upset about that .
So it ’s …you know , really , we are choosing between these two predicaments .
Letterman :
There ought to be a way , there ought to be a different way here , because I mean , the length of the campaign — you can understand this , but the sums of money required and at the end of the day , we ’re just trying to satisfy somebody ’s ego when you get right down to it .
The United States now has about 50 soldiers in Pakistan .
Any expanded operations using C.I.A. operatives or Special Operations forces , like the Navy Seals , would be small and tailored to specific missions , military officials said .
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , who was on vacation last week and did not attend the White House meeting , said in late December that “ Al Qaeda right now seems to have turned its face toward Pakistan and attacks on the Pakistani government and Pakistani people . ”
In the past , the administration has largely stayed out of the tribal areas , in part for fear that exposure of any American - led operations there would so embarrass the Musharraf government that it could further empower his critics , who have declared he was too close to Washington .
Even now , officials say , some American diplomats and military officials , as well as outside experts , argue that American - led military operations on the Pakistani side of the border with Afghanistan could result in a tremendous backlash and ultimately do more harm than good .
That is particularly true , they say , if Americans were captured or killed in the territory .
In part , the White House discussions may be driven by a desire for another effort to capture or kill Osama bin Laden and his deputy , Ayman al - Zawahri .
Currently , C.I.A. operatives and Special Operations forces have limited authority to conduct counterterrorism missions in Pakistan based on specific intelligence about the whereabouts of those two men , who have eluded the Bush administration for more than six years , or of other members of their terrorist organization , Al Qaeda , hiding in or near the tribal areas .
The C.I.A. has launched missiles from Predator aircraft in the tribal areas several times , with varying degrees of success .
Intelligence officials said they believed that in January 2006 an airstrike narrowly missed killing Mr. Zawahri , who had attended a dinner in Damadola , a Pakistani village .
But that apparently was the last real evidence American officials had about the whereabouts of their chief targets .
Image Al Qaeda and the Taliban use the tribal areas as a base .

The New York Times
Critics said more direct American military action would be ineffective , anger the Pakistani Army and increase support for the militants .
“ I ’m not arguing that you leave Al Qaeda and the Taliban unmolested , but I ’d be very , very cautious about approaches that could play into hands of enemies and be counterproductive , ” said Bruce Hoffman , a terrorism expert at Georgetown University .
Some American diplomats and military officials have also issued strong warnings against expanded direct American action , officials said .

Yesterday we covered RIAA President Cary Sherman 's idea to move content filtering out of the network and onto the home computer .
His goal is to avoid the encryption that will likely make network filtering useless , but the idea of convincing users to install some sort of RIAA - approved monitoring application on their computers is one that needs a little more time in the oven .
Now , the RIAA tells Ars that Sherman was " simply musing " and that the group has no specific home filtering agenda to push .
An RIAA spokesperson who attended Sherman 's panel discussion tells us that Sherman " was simply musing in response to a question that required it .
He was not proposing or suggesting anything specific but speaking in the abstract about a few general ideas . "
On one hand , this is excellent news ; there 's no official push to start peering inside everyone 's PCs .
But on the other hand , the fact that this sort of plan is what comes out when RIAA bosses start " musing " tells you something about the way they instinctively approach these sorts of problems .
It 's not just Sherman , though ; music 's international trade group feels exactly the same way about filters , and it 's willing to call for a government mandate .
But in our view , the solution to the illicit use of intellectual property cannot just be ratcheting the thumbscrews tighter ; at some point , any success that this approach achieves will be offset by widespread user outrage and a legitimate anger at not being in control even of their own machines .
The problem is n't that filtering wo n't be 100 percent accurate .
As Sherman rightly pointed out in his remarks , we do all sorts of things to prevent crime in our society , and none are 100 percent effective ; many even carry some risk that innocent people will be inconvenienced or even thrown in jail .
No , the real issue is that filtering wo n't work until the thumbscrews are so tight that blood is pouring from people 's hands .
Should that day ever come , the revolucíon wo n't be far behind .
Network filtering wo n't work ; Sherman knows it and said as much in his remarks .
While perhaps initially successful , encryption will stymie deep packet inspection techniques and will be built into all major P2P clients .
The Pirate Bay has already announced plans to tweak the BitTorrent protocol to include such encryption .
So the filtering police need to move to the edges of the network , into a user 's computer .
But even here , things will be tricky .
When all you need to do is boot a free OS ( Linux ) inside free virtual PC software to do unlimited file - swapping , we 've traded quite a bit of privacy and freedom in return for something that wo n't stop piracy .
And how would the software know what to look for ?
The whole point of putting the filter on the client machine is that it can examine media files after decryption ; but after decryption , when the files are simply stored in a user 's media library , the software can't tell whether they are legal or not .
The problems go on and on .
Yes , filtering might create a " speedbump , " especially for less tech - savvy users , but only through draconian implementations of the sort that would never be tolerated in other law enforcement situations .
Would you let the FBI install tracking software on every PC in the country to look for encrypted e-mails promoting terrorism ?
While data on the effect of P2P use is conflicted , several important studies have shown that it's not killing the music business in the ways that are generally assumed .
In 2006 , for instance , we noted a study ( funded by CRIA , Canada 's equivalent of the RIAA ) that actually showed 75 percent of file - swappers purchasing music that they had first downloaded illicitly .
Another well - known study in 2007 found that P2P 's effect on music sales was " not statistically distinguishable from zero . "
Maybe the bogeyman just is n't that scary ?
Given that filtering is n't going to work unless we 're willing to become a copyright police state , the industry needs to keep up its ( laudable ) experiments in music distribution instead .
Things like Nokia 's " Comes With Music " are interesting experiments , as are the free streaming from iMeem and Last.fm .
And would it kill someone to offer the same product found on a CD ( lossless digital music ) as a download for $ 8 an album ?
Or what about charging $ 15 a month for a blanket license to download content and play it on portable devices ?
I 'd pay .
What we need is better business models , not tighter thumbscrews .
Colbert to Larry King : Fascism gets a bad rap David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday April 15 , 2008

Print This Email This Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert , who is in Philadelphia this week to cover the Pennsylvania primary , appeared on Larry King Live to explain his unique perspective on the election and offer the legendary " Colbert bump " to any candidate who will appear on his show .
" We 're going down to celebrate what we call the ' Democralypse ' in Pennsylvania , " Colbert told King .
" The delightful dismemberment of the Democratic Party .
...
The fight between Hillary and Obama is like an iron bear cage that has caught the Democratic Party by the ankle , and now the Democrats have to gnaw off their own leg to get away . "
King recalled Colbert 's abortive attempt to run in the South Carolina primary and asked Colbert what he would do if a deadlocked Democratic convention turned to him as a candidate .
" I am not entirely sure I would want it , " Colbert replied .
" If it 's not Hillary Clinton who gets the nomination , I 'm sure whoever gets up there and gives the acceptance speech , Hillary Clinton will burst out of their chest like the Alien and seize the microphone . "
" She 's tenacious , " he went on .
" That is what she brings to the fight .
...
You could actually lop off her head , arms , and legs , and she 'll crawl towards you using the muscles in her belly - button . "
Asked about Bill Clinton 's role in the campaign , Colbert insisted that nothing Bill says should reflect on Hillary .
" I think he 's a rogue operative that they 're having trouble shutting down , " Colbert stated .
" He 's a loose cannon .
Everything he 's saying is unofficial . "
Colbert 's only remark on Obama was , " He 's an inspiring candidate , and he's got the young people out there just eating out of the palm of his hand .
He 's passing his hope bong around the drum circle of young America . "
Colbert also referred to Chris Matthews ' appearance on his own show .
" I nailed him on the fact that he 's probably running for Senate in 2010 , " Colbert boasted .
" He said his childhood dream was to be a senator .
... I would say it 's as good as running . "
However , Colbert 's most striking response was to a German viewer 's question about ending fascism in America .
" Fascism gets a bad rap , " Colbert replied .
" In a time of war , there should be no questioning of our leaders .
...
We should start thinking more about how the war is feeling and less about how we feel about the war .
Is n't it more important than the individual at this point ? "
" That 's a fascist concept , " King noted .
" I know , I 'm endorsing that idea , " Colbert agreed .
" I 'm anti-polygamy , I 'm pro-fascism .
Is that so hard to understand ? "

Personal rapid transport vehicles travel at 25mph
There are no drivers , no rails , no timetables and no emissions .
But , most importantly for passengers , there are no queues .
Welcome to the UK's first personal rapid transport system ( PRT ) .
But while these low - energy , driverless pod-shaped vehicles may look like something from sci- fi epic Bladerunner , they are about to become British transport reality .
In less than two years ' time , after the opening of Heathrow 's Terminal 5 in March 2008 , a network of 18 of these four - seater capsules will be ferrying passengers to and from a business car park to the new terminal building .
Already under construction , the first phase of the airport 's £ 25 m PRT will use 3.8 km ( 2.4 miles ) of guideway - designated ground - level or raised path - to move people from car to check - in in just four minutes .
No wait
But the greatest selling point of the system for users is not its speed - set to a maximum 25 mph ( 40 k ph ) - but , instead , its promised convenience .
It appears to solve the often - encountered problems of mass public transit , including fixed timetabling - leading to long waiting times and queues , restricted routes and shared travel space .
See proposed route of Heathrow personal rapid transport system
Enlarge Map
With PRT , vehicles turn up on demand , can be programmed to go to any destination and accommodate just one group of travellers who already know each another .
According to Advanced Transport Systems ( ATS ) , the Bristol - based company behind the Heathrow system , passengers will only have to wait a maximum of 12 seconds .
And , because the vehicles have their own designated paths , there will be no congestion and no traffic lights - in principle , a non -stop journey from A to B .
To those with more green concerns , the system also has the advantage of generating zero local emissions and being 70 % more energy efficient than cars and 50 % more than traditional buses .
" It offers a completely new form of public transport - one that will deliver a fast , efficient service to passengers and bring considerable environmental benefits , saving more than half of the fuel used by existing forms of public or private transport , " says Mark Bullock , managing director of Heathrow Airport .
So , how does the system work ?
The cars , powered by a battery pack , follow dedicated 1.5 m - wide guideways using laser sensors embedded in the vehicles .
Passengers board at designated points - not unlike bus stops or taxi ranks - where vehicles are waiting or can be called within seconds .
Expansion
Once on board , travellers use a touch screen to select a destination .
A central control system responds by allocating the vehicle the required path and passengers are taken non -stop via the best - available route .
This , ATS says , is " a new approach to travel .
This is transport for a sustainable future . "
If the first - ever public test of the technology at Terminal 5 goes well , Heathrow plans to expand its use across the airport .
The cars can be caught at designated points
But it does n't stop there .
There are already indications that the capsules will be embraced elsewhere in Britain and the world .
In the Northamptonshire town of Daventry , councillors are considering proposals for a PRT system of up to 100 vehicles to help transport its growing population , which is expected to increase from 23,000 to 40,000 by 2021 .
And a number of other countries , including some Gulf states , are also looking at similar systems .
However , although PRT seems to be an ideal transport solution , critics claim it has limited applications , especially in big cities due to the required network of guideways .
Some also say its efficiency has yet to be tested .
City dynamics
But , those behind the Heathrow project acknowledge PRT , a concept which has been around since at least the 1950s , has its limits .
They say it will not compete with mass transit systems in large cities , such as the London Underground , but will instead complement them .
Richard Teychenne , of ATS , says it will work particularly well in the suburbs , linking areas together - such as transporting people between residential areas , or from rail stations and out of town car parks directly to shops and offices .
" It could really change the dynamic of a city , " he says .
Another advantage of the capsules , he claims , is safety .
CCTV can be in operation in every vehicle and passengers no longer have to share public transport with other unknown people .
This could offer obvious advantages to women as well as children travelling to school , he says .
When all its features are digested , PRT may sound like public transport too good to be true , and it remains to be seen whether it can deliver on its promises .
Mr Teychenne admits the rollout does depend in how things at Terminal 5 go , and all international eyes will be on the west London airport in 2009 .
" Heathrow is setting a marker for the world , " he adds .
WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a lower court ruling that the F.B.I. went too far in searching the office of Representative William J. Jefferson , a Louisiana Democrat accused of using his position to promote business deals in Africa .
Without comment , the justices declined to review a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , which concluded last August that agents had violated the Constitution by the methods it used in the May 2006 search .
The appeals court did not find that the raid itself was unconstitutional ; rather , it found that the F.B.I. violated constitutional separation of powers by allowing agents to look freely through Congressional files for incriminating evidence .
The ruling last August told the bureau to return legislative documents to Mr. Jefferson .
It did not , however , affect other items seized from his office , including computer hard drives .
Nor did it affect evidence seized in a separate raid on the Congressman ’s Washington - area home , including $ 90,000 found wrapped in aluminum foil in frozen - food containers in his kitchen freezer .
I 've posted a few of Alan Shore 's rants on C&L before , ( Boston Legal ’s Alan Shore on Gitmo , Boston Legal to the rescue ) but this one about the Supreme Court just rocked .
ABC and David Kelley should be commended for keeping this show running .
Kelley writes some of the best politically informative -- holds no punches back --- opinions on TV today .
He really exposes every conflict of interest that the members of the Roberts Court have .
I hope to get the transcript eventually .

Public access to the Reimer Digital Library , which is the largest online collection of U.S. Army doctrinal publications , has been blocked by the Army , which last week moved the collection behind a password - protected firewall .
But today the Federation of American Scientists filed a Freedom of Information Act request ( pdf ) asking the Army to provide a copy of the entire unclassified Library so that it could be posted on the FAS web site .
The Army move on February 6 marks the latest step in an ongoing withdrawal of government records from the public domain .
“ It was a policy decision to put it behind the AKO [ Army Knowledge Online ] firewall and to restrict public access , ” said Don Gough of the system development division at the Army Training Support Center at Fort Eustis , Virginia , which operates the Reimer Digital Library .
The move came as a surprise since only unclassified and non-sensitive records had ever been made available at the Library site .
Is n’t it true , Secrecy News asked , that the only documents that had been accessible to the public were those that had been specifically …
“ ‘ Approved for public release , ’ yes , ” said Mr. Gough , completing our sentence .
“ I understand your concern , ” he added .
The FAS Freedom of Information Act request is intended to reverse the Army action .
“ We hope to restore public access to the Reimer Digital Library by obtaining all of its publicly releasable contents and posting that material on our own website , ” the FAS request explained .
“ Furthermore , in order to preserve the status quo , we expect to file regular FOIA requests for updates to the RDL two or three times a month , so that we may add them to our mirror site . ”
“ Alternatively , if the Army were to restore the prior level of public access to the RDL , that would fulfill this request and make future requests unnecessary , ” the FAS request stated .
Among the many thousands of documents that were formerly available to the public on the Reimer Digital Library , two of the latest additions are these .

Discover GNOME 3
An easy and elegant way to use your computer , GNOME is designed to put you in control and get things done .
Most system administrators grew up with the classic Unix tools .
If you ’re under 30 , chances are you grew up with the GNU versions of them .
Everyone ’s seen the lists of Unix tools you should be using if you are n’t already ( ie if you are n’t using screen , you ’re not paying attention .
This list is different , it ’s of clones of the classic Unix tools that improve them in some way .
ack
Grep results are often slowed by searching version control files .
Ack increases search speed by eliminating those files from search .
It also has preliminarily support for searching for only certain types of files , making your file search still faster .
ack is written in Perl so it ’s largely cross platform and has a more complete ( ala Perl ) regular expression engine .
In short time I ’ve trained my hands to type ack instead of grep .
As the author says , it ’ll save you 25 % of your time right there .
htop
htop is an improved eye candy version of top .
Its biggest features are its LED - like bar for CPU / Memory usage and its color coded process table output .
htop looks noisy after some time you quickly see htops benefits in being able to separate out information visually .
htop is currently only available on GNU / Linux but the authors have discussed possibly porting it to other platforms .
most
This replacement for the classic pagers ( more and less ) , has several advantages over its cousins , including showing the file process in percentage and being able to scroll horizontally as well as vertically without line wrapping the input .
nano
Nano is a clone of the popular text editor pico , but unlike its predecessor , nano has many configuration options and even supports syntax highlighting and other features usually only found in more complex editors like vim and emacs .
nano retains pico ’s small size and will fit on many small computers including embedded systems .
If you do n’t like vi and need a small editor , nano can more than do the job .
alpine
Many of us learned email on the classic unix mailer “ pine ” .
Sadly pine has had a soiled reputation both for its poor security and its licensing issues .
alpine is an effort by University of Washington ( the makers of the original pine ) to solve both these problems and retain pine ’s ease of use .
If you have n’t already moved on to another mailer like mutt , alpine should be your next logical move .
fish
Fish shell is an attempt to move away from the problems we typically have in shells into something more .
Not only does fish support coloring , automatic indentation , increased help and automatic escaping of control characters , integrated help , but it ’s just plain easier to use .
Unfortunately if you ’re in an environment with scripts that assume you ’re using a standard posix shell , fish wo n’t work for you as it breaks posix compatibility in order to make the shell environment easier to use .
Fish is still a very sexy project .

George Bush today ruled out a change in Washington 's Iran policy following the declassification yesterday of a US intelligence report that concluded Tehran had abandoned its nuclear weapons programme in 2003 .
The US president denied the national intelligence estimate ( NIE ) - which said Tehran 's determination to develop nuclear weapons " is less ... than we have been judging " - had undercut his administration 's repeated assertions that Iran was building nuclear weapons .
" Iran was dangerous .
Iran is dangerous .
And Iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon , " Bush told his first White House press conference in nearly seven weeks .
He said the US would continue to work to " isolate " Iran , claiming the NIE was a " warning signal " to the international community .
" I think it is very important for the international community to recognise the fact that if Iran were to develop the knowledge that they could transfer to a clandestine program , it would create a danger of the world .
" And so , I view this report as a warning signal that they had the programme , they halted the programme .
The reason why it 's a warning signal is they could restart it . "
As recently as October , Bush was invoking the threat of a third world war if Iran was not prevented from obtaining the necessary knowledge to make a nuclear weapon .
Asked if he had been " hyping " the threat from Iran , Bush said he was only made aware of the NIE last week and insisted it had changed nothing .
" I still feel strongly that Iran is a danger .
I think the NIE makes it clear that Iran needs to be taken seriously as a threat to peace .
My opinion has n't changed . "
The US intelligence estimate is unfortunate timing for the Bush administration because it could take the steam out of its efforts to push for further sanctions against Iran at the UN .
Iran today welcomed the NIE as proof of its peaceful nuclear intentions .
The Iranian foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , speaking before Bush , said he welcomed the US move to " correct " its previous assertions .
" It 's natural that we welcome it when those countries who in the past have questions and ambiguities about this case ... now amend their views realistically , " he told state radio .
" The condition of Iran 's peaceful nuclear activities is becoming clear to the world . "
The report was , however , contradicted by Israel .
Its defence minister , Ehud Barak , claimed that Iran had restarted its military nuclear programme .
" It 's apparently true that in 2003 Iran stopped pursuing its military nuclear programme for a time .
But in our opinion , since then it has apparently continued that programme , " he told army radio .
Barak said Israel was " familiar with this American assessment " but there " are differences in the assessments of different organisations in the world about this , and only time will tell who is right . "
Israel has not ruled out military action against Iran , but says it prefers a diplomatic solution .
Asked if the new US assessment reduced the likelihood of a US military strike on Iran , Barak said it was " possible " .
Israel has backed US - led efforts at the UN to impose sanctions on Iran for its refusal to halt uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to develop nuclear weapons .
Britain , which has backed the US campaign for sanctions against Iran , also said the risk remained of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons despite the US intelligence report .
The report , Downing Street said , " shows the intent is there and the risk of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon remains a very serious issue " .
Gordon Brown 's spokesman added : " We do need to examine the details of this report .
But in overall terms the government believes that the report confirms we were right to be worried about Iran seeking to develop nuclear weapons . "
Critics of the administration 's policy on Iran have seized upon the report to argue against military action .
The intelligence finding removes , " if nothing else , the urgency that we have to attack Iran , or knock out facilities " , said Chuck Hagel , a Republican senator .
" I do n't think you can overstate the importance of this . "
The Democratic leader of the US senate , Harry Reid , urged the White House to adjust its policy and pursue " a diplomatic surge " to engage with Iran .
See sidebar , Understanding America 's intelligence infrastructure .
This morning the Washington Post reported that the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers , an AFL - CIO affiliated labor union whose membership includes engineers , scientists and technicians at the Department of Defense , the Department of Energy , NASA and Boeing , endorsed Barack Obama .
The 85,000 person organization surveyed the candidates last year and posted their responses online .
The Union 's Executive Council voted yesterday without opposition to endorse the Senator .
In Obama 's response to the endorsement he said ,
" I ’ll support vigorous reinvestment in our federal research and development agencies , including NASA , to maintain America ’s leadership in Science and Technology and to foster economic competitiveness . "
Obama also picked up an endorsement today from Super Delegate and Congressman David Wu ( D - OR ) .
Wu represents the " Silicon Forest " area ( which includes the southwest part of Portland ) and is the Chair of the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee as well as a member of the Space Subcommittee of the House of Representative .
This puts Obama at 240 Super Delegates and 291 delegates away from capturing the democratic nomination .
A long list of people endorsing Obama can be found on Wikipedia , which also hosts a list for Clinton .
Many people in the space community are still concerned about Obama 's statements about delaying NASA 's Constellation program five years ( sending humans to the moon ) , a move that could have serious consequences for the future of human space exploration .
Perhaps getting more people supporting the Obama campaign who support human space exploration will bring in some new thinking on how the United States can use its human spaceflight program to support education , the economy , the environment and help foster international cooperation .

What defines such a republic ?
How about an executive that ignores the rule of law , commits war - crimes and then destroys the actual evidence ?
Today 's bombshell is that the CIA has done just that with respect to tapes made recording the torture of enemy combatants .
Read the whole story .
We live in a country where the government can detain indefinitely , torture in secret , and then secretly destroy the tapes of torture sessions to protect its own staff :
The videotapes showed agency operatives in 2002 subjecting terror suspects including Abu Zubaydah , the first detainee in CIA custody to severe interrogation techniques .
They were destroyed in part because officers were concerned that tapes documenting controversial interrogation methods could expose agency officials to greater risk of legal jeopardy , several officials said .
The CIA said today that the decision to destroy the tapes had been made " within the CIA itself , " and they were destroyed to protect the safety of undercover officers and because they no longer had intelligence value .
The agency was headed at the time by Porter J. Goss .
Through a spokeswoman , Goss declined this afternoon to comment on the destruction of the tapes .
My italics .
This was a deliberate act to destroy evidence of war - crimes and to protect war criminals from facing the rule of law .
The Congress needs to find out who authorized the destruction of those tapes .
I should add that this is not the first time that videotapes of alleged torture sessions have been " lost . "
The same happened in the case of Jose Padilla :
The missing DVD dates from March 2 , 2004 .
It contains a video of the last interrogation session of Padilla , then a declared ' enemy combatant ' under an order from President Bush , while he was being held in military custody at a U.S. Navy brig in Charleston , S.C.
But in recent days , in the course of an unusual court hearing about Padilla 's mental condition , a government lawyer disclosed to a surprised courtroom that the Defense Intelligence Agency which had custody of the evidence was no longer able to locate the DVD .
As a result , it was not included in a packet of classified DVDs that was recently turned over to defense lawyers under orders from Judge Cooke .
The disclosure that the Pentagon had lost a potentially important piece of evidence in one of the U.S. government 's highest - profile terrorism cases was met with claims of incredulity by some defense lawyers and human - rights groups monitoring the case .
" This is the kind of thing you hear when you ’re litigating cases in Egypt or Morocco or Karachi , " said John Sifton , a lawyer with Human Rights Watch , one of a number of groups that has criticized the U.S. government ’s treatment of Padilla .
" It is simply not credible that they would have lost this tape .
The administration has shown repeatedly they are more interested in covering up abuses than getting to the bottom of whether people were abused . "
A potential opening for Congressional investigation :
The tapes , recorded in 2002 and destroyed in 2005 , were not provided to the September 11 Commission despite a formal request to the CIA for " transcripts and any other documentary evidence " taken from interrogations .
The Commission completed its work in 2004 .
The story also reports that CIA attorneys told " federal prosecutors in 2003 and 2005 , who relayed the information to a federal court in the Moussaoui case , that the C.I.A. did not possess recordings of interrogations sought by the judge in the case . "
Moussaoui had sought the tapes as exculpatory evidence .
This administration commits war - crimes , hides the evidence from federal law officers and the 9/11 Commission and then destroys the evidence completely .
Give that some time to sink in .

Today , one of Mininova 's users will will have the honor to download the 5 billionth torrent , an impressive figure for a site that has only been around for little over three years .
If Mininova continues to grow at this rate , we might see the 10 billionth download before the year ends .
Mininova is currently the most visited BitTorrent site , and with approximately 3.5 million visitors a day , the site has gathered a spot among the 50 most popular websites on the Internet .
When we reported about the 3 billionth download back in November , Erik from Mininova told TorrentFreak : “ We hope to reach the 4 billion mark in 4 or 5 months from now ” .
He did n’t have to wait that long , as it only took 78 days before they got there .
The TV - show category remains the most popular , approximately half of all downloads from Mininova are torrents relating to TV - episodes .
The popularity of Mininova became apparent a few weeks ago when the site was offline for nearly a day because of hardware issues .
The millions of visitors had to go elsewhere to feed their BitTorrent habit , and as a result , other sites like Torrentz.com and SumoTorrent saw a huge traffic increase , and almost went down under the strain .
The Mininova team will continue to optimize the site in order to handle the continuous traffic increase .
On top of this , they are also adding new services and features such as a content distribution platform for independent publishers , a music streaming feature , and more recently , video streaming .
From the looks of it , Mininova ’s growth will not be halted anytime soon , unless there is outside intervention .
Last week , the Dutch anti-piracy organization BREIN announced that it will take legal action against the site , not to take it down , but to force it to filter copyrighted content .
Erik from Mininova said in a response they “ will proceed to court with full confidence , ” and they will continue to serve torrents .
Mininova downloads since 2005 .
A company which hosts many BitTorrent trackers has been ordered by the CRIA to close at least four major sites .
Moxie Colo was issued with cease and desist notices and ordered to hand over the owners data and site logs of What.cd , SumoTracker , BTMon and FullDls .
They are told to simply close many other sites they host .
Those who believed that Canada would develop as one of the world ’s BitTorrent safe - havens , are in for quite a surprise .
Despite many people believing that torrent sites are operating legally in Canada , today popular Canadian BitTorrent host Moxie Colo was served with cease and desist orders , courtesy of the CRIA .
They specifically demand that the Moxie Colo stops hosting top ranked torrent sites What.cd , SumoTorrent , BTMon and FullDls .
Generally , the CRIA is demanding that Moxie stop hosting all torrent sites .
TorrentFreak has been reporting recently on the plight of QuebecTorrent which is currently tied up in a legal battle against the music industry in Canada .
Clearly that – and the running out of town of Demonoid – was just a run up to further action by an emboldened CRIA .
In files served on Moxie Communications Inc ( the parent company of Moxie Colo ) , the CRIA is demanding that Moxie turn over the personal details of the torrent site administrators , presumably so they can go after them .
The CRIA also want Moxie to turn over all relevant site logs , but it is at least unlikely that the Canadian police will be interested in most of the users .
Of course , just because the CRIA demands something , does n’t mean they will get it .
For now , Moxie Colo said it wo n’t be giving in to the CRIA ’s demands .
Sean Corbin , CEO of Moxie Communications told TorrentFreak : “ We will not be following the request and will be fighting for the rights of our clients as to date laws in Canada protect them .
We have looked into the matter and from what we understand these sites are not breaking any laws in Canada .
If we do not comply they might bring legal action against Moxie Communications , as they believe without us these sites could not do what they do so therefore we are as bad as they are . ”
More on this breaking story as we get it .

Scientists say there may be many more worlds in our galaxy
New evidence suggests more than half the Sun - like stars in the Milky Way could have similar planetary systems .
There may also be hundreds of undiscovered worlds in outer parts of our Solar System , astronomers believe .
Future studies of such worlds will radically alter our understanding of how planets are formed , they say .
New findings about planets were presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) in Boston .
Nasa telescope
Michael Meyer , an astronomer from the University of Arizona , said he believed Earth - like planets were probably very common around Sun - like stars .
I expect that we will find a very large number of planets
Alan Stern , Nasa
Mr Meyer 's team used the US space agency 's Spitzer space telescope to look at groups of stars with masses similar to the Sun .
They detected discs of cosmic dust around stars in some of the youngest groups surveyed .
The dust is believed to be a by - product of rocky debris colliding and merging to form planets .
Nasa 's Kepler mission to search for Earth - sized and smaller planets , due to be launched next year , is expected to reveal more clues about these distant undiscovered worlds .
Frozen worlds
Some astronomers believe there may be hundreds of small rocky bodies in the outer edges of our own Solar System , and perhaps even a handful of frozen Earth - sized worlds .
We have to find the right mass planet and it has to be at the right distance from the star
Debra Fischer , San Francisco State University
More than a thousand objects had already been discovered in the Kuiper belt alone , he said , many rivalling the planet Pluto in size .
" Our old view , that the Solar System had nine planets will be supplanted by a view that there are hundreds if not thousands of planets in our Solar System , " he told BBC News .
He said many of these planets would be icy , some would be rocky , and there might even be objects with the same mass as Earth .
" It could be that there are objects of Earth - mass in the Oort cloud ( a band of debris surrounding our planetary system ) but they would be frozen at these distances , " Dr Stern added .
" They would look like a frozen Earth . "
Goldilocks zone
Excitement about finding other Earth - like planets is driven by the idea that some might contain life or perhaps , centuries from now , allow human colonies to be set up on them .
The key to this search , said Debra Fischer of San Francisco State University , California , was the " Goldilocks zone " .
This refers to an area of space in which a planet is " just the right distance " from its parent star so that its surface is not - too - hot or not - too - cold to support liquid water .
" To my mind there are two things we have to go after : we have to find the right mass planet and it has to be at the right distance from the star , " she said .
The AAAS meeting concludes on Monday .
The world 's top donors of humanitarian aid came together on the sidelines of the United Nations to address the growing needs of people around the world .
The three - headed frog has fused bodies and six legs
The creature - which has six legs - has stunned a BBC wildlife expert who said it could be an early warning of environmental problems .
Laura Pepper , from the Green Umbrella nursery in Weston - super - Mare , said : " We thought it was three frogs huddled together at first .
" It is very strange .
The children could n't believe it . "
Mike Dilger , from the BBC Natural History Unit , said : " I have never seen anything like this .
" Frogs are primitive animals - so the occasional extra toe is not that unusual .
But this is very unusual . "
All the creature 's eyes and legs appear to function normally , but it is not known whether it eats using all three of its mouths .
The amphibian was kept in a container for several hours but hopped away later while nursery staff were showing it to curious parents .
The Transport Secretary , Ruth Kelly , deftly evaded public association with the Terminal 5 disaster yesterday by dispatching her aviation minister , Jim Fitzpatrick , to the Commons to face the music .
To an almost empty House – perhaps MPs , like so many others , were stuck at their weekend destinations , sans toothbrush , sans clothes , sans nearly everything – the hapless minister revealed that the latest tally of " stored " luggage was now 28,000 pieces , and expressed fervent hope that British Airways and the British Airports Authority would learn lessons from the debacle .
But not , of course , before they had sorted it all out .
To which , I am sure , we can all say " hear , hear " .
Without presuming to conclude what those lessons might be , however , I will hazard that one will concern staff training .
Of the many complaints voiced by employees and passengers alike , lack of preparation for the big day loomed large .
From a shortage of parking space through tardy security vetting , to the screens and conveyor belts that no one knew how to work , the impression was that senior managers had banked , quite unrealistically , on it all coming together on the relevant morning .
The operational staff need not be let off the hook completely .
As some of the shop workers pointed out , they got into work on time , so how come the baggage handlers and check - in staff found it so hard ?
Did they actually take up the training provided ?
Some of the baggage - handlers may well have been fathers , brothers , sons etc. of the women made redundant by BA 's catering contractor , Gate Gourmet , in 2005 .
There was a stroppiness underlying the self - justification that suggested less than total dedication to the greater glory of T5 .

That said , both BA and BAA have chequered records as employers and , regrettably , they are not unique among British companies .
Even where there is a willingness to invest in spectacular new buildings or hi-tech infrastructure , nothing like the same investment seems to be made in employees .
One part of the explanation – the smaller part – may be the availability of trained , or trainable , labour from elsewhere : Jamaican and Filipina nurses ; textile workers from Bangladesh ; doctors from India and Pakistan .
The recent influx of Central Europeans , many of them skilled or highly educated , has been a boon for business , if not for less well - educated Britons competing for the same jobs .
As Poland 's economy rebounds and the pound falls against the euro , " our " Poles are starting to leave .
Perhaps training will then finally rise up the political and business agenda .
Just do n't bet on it too soon .
For the greater part of the explanation reflects an ingrained view that certain jobs are essentially low - skilled , and will remain so .
They are often allocated by word of mouth and personal connections rather than competition – or , increasingly , in batches , through agencies – and the assumption is that the employee comes ready primed for his or her particular function .
If training is required , it is a couple of days ' induction .
The Government would reject absolutely that it discourages training .
Did not Tony Blair harp on about the " knowledge economy " ?
And Gordon Brown picked up the baton .
Addressing the CBI last year , he spoke at length about how Britain , as a small country , would never be able to compete with the rest of the world on low skills , so had to develop a " high skills " economy , strong on " high value - added services and manufacturing " .
The trouble is that the practical message emanating from Whitehall in recent years has been quite different .
Not only have would - be graduates had to take out loans to fund themselves through college , but established professions have been sliced and diced to create new groups of lower - skilled , cheaper , sub - professionals .
Qualified teachers have been supplemented with teaching assistants .
Police officers send cheaper community support officers on to the beat , while the GP service has been diluted with " nurse practitioners " .
The skills of these new sub- professionals may be entirely adequate to the job they are required to do .
But their proliferation – from 60,000 to more than 160,000 in 10 years in the case of teaching assistants – gives the impression of a cheapskate nation that resists paying for properly trained professionals .
And if we are so heedless of our professions , is it any wonder that we expect to get our carpenters , our plasterers , our hospital cleaners – and , yes , our baggage - handlers – semi- trained and on the cheap ?
Or that they take so little pride in their work , and so little responsibility when things goes wrong ?
Britain should be skilling up , not skilling down , and Heathrow 's T5 humiliation is an object lesson in why .

The latest word from General Motors is the Chevrolet Volt will cost about $ 35,000 when it arrives in showrooms at the end of 2010 , about five grand more than the company had hoped .
GM says problems designing accessories like windshield wipers and an audio system that wo n't drain the Volt 's batteries have forced its engineers to design expensive " redundant systems " that are driving up costs .
" It 's starting to look like it 's going to be closer to $ 35,000 , " GM spokesman Dee Allen told us , confirming a report by Canwest News .
" We had set a target of $ 30,000 , but if it comes in closer to $ 35,000 and it means meeting the 2010 deadline , that 's the direction we 're going to go . "
GM product boss Bob Lutz told us last month that the Volt would probably cost more than the $ 30,000 GM had targeted and said the accessory systems are one of the biggest challenges .
So what 's the problem ?
And have you seen that bizarre TV ad for the Volt ?
GM says the Volt 's lithium - ion batteries will provide a range of 40 miles and a one - liter engine will power a generator that will keep the vehicle going beyond that .
In most cars , accessories like windshield wipers , air conditioning and the stereo are powered by the battery , which is recharged by the engine through the alternator , or directly by the engine .
But the Volt does n't have an alternator , and it has something draining the batteries other cars do n't - the wheels .
They need all the juice they can get .
" You really start taking away from the range when you 're using 10 - speaker audio systems , wipers , " Allen says .
" These systems need to be redone , and they are being redone . "
GM has no doubt it will solve the problem , but not in time to meet the 2010 deadline .
The first - generation Volts will have workarounds GM called " redundant systems . "
Allen could n't tell us anything more about that , but said second - generation Volts will be " more refined . "
And , presumably , cheaper .
According to Autoblog Green , this ad for the Volt recently aired during " Robot Chicken " on Cartoon Network 's Adult Swim .

A bill outlawing the possession of " extreme pornography " is set to become law next week .
But many fear it has been rushed through and will criminalise innocent people with a harmless taste for unconventional sex .
Five years ago Jane Longhurst , a teacher from Brighton , was murdered .
It later emerged her killer had been compulsively accessing websites such as Club Dead and Rape Action , which contained images of women being abused and violated .
When Graham Coutts was jailed for life Jane Longhurst 's mother , Liz , began a campaign to ban the possession of such images .
WHAT IS EXTREME PORNOGRAPHY ?
As defined by the new Criminal Justice Bill
An act which threatens or appears to threaten a person 's life
An act which results in or appears to result in serious injury to a person 's anus , breasts or genitals
An act which involves or appears to involve sexual interference with a human corpse A person performing or appearing to perform an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal Supported by her local MP , Martin Salter , she found a listening ear in then home secretary , David Blunkett , who agreed to introduce legislation to ban the possession of " violent and extreme pornography " .
This was eventually included in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill , which gets its final reading this week and will get Royal Assent on 8 May .
Until now pornographers , rather than consumers , have needed to operate within the confines of the 1959 Obscene Publications Act ( OPA ) .
While this law will remain , the new act is designed to reflect the realities of the internet age , when pornographic images may be hosted on websites outside the UK .
Under the new rules , criminal responsibility shifts from the producer - who is responsible under the OPA - to the consumer .
But campaigners say the new law risks criminalising thousands of people who use violent pornographic images as part of consensual sexual relationships .
People like Helen , who by day works in an office in the Midlands , and enjoys being sexually submissive and occasionally watching pornography , portrayed by actors , which could be banned under the new legislation .

" Mrs Longhurst sees this man having done this to her daughter and she wants something to blame and rather than blame this psychotic man she wants to change the law but she does n't really understand the situation , " says Helen .
" Do you ban alcohol just because some people are alcoholics ? "
She has an ally in Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer , a Liberal Democrat peer who has fought to have the legislation amended .
" Obviously anything that leads to violence against women has to be taken very seriously , " says Baroness Miller .
" But you have to be very careful about the definition of ' extreme pornography ' and they have not nearly been careful enough . "
She has suggested the new act adopt the legal test set out in the OPA , which bans images which " tend to deprave and corrupt " .
But the government has sought to broaden the definition and the bill includes phrases such as " an act which threatens or appears to threaten a person 's life " .
Speaking from her home in Berkshire , Mrs Longhurst acknowledges that libertarians see her as " a horrible killjoy " .
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG
A lot of people would like to march and demonstrate against this law but if you stick your head above the parapet you are going to get yourself in the firing line
Click here to read more Helen defends extreme porn " I 'm not .
I do not approve of this stuff but there is room for all sorts of different people .
But anything which is going to cause damage to other people needs to be stopped . "
To those who fear the legislation might criminalise people who use violent pornography as a harmless sex aid , she responds with a blunt " hard luck " .
" There is no reason for this stuff .
I can't see why people need to see it .
People say what about our human rights but where are Jane 's human rights ? "
What is considered obscene has changed over the years Recently , the much - publicised rompings of Formula 1 boss Max Mosley have served as a reminder that kinky sex is found in all walks of society .
And just as Mr Mosley is fighting the expose of his antics , calling it an invasion of private life , so Baroness Miller says the new law also threatens people 's privacy .
" The government is effectively walking into people 's bedrooms and saying you can't do this .
It 's a form of thought police . "
She says there 's a danger of " criminalising kinkiness " and fears the legislation has been rushed through Parliament without proper debate because it is a small part of a wider bill .
Deborah Hyde , of Backlash , an umbrella group of anti-censorship and alternative sexuality pressure groups , has similar concerns .
Having engaged in it consensually would not be a crime , but to have a photograph of it in one 's possession would be a crime .
That does not seem to make sense to me
Lord Wallace of Tankerness
" How many tens or hundreds or thousands of people are going to be dragged into a police station , have their homes turned upside down , their computers stolen and their neighbours suspecting them of all sorts ? "
Such " victims " wo n't feel able to fight the case and " will take a caution , before there are enough test cases to prove that this law is unnecessary and unworkable " .
Another opponent of the new law is Edward Garnier , an MP and part - time judge , who questioned the clause when it was debated in the Commons .
" My primary concern is the vagueness of the offence , " says Mr Garnier .
" It was very subjective and it would not be clear to me how anybody would know if an offence had been committed . "
But the Ministry of Justice is unrepentant , saying the sort of images it is seeking to outlaw are out of place in modern - day Britain .
" Pornographic material which depicts necrophilia , bestiality or violence that is life threatening or likely to result in serious injury to the anus , breasts or genitals has no place in a modern society and should not be tolerated , " says a spokeswoman for the ministry .
Graham Coutts , who killed Jane Longhurst after viewing extreme pornography
Yet opponents have also seized on what they see as an anomaly in the new law , noted by Lord Wallace of Tankerness during last week 's debate in the House of Lords .
" If no sexual offence is being committed it seems very odd indeed that there should be an offence for having an image of something which was not an offence , " he said .
With that partly in mind , the government is tabling an amendment that would allow couples to keep pictures of themselves engaged in consensual acts - but not to distribute them .
Lord Hunt , who has charge of the bill in the Lords , admits it is being rushed through to meet a deadline .
But he denies the law has not been thoroughly considered and maintains it will only affect images that are " grossly offensive and disgusting " .
A selection of your comments appears below .
The sad thing is that no matter what laws are brought in they will never stop the monsters like Graham Coutts !
and innocent people with " kinks " will suffer ... more and more of peoples rights are being taken away , we are supposed to be a free country yet they go after innocent people and continue to let out monsters who do the damage !
is n't it time that laws were passed to put these monsters away forever rather than giving them a second chance !
Claire , Worcestershire , UK Seems like the dictatorship of the opinions of a minority , which is not my idea of a democracy ..
bob , London Speaking as a psychologist who has taught for nearly 10 years the alleged links between violent media and aggression , I think we need to take a step back here .
Despite popular assumptions that watching violent images ' causes ' aggression , the evidence ( around 1000 published studies ) that it does is contradictory and far from conclusive .
It is one thing to say that a deeply disturbed and dangerous person may seek out violent pornography to fulfil their deviant fantasies : however it is an entirely different matter to say that normal , well adjusted people will be inspired to commit violent crimes if they watch such images .
If we wish to avoid such tragedies happening again , we should take a wider look at how people become so disturbed that they lose the ability to judge right from wrong and commit such atrocities .
A debate over whether such pornography is banned or not is therefore a side issue as it does not adequately address this matter .
Dr Chris Cocking , London
If owning material that contains " An act which threatens or appears to threaten a person 's life " becomes illegal , then almost every film I own will be illegal .
Even if the violence must be in a sex scene I can think of several mainstream films this would include .
Basic instinct and Goldeneye to name two .
DaVe O , Cardiff I completely agree with this Bill .
It 's disgusting to think that someone finds it " kinky " to watch a women being raped , or having sex with a dead person and that their " rights " should be protected .
What about the people in the video being raped ???
Surely the people that like to watch " kinky porn " agree that there is a line , and surely if people cross the line should held accountable ( and I 'm talking about extreme cases , not just someone who finds bondage kinky ) .
They say the ultimate pornography is murder , do n't you think that these videos are stepping - stones to the ultimate act ?
Do n't you watch porn to fulfil your fantasies ?
I think if this becomes " acceptable " behaviour , then people will be able to argue that processing child - porn is just as innocent .
Victoria , London
What utter nonsense .
Jane Longhurst was murdered by a psychotic , not a photograph of a fetishist sex act .
I 'm so sick of Labour 's moral posturing ...
Nick , Edinburgh
Anyone who does n't agree with new law has serious mental health issues ...
Daniel , Oxford
There is more violence and incentive to cause violence and death in modern day video games , which are freely available to under 18s , than in the vast majority of porn films .
But the government will not try to ban them because they generate a lot of income tax .
The country and do - gooders have gone crazy .
Myles Povey , Chester I would consider myself a stable and well adjusted woman with no desire to harm another living creature especially a human .
Yet my partner and I enjoy a deep and loving relationship which is what many would consider " kinky " or deviant .
Whilst I do genuinely feel for Mrs Longhurst , I was under the impression we live in a democracy where people who were considered old enough to vote were also allowed to enjoy their own sexual preferences in their own home between consenting adults .
The people in these images have consented to the act and are enjoying it , but I can be prosecuted for viewing it .
Absurd !

What are these ?
Critics say the constitution will strengthen the government 's power
Speaking on behalf of Asean , Singapore Foreign Minister George
Yeo said there were concerns over the credibility of the new text and forthcoming polls .
It would ultimately be up to the Burmese people to vote " yes " or " no " in a referendum later this year , he added .
The US has also criticised the text and cast doubts over the poll 's fairness .
Mr Yeo was speaking as the host of a meeting of the regional body , Asean ( Association of South East Asian Nations ) , in Singapore .
The junta needs to start from scratch with a real draft constitution that actually passes the laugh test
Gordon Johndroe
White House national security spokesman
" What we are concerned about is the credibility of the process , " Mr Yeo said .
" There must be provisions for independent verification and many of us expressed the view that Myanmar [ Burma ] cannot ignore the international dimension , " he added .
" This is something that they have to decide on their own .
In the end , it 's for the Myanmar people to vote ' yes ' or ' no ' to it in the referendum . "
He earlier said some ministers at the meeting found it odd that the Burmese constitutional draft barred the pro-democracy leader , Aung San Suu Kyi , from standing for election .
Separately , the US said preventing Ms Suu Kyi from running in the elections casts doubts on the vote .
" That is hardly the definition of free and fair elections .
The junta needs to start from scratch with a real draft constitution that actually passes the laugh test , " White House national security spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
Secret text
Burma 's military government announced on Tuesday that a draft of the nation 's new constitution had been completed .
The document was drafted behind closed doors by an army - appointed body , and little is known of its contents .
The draft will be put to a referendum in May , and be followed by elections in 2010 , according to state media .
The constitution bars Ms Suu Kyi from standing as a candidate because she had a foreign husband .
Ms Suu Kyi's party said it was " unjust " to ban her from standing before the draft was even approved .
The country has not had a constitution since the military seized power in 1990 , after refusing to recognise Ms Suu Kyi's victory in a national election .
The pro-democracy leader has spent most of the years since then in jail or under house arrest .
I ’m just back from the first Scotland on Rails conference , and a jolly fine conference it was too .
Much kudos is due to Alan , Graeme , Abdel and Paul .
It was hard to believe that this was the first conference these guys have run and I think all my fellow delegates hope it wo n’t be the last .
As I said in the Pub on Saturday night , I ’d had a talk proposal knocked back and , in that situation , it ’s terribly easy to find yourself sitting in a session thinking “ Bloody hell , my talk would have been better than this ! ” , but not at this conference .
A phrase that cropped up a couple of times was the old saw that “ Data == Code ” - it ’s very hard to avoid the idea once you start talking about code generation or Domain Specific Pidgins , parsing …
I first came across the idea in The Structure And Interpretation of Computer Programs where it ’s elegantly phrased as “ Data is just dumb code , and code is just smart data ” .
Traditionally , the idea seems to be attributed to John McCarthy , the inventor of Lisp .
But it ’s older than that .
Way older than that .
The idea is actually older than Computer Science .
It lies at the core of Turing ’s original paper cite >
On Computable Numbers , with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem in which invents computer science on the way to proving that it ’s impossible to decide algorithmically whether a given statement of arithmetic is true or false .
In the course of the paper , Turing posits what has become known as the Halting Problem :
Given a description of a program and a finite input , decide whether the program finishes running or will run forever , given that input .
Turing ’s proof runs something like this :
Suppose we have a subroutine halts ?( code , data ) which solves the halting problem .
Let ’s use that to write something like :
def counter \_example ( code ) if halts ?
code , code for ( ; ; ) end else return end end counter\_example ( File.read( STDIN ) )
counter\_example.rb < counter\_example.rb
halts ?
counter \_example
halts ?
halts ?
and ask the question " What happens when we run " ?
Ifreckons thatwould halt , given itself as input , then counter example will enter an infinite loop , but ifreckon that it would enter an infinite loop , then it would halt .
Which is a contradiction .
Which means that there can be no subroutine , which means that maths is hard enough to be interesting and occasionally undecidable .
Look at how the proof works - it 's built around the idea that code can be treated as data .
In fact , you could say that the Turing Machine looks like it does because Turing was working backwards from this core idea to describe a sufficiently powerful machine that could obviously treat it 's own description as data .
Certainly when you compare the clarity of his proof that the halting problem is undecidable ( given the idea of the universal Turing machine ) with the contortions required to make mathematics swallow its own tail in similar fashion so that GÃ¶del could prove his Incompleteness Theorem .
So , if you want to know who the idea that code is data is due to , the answer ( as is so often the case in our field ) is Turing .
### Postscript Incidentally , Turing is also responsible for the first ever bug - his original implementation of a Universal Turing Machine has a couple , one of which is probably a dumb typo ( which even I could spot when I read the paper ) .
Another is more subtle , but still fixable .
Somewhat delightfully , a young grad student , ( [ Donald W Davies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Davies), who invented packet switching ) spotted these bugs and told Turing : > I ... found a number of quite bad programming errors , in effect , in the specification of the machine that he had written down , and I had worked out how to overcome these .
I went along to tell him and I was rather cock - a- hoop ... I thought he would say ' Oh fine , I 'll send along an addendum .
But in fact he was very annoyed , and pointed out furiously that really it did n't matter , the thing was right in principle , and altogether I found him extremely touchy on this subject .
Nearly fifty years later Davies wrote and published a debugged version of the code , which you can find in [ The Essential Turing ] ( amazon:0198250797 ) .
One lesson to draw from the above is that getting annoyed at people pointing out trivial bugs in example code is also at least as old as computer science .
Rather splendidly , there 's also a story of the chap who wrote the first ever assembler getting a serious telling off from Turing because the computer 's time was too valuable to waste it on converting symbols into machine code when humans were perfectly capable of doing it themselves .
Who knows , maybe Turing 's contention was actually true back in the days of the Manchester Baby ...
Prince William was awarded his RAF wings on 11 April Defence officials have justified giving Prince William permission to land a helicopter in a field belonging to his girlfriend Kate Middleton 's family .
The Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) issued a statement after the News of the World reported William touched down at the Middletons ' Berkshire home on 3 April .
Officials said the sortie had been fully authorised as part of the prince 's attachment to the RAF .
The Chinook landed for 20 seconds , but no - one got on or off , the MoD said .
The News of the World said the 25 - year - old prince touched down on land at the Middletons ' home in Bucklebury , Berkshire , during a 100 - mile , two - hour training exercise .
This was very much a routine training sortie that achieved essential training objectives
Ministry of Defence
He flew out of RAF Odiham , Hampshire , but , because of a shortage of landing spots in the county , asked for permission to use the Middletons ' land , the paper claimed .
Kate and her parents , Michael and Carole , were watching from their home as he landed , it also said .
The flight was described as " ridiculous and inappropriate " by aviation author Jon Lake , quoted in the News of the World .
" This is an absolute waste of training hours on the Chinook helicopter that the military are hard - pressed to afford , " he told the paper .
" No other pilot at Prince William 's stage of training would be allowed anywhere near the left - hand seat of a Chinook . "
' Routine training '
In a statement , the MoD said battlefield helicopter crews routinely practised landing in fields and confined spaces away from airfields as part of their training for conflicts such as Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Helicopter bases continually seek permission from land owners to use their fields and there are only two fields permanently available in Hampshire .
Opportunities to use alternatives are therefore regularly seized . "
It added : " The aircraft landed in the field , after taking all necessary safety precautions , and was on the ground for 20 seconds .
" No - one got on or off the aircraft .
This was very much a routine training sortie that achieved essential training objectives . "
Prince William was awarded his RAF pilot 's wings on 11 April after training with the air force since January .
His shortened training course was designed to make him a competent flier , but an RAF pilot would usually spend up to four years under instruction .
A graduate of Sandhurst military academy , William will now undertake a similar attachment to the Royal Navy .
His training periods with the RAF and Navy are familiarisation attachments , aiming to prepare him for his future role at the head of the armed forces .

What are these ?
Our youth , released from years of post secondary study , fly from the nest and into the sunrise of promising careers and worthwhile lives .
Sniff !
Swallow that lump .
Our youngest is three years from graduation and we 're already getting emotional .
Now , picture this .
Five years after the cap and gown were returned to storage , the shoulders of our children are bent and bowed .
The tens of thousands they accumulated in student debt is growing , not shrinking , made worse by car loans and credit cards that never seem to get paid off .
Home ownership drifts unattainably far off and Mom and Dad have been hit up again for a loan just to cover the basics .
Can we change things ?
Can we set up our kids ' lives and expectations to ensure they are n't crushed by debt before they are even 30 years old ?
We think so .
Some realities are inescapable , such as the high cost of education , the inability of young people to earn enough during the summer to pay more than a fraction of the price tag and the low wages awaiting many of them upon graduation .
But there are lots of steps we can take to ensure our offspring do n't make student debt worse with poor money management skills .
Here are some suggestions :
1 . Give your children an allowance , by all means .
But make them accountable for it .
Hold a quarter of the sum in reserve .
If and only if they have successfully recorded their spending at the end of the month , they get the rest .
2. Insist on saving .
Like brushing teeth , it should n't be an option .
The percentage should be around 25 per cent .
Once they are out in the world , 10 per cent is the figure to aim for but when they are young , with no bills to pay , make it higher .
Consider bonusing it up if they keep their hands off .
Also encourage them to put a portion of cash gifts into savings .
3 . Jobs are good .
Shovel , cut , sweep , deliver ... it does n't matter .
In our opinion , no kid should reach high school without the experience of working .
We do n't buy the , " let kids be kids " line .
Kids have always worked .
Even an afternoon delivering newspapers teaches them about work .
And part of the money they earn should be saved .
4. Split savings into two piles .
Half goes into an RESP fund , for which they get a lovely 20 per cent government education savings grant .
The other half goes into their own savings accounts .
Saving up for purchases , or delaying gratification , is the single most valuable lesson you can teach a child .
5 . Stop buying big ticket items for your kids right this very minute !
Let them participate in saving up for the iPod or the Playstation .
Big ticket items at 11 turn into bigger ticket items at 25 .
Car loans are a significant contributor to the crushing debt load of our youth , because it is too easy to purchase vehicles with little or no money down .
6. Debit cards are a fact of life — do n't fight them , instead focus on their proper use .
Insist kids record all transactions and then reconcile them with the bank statement at the end of the month .
Do n't allow withdrawals from ATMs that charge a fee .
If they ignore you , take the card away for a month .
And do not allow savings accounts to be attached to debit cards .
If children or teens overspend , they should bear the consequences of card refusal and overdraft charges .
7 . By adolescence , make sure your child has a clothing allowance .
Giving them money quarterly for the basics ( excluding coats , boots and shoes ) is a good system .
Shopping with them as they spend their own money teaches them how to budget .
If they wipe out their entire quarterly allotment with a single purchase , so be it .
8. Discuss with children the difference between wants and needs .
This is the Achilles heel of our times .
Try this :
When your children lust after something , offer to pay a percentage if they wait two months .
Amazingly , the desire often disappears .
9 . Involve the kids in family spending .
Yeah , yeah , it 's boring and the computer , iPod , TV beckons .
Give each child some financial responsibility .
It could be helping you with comparison shopping .
Most kids love this because finding the cheaper price is like a game .
It could be coupon clipping for their favourite cereal .
Get creative .
10 . Start your children investing .
Even Canada Savings Bonds , purchased inside an RESP , are a lesson in making your money grow .
It is too expensive to buy small quantities of shares , but mutual funds purchased quarterly introduce them to the notion of long - term investing .
Losing money when the market dips is n't such a bad thing when the stakes are low .
And since the market goes up more than it goes down , if you have chosen a good , low - risk fund they will watch it recover .
11 . Encourage parents and grandparents to cut back on the Christmas and birthday presents and deposit money in an RESP instead .
12 . Read statements in paper form or online with your kids .
It only takes a few minutes to cast your eye over their bank statement and RESP statement but the process teaches children the importance of that money management habit .
They will learn what the acronyms mean , what interest , debit , credit , withdrawal and deposit refer to .
They will also learn how to spot fees and penalties .
As a result , they wo n't be intimidated by the process when they get out on their own .
That 's gold for the later years .
13 . DO NOT BAIL THEM OUT .
Financial bailouts that begin in adolescence translate into financial dependence later on .
If they have spent all their Christmas money and they still have presents to buy ... too bad .
Make something — bake cookies , paint a picture .
14 . Let your kids know early on that they will be participating in the funding of their education .
There is no reason why a child can't pay for a quarter to a third of their own education , even more if post - secondary includes community college or university in their hometown .
15 . Consider a year or two of working before beginning post - secondary studies .
A period of employment first teaches them a universe of valuable skills .
Today 's students run the gamut of young , old , part - time and full - time so there is no stigma involved in waiting .
On the other hand , a post - grad life with minimum debt spells freedom .
You want to spend a year hanging out in Asia ?
No problem — if there are no student loans to pay .

Finally , you can follow every suggestion religiously but some kids still wo n't get it easily .
However , if you lay down the essentials of good money management early , chances of your children reaching 30 without being overwhelmed by debt are far , far higher .
" Women use me .
That 's my job , " says Casey , a 29 - year - old construction worker by day and stripper for the past five years .
" I 'm a Leo , so I love entertaining and dropping barriers . "
Tonight , at Au Bar 's Friday night Ladies Night , Casey will also be dropping his clothes , even his " t - bar , " the stripper industry name for thong underwear .
" At Skybar , [ Ladies Night ] we do n't get naked , just down to our boxers , " adds Hunter .
Women can be aggressive , " sometimes the girls get mad and pick a fight .
One woman chased me out of the bar and yelled at me on the street . "
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
Right now , the bar 's empty , and Casey , Hunter and Dimitrius are hydrating themselves for the night 's festivities , which typically involve dancing around in costumes -- firemen and cops are the most popular -- dry - humping the odd bride - to - be , perhaps some tea - bagging ( industry speak for dipping their crotches over women 's faces in 69 position ) and certainly lots of MC - encouraged , two - way groping , since audience participation is a prerequisite of any Ladies Night .
These guys might go home with a phone number , some scratches and even bites .
Worst case scenario , a bruised ego since women have been known to boo , throw ice or , the ultimate insult , walk right out the door mid-show .
" Ladies love a man with a long hose , " says Hunter about the wild popularity of the fireman costume .
Tonight , these guys are thinking outside the box .
Casey 's wearing his French waiter get - up , Dimitrius is wearing an authentic French Foreign Legion uniform he picked up at a local surplus military store and Hunter is playing Don Juan .
How do they avoid showing up with the same outfit ?
" We phone each other beforehand , " says 22 - year - old Dimitrius , a university marketing student by day , stripper these past six months and the rookie in the bunch .
' To the lions '
" I wo n't take off my g- string , since I 'm the first act , " says Dimitrius .
" That 's what happens when you have a small penis , " responds Hunter .
I do n't know if he 's joking , but according to their manager Mark Aylott of Stripper Entertainment ( which has the largest supply of male strippers in Western Canada and supplies men to almost every Ladies Night , stagette or birthday surprise party in town ) , " Penis size is n't that important .
Really big ones are only good for novelty .
We had one guy who was half penis .
He jumped around for awhile and then brought his third leg out .
Half the crowd ran for the door .
Anyway , most dancers tie off with a cock ring because blood goes elsewhere when you 're dancing , like coming out of a shower , which is n't good . "
Aylott , a former stripper himself , gets about six applications from would - be male strippers per month .
He looks for a toned body and good dance moves , first and foremost , but will help recruits with choreography and costumes .
If they pass the basics , Aylott " throws them to the lions " at one of the city 's many Ladies Nights .
" The money 's pretty good , [ $ 175 for club gigs and $ 200 for private parties ] but 15 minutes is a long time to be dancing with your dangler out in front of a crowd of women , " says Aylott .
Seventy - five percent can't hack it , so Stripper Entertainment is always hiring .
These guys are a rare breed and do n't seem nervous .
" You just have to do what the girls like and what touches your heart , " says Dimitrius .
Other strippers I 've met admit it can be nerve - racking going in front of 100 women chanting ' Penis ! Penis !'
Then , when the clothes come off , the women might giggle and point .
The men say standing at attention in such an environment can be a challenge .
' I was a geek '
" Nakedness creates a whole different atmosphere and it takes a lot to impress girls , " said Diamond via cell phone , en route to a tour of duty in the Interior .
" They often grope you like crazy .
I feel like a piece of meat , but it 's part of the job . "
Diamond is one of Stripper 's most requested men and , in the busy summer season , he can work up to five gigs a night , including private stagettes and club events .
He got into stripping after dropping out of the University of Victoria 's engineering program .
" You tend to do anything when you 're broke .
Of course you have to invest .
I spend a lot of money on costumes , props , promotions .
I work out every day . "
Male strippers also have to maintain professionalism in the face of drunk , horny women .
" Propositions happen a lot , almost every day , " in Diamond World .
" I just smile and laugh and try to keep it professional .
Sometimes it 's the bride - to - be but most cases it 's an invited guest , sometimes the mother - in - law .
I 'm not a cocky person .
I was a geek in school so positive comments are a shock .
It does nothing to my ego . "
Twenty five - year - old California Kid , another top - requested stripper and part - time actor who does " Vegas - style " shows and even lights himself on fire , said , " I got a lot of propositions for sex and whatnot in my younger days and I fell for that .
But now I 'm married and recognize the look in their eyes .
Girls are worse than men , more piggish .
They think they can grab you and get anything from you .
I just think , ' I would n't touch you with a ten foot poll . '
But it 's kinda flattering . "
Interactive burlesque
Casey shrugs his shoulders when I mention all of this .
" Stripping has helped me understand women better and respect them more . "
Soon enough , he 's on stage with a bride - to - be from Seattle pinned to the stage with her feet up around her ears as he thrusts into her backside to the beat of Ricky Martin .
He 's already laid his hands on about half the women perched on their barstools around Au Bar 's stage , recently elevated just for Ladies Night .
While women stripper clubs have strict no touching policies and the mood is typically like the waiting room of some hot sexy dentist , Ladies Nights tend towards interactive burlesque with the women as much prop as patron .
Casey does n't actually take it all off , but , instead , gives us the odd peak , also known as ' the meat puppet show . '
Bride - to - be Karen is fine with that .
" I 'd rather they did n't get naked , " says the nurse , whose friends forced her into a slutty nurse 's uniform for tonight 's stagette .
" I see penises every day at work .
Male bodies are functional .
I 'm thinking , ' Just put it away . ' "
On the other side of the tracks , at a Chicago 's Tonight Ladies Night , another bride - to - be said practically the same thing to me early in the evening .
By the end of the show , she was dirty dancing with one of the strippers and had taken up smoking again .
' Buck naked '
But when I poll other Au Bar patrons , most agree with Karen .
Only one woman admits she 's here first and foremost to look at buck - naked men .
" Naked men are n't that aesthetically pleasing , especially dancing , you look pretty stupid , " according to Adrian , by far Stripper 's most requested male dancer .
" Women are here to have fun with their friends and you 're the side show , " says the 26 - year - old in his final year of finance at a local university who likes to do Matrix - style shows and often appropriately opens with Metallica 's " Master Of Puppets . "
Adrian does admit that female sexuality is very complex and he's also seen patrons lapse into unladylike behaviour when faced with thrusting bulging sequined thongs .
" They do n't understand that when the show 's over , in our minds , we 're done .
They 'll slap you on the ass .
Some girls are mean .
You wonder , ' Are they laughing with me or at me ? ' "
It 's hard to tell who 's the butt of the joke by the time Hunter , in black cape and mask , pulls out his penis and cleans a woman 's glasses off with it .
Her face turns purple and when he hands her glasses back , she does n't return them to her face .
Of course , she does n't really need them since we rarely get a clear shot of Hunter 's assets .
No wonder he gets chased out of bars .
Mixed messages
I feel a bit ripped off and confused by all the mixed messages .
How does a straight woman maintain her sex drive if she does n't think the male body is fun to look at , lust over and , perhaps , even objectify occasionally ?
Much of human brain is associated with vision , but women tend to link stimuli across both hemispheres , while men compartmentalize .
Of course , our brains are highly adaptable , so it makes me wonder what part does recent socio- economic culture play in the rarity of full frontal male nudity , even at a peeler show ?
One woman yells something over the music about the female drive to " nest . "
I guess she did n't receive the news that this " fidelity for food " equation was recently debunked by anthropologists like Kristen Hawkes , Stephen Beckerman and Helen Fisher who believe it 's little more than recent cultural hype , and that , traditionally , women are polygamistic both for breeding and pleasure .
Thinking of naked tribal men dancing around to impress potential suitors , I wonder if the lack of male full monty in our western culture came out of a puritanical fear of women 's sexuality .
Maybe our culture 's elite rulers feel threatened by the effect of less economically powerful men's potentially bigger penises have on the tribe , but unfortunately there are no studies on this topic .
Backwards night
At any rate , the women at Au Bar Ladies Night seem to have reverted to a pubescent state of repressed sexuality , cheering on demand when the MC says , ' Ladies , you 're gonna see some peepees ! "
At some Ladies Nights , there are even prize - winning games between sets like Throw The Hoop on the Giant Inflatable Penis !
Yet , for brief moments , usually as the " meat - puppet show " begins , I can see this glimmer of wanton lust sweep across the women 's disco - ball speckled faces .
The tension in the air becomes palpable , much like any stripper club .
Then , they typically lapse back into giggling , pointing and letting Hunter tuck pink " Stripper Bucks " into their cleavage then remove them with his teeth while mugging for their friend 's camera .
Everything seems backwards at Ladies Night .
Meanwhile , the male strippers certainly look attentive but , as with women strippers , sex tends to be the last thing on their minds as they navigate the tough terrain of " naked land . "
Only careful choreography allows them to take their pants off at just the right moment in " Ca n't Touch This , " or risk a wardrobe malfunction .
" My mind is always on what you 're going to do next , " said Adrian .
" You have to be focused .
It 's tough . "
Because of this , Ladies Nights are sometimes like the Gong Show .
Aylott has been known to get out the proverbial giant hook and " yank guys of the stage .
One guy was almost translucent , blinding white .
His prop was his mountain bike , so he did all these jumping tricks , then he just swayed around .
Women pointed and laughed .
One guy said he was 212 pounds and ripped .
He showed up at the club in leather bondage gear .
I said , ' You look fat ! '
He unzipped and he was fat .
I said , ' You just have to go away , " so he waddled off .
We 're cruel humans at the office , too .
The bad videos get lots of play .
Sometimes they get taken home for private viewings . "
' You 're on your own '
In case you men are thinking career move , Aylott advises wannabes to " Try to be sexy but do n't do anything outside your comfort zone which could cause injury or make you feel like a big tool .
You have to be committed . "
And willing to take " the worst kind of debauchery , particularly with the fundraiser set ; the dancers literally get the clothes ripped off their bodies .
One guy showed me the bite marks on his ass and said , ' I 'm conflicted .
On the one hand , they were harassing me , on the other hand they were really hot . ' "
Diamond said his ass is bitten " a lot . "
Add sexual propositions to the mix and it's no wonder all of tonight 's dancers are presently single .
" There 's a lot of discrimination out there , " says Dimitrius .
" No girls are trying to rescue us , " according to Adrian , who says he'd sometimes like " more security .
Doormen are watching , but essentially , you 're on your own . "
Even if these guys find a girlfriend , jealousy sometimes rears its head .
" It 's hard on relationships when 15 women proposition them in one night , " says Aylott , adding , " We 're not an escort agency .
What they do on their own time is none of my business . "
Hunter wraps up his set with one last peak , demurely picks up his pile of clothes and tiptoes barefoot back to the men 's bathroom to change .
Karen remains unimpressed and just wants to get on the dance floor .
Casey and Dimitrius , now in black street clothes , do the obligatory post - show flirting , readying for attitude from the impending rush of male patrons lined up outside ; sometimes jealous boyfriends want to fight the strippers or even smash strippers ' car windows .
But first , the MC gives out door prizes as if we 're sugar - rushing teenyboppers who came here for loot bags , not naked men .
Danielle Egan is a Vancouver - based writer .
A few months ago , I decided to save the earth .
Maybe it was something Al Gore said .
Maybe it was something Leonardo DiCaprio said .
Maybe it was just the high gas prices and the weakening dollar .
Whatever it was , two weeks later I was at a car dealership near where I live in upstate New York , trading in my glacier - melting , atmosphere - wrecking , gas - guzzling American pick - up truck for a pocket - sized , carbon - frugal , 35 mile - per - gallon Japanese econobox .
And you know something ?
It felt good .
It felt right .
It felt as if simply by getting into that car , just by turning the key and pulling into traffic , I was doing something good for mankind .
My goodwill passed quickly .
I was somehow both saving mankind and bringing out the worst in him .
" Move your ass ! " called the driver of an SUV that swerved around me .
" Get a real car , jackass , " shouted the driver of a pick - up truck as he sped by .
If the effect my car was having on the planet was to reduce my contribution to the accumulation of dangerous gasses in its atmosphere , the effect it was having on the planet 's inhabitants was an overwhelming need to overtake , regardless of how quickly I was already going .
If I was doing 40 mph , they 'd go by at 45 .
If I was doing 45 , they 'd go by at 50 .
If I was doing 70 , they 'd pull up beside me , look over , shake their heads and speed off at 80 .
They cut me off .
They veered into me .
They gave me the finger .
It did n't make any sense .
I was only trying to help .
I was suffering for them , did n't they realise that ?
I was the Jesus of Blacktop , the Christ of Concrete .
" My sloth will save thee ! " I wanted to shout .
What would Jesus drive ?
I began to regret my decision .
And I began to get angry .
Save mankind ?
What had I been thinking ?
I hate mankind .
Everyone does .
Why do you think aliens always circle around and leave ?
I hated my new car .
I hated Japan .
I wanted a gas - guzzler .
I wanted a car with negative miles per gallon .
I wanted a Ford F - 150 .
I wanted a Ford F - 350 .
I wanted a Ford F - 550 , with an extra engine strapped to the top that did n't even attach to anything , it just ran continuously , all day and all night , doing nothing but spreading toxins and poison into the atmosphere of a planet full of people I loathed .
I wanted a car that ran on CFCs , and I wanted to drive it across the planet with " Bite me , mankind , " written across the back window .
And when , a few weeks later , I returned home , all mankind would be gone and I would laugh and laugh and choke and die .
Happily .
And then , a week or so later , spring arrived .
Just beyond the sun-filled windows of my bedroom , bright red cardinals and haughty black crows sang their favourite songs as the eager buds of a nearby maple shook their bright green heads in the warm morning breeze .
I hurried outside , climbed into my car , opened all the windows and went for a drive .
All around , the earth was awakening , coming to life and , suddenly , my car felt right again .
And I felt good again .
And I was happy again .
Because I realised that what I had set out to do was save the earth ; if mankind happened to survive , too , well , there was nothing I could do about that .
An hour later , and many more miles further than my pick - up would have gone , I stopped at a gas station for a refill and a cup of coffee .
" What in the hell you call that ? " asked the driver of the SUV that pulled up beside me .
" What do I call what ? " I ask .
" That , " he said .
" I call it a car . "
He shook his head .
" My truck craps bigger 'n that , " he said .
His friend laughed , slapped him on the back and they peeled out , spinning their tyres and leaving behind a thick cloud of dust and sinister smoke .
Nope .
Nothing I could do about that at all .
· A few days ago , someone running for president of the United States suggested that blue - collar people in America are bitter .
Two other bitter people , both of whom also happen to be running for president and neither of whom happen to be blue collar , denied that blue - collar people were bitter .
They said it was elitist to say that blue - collar people were bitter , and both expressed their bitterness about the elitism they believed they were hearing .
The bitter feud grew all weekend until yesterday , when it finally made its way to the bitter mainstream media , which spent the day wondering whether the people who were allegedly bitter were actually bitter , or whether they were just bitter about the bitterness allegations .
Bitter bloggers , rushing to the defence of their bitter candidates , complained bitterly - some were bitter about the suggestion that blue - collar people were bitter , and some were bitter about the reaction to the suggestion that blue - collar people were bitter .
By this morning , the whole bitter episode was being called Bittergate , and all the news programmes , on all the news channels , spent all afternoon preparing Bittergate logo designs in time for the evening news .
And people wonder why I 'm bitter .

Re : “ Free to Speak ” , April 28 , 2008 print edition
The editors of Maclean ’s believe that “ Human rights commissions are undermining the fundamental Charter rights of all Canadians . ”
With respect , we disagree .
Our action in dismissing the complaints against the Maclean ’s articles supports freedom of expression .
Our action in calling for debate and discussion also supports that principle .
In our decision we explained that the complaints were not within our jurisdiction .
The decision not to proceed was the result of careful consideration of the law .
Any other interpretation would have interfered with freedom of expression .
Once that decision was made , we were free to comment on the issues raised .
We followed the correct process for both aspects of our mandate under section 29 of the Ontario Human Rights Code – protecting and promoting human rights in order to create “… a climate of understanding and mutual respect for the dignity and worth of each person … , ” as set out in the Preamble .
Stereotyping hurts the people and groups targeted , their families and their communities , and ultimately , all of us .
In the post - 9/11 world , we have seen more and more negative portrayals of Muslims and the rise of Islamophobia .
Like racial profiling and other types of discrimination , ascribing the behaviour of individuals to a group damages everyone in that group .
We have always spoken out on such issues .
Maclean ’s and its writers are free to express their opinions .
The OHRC is mandated to express what it sees as unfair and harmful comment or conduct that may lead to discrimination .
We need to keep in mind that freedom of expression is not the only right in the Charter .
There is a full set of rights accorded to all members of our society , including freedom from discrimination .
No single right is any more or less important than another .
And the enjoyment of one depends on the enjoyment of the other .
This means if you want to stand up and defend the right to freedom of expression then you must be willing to do the same for the right to freedom from discrimination .
The human rights system exists in Canada , in part , to shine a light on prejudice and to provoke debate – and action .
We called for debate and dialogue ; we still do .
We have taken controversial views before and no doubt will again .
That is inevitable because we have a mandate to promote change – away from unfair stereotypes and discriminatory behaviour and towards a culture of human rights .
We agree with the Editors of Maclean ’s : critics are entitled to their opinions .
Sometimes we must be critical .
We have that duty , enshrined in law , to speak up on human rights issues of the day – and we will continue to do so .
Yours truly ,
Barbara Hall
Chief Commissioner
WASHINGTON , March 13 ( Reuters ) -
What 's over $ 100 billion a year in Iraq war costs to a $ 14 trillion U.S. economy ?
Not much now , but the tab is growing on a " buy - now - pay - later " plan that threatens long - term problems .
Money was not much of an issue five years ago when President George W. Bush led the country into war in Iraq .
Instead , all eyes were on allegations , later proven unfounded , that then - Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and could use them against the United States .
But $ 500 billion later , experts worry about the impact on the world 's biggest economy , already facing a crippling housing crisis .
" The short - term economic consequences of the war have been manageable and modest .
But the long - term consequences will be substantial , " said Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody 's Economy.com .
Much of the problem , economists say , is that every month of combat adds more than $ 10 billion to a U.S. debt that now tops $ 9 trillion .
" Extra government debt is undoubtedly a bad thing for our economic performance in the long run , " said Doug Elmendorf , senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former economist for the Federal Reserve Board .
Other expenses -- such as health care costs for the poor and a new prescription drug plan for the elderly -- combine to increase the government 's debt at a much faster rate than the Iraq war , Elmendorf noted .
' STOP DIGGING '
" The rule when one is in a hole is to stop digging , " Elmendorf said of debt and war costs .
Robert Reischauer , head of the Urban Institute and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office , said the benefits of war spending for the U.S. economy had been " muted " because so much of the money is spent on goods and services abroad .
That , he said , was " stimulating economies elsewhere , not the least being the economies of Iraq , Kuwait and Saudi Arabia . "
War backers would point out that failing to secure the United States after the Sept. 11 attacks would have a severe impact on economic well - being , he said .
" If one thinks this war is very important for our national security , then ultimately , it is important for our economic success as well , " Elmendorf said , adding that " if it was , it was also worth paying for " it instead of borrowing .
At some point , government debt comes due and the Treasury Department either must pay it off or roll it over and pay more interest , just like a family facing monthly credit card bills .
Higher government borrowing also could push up interest rates , making it more expensive for consumers to borrow for home mortgages and businesses to finance investments .
In early 2003 , it seemed a remote possibility that the U.S. - led invasion could create economic problems at home .
On Jan. 29 , 2003 , less than two months before the war , then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the White House budget office " has come up with a number that 's something under $ 50 billion for the cost . "
And of that , he added , a portion might be paid by " other countries . "
Vice President Dick Cheney tried easing economic concerns by saying Iraqi oil revenues could cover some costs .
Five years later , the war may have helped some local economies , where bullets and tank armor are made , or enriched contractors working in Baghdad .
But none of Iraq 's oil revenues have been tapped and U.S. taxpayers have bankrolled an effort that so far has cost them not $ 50 billion , but around $ 500 billion , with hundreds of billions of dollars more ahead .
U.S. ELECTION
As November 's U.S. presidential and congressional election nears and voters worry about pocketbook issues , Democrats have begun tying the war to the faltering economy .
" You cannot separate the economy from the long , bloody civil war in Iraq , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat , told reporters .
Democrats were hearing from voters back home that " we ( the U.S. ) do n't have money for anything anymore .
We 're borrowing all the money for Iraq , " he said .
Washington 's overall spending on domestic programs outside of defense , such as education , highways and law enforcement , has grown .
But over the seven years of the Bush presidency , that funding represents a declining share of the budget and economy .
Nobel Prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz , who says the Iraq war could end up costing $ 3 trillion when factoring in combat and other long - term related costs , also blames the war for part of the run-up in world oil prices .
At the beginning of March 2003 , just before the fighting began , U.S. crude oil was $ 37.21 a barrel .
This week , that same barrel hit a record $ 110 .
The war accounted for $ 5 to $ 10 of oil 's higher price , Stiglitz told Congress .
Robert Ebel , a senior energy adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said Mideast political instability always factored into oil prices .
But the huge increase over the past five years , he said , was not so much due to Iraq .
" Growth in demand has not been matched by substantial growth in supply , " with China 's oil thirst rising , oil - exporting countries ' spare production capacity down and no new U.S. refineries being built .
Largely because of World War Two , which brought a huge expansion in industrial production and millions of jobs , there has been a notion that wars are good for the economy .
That may have been the case in the 1940s .
But in 2003 , with an economy growing and full employment , war did not bring the kind of investment that was needed or in the long - term interest , according to Stiglitz .
" America is a rich country .
The question is not whether we can afford to squander $ 3 trillion or $ 5 trillion .
We can .
But our strength will be sapped , " he told Congress .

Lou Dobbs ' commentary appears weekly on CNN.com .
Lou Dobbs says U.S. leaders have squandered the nation 's wealth .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- President Bush 's assurances that we 'll all be " just fine " if he and Congress can work out an economic stimulus package seem a little hollow this morning .
Much like Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke 's assurances last May that the subprime mortgage meltdown would be contained and not affect the broader economy .
And it seems Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has spent most of the past year trying to influence Chinese economic policy rather than setting the direction of U.S. economic policy .
There is no question that Bush , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will quickly come up with an economic stimulus package simply because they can no longer ignore our economic and financial crisis .
That economic stimulus plan will amount to about 1 percent of our nation 's gross domestic product , an estimated $ 150 billion .
But all of us should recognize that the stimulus package will be inadequate to drive sustainable growth in our $ 13 trillion economy .
An emergency Fed rate cut and an economic stimulus plan are short - term responses to our complex economic problems , nothing more than bandages for a hemorrhaging economy .
Bush , Pelosi , Reid and the presidential candidates of both parties have an opportunity now , and I believe an obligation , to adjust the public policy mistakes of the past quarter - century that have led to this crisis .
And only through courageous policy decisions will we be able to steer this nation 's economy away from the brink of outright disaster .
We all have to acknowledge that our problems were in part brought on by the failure of our government to regulate the institutions and markets that are now in crisis .
The irresponsible fiscal policies of the past decade have led to a national debt that amounts to $ 9 trillion .
The irresponsible so - called free trade policies of Democratic and Republican administrations over the past three decades have produced a trade debt that now amounts to more than $ 6 trillion , and that debt is rising faster than our national debt .
All of which is contributing to the plunge in the value of the U.S. dollar .
At precisely the point in our history in which this nation has become ever more dependent on foreign producers for everything from clothing to computers to technology to energy , our weakened dollar is making the price of an ever - increasing number of imported goods even more expensive .
All Americans will soon have to face a bitter and now obvious truth :
Our national , political and economic leaders have squandered this nation 's wealth , and the price of this profligacy is enormous , and the bill has just come due for all of us .
Bernanke endorsed the concept of a short - term economic stimulus package , but he cautioned that the money must be spent correctly : " You 'd hope that [ consumers ] would spend it on things that are domestically produced so that the spending power does n't go elsewhere . "
Just what would you have us spend it on ?
The truth is that consumers spend most of their money on foreign imports , and any stimulus package probably would be stimulating foreign economies rather than our own .
Imports , for example , account for 92 percent of our non-athletic footwear , 92 percent of audio video equipment , 89 percent of our luggage and 73 percent of power tools .
In fact , between 1997 and 2006 , only five of the 114 industries examined in a U.S. Business and Industry Council report gained market share against import competition .
And let 's be honest and straightforward , as I hope our president and the candidates for president will be :
This stimulus will not prevent a recession .
It may ease the pain for millions of Americans , but a recession we will have .
The question is how deep , how prolonged and how painful will it be .
Unfortunately , we 're about to find out how committed and capable our national leaders are at mitigating that pain and producing realistic policy decisions for this nation that now stands at the brink .

Aid is also a serious problem in the contested Ogaden region of Ethiopia , across the border from here .
A recent report written by a contractor working for the United States Agency for International Development said the drought there was “ clearly worsening ” and that the response by the Ethiopian government , one of America ’s closest allies in Africa , was “ absolutely abysmal . ”

Drought is killing livestock and destroying livelihoods .

This may be no accident .
The Ethiopian government is struggling with an insurgency in the Ogaden , and the report said that “ food is clearly being used as a weapon , ” with the government starving out rebel areas , while a mysterious warehouse of American - donated food was discovered across the road from an Ethiopian Army base .
“ The U.S.G. , ” meaning the United States government , “ cannot in good conscience allow the food operation to continue in its current manifestation , ” the report said .
“ This situation would be absolutely shameful in any other country . ”
The report was not made public , though a copy was provided to The New York Times .
When asked about it , a senior American aid official characterized the report as “ just a snapshot and one person ’s observations and impressions . ”
But the senior aid official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , also said : “ We ’re not saying there ’s not a crisis in the Ogaden .
We ’re not saying the Ethiopian response has been satisfactory .
But some progress has been made .
And we need more . ”
Ethiopian officials declined comment and have denied human rights abuses in the Ogaden .
All across this region , one of the poorest of the poor , people are left to the mercies of the desert .
In central Somalia , for instance , fewer than five inches of rain have fallen in the past year and a half , aid officials say .
The winds are harsh , throats are dry .
This area , like much of the Horn of Africa , is too arid for farming .
The people here , in lonely outposts like Dagaari , survive by grazing goats , sheep , cattle and camels , selling the animals for money they use to buy food .
“ But nobody wants a skinny goat , ” explained Abdul Kadir Nur , a herder in Dagaari .
That was about all he had left after the drought killed 400 of his 450 animals .
Not far from the pile of goat bones is a circle of stones .
It is the grave of his toddler son .
Mr. Abdul Kadir said the boy had died of hunger and that he had been placed in his grave at an angle , “ so he can sleep . ”
He walked a few more steps , his flip - flops digging into the crunchy earth .
He arrived at Ms. Safia ’s hut , where several people were peering in the doorway , watching her sweat on the dirt floor .
The nearest hospital was only a half hour away , but nobody had any money to pay for a ride .
“ She will most likely die , ” an elder said and walked away .
Ms. Safia ’s son seemed to sense that .
He curled up next to his mother while he still could , his face pressed against the damp cloth that covered her .
Her ribs moved up and down , up and down , in quick shallow breaths .
Late today , in response to longstanding congressional demands , the Justice Department released a declassified version of one of the original legal underpinnings for U.S. government - sanctioned torture , a March 14 , 2003 memo written by the Office of Legal Counsel ’s John Yoo .
From the Post :
The memo–which was rescinded just nine months after it was issued–provides an expansive argument for nearly unfettered presidential power in a time of war , contending that numerous laws and treaties that forbid torture or cruel treatment should not apply to the interrogations of enemy combatants overseas .
â ¦
“ If a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate a criminal prohibition , he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the al Qaeda terrorist network , ” Yoo wrote .
“ In that case , we believe that he could argue that the executive branch ’s constitutional authority to protect the nation from attack justified his actions . ”
Interrogators who harmed a prisoner would be protected by a “ national and international version of the right to self - defense , ” Yoo wrote .
He also articulated a definition of illegal conduct in interrogations — that it must “ shock the conscience ” — that the Bush administration advocated for years .
“ Whether conduct is conscience - shocking turns in part on whether it is without any justification , ” Yoo wrote , explaining , for example , that it would have to be inspired by malice or sadism before it could be prosecuted .
Jason Scott had just finished his first year at Stanford and had nowhere to live .
Financial aid did n't cover the dorms for the summer .
He had $ 50 in his wallet , and so until paychecks arrived from his on - campus summer jobs , he needed to be resourceful .
For two weeks , he lived in his Jeep parked around Stanford 's grassy Oval , with its grand view of the campus ' sandstone arcades .
He showered in the gym .
He ate peanut butter sandwiches .
During the day , he worked in the registrar 's office microfilming Stanford students ' applications , the contents of which justified a nagging sense that most of his classmates came from a different world .
Some referenced exotic travel , unusual sports such as water polo , and boarding schools with names like Phillips Exeter Academy and St. Paul 's School .
" Who are these people ? " he remembers asking himself .
Stanford says it admits the brightest students regardless of their ability to pay .
Yet only 12 percent of Stanford 's 6,759 undergraduates receive Pell Grants , a yardstick used to measure how many low - income students such as Scott are enrolled .
The number has n't budged despite Stanford 's generous financial aid incentives in recent years .
At UC Berkeley , meanwhile , 31 percent of undergraduates get the federal grants that are typically awarded to students from families earning less than $ 40,000 a year .
Scott , now a senior , and his college friends who also grew up poor entered a new universe at Stanford .
For the first time , they clearly understood the advantages of money - knowledge that shaped their Stanford experience .
As much as money matters , Scott said , it matters most before students ever try to enroll .
Kids who grow up with money attend good high schools .
They understand the importance of mastering the violin or excelling at soccer .
They have SAT preparation and sometimes professional college application consultants .
Those advantages help smooth the way at the most prestigious of the West Coast 's major private universities .
" We struggled to get there and once we got there , it was a culture shock , " said one of Scott 's friends , Tanya Koshy , a recent Stanford graduate .
" Once you get over the initial shock and accept the fact that you 're different and come from a different background , you can propel yourself forward and nothing can hold you back . "
Frugal living
Almost everything in Scott 's dorm room can fit into his one red suitcase .
His single wall decoration is a birthday poster his dorm mates made that hangs above a desk with a wooden chair .
All of this contrasts with his roommate 's things : a black leather office chair , a poster depicting a mansion and luxury cars that reads " Justification for Higher Education , " an enormous flat - screen TV .
Scott has always lived frugally .
Born in Guyana , he moved to the United States with his older sister at age 11 to be with his remarried father , who is in the military .
The family eventually settled in Junction City , Kan. , where the median income is $ 30,084 .
Scott qualified for the gifted program at his high school and took the three Advanced Placement courses offered .
He scored 1,320 out of 1,600 on the SAT .
Once at Stanford , he realized he was behind in subjects like math despite his hard work in high school .
His dream of someday becoming a Rhodes Scholar began to vanish .
He gravitated toward those with similar backgrounds , forming a tight - knit group of five close friends .
They laughed together in disbelief at some of what they heard - talk of a weight - loss camp in Brazil where someone planned to tone her abs , discussion about buying Prada handbags .
The culture shock took other forms .
Once , Scott tried to join a student - run program teaching children in Africa for a summer , but it cost $ 3,000 .
A classmate advised him to persuade his parents to pay for it .
" I had to explain that I had to pay for stuff on my own and that I actually have to work , " he recalled saying .
Bianca Argueza , who lives next door to Scott in the dorms , understands .
Her father died when she was 9 and her mother struggled to support six children .
She has at times felt isolated at Stanford .
" When I tell someone that I have trouble paying for a dorm trip that costs $ 5 , they say , ' Well , it 's only five dollars .
It 's not that much . ' ... I do n't think people really understand just how little a family who lives on $ 19,000 can afford . "
Stanford and other elite universities in the last couple of years have launched highly publicized financial aid initiatives as their endowments have ballooned , with Stanford 's now at $ 17.1 billion .
Last month , Stanford drastically reduced its $ 47,200 annual price tag , which includes tuition plus room and board , for middle - class students whose families make $ 100,000 or less .
University officials have said they want more economic diversity .
And yet one measure of that - Pell Grant numbers - has remained steady at Stanford .
Admissions officers say the problem is that low - income students do n't understand how little the university charges them , so they do n't apply .
Scott , for instance , has had to pay roughly $ 2,500 a year , which he did by working and taking out a small loan .
The university covered the remaining $ 44,700 .
If Stanford wants more low - income kids , some education observers counter , it needs to change its admissions criteria and consider the grades , test scores and experiences of poor students differently , taking into account their lack of resources .
Dean of Admissions Rick
Shaw says the university considers each applicant in context and does n't compare the accomplishments of a student at a poor school to one educated at prep school .
Still , he said , " It 's a very , very competitive process .
" Certainly there are going to be kids who have advantages on the basis of where they go to school or their family . "
Dealing with the disconnect
Sociology drew Scott 's interest , in part as a way of understanding the disconnect he felt as a low - income student at Stanford .
Despite his own admission to Stanford , he believes most students with his background do n't have a chance of going to an elite university .
That 's one reason he took a job last year at College Track in East Palo Alto , an after - school program aimed at getting low - income students into college .
There 's tutoring , a music studio , a computer room and intensive guidance on the college application process .
At the same time , he organized his own summer service - abroad program using the College Track model with a $ 7,000 grant from the Haas Center for Public Service at Stanford .
He returned to his native Guyana and taught kids at a children 's shelter to use computers , type and read .
He 's grateful to the university - yet after four years , he still feels as if he's in a dream from which he might wake up .
Next fall , he plans to pursue sociology and will enter the Ph.D. program at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana .
He chose that school in part because it has an airfield nearby .
Becoming a pilot has been a long - held goal , one he mentioned on his Stanford application .
He envisions teaching sociology and pilot training at a small college .
His friend Koshy , who does n't quite get the pilot / sociologist thing , theorizes Scott is creating multiple safety nets because he knows what it 's like to have so little .
Scott says he picked Notre Dame , with its Midwestern location , for another reason :
He hopes he wo n't feel as out of place as he does at Stanford , that the socio- economic differences wo n't be as stark .
A faltering economy has n't slowed American CEOs ’ pursuit of wealth
By David Walsh
16 April 2008
The incomes of American chief executives surged ahead in 2007 and into early 2008 , despite an economy that was beginning to unravel and various half - hearted ( or less ) efforts to bring the process under control .
Numerous reports point to this reality .
The Wall Street Journal / Hay Group 2007 CEO Compensation Survey is one of the most recent .
A week earlier , on April 6 , the New York Times carried a lengthy article that cited the findings of the compensation research firm Equilar .
USA Today ran a piece April 9 entitled , “ Stocks may fall , but execs ’ pay does n’t . ”
On April 15 CNNMoney.com posted a column , by an editor from Fortune magazine , headlined , “ Rewarding Failure , ” with this underline : “ CEO pay has risen faster than corporate profits , but there are major obstacles to changing the system . ”
The general picture is this .
American CEOs , addicted to multimillion - dollar incomes and lifestyles that would have made many European royal families in an earlier age blush with shame , continue to rake in fabulous amounts of money , apparently oblivious to the fate of their firms .
It goes without saying that the top executives proceed without regard to the conditions of their employees , or former employees , much less society as a whole .
For obvious political reasons , the Wall Street Journal is somewhat defensive about the situation .
The lead article in its special section devoted to the issue April 14 suggests that corporate boards are flexing their “ pay muscles , ” that directors “ are increasingly exercising more clout in setting CEO compensation .
And in some cases , the boss is actually feeling a little pain . ”
Pain is relative .
The article cites the case of Charming Shoppes Inc. , which recently agreed to a new contract with its CEO , Dorrit Bern .
Ms. Bern was obliged to give up $ 154,760 in annual perquisites , including a Philadelphia apartment and weekend flights to Chicago ; she also lost the $ 1 million signing bonus she had received with previous contracts .
Apparently , Ms. Bern was not pleased .
Nonetheless , with annual total compensation of more than $ 5 million , she will probably squeeze by .
The Journal proceeds along these general lines , arguing that efforts are being made to slow down the increases in executive pay , while providing figures that hardly bolster their argument .
On the same page as the piece depicting Ms. Bern ’s situation , the newspaper carried another article : “ Persistent Pay Gains , ” which began : “ Chief executives hit the pay jackpot last year — despite signs of a looming economic slowdown . ”
It notes that the median salary and bonus for US CEOs rose 4.7 percent to $ 2,939,000 , according to the Hay Group study of 200 major American firms with annual revenue over $ 5 billion .
Total direct compensation , including stock options and other long - term incentives , rose to a median of $ 8,848,000 .
The Journal cites the earnings of 2007 ’s “ biggest winners . ” John A . Thain , who only took over at Merrill Lynch on December 1 , took in compensation of $ 78.5 million , from restricted shares he received plus stock options .
Lloyd Blankfein of investment bank Goldman Sachs made some $ 68.5 million last year .
Occidental Petroleum ’s Ray Irani , a perennial on the annual list of bloated salaries , received about $ 61 million .
Kenneth Chenault of American Express got $ 46.2 million , due to options and annual incentive compensation .
Rounding off the list of the top five was Richard Fuld of embattled Lehman Brothers , who was paid $ 40 million , mostly in stock .
Another 22 firms paid their CEOs in excess of $ 20 million in total compensation in 2007 , including United Technologies , Disney , Honeywell , AT&T , Coca - Cola , Bank of New York Mellon , Hewlett Packard , IBM , Johnson & Johnson , Boeing , MetLife , Lockheed Martin , Verizon and Kraft .
Special mention should be made of the case of Jeffery Mezger of KB Home , who received a bonus of $ 6,000,000 and total compensation of more than $ 22,000,000 , despite the real estate collapse and his own firm ’s difficulties .
KB
Home lost $ 929 million on revenue of $ 6.4 billion in 2007 and the company ’s share price had lost two - thirds of its value by November .
The Times noted in its April 6 article that Robert Toll of luxury builders Toll Brothers received no bonus in 2007 , “ but the company has rewritten the compensation plan so that he will probably get one this year even if home building does not recover . ”
Washington Mutual officials also thoughtfully decided to change the rules in the face of difficulties that might have cost its top executives some income .
In February the bank ’s board changed the design of the company ’s bonus plan by “ de- emphasizing the importance of foreclosure - related write - downs .
... [ T ]he new plan allows the board to pay bonuses even when non-performing mortgages overwhelm the bank ’s other businesses . ”
Washington Mutual announced April 15 that it had suffered a $ 1.14 billion loss in the first quarter .
It plans to cut 3,000 jobs , slash its dividend by 93 percent and raise $ 7 billion from a group of investors to keep itself afloat .
Wachovia bank announced Monday that it had suffered a first - quarter loss of nearly $ 400 million , a fourfold increase in troubled loans ( to $ 8.4 billion worth ) and a 41 percent cut in its dividend .
It also laid off 500 employees in the first quarter .
Critics allege that Wachovia executives have raised dividend payments recklessly and made poor acquisitions , paying premium prices for mediocre companies for the past decade .
The bank ’s CEO , G. Kennedy Thompson , was paid $ 15.8 million in total compensation in 2007 , a slight decrease compared with 2006 .
Alcoa , the world ’s third - largest aluminum company , reported April 7 that its first - quarter profits had fallen 54 percent over last year because of surging energy costs , a weaker US dollar and lower metals prices .
The company ’s CEO , Alain J. P. Belda , received $ 13.5 million in compensation last year .
UPS , the delivery giant , saw earnings fall as well in the first quarter , and its share price dropped accordingly .
Matthew Eskew , its chief executive , pulled in a mere $ 5.3 million in 2007 .
General Electric ’s Jeffery Immelt made a respectable $ 13.3 million last year ; his company reported a decline of almost 6 percent in first - quarter earnings , prompting serious concerns on Wall Street .
The ERI Economic Research Institute and Career Journal reported February 15 that while the revenues of 45 randomly selected public companies had increased by only 2.8 percent over the course of 12 months , executive compensation had jumped by 20.5 percent .
They estimated that the average top executive received total compensation of $ 18.8 million as of February 2008 , up from $ 15.6 million a year earlier .
The spectacle of executives receiving enormous salaries and other forms of pay even as their own firms and the economy as a whole falter creates a certain nervousness in some media and political circles .
This is the ugly face of capitalism peering out at the population .
The official response takes various forms .
Presidential hopefuls from both major parties have criticized the trend in CEO pay .
Barack Obama , Democratic senator from Illinois , pointed out to an audience in Indiana April 11 that “ Some CEOs made more in one day than their workers make in one year . ”
The Wall Street Journal noted earlier this month , a little bitterly , that Republican John McCain had made a “ populist turn , ” after the Arizona senator termed compensation of failed investment bank Bear Stearns and floundering mortgage lender Countrywide executives “ outrageous ” and “ unconscionable . ”
This is political posturing , which will have no more impact than the handwringing of certain editorialists in the business and liberal press .
And everybody more or less admits it .
The op - ed piece from Fortune posted on CNNMoney.com suggests that “ The mammoth pay and disastrous performance of Countrywide Financial ’s Angelo Mozilo , Citigroup ’s Chuck Prince , and Merrill Lynch ’s Stan O’Neal should be enough to make the public furious .
“ Each CEO departed with $ 100 - million - plus compensation after misadventures with subprime mortgages .
Now add the economic slowdown to the mix ; ordinary Americans are worried about making ends meet while failed pooh - bahs rake it in . ”
Considering all the ingredients , the article goes on to ask , with a presidential election imminent , “ how could change not be imminent ? ”
Bluntly replying to its own question , the column informs the reader : “ The answer is that whatever remedies reformers enact , corporate boards can always find a way to pay the boss whatever they like .
Over the past 25 years CEO pay has risen regardless of the economic or political climate .
It rises faster than corporate profits , economic growth , or average workforce compensation .
“ A recent study by the compensation consulting firm DolmatConnell & Partners found that CEO pay in the companies of the Dow Jones industrials increased at a blowout 15.1 % annual rate over the past decade . ”
The New York Times April 6 posed a similar question : “ Was n’t 2008 supposed to be the year of shareholder victory on the executive compensation front ?
“ After all , tighter disclosure rules kicked in last year , and — the theory went — once companies had to shine a spotlight on their compensation practices , they were bound to make them better .
Politicians , never loath to acknowledge the national mood — particularly in an election year — held several hearings about excessive pay .
But signs of sweeping change remain few . ”
Or change of any significant kind .
‘ Shareholder activism , ’ the occasional grandstanding by the politicians and media complaints have not slowed corporate compensation or reduced the chasm of social inequality .
On the contrary , the most recent figures indicate that the super - rich are accumulating wealth faster than ever .
Economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California , Berkeley , and Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics , recently reported their findings for the year 2006 .
They discovered that average incomes of the highest - earning 1 percent grew 11 percent year - over - year between 2002 and 2006 , whereas the bottom 99 percent saw their incomes grow on average just 0.9 percent annually .
The Institute for Policy Studies noted last autumn that the average American CEO from a Fortune 500 company earned 364 times an average worker ’s pay .
The IPS further commented : “ Last year , the top 20 earners in the most lucrative corner of America ’s business sector , the private equity and hedge fund world , pocketed 680 times more in rewards for their labors than the nation ’s 20 highest - paid leaders of nonprofit institutions pocketed for theirs — and 3,315 times more than the top 20 officials of the federal executive branch , an august group that includes the President of the United States . ”
Consider the case of billionaire Larry Ellison of software giant Oracle , renowned for his conspicuous consumption .
A University of Chicago economist has calculated that Ellison cannot spend enough on personal consumption to prevent his fortune from growing .
The economist , Austan Goolsbee , estimates that the Oracle chief would have to spend over “ $ 183,000 an hour on things that ca n’t be resold , like parties or meals , just to avoid increasing his wealth . ”
None of this is going unnoticed by the population .
A recent Pew Research Group poll found that fewer Americans now than at any time in the past half century believe they ’re moving forward in life and that working or middle class Americans , who have endured relative economic decline ( but progress in absolute terms ) for decades , have made no economic progress of any kind since 1999 .
Every serious attempt to discourage the ruling elite from plundering the national economy will fail .
A certain social physiognomy has been created by the decades of parasitism , swindling and accumulation of vast piles of wealth .
These people do not intend to give a penny back , or restrain themselves in any fashion .
Many historians of the French Revolution refer to ‘ the resistance of the privileged classes , ’ their short - sighted determination to thwart social and fiscal reform at all costs , as a political factor of some significance in the eventual eruption of the epoch - making events of 1789 .
Things could turns nasty in Zimbabwe over the next few days .
Troops have been mobilised on to the streets of Harare and other population centres .
It is the surest sign that President Robert Mugabe knows that he is heading for a massive drubbing in tomorrow 's elections .
But though he will almost certainly lose the vote , he knows he will win the election .
Three million surplus ballot papers have been printed in preparation for the ballot - stuffing frauds with which Mr Mugabe has cheated the Zimbabwe electorate in the past .
All the signs from opinion polls , both public and private , are that the leader of the MDC opposition , Morgan Tsvangirai , is in the lead with between 30 and 40 per cent .
Second , with about 20 per cent , comes Simba Makoni , who quit as Mr Mugabe 's finance minister in 2002 , and who many expected to present a greater threat to his former boss than Mr Tsvangirai who is generally believed to have won the last election , before the fiddling began .
Mr Mugabe is said to have only about 10 per cent of voters committed to him – hardly a surprise since he has presided over economic chaos with inflation at 100,000 per cent , unemployment at 80 per cent and life expectancy that has plummeted to among the lowest in the world .
Zimbabwe , once southern Africa 's breadbasket , is now ranked 151st out of 175 countries in the UN poverty index .
Even basic commodities such as bread and cooking oil are now hard to come by .
More Zimbabweans have died from the combined effects of malnutrition , crumbling health care and Aids than have perished in Darfur .
It ca n't even be said Mr Mugabe has turned his nation into a banana republic since the banana has become a luxury commodity costing billions of Zimbabwean dollars .

What happens next depends in part on how blatant is the ballot - rigging .
Mr Mugabe needs 51 per cent of the vote to win , a figure he might struggle to achieve even by ballot - stuffing , given the collapse of Zimbabwe 's infrastructure .
He might have to resort to arranging for ballot boxes from opposition strongholds to go missing , as happened in Kenya .
If the opposition reacts with mass demonstrations on the streets , the Mugabe regime could react with a security clampdown , arrests , beatings and torture , as in the past .
The international community needs a co-ordinated reaction to a rigged vote .
Members of the African Union must take the lead in issuing , along with the European Union and United States , a joint statement withholding recognition of the results .
They then need to crank up the kind of concerted intervention , fronted by a high - level African Union mediation mission , as happened in Kenya .
Its aim must be to assist the negotiation of a power - sharing agreement to set up a transitional government in advance of new elections .
Rich nations must outline a package of economic and political assistance which would be made available to any government of national unity from which Mr Mugabe is excluded .
Keeping this together will be difficult .
It was tricky in Kenya , taking many weeks for Kofi Annan to negotiate , and it will be even trickier in Zimbabwe .
But there are reasons for optimism .
South Africa may well take a harder line ; last year 's long mediation attempt by Thabo Mbeki failed , and the new chairman of the ANC , Jacob Zuma , has been more critical of Mr Mugabe than Mr Mbeki was in the past ; members of his trade union power base picket the Zimbabwean embassy in Pretoria every day .
If such tactics fail , then the only option will be to intensify targeted sanctions against Mr Mugabe and those of his cronies blocking a political settlement .
Firefighters slide down the slippery pole to a waiting engine .
( 1948 )
Hulton - Deutsch Collection / Corbis __1878 : __A Chicago firefighter hears the alarm ringing and slides down a pole that just happened to be nearby .
It 's the birth of the firehouse sliding pole .
It 's not easy to get a whole lot of people down a flight of stairs fast , so some firehouses had added sliding chutes , like those you see in children 's playgrounds .
Firefighters at Engine Company 21 were unloading hay for the horses that pulled their fire engines .
When the bell rang , firefighter George Reid was up in the hayloft on the third floor .
The long binding pole that was used to secure the hay to the wagon had been stashed vertically up the loading area to the hayloft .
Rather than run all the way down two flights of stairs , Reid decided to slide down the pole .
Swift thinking , George .
His captain , David Kenyon , liked the idea and arranged with the chief to cut a hole in the second floor and install a pole to get his firefighters quickly from their living quarters to the fire engines .
The crew at Engine 21 rounded off a beam of Georgia pine to a 3 - inch diameter , sanded it and varnished it .
Then they waxed it with paraffin .
The thing worked .
Engine 21 , which was staffed entirely by black firefighters , soon got a reputation for being the first responder among first responders .
The fire chief , who'd threatened to make Kenyon pay for repairing the hole in the floor if the idea was a bust , wound up ordering poles installed for every firehouse in Chicago .
Boston improved the idea in 1880 .
Fire pole 2.0 was made of shiny , slippery brass .
Nowadays , the poles are sometimes considered safety hazards , and new firehouses are often built without them .
Single - story firehouses are preferred .

Feb. 12 , 1878 : A Face - Saving Invention From Harvard
Time to Close Gaps in Emergency Communications
An admirer once wrote to Rudyard Kipling : “ I see you get a dollar a word for your writing .
I enclose a check for one dollar .
Please send me a sample . ”
Kipling responded : “ Thanks . ”
For the sake of argument we will assume that you are going to be putting your personal ad on craigslist or somewhere else online , would you really want someone who was reading the newspaper personal ads in this day and age ?
When reading these steps you may note that some are mutually exclusive , normally I would consider that problematic , but not today .
The easiest way to scare men off with your ad is simply not to include a photo .
The majority of men are going to pass this by every single time , particularly the men who have standards in a woman beyond having a pulse .
You know who responds to ads without pictures ?
I 'll tell you who , men who are so terribly desperate that they reply to every single advertisement posted in hopes of getting a response .
Instead of posting a picture of yourself post a picture of a flower or a cartoon character or a kitten .
This not only tells prospective men that you are unattractive and insecure it also lets them know that you are flaky and play mind games .
If you do actually post a picture of yourself then make sure it is low resolution and cropped in such a way that your figure is completely hidden .
That way you can scare away the men that assume that you are heavier and uglier than you actually are , while simultaneously setting someone else up for disappointment or yourself up for an embarrassing situation .
It is better just to let them know what you are offering up front , some guys will deal and some wo n't .
If all you have are nice high resolution photos then be sure to pick one that also includes your best friend ( is n't she pretty ) .
Statistically speaking your best friend is probably better looking than you are , and if she is n't then she just detracts from your ad and thus helps scare men off either way .
You can scare off a few extra men by not indicating which one is you .
I am going to go against some of the traditional wisdom here that would say that you should be extremely detailed about yourself in order to get the best responses .
In fact you should only be overly detailed if you want to scare away men , once you get past a basic level of information you are simply providing a potential mate with more criteria that they can filter you out using .
Short or long you should however use as many text message abbreviations in your description as possible in order to scare away the maximum amount of men .
Your love for country music or rap might not end up being more than a tiny quirk in your future relationship with that certain someone , but mentioning it in your ad could easily scare them away .
If you really want to make the men run consider mentioning how you basically just listen to Billy Ray Cyrus and Bone Thugs in Harmony all day long at maximum volume .
If you have children then be sure to mention how " they are your whole world " and how " nothing comes before them " , but how they " have a daddy " and you " are n't looking for a new daddy for them " .
If you can only somehow mention that you do n't get child support for them then you can probably manage to scare off everyone in one single section .
Now we are getting into a real gold mine here , nothing beside that picture is going to scare away more men than the section where you list your own personal laundry list of requirements .
Every single thing you put in this section will scare away men , most women list enough requirements that it is mathematically improbable that anymore meeting their requirements would ever even read the advertisement , you should do that , and more .
Be sure and ask for a tall man , the bigger the height requirement the better , best to list something at 6 ' 2 " or above , since that easily scares off 95 percent of the men reading your ad , since less than five percent of men are that tall .
You should certainly require an athletic build as well , to scare off any fat or underweight men reading your advertisement .
In general you just can't go into enough detail in what you want from a man 's looks or body .
The more you require , the more men you will scare off .
If you really want to scare off some men then be sure to mention something about penis size , that way you wo n't have to deal with any of those short dick men answering your ad , or any of the average men either , or anyone who does n't have an absolute whopper .
While rounding out this section you should also specify a hair color , eye color and race as well , for maximum results the racial choice should be different than your own .
Finally , you can also scare off lots of men by forgetting to include your age , location or race ( assuming you left out a picture here , since you are trying to scare them off ) .
If you would actually like to get some good responses to your advertisement then there are a few things to look at .
First and foremost you should include a picture , and it should be the best recent picture you can come up with and it should be of you and only you and it should not be carefully cropped in order to hide your figure .
Believe me , would you rather have guys filter you based on your figure before you ever even know they exist , or would you rather have them do it in person while you are standing right there ?
Plus there is the minor little detail that many men will assume something far worse from that cropped shot than whatever your reality is .
I am going to go against some other opinions and simply state that I do n't really care what sort of activities a woman might claim to be interested in on her personal ad .
She is probably lying anyway , and most of life does n't consist of that anyway .
Say something interesting , minor and true .
Do n't tell me that you like sports and restaurants and walking on the beach .
it just all ends up sounding exactly the same as every other ad .
Tell me " Hi , I am Resa and I love muffins and I am looking for a boy who also likes muffins . "
If you have a kid you can even do this variation " Hi , I am Gabby and I like Muffins , my daughter Cindy likes muffins too .
We want to meet a boy who likes muffins . "
Just tell me something fun or interesting , I do n't even really care what it is .
As far as children go they are a lot less scary when mentioned in a fun way than in an intense way .
As far as what you want out of a man , honestly the less you say here the better , if you have a fun ad and a good picture than you should have many people to pick from , so there is n't any good reason to write a huge list of requirements .
Honestly we all know that you are going to filter them by photos and age first anyway !

NORWAY is the most generous rich country , giving nearly 1 % of its national income in foreign aid in 2007 .
Total net aid from the 22 countries of the OECD development assistance committee fell by over 8 % to $ 103.7 billion as debt - relief payments tapered off .
Each country gave an average of 0.45 % of GDP , some way off the UN target of 0.7 % .
Only five countries achieved this .
America , the biggest total donor , is miserly compared with most other countries .

Israeli soldiers post pictures of themselves on Facebook
Israel has sentenced a soldier to 19 days in jail for uploading a photograph taken on his military base to the social networking website , Facebook .
The Israeli military declined to comment on the nature of the image , but said the soldier was serving with an elite intelligence unit .
Local media say it is the first such conviction for an Israeli soldier .
The case follows widespread reports about the potential security risk of soldiers posting photos on the web .
The Israel Air Force has recently instructed all servicemen under their command who are serving in sensitive units to remove any photos they may have uploaded to Facebook , the Haaretz newspaper reports .
These rules do not apply to member of the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) .
A spokesman told Haaretz the IDF would take measures to educate soldiers about the dangers inherent in the " careless civilian use of the internet " .
Monitoring
The defence ministry launched an inquiry earlier this year to check the potential security risk in the dozens of social networking groups dedicated to life in the Israeli military .
The review has found that some troops had posted detailed pictures of air bases , operations rooms and submarines .
The BBC's Martin Asser says militants in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories are believed to monitor Israeli web forums and communities , including Facebook and the photo sharing site Flickr , to get information .
He says some personnel are authorised to post pictures , but only after vetting by military censors .
The defence ministry told the BBC military tribunals have investigated and disciplined about 100 soldiers who broke the rules and unwittingly helped the enemy this year .
Our correspondent says the worst offenders were punished with a month in jail , while others were warned they would face similar punishment if they re-offended .

European Union trade chief Peter Mandelson expressed support for Russia to join the World Trade Organisation .
Peter Mandelson , European Union trade chief , said , " Frankly , we want to see Russia in the WTO , it 's the largest economy of its size and importance outside of the organisation , there are benefits , substantial benefits , both for Russia and its trading partners .
Russia has to take important steps to integrate into the global economy and one of the best ways it can do that is by growing and integration and convergence between its economy and that of the European Union . "

The footages shows Wal - Mart executives in unguarded moments
Wal - Mart , the world 's largest retailer , faces embarrassment and potential lawsuits after its corporate video archive was made public .
Flagler Productions , which worked for Wal - Mart for almost 30 years , has made its footage available to lawyers , unions and media organisations .
The archive includes clips of male store managers parading in drag .
Wal - Mart dropped Flagler in 2006 and only offered the firm $ 500,000 for the video library .
Flagler had asked for $ 150 m before reducing its price to $ 145 m , according to a letter on Wal - Mart 's website .
The footage captures Wal - Mart executives and employees in closed meetings and unguarded moments .
A lawyer stumbled on the archive when representing a 12 - year - old boy who suffered extensive burns after a gas canister bought at Wal - Mart exploded .
She found footage of employees joking and playing skits about exploding gas cans , reports said .
Flagler says that since Wal - Mart never signed a contract for its services , the rights to the tapes still belong to the production company .
Reports say Flagler , based in Kansas City , is now charging $ 250 an hour for video research .
Wal - Mart has not commented on the ownership of the archive .
CAIRO , Egypt–Omar Osama bin Laden bears a striking resemblance to his notorious father – except for the dreadlocks that dangle halfway down his back .
Then there 's the black leather biker jacket .
The 26 - year - old does not renounce his father , Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden , but in an interview he said there is a better way to defend Islam than militancy : Omar wants to be an " ambassador for peace " between Muslims and the West .
Omar – one of bin Laden 's 19 children – raised a tabloid storm last year when he married a 52 - year - old British woman , Jane Felix - Browne , who took the name Zaina Alsabah .
Now the couple say they want to be advocates , planning a 5,000 - kilometre horse race across North Africa to draw attention to the cause of peace .
" It 's about changing the ideas of the Western mind .
A lot of people think Arabs – especially the bin Ladens , especially the sons of Osama – are all terrorists .
This is not the truth , " Omar said last week at a café in a Cairo shopping mall .
Of course , many may have a hard time getting their mind around the idea of " bin Laden : peacenik . "
" Omar thinks he can be a negotiator , " said Alsabah , who is trying to bring her husband to Britain .
" He 's one of the only people who can do this in the world . "
Omar lived with the Al Qaeda leader in Sudan , then moved with him to Afghanistan in 1996 .
There , Omar says he trained at an Al Qaeda camp but in 2000 he decided there must be another way and he left his father , returning to his homeland of Saudi Arabia .
" I do n't want to be in that situation to just fight , " he said .
" I like to find another way and this other way may be like we do now , talking , " he said in English .
He suggested his father , the mastermind behind the Sept. 11 , 2001 terror attacks on New York and Washington , did not oppose his leaving .
Alsabah interjected that Omar was courageous in breaking away , but neither elaborated .
Although there is no way to confirm the details he describes of his childhood and upbringing , the strong family resemblance and Omar 's knowledge of Osama 's family life have convinced many of his lineage .
" Omar bin Laden is the son of Osama bin Laden and his first wife , Najwa , " a U.S. intelligence official said yesterday , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media .
Omar and his wife insist they have not been bothered by Egyptian officials , who said yesterday that the terror leader 's son did not pose a threat .
Omar said he has n't seen or been in contact with his father since leaving Afghanistan .
" He does n't have email , " Omar said .
" He does n't take a telephone ... if he had something like this , they will find him through satellites . "
Omar does n't criticize his father and says Osama bin Laden , who is believed to be hiding in the Pakistan - Afghan border region , is just trying to defend the Islamic world .

" My father thinks he will be good for defending the Arab people and stop anyone from hurting the Arab or Muslim people any place in the world , " he said , noting the West did n't have a problem with his father when he was fighting the Russians in Afghanistan in the 1980s .
Omar and his wife are now planning a horse race for peace across North Africa , which they hope to start in March .
They envision it as an equine version of the Paris - Dakar car rally .
That rally was cancelled this year due to fears over terrorist threats made by Al Qaeda - affiliated groups .
Omar , however , said he is n't worried .
" I heard the rally was stopped because of Al Qaeda , " he said .
" I do n't think they are going to stop me . "

The suburbs of the US are no longer the same as those immortalised in 1950s movies , with white families living in big houses and the father driving off to work in his Buick , past manicured lawns .
MS - 13 gang members are often heavily tattooed
These days , it is more likely that English will not even be the first language you hear on the streets .
In Langley Park , Maryland , the kiosks sell Spanish - language newspapers ; the supermarket shelves are stocked with tortillas and assorted black beans .
Mexican music plays in the background while the tannoy blares out announcements in Spanish .
Outside , groups of men hang out on the street corners and their Spanish is accented - Nicaraguan , Honduran and , most often , Salvadoran .
They wait , hoping to be picked up for a day 's labouring in the houses and gardens of Washington DC 's middle class .
But among the hard - working families lurks a darker shadow .
Violent crime Vicious street gangs , committed to violence , have spread throughout the Americas and are now a significant threat in the US .
We visited Maria Hernandez in her apartment in Langley Park .
She welcomed us through her battered front door , which had been smashed by police in a dawn raid .
The groups spread to Central American states after being born in the US
They were looking for evidence connecting her son , Marvin , to an assault , where a man suffered brain damage after being hit on the head with a baseball bat .
Maria told us that Marvin had joined a gang after being picked on at school .
The police search warrant said Marvin was a member of MS - 13 .
MS - 13 - or Mara Salvatrucha - is the biggest and fastest - growing of the Latin American street gangs .
In Maryland alone , MS - 13 members are accused of being responsible for a long series of violent crimes including murder .
Favoured tactics include decapitation by machete .
MS - 13 started life as a group of young immigrants on the streets of California in the 1980s .
After nearly a million Salvadorans fled their civil war for the US , many of them settled in Los Angeles where gang violence was rife .
In the 1990s , the " maras " spread to Central America after many of their leaders were deported from the United States .
Kill and control
Those countries , struggling to get back on their feet after years of devastating civil conflict , were a perfect setting in which gangs could proliferate .
There 's evidence that the model of the gang is rape , kill , control .
They 're really about gaining control over other immigrants from their community
Rod J Rosenstein , US attorney for Maryland Today , some estimates put up to 60,000 maras active in El Salvador , Honduras , Guatemala , Mexico and - according to the FBI - in more than 40 US states .
Rod J Rosenstein is Maryland 's US Attorney .
His office is currently prosecuting a series of cases against MS - 13 .
He told us the gang 's motives are more about mayhem than money .
" There 's evidence that the model of the gang is rape , kill , control , " he said .
" They 're really about gaining control over other immigrants from their community , intimidating people and asserting some degree of threat which enables them to control their neighbourhoods . "
Rosenstein 's prosecutors have moved on from charging individual gang members with discrete crimes .
Instead , they are now targeting MS - 13 with federal racketeering laws - the same legislation used against the Mafia and other organised crime .
For this tactic to be successful , they must prove that MS - 13 is indeed an organised network .
We attended court in Greenbelt , Maryland .
The prosecutors spent much of their time talking about gang meetings ; about the clothes - blue and white for MS - 13 - and the tattoos .
And , most damningly , an alleged firm link between gang leaders in El Salvador and their proteges in the US .
Murder by mobile
In June 2007 , the then US Attorney - General , Alberto Gonzales held a press conference to announce charges against MS - 13 leaders in El Salvador .
Police seem unable to crack the strength of the gangs
The indictment alleged that Saul Antonios Turcos Angel communicated with members of the " Teclas Locos Salvatruchos " clique in Maryland via mobile phone and ordered them to commit two murders .
Later that day gang members in Maryland killed two people and wounded a juvenile .
The links between the countries are clear .
The court in Greenbelt was shown a home video made by the gang in a Salvadoran prison .
In it , maras send greetings to their " homies " in Maryland and other parts of the US .
They talk of killing and controlling others and display their full - body tattoos in a show of allegiance to MS - 13 .
Mindful of these trans-national links , the FBI last year made the decision to open an office in El Salvador .
Aaron Escorza heads the FBI 's National Gang Task Force .
He told us the gangs move freely around the region .
" They do n't recognise borders .
They commit crimes in El Salvador , flee El Salvador to come to the US and you have MS -ers who are committing crimes in the US and fleeing down to El Salvador to evade arrest . "
Hard fist
But once in El Salvador , the challenge to authorities is immense .
Entire swathes of the capital are virtually under the control of MS - 13 and its rival , Mara 18 .
Local police patrol warily , tending when possible to avoid those parts of the city .
The region 's homicide rates are among the highest in the world - 58 per 100,000 of population in El Salvador .
The past decade has seen politicians rise to power on the back of promises to declare war against the gangs .
The " Mano Dura " - or Hard Fist - policy introduced by Honduras at the start of the decade was closely followed by " Super Mano Dura " in El Salvador .
The legislation meant police could round up gang members at will , throwing young men in prison for any suspicious behaviour , including associating with likely gang members or sporting tattoos .
The result was thousands of gang members in prison .
But courts were not able to process such numbers and many lingered in prison without charge .
The prisons themselves have become strongholds of the gangs , many of them controlled by the Maras themselves , the authorities guard only from the outside .
The " Mano Dura " policies are now largely discredited .
On patrol in San Salvador , the police told us the laws had been counter - productive , driving the gangs underground and leading to more clever tactics from the likes of MS - 13 .
They pointed out men who could be Maras , but who now wear long t- shirts to cover their tattoos .
The graffiti that used to be ubiquitous , identifying each gang 's territory , is no longer so obvious .
Mano Dura made the prisons into virtual headquarters for the gangs .
And the US deportation policy added to the problem , with the result that the gangs have become ever more organised and powerful .
Revolving door Jose Miguel Cruz , of the University of Central America , who has studied the Maras for over a decade , says these approaches have led to a " revolving door " effect .
" MS - 13 has spread across the US and is a major security problem in Central America .
We have n't tried any more preventative measures . "
He draws a comparison with Nicaragua .
" They also are poor , they also have weak institutions . "
If we can lock them away we will but if we can't , they should be deported
Julie Myers , US assistant secretary of state for homeland security But Nicaragua has so far managed to avoid any large - scale gang problem .
Why ?
" The police concentrate on more preventative measures , " says Mr Cruz .
Former gang member Edgar Ramirez backed this up .
When he arrived back from the US , deported after a three - year prison sentence , he said there were no opportunities , no way back into normal society .
" I had tattoos so everyone treated me like a criminal , " he tells us .
" And if you speak English , they know you 're a deportee . "
For now , US policy remains focused on law - enforcement .
The US Assistant Secretary of State for Homeland Security , Julie Myers , says it must remain the priority .
" If we can lock them away we will , but if we can't , they should be deported , " she told us .
" We have to think about stopping young people going into gangs ; but I believe the American public is safer when we remove these individuals from the streets of our communities and deport them wherever possible .
"
In the 1980s , when Ronald Reagan was fighting a proxy war against the Soviet Union in Central America , he promised to rebuild a new , better , El Salvador .
But after spending so much on the war , there was little appetite in Washington for the reconstruction project .
Two decades later , the US is reaping the consequences .
And in Central America , a region still struggling with poverty and crime , MS - 13 has thrived .
Law enforcement alone does not seem to be enough to contain it .
The Maras : the Most Dangerous Gang in America for the Assignment programme was broadcast by the World Service .

If honeybees die off , it will endanger ice cream , warns Häagen - Dazs :
The cows whose milk makes ice cream eat alfalfa that depends on bees .
Forty percent of Häagen - Dazs ’s flavors contain other ingredients , from almonds to strawberries , that rely completely on honeybee pollination .
The continuing and mysterious disappearance of the bees — aside from threatening one - third of the United States ’ food supply and at least $ 15 billion worth of agricultural productivity — could spell dessert disaster .
Pollinating California ’s almond crop alone already requires more than half the current population of American honeybees .
This month ice - cream makers go on the offensive .
Häagen - Dazs is launching two new honey - themed flavors and labeling bee - dependent pints to help save the honeybee .
A portion of the proceeds , up to $ 250,000 , will go to geneticists , entomologists , and educators at the University of California at Davis and Pennsylvania State University who will research the causes of the bees ’ decline , create stronger bees in the laboratory , and teach the public how to make their surroundings more bee friendly .
The two new flavors — Vanilla Honey Bee ice cream and Vanilla Honey & Granola frozen yogurt — are both delicious .
The honey flavor is sharp without overwhelming the vanilla , and samples left in DISCOVER ’s freezer vanished in record time .
So next time you ’re looking for a virtuous indulgence , think of the honeybees .

Citizens of the US in the 1970's were in shock at how the crime rate was increasing .
In part , this was a demographic shift as a wave of young males more likely to resort to crime bulged through the system .
But this chart showing the great release of mental patients onto the streets in the 1960's and early 1970 's points to another potential cause we seldom hear people discuss .
Here are US crime rate stats :
PARIS -- Jérôme Kerviel is accused of breaking into computer systems to make risky trades that cost Société Générale SA billions .
Now , the former trader has a new job -- in computer services .
As prosecutors investigate his role in the world 's biggest - ever trading scandal , Mr. Kerviel has started working at Lemaire Consultants & Associés , an information - technology consultancy specializing in IT network installation and security , according to his lawyer , Guillaume Selnet .
Mr ....
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The developer of the World Trade Center in New York is seeking $ 12.3 billion in damages from the airlines and other companies associated with the September 11 terrorist attacks , his spokesman said Thursday .
Firefighters survey the destroyed facade of the World Trade Center on September 13 , 2001 .
Larry Silverstein , president and CEO of Silverstein Properties , has recovered $ 4.6 billion in insurance payments , spokesman Bud Perrone said .
The additional money is meant to offset the remaining costs of what was lost on September 11 .
Perrone was not able to provide a full list of defendants , but the companies named in the suit include American Airlines , United Airlines , Continental Airlines and Boeing .
Also named : MassPort , which manages Logan International Airport in Boston , where the planes that hit the World Trade Center took off .
Most of the money sought in the lawsuit -- $ 8.4 billion -- would replace the property that was destroyed in the attacks , Perrone said .
The remaining $ 3.9 billion would pay for lost income and expenses associated with renting the new buildings .
The efforts to recover damages did not stand in the way of the families of September 11 victims pursuing wrongful - death suits , said Janno Lieber , president of World Trade Center Properties .
There was no immediate comment from the companies involved or the families of the victims .

NS Harsha is a gifted story teller who captures everyday life from India as seen through the lens of news and world events on his canvas through the medium of paints and color .
Miniature art form is not unknown in India .
In fact , it has been used through the ages to depict life from courts of kings to humble settings of huts or villages .
However , Harsha has picked up this technique to bring to the world his observations of Indian society which at times are whimsical and at times absurd , or even tragic or significant on the world scene .
Perhaps painting is just a medium to express the philosopher and the thinker in him .
Perhaps brush is Harsha ’s tool in an attempt to bring a social change , and awareness and curiosity that surrounds humanity .
Through paintings or community installations , Harsha connects and engages the viewer in his thoughts as if together they are trying to find a solution to improve human condition in India or in world at large .
He creates in each of his acrylic on canvas paintings intimate spaces that bring to mind the basic format of early cinema or theater halls usually found in small towns and villages .
The narratives in Harsha ’s satirical canvasses may unfold against painted backdrops as his figures – the Queen of England , school children , the quintessential Indian farmer figure , Hindu mythological characters , or sages and clowns – juxtaposed against them act out complex scenes before us .
Painting delicate banners into his paintings , Harsha cleverly plays with text and words .
Each of his works are witty , poetical , and at the same time a social response .
One of the works , Mass Marriage , which also won him UK ’s prestigious 40,000 pound Artes Mundi Prize last week , at first seems a gentle and amusing narrative on Indian marriage around the world .
But , on closer inspection , it also reveals loss , sadness and the complex nature of human relationships .
Rhodri Glyn Thomas , Wales ’ Minister for Heritage said “ I am delighted to congratulate N S Harsha on receiving this prestigious prize , it is a great achievement .
Artes Mundi is an important initiative that brings together artists from across the world to engage in cultural debate and its theme of humanity allows it to capture the public imagination .
The public response to the exhibition here in our National Museum , the artistic activity in communities across Wales and its work with schools and colleges is testament to that and it has become one of the highlights in Wales ’ cultural calendar . ”
Harsha , 39 , studied painting at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Baroda in 1995 .
Since then he has taken part in a variety of collaborative projects and exhibitions internationally including the Singapore Biennale 2006 , the 2nd Fukuoaka Asian Art Triennial 2002 and the Asia Pacific Triennial of contemporary Arts , Australia 1999 .
Harsha beat off competition from eight other finalists , including a duo , to win the prize .
“ I feel numb .
It ’s a great responsibility that ’s been handed to me .
Everyone believes in you and I have to take my work forward from here .
It gives you strength to keep on believing .
Though I have not thought how to spend the prize money , I do wish to share a part of it with the artist community , ” Harsha , who lives and works in Mysore , said .
Hours after arriving in Wales last month for the opening of the exhibition of the nominees ’ work , he painted a floor mural which was covered with scatter cushions to invite children to interact with his work ( also seen in image on top ) .
The figures in Harsha ’s delicate , sly and playful world are almost invariably focused on an event , animated by a mutual curiosity , pointing out something that is odd , incongruous or comically strange .
For the viewer the wit resides as much in the scale of the depictions as it does in the finely summarized telling detail of the vignette .
Louise Arbour , U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights , speaks during a news conference in Mexico City February 8 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Andrew Winning
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) -
The controversial interrogation technique known as waterboarding and used by the United States qualifies as torture , the U.N. human rights chief said on Friday .
“ I would have no problems with describing this practice as falling under the prohibition of torture , ” the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights , Louise Arbour , told a news conference in Mexico City .
Arbour made her comment in response to a question about whether U.S. officials could be tried for the use of waterboarding that referred to CIA director Michael Hayden telling Congress on Tuesday his agency had used waterboarding on three detainees captured after the September 11 attacks .
Violators of the U.N. Convention against Torture should be prosecuted under the principle of ‘ universal jurisdiction ’ which allows countries to try accused war criminals from other nations , Arbour said .
“ There are several precedents worldwide of states exercising their universal jurisdiction ... to enforce the torture convention and we can only hope that we will see more and more of these avenues of redress , ” Arbour said .
The U.S. Congress is considering banning the practice , in which prisoners are immobilized and water is poured into their breathing passages to simulate drowning .
Arbour referred to an arrest warrant issued in 1998 by a Spanish judge for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet , who died in 2006 , on charges of torture , murder and kidnapping in the years that followed his 1973 coup .
Latin American dictatorships in the 1970s and 1980s were known to use waterboarding on political prisoners .
Early 1800 ’s : The Black Rock was a slave boat crossing the Pacific .
The boat was transporting a large assortment of metallic minerals , which were highly reactive to other forces of magnetism .
Unexpectedly , the boat encounters the island of LOST .
Being that the island has unique magnetic properties , the magnetic materials on the boat “ react ” with the magnetic forces on the island , and the boat is literally hoisted onto the island .
The boat , having strong levels of magnetism , creates a hole in the invisible bubble that surrounds the island – this hole is at coordinate “ 325 ” , or the “ special location / coordinate ” that Daniel ’s team travels through to get to the island .
Once the Black Rock crashes , the leaders aboard the ship , including Alvar Hanso , begin studies on the magnetic aspects of the island .
Their descendents ultimately form the DHARMA initiative in the late 1900’s .
1960 ’s : The DHARMA initiative was created for the enhancement of the human race .
What initially began as a simple research initiative developed into a massive project that was designed to test fate .
At some point during DHARMA’S studies , someone managed to leverage the magnetic properties of the island to bend time and space – thus , a time machine was created .
This time machine is n’t a Delorian with a flux capacitor .
It ’s , in fact , much simpler .
Let ’s say that DHARMA created a time machine , and activated it in 1960 – then , after 1 year of the time machine running , someone decides to enter the machine in 1961 .
They can only go back in time , and they can only go back in time up to 1 year ( back to 1960 , when the time machine started “ running ” ) .
Furthermore , once you go back in time , you ’re STUCK in the past .
You can not go back to 1961 , because you now EXIST in the past .
In addition to your body going through the time machine , say you contracted a deadly disease in 1965 , but went back to 1960 , before you developed the disease – you would n’t have the disease when you stepped out of the time machine in a past time .
In the beginning stages of testing the time machine , DHARMA chose to run tests on animals ( namely , polar bears ) , as to avoid creating any time - related catastrophes or paradoxes .
The first initiative of testing the time machine was to see they could extend the life of an animal .
They sent a polar bear back in time a few years , and then changed its habitat to see if it could “ survive . ”
DHARMA used the same type of mechanism to work with polar bears that Daniel Faraday had discovered back in 1996 .
DHARMA saw that once polar bears had gone back in time , they could survive off the island , and even in remote extreme climates ( such as deserts ) – thus making them partially invincible .
Realizing the power of this time machine , the leaders of DHARMA opt to only keep limited knowledge of the time machine ’s existence .
Thus , many of the experiments on the island of LOST are just a façade to conceal the “ true ” research behind the DHARMA initiative .
Shortly after the experimentation with the polar bears , DHARMA starts sending people back in time .
Over a few years of researching the time machine , DHARMA becomes curious to see if this time machine can allow people to alter the course of history .
In order to see if people can “ change a future that ’s already written , ” DHARMA begins simple tasking their time travelers with doing things to alter the course of history .
Unfortunately , these time travelers were not able to do anything to permanently alter the future that was already laid out .
Now getting desperate to prove that there ’s ANY benefit to the new time machine , the leaders of DHARMA find a group of their own people to involuntarily become “ test subjects ” of their next experiment involving time travel .
This being : can sending people back in time permanently cure them of a deadly virus ?
Without proper warning , DHARMA releases a virus in an area of the island that infects many of the “ test subjects . ”
Then DHARMA claims that they can cure the disease with this special “ device , ” that device being the time machine .
This , however , is NOT obvious to the test subjects - they just want to get cured , and think the time machine is some type of complex vaccination .
As fate would predict , the test subjects go back in time and are cured of the virus , only to be later killed by the smoke monster , as the monster is the “ physical means ” in which the timeline course corrects itself .
DHARMA , seeing this smoke monster for the first time , is now officially fearful that this time machine will end up serving no purpose whatsoever .
The only thing DHARMA has accomplished is pissing a small portion of their work - force .
The surviving test subjects who were n’t originally infected by the virus become a faction of the DHARMA initiative , and are subsequently referred to as the Others / Hostiles – Richard and Jacob are among that group .
1970 - 1985 : Ben ’s mother is recruited by DHARMA to come to the island and work on this time machine .
After several years of testing the time machine , she too has given up on its abilities .
She has also met Richard , the leader of the Others , and he tells her about the horrible experimentation that DHARMA did to his people , resulting in the death of several of his friends .
Ben ’s mom quickly grows to hate DHARMA for the morals that they ’re willing to ignore in the name of science .
She deems it her destiny to bring down DHARMA for the pain that they ’ve brought upon the innocent .
But , instead , she decides to kill two birds with one stone : instead of just leaving the island and possibly angering DHARMA at her departure , she decides to use the time machine to go back in time to the point at which she came to the island .
Then , she leaves the island .
This way , it would appear to the outside world that she never even left to go to the island .
She ’s going back in time to re-live 15 years of her life that she lost out on while she was doing testing in the island .
Brilliant !
1970 : Ben ’s mother has traveled approximately 15 years back in time , back to 1970 , where she finds herself back in Oregon .
She meets a great guy , marries him , and gets pregnant .
But , she was childless in the alternate future that she lived out on the island .
Unfortunately for her , DHARMA had not yet discovered that connections between the dying children / mothers and time travel .
( Remember when Juliet sees the xray of the woman who was only 26 , but with a 70 - year - old womb ?
Apparently , a unique effect of time travel is that your womb will always age , however , your body wo n’t age ) .
When the time comes for Ben ’s mom to give birth , she dies , but still manages to produce a baby boy .
The reason she died was because the timeline was course correcting to replace her with Ben .
In a way , Ben is the embodiment of her , and was thus “ created ” to fulfill her legacy as the disgruntled DHARMA engineer that would ultimately bring down the shady corporation .
It ’s Ben ’s role to figure out how to “ work around ” fate , and to find a way to make the time machine “ work ” without using DHARMA ’s methods .
1980 : It ’s not long after Ben ’s mother ’s death that their good friend Horace recommends that they go to the island .
Horace is likely affiliated with DHARMA , and was sent to investigate Ben ’s mother .
After finding out about her death , he sent her husband and Ben to the island so that DHARMA could “ contain ” a potential hiccup in time .
When Ben and his dad get to the island , we find out that Ben ’s father was merely to become a peon for DHARMA .
Ben was the real reason that they came to the island :
It was Ben ’s legacy to fulfill his mother ’s destiny .
Ben , unfortunately , is n’t aware of this at the time .
He ’s just trying to enjoy himself , and make sure his father is n’t too much of a jerk .
1981 : After a good bit of time on the island , Ben hears and sees his dead mother outside his house on the island !
The reason he sees her is because in an “ alternate future , ” she was actually alive and working on this island for DHARMA .
She appears half - dead to him because her dead spirit is designed to “ help Ben understand his destiny ” so that he can carry on her legacy .
Thus , her spirit is time ’s way of course correcting the future .
Shortly after Ben sees his dead mom , he sees Richard in the jungle , who says “ you ’re not ready . ”
Richard is a time traveler - and a DHARMA - hater .
When Ben first encounters Richard in the jungle , Richard has traveled back in time from the year 2007 to 1981 .
Thus , while Richard is working with Ben , Richard is not aging .
Why did Richard go back in time to get in contact with Ben ?
To recruit him .
Richard knew Ben ’s mother in the alternate timeline , so he knows that Ben is an incarnation of his Mother , and that he is some type of prodigy on the island .
From there , Richard and Ben then spend their years plotting on how they will ultimately bring down DHARMA , and use the time machine for tests that do n’t involve killing people .
1988 : Rosseau ’s crew was an opposing force to DHARMA .
They were n’t affiliated with the Others ; however , they were going to the island to investigate “ shady business practices ” being conducted by DHARMA - These business practices being the releasing of the virus to the locals on the island .
Unfortunately , at the point in time , other Others and Ben had n’t conceived their “ master plan ” to bring down DHARMA .
However , they did n’t want to expose children to the experiments of DHARMA .
Once Rosseau lost her baby , she set up a looping signal .
That ran for years on the island , but the signal was being blocked by the looking glass .
1981 -2007 : Ben grows up from the age 10 to 37 , planning with Richard and Jacob the “ ultimate plan ” to wipe out DHARMA , the purge .
In the mean time , DHARMA continues to test other unique aspects of the island in order to see if they can leverage the time machine for some other purpose .
In the midst of this , DHARMA discovers the magnetic anomaly in the island via the SWAN station .
This magnetic anomaly is a bubble that encompasses the entire island .
Unfortunately , DHARMA only does some basic tests on this anomaly , as they do n’t really know how to use it for anything .
During this time , both the others and DHARMA are trying to learn how they can leverage the time machine “ for the greater good . ”
During the testing of the time machine , DHARMA and the others make the following discoveries about time travel .
Note that there is not a specific “ definition ” of time travel that applies to the show – time travel is simply used as a concept in the show , and the “ weird things ” that we see are typically fate ’s way of course correcting to preserve something that ’s meant to happen in the future .
When someone enters the time machine , they can only go back in time – and only to a time where the machine was currently running .
For example , if you are 50 , and go back 10 years in time , you do NOT have your 40 - year - old body .
HOWEVER , while you are re-living 10 years of your life , you body will not age until you catch up with the time in which you entered the time machine .
When you go back in time , you do not de-age .
For example , if you are 50 , and go back 10 years in time , you do NOT have your 40 - year - old body .
HOWEVER , while you are re-living 10 years of your life , you body will not age until you catch up with the time in which you entered the time machine .
However , say you were paralyzed ; fate would need to do some course correction to make sure that you are still able to play your past role in life .
Thus , time travel can TEMPORARILY cure any physical ailments you may have had prior to entering the time machine .
However , fate will still find a way to paralyze you once you catch up with the current time .
Say the first time you were paralyzed , it was because you were pushed out of a window .
Because “ the universe has a funny way of course correcting , ” you may get hit by a car the second time around .
When you go back in time , you will still have your current hair style , tattoos , and memory .
However , say you were paralyzed ; fate would need to do some course correction to make sure that you are still able to play your past role in life .
Thus , time travel can TEMPORARILY cure any physical ailments you may have had prior to entering the time machine .

Say the first time you were paralyzed , it was because you were pushed out of a window .

In other words , if you went to church on a specific date in the past , and then went back in time , you would n’t necessarily go to church in your new timeline .
However , if you changed a belief as a result of going to church the first time around , “ fate would find a way to influence you into that belief . ”
Perhaps you would have a near death experience , or maybe a mysterious person would greet you in a jewelry store and tell you that you need to change your beliefs … or , maybe fate would just kill you since it could n’t find a way to change your belief .
When you go back in time , you can only “ change ” things that do n’t have an impact on your destiny .
In other words , if you went to church on a specific date in the past , and then went back in time , you would n’t necessarily go to church in your new timeline .
However , if you changed a belief as a result of going to church the first time around , “ fate would find a way toyou into that belief .
” Perhaps you would have a near death experience , or maybe a mysterious person would greet you in a jewelry store and tell you that you need to change your beliefs … or , maybe fate would just kill you since it could n’t find a way to change your belief .
Thus , you become “ half dead ” until time catches back up .
In other words , your presence may be known to some people but not others .
Your presence would only be known when you are required to make an impact to fate .
If you go back in time and die , you are not “ totally ” dead because there has already been a variation of the universe where you were alive in the future .
Thus , you become “ half dead ” until time catches back up .
In other words , your presence may be known to some people but not others .
Your presence would only be known when you are required to make an impact to fate .
Fate does not allow for a new entity to exist in a past where it originally did not exist .
Thus fate would either have to kill the mother , the baby , or both in order to course correct .
UNLESS , fate decides to use the baby or mother to “ replace ” someone else in the timeline .
If you have never had a child , you can not go back in time and give birth .
Fate does not allow for a new entity to exist in a past where it originally did not exist .
Thus fate would either have to kill the mother , the baby , or both in order to course correct . , fate decides to use the baby or mother to “ replace ” someone else in the timeline .
The “ rules , ” if you will , are governed by how FATE decides to preserve the timeline .
Thus , if you are required to do something profound in a future timeline , fate will find any way possible to preserve the timeline – we ’ve seen ghosts and smoke monsters in LOST .
So according to the show ’s definition of time travel , fate “ does have a funny way of course correcting . ”
Basically , the “ rules of the time machine ” are not governed by any physical definitions of time travel .
The “ rules , ” if you will , are governed by how FATE decides to preserve the timeline .
Thus , if you are required to do something profound in a future timeline , fate will find any way possible to preserve the timeline – we ’ve seen ghosts and smoke monsters in LOST .
So according to the show ’s definition of time travel , fate “ does have a funny way of course correcting . ”
2007 : Swelled with hatred , Ben , Richard , and Jacob find a way to hijack the time machine , and go back in time to the year 1996 to wipe out all of DHARMA on the island ( The Purge ) .
Note that in Ben ’s original timeline from his birth to 2007 , Oceanic 815 did not crash on the island and Ben did not come down with cancer .
The fact that Ben , Richard and a few others lived out a life to the year 2007 gives them some unique powers : they know that they will technically remain alive until 2007 , no matter what happens ( unless fate deems their existence as not necessary in preserving their original timeline ) .
This is one reason for Ben being able to survive through the whole power struggle on the island in season 4 , and the reason he can take a severe beating from the Losties in almost every episode .
1996 ( new timeline on the island ) : Having gone back in time , and realizing that there are plenty of DHARMA folk in other aspects of the world ( Penny ’s father ) , the Others need to quickly think of something that will prevent DHARMA from ever reaching the island .
Thus ,
Ben figures out a way to put the entire island into a “ time loop . ”
This time loop will keep the island suspended in time in the past ( in the year 1996 ) – thus preventing any outside DHARMA people from reaching them on the island .
Once Ben and Richard start the time loop , they round up the remaining locals on the island – these people ultimately grow to become the opposing force to DHARMA , the “ others . ”
In order to create this “ time loop , ” Ben and Richard snatch up the time machine from the ARROW station , and move it to the swan station .
With the engineering mind of Mikhail , they are able to cement the time machine into walls deep within the swan station .
In addition , Mikhail is able to “ sync ” the time machine up with the magnetic anomaly that encompasses the island – thus giving the Others the ability to send the entire island back in time !
They then rig - up the computer system that requires the pushing of a button every 108 minutes ; however , this button pushing is actually activating the time machine every 108 minutes .
So , for a great number of years , DHARMA is able to suspend time on the island by “ resetting ” the time machine every 108 minutes .
Unfortunately , one of the downsides to this is that time on the island is contained in its unique magnetic bubble – thus , time in the rest of the world is still running its course .
Therefore , island time stays in the year 1996 , while real world time eventually reaches the year 2004 at the time of the plane crash .
The only way to pass through the island time and the real world time would be to use the “ special ” coordinate , which is referenced in season 4 .
Note that in season 3 , Ben makes a comment to Richard “ Remember when we used to celebrate birthdays ? ”
Well , there would n’t be any reason to celebrate birthdays if the Others are repeating time every 108 minutes , and thus not aging .
1996 - 1996 ( 8 years elapse on the island ) :
While time is staying constant on the island , the others , now invisible to the outside world , are able to continue tests in time travel .
The Others want to start a new “ world ” on the island .
They want to keep the island in its time loop forever .
They believe that with time stopped on the island , the rules of fate wo n’t apply .
But , what ’s the only problem ?
With time suspended , and the fact that fate always kills mothers and babies , the others need to find a way to pro-create on the island .
Thus , they recruit Juliet to explore the known pregnancy issue .
They also find a prestigious military officer ( Kelvin ) to press the button , making him think that he ’s saving the world .
Meanwhile , the rest of the natives are living out their days while not aging ( including Richard , Ben , and all of the others ) .
Because the island is hidden from the outside world , Ben and Richard have to be careful in letting people on and off the island .
Furthermore , you can only leave the island through the “ special coordinate ” that the Black Rock created over a century ago .
If you do n’t leave through that coordinate , you could end up leaving in the year that the island exists , which would be at some point in the past – this would require you to find a “ constant ” between island time and real world time in order to survive .
Conversely , if you were to try to enter the island from the future into the past island time ( assuming you do n’t use the special coordinate ) , then your mind would become “ stuck ” between the island time and the real world time – also requiring you to find a constant .
Jacob is also a time traveler with Richard and Ben ; however , we have n’t seen him in his “ alive ” state .
At some point in time after Jacob goes back in time with Richard and Ben to start the time loop , Jacob dies .
However , being that Jacob lived in a previous timeline on the island up to the year 2007 , his “ spirit ” is able to stay alive in order communicate with Ben and Richard .
1996 - 2004 ( Off - Island Time ) :
While the island is stuck in the year 1996 , all of the main characters of LOSTS ’ lives play out via flashbacks .
We see the initial backstories from their second iteration through time .
Keep in mind that when Ben , Richard and Jacob lived out their first timeline to the year 2007 , the plane did not crash .
The Losties ’ flashbacks that we see in seasons 1 - 3 are taking place as the Others are in the time loop on the island ( or the Other ’s second iteration through time ) – and the flashbacks are designed to represent how fate changed the lives of the Losties to ultimately bring them to the island .
For example , in Jack ’s original timeline , his father was perfectly normal and did n’t end up getting killed in Australia ; however , when Ben went back in time , fate created a series of events in Jack ’s timeline , which ultimately brought him to the island .
The same applies for all of the other Losties .
1996 ( Island Time - around 2001 in Off - Island time ) : Richard and Ethan leave the island via the special coordinate , about 5 years into the time loop to carry out a recruiting mission .
They pinpoint Juliet to explore the child birth issue on the island .
She is genuinely a good person , and will do anything to help her sister .
However , she is not aware of the time loop which is occurring on the island , and Ben is using her lack of awareness to keep her at the island .
Since Ben was from the future , he knew that Juliet ’s husband would get hit by a bus on a certain date – so he strategically timed Richard and Ethan ’s visit to be a few days prior to the husband ’s accident , knowing that would be a trigger to get Juliet to the island .
Also ,
Ben knew that Juliet ’s sister would ultimately get cured of her cancer and have a baby girl .
That ’s why Ben is so persistent on the fact that if Juliet comes to the island , that they can cure her sister .
Thus ,
Ben is n’t a liar .
He knows from his past timeline what is going to happen , and he ’s manipulating things based on his knowledge .
1996 ( Island Time - around 2001 in Off - Island Time ) : Widmore , a third party who has an obsession over DHARMA , purchased a journal of the Black Rock at an auction .
The journal gave him the coordinates that the boat traveled through to get to the island .
Widmore hires Libby ’s husband to be the first “ test subject ” to try to reach the island .
He give ’s Libby ’s husband a boat with pre-programmed coordinates – this will ultimately allow him passage into the island , through the time barrier .
However , Libby ’s husband unexpectedly dies , and she hands the boat over to Desmond .
It ’s unclear whether or not Widmore is intentionally sending Desmond to the island just to get rid of him , or if it ’s a total coincidence that the boat ends up in Desmond ’s hands .
2004 ( Off - Island Time ) : Oceanic 815 crashes on the island because Desmond did n’t press the button to reset the island time back 108 minutes .
Not pressing the button temporarily stopped the time machine from harnessing the power of the magnetic bubble , thus creating an opening over the island the split second Oceanic 815 flew over – 8 years into the island timeloop , and in the year 2004 outside the island .
The resulting power of the current flowing through the magnetic field ripped the plane in half .
We , as viewers , are left with two huge questions : was it a complete coincidence that the plane just happened to crash over the island leading Locke to not press the button OR did DHARMA somehow engineer this plane crash to happen the exact second that the plane flew over the island , knowing that specific group of people would free the island of its time loop ?
That , my friends , brings us back to the theme of LOST – did fate cause the plane crash , or had DHARMA staged certain “ characters ” to ultimately “ lead ” our heroes to the island …
OR was it some combination of both fate and the work of DHARMA ?
After the plane crashes , our heroes now exist in the year 1996 on the island , and they have taken on their physical attributes from the year 1996 .
Locke is healed because he had n’t gotten into his accident until around 2002 – the same with Rose .
Also , in the original timeline of the universe , Oceanic 815 did NOT crash .
Therefore , if the losties ever got off the island and back into the year 2004 , fate would deem that they survive at least until 2007 ( which was how far the future had been written in Ben ’s original timeline ) .
1996 ( island time ) :
All of the events in the first 2 seasons of LOST take place .
The hatch is discovered and Locke ultimately ends up not pressing the button and Desmond turns the fail safe .
The turning of the fail safe destroys the time machine , and now the island time is officially moving again ; however , the purpose of the fail safe was to permanently set time back to the original start date of 1996 !
Now the island is moving at about 8 - 9 years behind real world time .
When Desmond turned the fail safe key , his life flashed before his eyes …
Well , actually , he got to “ re- live ” about 9 years of his life !
He got to relive being rescued from the island , witnessing Charlie ’s death , and then starting his life up again off the island , meeting Penny , and then ultimately coming back to the island , thus creating a full loop for his life story .
Desmond could not escape his fate .
The reason only Desmond got to re-live his life was some function of him being the “ key turner ” OR the fact that he was exposed to the extreme magnetic radiation levels in the hatch ( which is referenced in Season 4 ) .
I ’d venture that he was probably “ at the heart of the time machine ” thus , he was a little more clairvoyant to his alternate future than say , the folks who were out on the beach .
And , that is ultimately how he gets “ flashes ” of Charlie ’s death .
Who knows how many times Desmond actually got to “ re- live ” his life .
And , each time Desmond re-lived his life , he saw what would ultimately lead our heroes to getting off the island – and that would be Charlie sending out the message .
2004 ( Off - Island time , after the plane crash ) : Widmore stages a fake Oceanic 815 plane crash because he has gotten wind that the plane may have entered the secret DHARMA research island .
The fact that the plane ca n’t be found at the island ’s location leads Widmore to believe that time travel does truly exist on the island .
Widmore is a rich man , so he wants to use time travel for his own benefit .
On another side of the power struggle , there are a few DHARMA folks left in the real world , who also are desperately trying to get back to the island , ultimately to kill Ben – because he is responsible for the disappearance of their research team on the island ( aka , the purge ) .
Once DHARMA discovers that Widmore is sending a ship to the island , they round up a small crew to travel to the island as spys : Naomi , Faraday , Lapidus , etc .
Ben is on the third point of this power triangle .
He knows that he ’s destined to survive until at least 2007 – yet in his original timeline , he did n’t have to deal with this struggle .
However , since Ben believes that there is a pre-written future for him , he does n’t have much fear that Widmore or DHARMA will ever be able to succeed in bringing him down .
So , with that , Ben sends
Tom off the island to recruit Michael to destroy everyone on the boat : DHARMA and Widmore ’s folks .
So , from Ben ’s perspective , he ’s killing two birds with one stone .
1996 ( island time ) : after Desmond is able to finally lead Charlie to his destiny and losties remove the blocking - signal , Jack is able to communicate to the freighter using Naomi ’s device .
Her device is a specially manufactured DHARMA device that allows Naomi to communicate in the past ( on the island ) with the future DHARMA in 2004 ( on the freighter ) .
Note that even Sayid pointed out how futuristic the device was – it ’s futuristic because it ’s used to communicate between different times !
Daniel has his friend on the freighter launch a payload in order to “ test ” the special coordinate that allows passage from the island .
If the payload had been launched very far away from the special coordinate , it may have arrived as much as 8 years later in time !
The fact that the payload arrived 31 minutes suggested to Daniel that they had almost found the exact coordinate .
As for the motives of Naomi ’s crew - these are working for DHARMA , they are not happy , and they are after Ben .
They want to know why DHARMA was wiped out on the island .
1996 ( Desmond ’s timeline ) : As Sayid and Desmond leave the island , they pass through the time barrier between the island time and the real world time .
In other words , Desmond is instantly passing from the island time of 1996 to the future time of 2004 .
Only Desmond is impacted by the “ time transition , ” because he was originally exposed to the high levels of the magnetism ( aka radiation ) in the SWAN hatch for the past 3 - 4 years .
While Desmond makes the transition , his mind is meshed with the 1996 version of himself .
Daniel understands exactly what is happening to Desmond – so he uses his communication device to talk to the 2004 version of Desmond in order to create a “ constant ” for himself so that he could eventually make it off the island .
That is why when Daniel checks his log ; he is able to see the newly written content , saying that “ Desmond is his constant . ”
Daniel was n’t actually changing the past by asking Desmond to make contact , he was just trying to figure out how he could get off the island , and back in to the present year of 2004 .
Unfortunately for Daniel , Naomi , and their crew , they were hand selected by DHARMA to be guinea pigs .
We ’d seen in their flashforwards that they possibly knew too much about DHARMA – thus they were expendable .
As for the other crew member on the freighter who ’s experiencing Desmond ’s symptoms – that guy attempted to get to the island , but did n’t pass through the special coordinate .
As a result , his mind was sent from 2004 to 1996 , and he did n’t have a “ constant ” to keep his mind connected between the two timelines .
As a result , he died .
So , the only true way to get to the island is through the special coordinate , which allows passage between timelines .
1996 ( island timeline ) :
Once the power struggle on the island plays out , 6 “ survivors ” emerge and leave the island : Jack , Kate , Hurley , Sun , Aaron and Sayid .
It ’s still unclear how the 6 get off the island , but we do know that the rest of the survivors remain on the island in the year 1996 ; however , DHARMA , nor Ben , ever tell the 6 that they were previously living in the year 1996 on the island .
2005 : Along with the “ 6 , ” Ben has also gotten off the island .
Remember that he has traveled from the future ( around 2007 ) back in time to 1996 as well .
Now that Ben is off the island , he uses Sayid to help course correct to ensure that the future to 2007 plays out according to plan .
We ’re not exactly sure why Sayid is killing the people that Ben chooses ; however , it is likely that these people must die in order to preserve the new timeline – perhaps they are members of DHARMA , and once Ben can eliminate all of them .
It ’s clear , however , that Ben ’s interest is now taking over DHARMA and regaining control over their time machine .
Once he can obtain that , he can travel back in time to 1996 , go back to the island , and restart the time loop ( hopefully ) .
2007 : Jack has lived about 3 - 4 years off the island in the new timeline .
He knows that there are people living on the island in the year 1996 ( now probably 1999 on the island ) .
Jack may also be aware that in an original timeline , his plane was n’t meant to crash , and he was meant to survive .
Thus he tried to jump off a bridge ( similar to how Michael tried to shoot himself with a gun ) , to test fate to see if he CAN actually kill himself .
Jack then reads in the paper that Ben has died – which may create the perfect opportunity to go back to the island , assuming that Ben was previously preventing them from going back .
One thing to note is that Jack and the other survivors may not even be aware that they had lived in the past on the island .
However , the fact that they are still alive is testing fate , given that they were meant to die in the plane crash , years ago .
I predict that the show will end with a final scene that will determine whether or not the survivors have “ free will ” to overcome some type of obstacle that fate would ’ve deemed impossible .
What is that obstacle ?
Only time will tell .
Conclusions :
Going forward , I can only predict a few things that will happen : Throughout season 4 , I think Naomi ’s DHARMA folks will infiltrate the island and there will be a cat and mouse game between the Others , our heroes , and DHARMA .
I think that Jack and Ben will slowly start to see eye to eye , and Jack will start to realize Ben ’s pessimistic viewpoint on fate .
However , I do n’t believe the “ time machine ” concept will come into play until the final season .
By the end of the series , I think some people will stay on the island and some will leave ; however , the question will remain : will our heroes be able to “ beat fate ” somehow .
Either way , the failure to keep pressing the button and the leading of DHARMA to the island has caused a great burden for Ben and the Others , as they now have no control over DHARMA and the island .
Our only hope is that they can harness some more of the islands powers to finally allow free will to change the future and stop DHARMA once and for all !

BILL Clinton made a sig nificant admission in Corpus Christi , Texas this month – saying he had decided to pardon Puerto Rican terrorists back in 1999 “ based on the stuff I was given by the staff . ”
But Ron Kolb , the citizen whose questioning prompted the ex-president ’s comment , rightly pointed out that the FBI and Justice Department had opposed the pardons .
The clear conclusion is that it was Clinton ’s political staff who pushed for clemency – with the obvious goal of helping Hillary Clinton ‘s bid to become a New York senator .
Bill still denies that was his motive , of course – but no one believes it .
The lobbying by Hispanic politicians from New York on the issue had been years - long ; the culmination was noted by the New Republic noted back in ’ 99 : “ Two days before the president announced the clemency deal , New York City Councilman Jose Rivera personally presented Hillary with a packet on clemency , including a letter asking her to ‘ speak to the president and ask him to consider granting executive clemency ’ to the prisoners . ”
The FALN , a terrorist group devoted to independence for Puerto Rico , bombed the Fraunces Tavern here in New York City in 1975 , killing four and injuring 54 others .
It also :
* Bombed five other downtown New York buildings in 1974 .
* Booby trapped a building in Manhattan and then called the police , seriously injuring and partially blinding an officer .
* Exploded two bombs in Chicago ’s Loop in 1975 .
* Bombed the Merchandise Mart in Chicago in 1977 .
* Bombed a Mobil Oil office in New York , killing one person , in 1977 .
* Bombed two Chicago military recruiting offices in 1979 .
* Injured three police officers in New York bombings in 1982 .
Even in those pre-9/11 days , pardoning terrorists who were n’t even remorseful drew public outrage ; candidate Hillary soon wound up condemning Bill ’s decision .
But when it comes to politics , they really are a team – Hillary ’s administration would be staffed from the same pool that Bill drew upon .
The same team that freed hardened terrorists to win political markers for Hillary – the same team that ’s now willing to tear the Democratic Party apart in its desperate bid to steal the nomination for Hillary – would once again be empowered to free the guilty and endanger the innocent , whenever it suited their political needs .
Why does Hillary think America will trust her enough to make her president ?
Spain 's once - booming property market is in freefall , official statistics have revealed for the first time .
The announcement that house sales had plunged has dashed government hopes for a " soft landing " in the sector that has driven the Spanish economy for more than a decade .
The buying and selling of homes fell by 27 per cent in January compared with the same period last year , Spain 's National Statistical Institute ( INE ) announced yesterday .
The collapse coincided with a 25 per cent fall in the granting of mortgages , the biggest drop since 2004 .
The size of individual mortgages has also fallen , by nearly 4 per cent , as providers fear for the security of their loans .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The indicators published by the state organisation for the first time confirm the widespread fear that Spain 's property sector is not just cooling off , but falling sharply .
" We have to accept this is not a gentle correction , but a full - blown crisis .
We can only hope it will be sharp and short , " says Fernando Encinar , a director of Spain 's leading online estate agent , idealista.com .
The news will scare millions of Spaniards – and hundreds of thousands of Britons and other northern Europeans – who stretched themselves to get mortgages on homes they believed were a cast - iron investment .
Miguel Blesa , president of the Caja Madrid savings bank , Spain 's second leading mortgage provider , warned that things would get worse .
" There will be more problems in the property sector in coming months , since the market in new homes is paralysed , " Mr Blesa predicted .
" Many people thought that buying property , especially a second or third home , was an investment to make a profit .
Now we 'll see cascades of these homes up for sale . "
Mr Blesa was speaking in Vienna , where his savings bank yesterday inaugurated a new headquarters to handle credit lines for big construction companies operating in central and eastern Europe .
The message seemed clear : leading financiers are forsaking domestic homeowners and shunning Spain 's burst bubble to boost property development in livelier markets abroad .
The bulk of the transactions – 52.4 per cent – logged by INE were in second - hand homes , where the decline in activity was sharpest – 35.6 per cent .
The drop in sales of the remaining 47.6 per cent of new homes was 14.6 per cent .
This milder fall reflected developers ' savage price - slashing of up to 30 per cent to shift new properties .
" The problem is that many people refused to face up to the slowdown for more than a year , fearing to produce what they most fear .
But now it 's clear the sector is in crisis , there 's a danger people will make things worse by panicking and predicting disaster .
It 's a herd mentality , " Mr Encinar says .
By region , Murcia – the Mediterranean " Costa Calida " , which has become a magnet for British homeowners in Spain – remains reasonably active .
But prosperous Catalonia saw a dizzying 42.7 per cent drop in property transactions , and Madrid has virtually ground to a halt .
There is still demand , Mr Encinar insists .
" But buyers , not sellers , are fixing the price , forcing owners to negotiate .
This has never happened in Spain before .
It means we can expect substantial discounts in coming months .
It could soon be a good time to buy . "
Spain 's National Construction Confederation , which represents big companies , has pleaded for improved tax breaks for first - time buyers , to halt the downturn .
Several high - profile construction companies have gone bust in recent months : with sales paralysed , they could not repay their massive bank loans .

Sadr won big .
Iran won even bigger .
Maliki , Petraeus and Cheney lost .
For people raised on stories of conventional war , where both sides fight all - out until one side loses and gives up , what happened in Iraq this past week makes no sense at all .
Sadr ’s Mahdi Army was humiliating the Iraq Army on all fronts .
In Basra , the Army ’s grand offensive , code - named “ The Charge of the Knights , ” got turned into “ The Total Humiliation of the Knights , ” like something out of an old Monty Python skit .
Thousands of police who were supposed to be backing up the Iraqi Army either refused to fight or defected to Sadr ’s Mahdi Army .
In Basra , the Iraqi Army was stopped dead and clearly in danger of being crushed or forced to retreat from the city .
In Baghdad , Sadr ’s militia was rocketing the Green Zone non-stop — not a good look for the “ Surge is working ” PR drive — and driving the Iraqi Army clean out of the 2 - million - man Shia slum , Sadr City .
And in every poor Shia neighborhood in cities and towns all over Iraq , new branches of the Mahdi Army were forming up and attacking the government forces .
Then , after four days of uninterruptedly kicking Iraqi Army ass , Sadr graciously announces that he ’s telling his men to end their “ armed appearances ” on the streets .
Makes no sense , right ?
Nah , it makes a ton of sense , but you have to stop thinking of Gettysburg and Stalingrad and think long and slow , like a guerrilla .
If you want to know how NOT to think about Iraq , just start with anything ever said or imagined by Cheney or Bush .
Our Commander in Chief declared a week ago , when the Iraqi Army first marched into Basra , “ I would say this is a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq . ”
But when the Iraqi Army fled a few days later , he suddenly got very quiet .
But anybody could see how deluded the poor fucker is just by all the nonsense he managed to cram into that 15 - word sentence .
I mean , “ the history of a free Iraq ” ?
That ’s like that Mad Magazine joke about the “ World ’s Shortest Books . ”
But that ’s nothing compared to Bush ’s fundamentally wrong notion that there ’s even such a thing as a “ defining moment ” in an urban guerrilla war .
Guerrilla wars are slow , crock - pot wars .
To win this kind of war , the long war , takes patience .
Trying to force a “ defining moment ” by military action is not just ignorant and idiotic , but risks further demoralizing your side when that moment does n’t happen , as it inevitably wo n’t .
What happens when you launch premature strikes on a neighborhood - based group like the Mahdi Army is that you just end up convincing their neighborhoods that the occupiers are the enemy , and the Mahdi boys — all local kids you ’ve known all your life — are heroes , defending your glorious slum from the foreigners and their lackeys .
By the time a homegrown group like Sadr ’s is ready to “ announce itself ” on the streets , it ’s put in years of serious grassroots work winning over the locals block by block .
The Mahdi Army runs its own little world in the neighborhoods it controls .
It distributes food to the poor , deals out rough justice to the local crims , and runs the checkpoints that keep Sunni suicide bombers off the block .
It ’s the home team , the Oakland Raiders times one million , for people in places like Sadr City .
You ca n’t eradicate it without eradicating the whole neighborhood — or making it so rich that people do n’t need a gang .
That ’s probably the only sure way to end guerrilla wars : make the locals so rich they ’re not interested in gang life any more , turning them into Sean John Combs - alikes .
And that ’s not going to happen any time soon for the two or three million people crammed into places like Sadr City .
Until then , the Mahdi Army is their team and they ’re sticking by it .

Just one sausage a day could dramatically increase the risk of bowel cancer , experts say ( picture posed by model )
One sausage a day can significantly raise the risk of bowel cancer , one of the deadliest forms of the disease , experts have warned .
Eating 1.8 oz ( 50g ) of processed meat a day - the equivalent of one sausage or three rashers of bacon - raises the likelihood of the cancer by a fifth , research shows .
The sobering statistic adds to growing evidence that too much meat in the diet can be deadly .
Bowel cancer claims 16,000 lives a year in Britain , with lung cancer the only form of the disease which kills more .
However , fewer than one in three Britons is aware of the danger posed by favourite foods such as bacon and sausages , the World Cancer Research Fund warned .
Professor Martin Wiseman , the charity 's medical and scientific adviser , said : " We are more sure now than ever before that eating processed meat increases your risk of bowel cancer and this is why WCRF recommends that people avoid eating it .
" The evidence is that whether you are talking about bacon , ham or pastrami , the safest amount to eat is none at all .
" When you consider that eating 50g of processed meat a day can increase your risk of bowel cancer by about a fifth , it is clear that you can make a positive difference by cutting out as much as possible . "
Processed meats - those preserved by smoking , salting and any other method apart from freezing - include bacon , ham , pastrami , salami and hot dogs .
Sausages , hamburgers and mince fall into the bracket if they have been preserved with salt or chemical additives .
Those who can't bear to cut out processed meats will still benefit from eating smaller quantities , said Professor Wiseman .
" We do recommend that people avoid it completely , but it is not a case of all or nothing , " he added .
" Cutting down the amount of processed meat you eat can also reduce your risk of developing bowel cancer .
" But we need to do more to get this message across because if two - thirds of people do n't know about the link between processed meat and bowel cancer , then they are not in a position to be able to make informed decisions about whether to eat it or not . "
A survey of 2,000 Britons carried out for the World Cancer Research Fund ahead of the start of Bowel Cancer Awareness month tomorrow found that only 30 per cent were aware of processed meat 's role in the disease .
The poll follows a landmark report from the charity last year which blamed putting on weight , drinking and a whole range of everyday foods , including processed meats , for causing cancer .
Among the findings of the analysis of thousands of studies on lifestyle and cancer was that small amounts of processed meat raise the risk of bowel cancer by 20 per cent .
Processed meats may also trigger cancer in the prostate , lung , stomach and oesophagus .
The analysis , published last November , also found that red meat raises the risk of the disease , but to a lesser extent .
Both types of meat can be high in fat and iron , both of which are linked to cancer .
However , processing raises levels of cancer - causing chemicals called N - nitroso compounds , making bacon , sausages and the like more deadly .
It is estimated that if everyone cut down on red and processed meat , one in ten cases of bowel cancer could be prevented .
The charity 's warning coincides with the discovery of three genetic flaws behind bowel cancer , taking the number of known mutations to seven .
Pinpointing more rogue genes could lead to the development of a genetic test for the disease .
Edinburgh University researcher Professor Malcolm Dunlop said : " It is important to catch bowel cancer at an early stage when it is more likely to be treated successfully . "
Three steaks a week - but no more
Meat is a good source of protein as well as vitamins B and D and minerals such as iron and zinc .
However , these benefits have to be balanced against increasing evidence that red and processed meats raise the risk of cancers including bowel cancer .
Experts say red meat need not be eaten every day and that 18 oz ( 500g ) a week in cooked weight ( or 27oz /750g uncooked weight ) is sufficient .
That is the equivalent of three steaks , although the definition of red meat covers pork and lamb as well as beef .
Processed meat 's stronger links to bowel cancer have led to advice that it should be avoided altogether .
The World Cancer Research Fund advises that any meat bought should be as lean as possible , with any visible fat trimmed before cooking .
Fish , low - fat poultry and plant sources of protein such as beans or lentils are convenient and healthy alternatives to red meat .
When making a chilli with mince , the quantity of meat can be halved and extra kidney beans added in its place .
Chops or sausages can be swapped for fish , with a chicken or tuna sandwich providing a healthy alternative to bacon .
Diets rich in fish and fibre - loaded fruit and vegetables may also cut the risk of the cancer , as could cutting down on alcohol , exercising more and losing weight .
Bowel cancer is one of the most easily treated cancers if caught early .
However , embarrassment over discussing tell - tale signs such as diarrhoea or rectal bleeding leads to thousands of victims a year not seeking help until it is too late .
The disease is most prevalent in the over - 60s and is slightly more common in women than men .
Women have a one in 18 risk of bowel cancer in their lifetime , while for men the figure is one in 20 .
So here 's what we do :
We all make our own “ Fitna ” movies .
As many as possible .

To get more votes , he tries to scare more people .
And now he 's suggesting to release a movie called “ Fitna ” that 's radically critical towards islam .
This hits an open nerve in Dutch media of course .
We all remember how our favourite asshole cinematographer Theo was slaughtered like a pig in the street after making “ Submission ” with Ayaan Hirsi Ali .
Only by implication , this artificially blonde embarrassment claims death defying heroism !
It is sooo embarrassing to be Dutch some times .
I ’m sorry .
Why ?
Well we can't stop Wilders .
He has a right to freedom of expression and he is smart enough to stay within the boundaries of Dutch law .
Actually , we do not want to stop his movie because we cherish our freedom of expression .
Even stupid populist politicians have fundamental rights .
Especially they !
We can compete for attention however .
And we can produce disinformation .
So we are going to make Movies called “ Fitna ” in which we apologise for Geert Wilders embarrassing behaviour .
We will make so many of them that it will be hard to find the movie by Wilders without finding lots of movies apologising for it .
Just to let the world ( and ourselves ) know that allowing confused people to speak does not mean that we agree with what they say .
Sorry .
So if you want to join in ; just make your own Fitna movie and put it on line .
Put on a blonde wig , look cross eyed and say you ’re sorry .
Film it with you telephone or camera .
Then , publish it on line as many times as you can , Youtube , Hyves , Myspace any place .
Call it Fitna by Geert Wilders .
Add any statement that you like to .
Link to your movie and to other movies you like from your blogs and websites .
Sorry !
Let ’s smother this Wilders in our apologies .
If we work hard enough , no one will be able to find his crap among all the noise we produce .
And the world knows how we feel about Wilders and his opportunism .
WE’RE SORRY !
And we are proud to live in a country where we have all inherited freedom of speech .
Lets cherish it .
Let 's defend Wilders ' rights to his opinions and to his ways of making politics !
Remember that Bento Spinoza , one of earliest of the great thinkers about religion and free speech , was ousted by his community of religious immigrants .
His zealot family was tolerated here in the Low Lands and Spinoza was tolerated here too .
More than 3 centuries of preciously negotiated tolerance .
That is a very big treasure !
Go to YouTube and get inspired by several " Fitna " movies !
Sorry ... this film was removed by YouTube ' due to terms of use violation ' .
Copyright on the portrait ?
Therefore , do n't use the real portrait of Wilders but make up your own .
And have a look at the film anyway click here !
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Militants bombarded Baghdad ’s Green Zone with rockets on Sunday , taking advantage of the cover of a blinding dust storm to launch one of the heaviest strikes in weeks on the fortified compound .
The strikes appeared to defy a renewed call for a ceasefire by Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , which has seen many of his masked gunmen leave the streets of the Sadr City slum where they hold sway in eastern Baghdad .
Reuters correspondents heard the missiles whistling overhead and exploding inside the heavily fortified government and diplomatic compound on the west side of the Tigris River in Baghdad .
Sirens wailed , ordering people to take cover .
Iraqi police said eight missiles or mortars had hit the Green Zone and another 14 fell in other parts of the Iraqi capital before nightfall in several quick bursts , killing two people and wounding 20 .
“ The Green Zone has received several rounds of IDF ( indirect fire ) but I ca n’t say more than that , ” U.S. embassy spokesman Armand Cucciniello said .
“ The duck and cover alarm sounded and people ran out for cover . ”
Several more missiles were fired late on Sunday evening but it was unclear if there were any casualties .
The United States blames rogue elements of Sadr ’s Mehdi Army militia for firing the rockets .
It accuses neighboring Shi’ite Iran of supplying the weapons and says some were made as recently as last year .
Iran denies the accusations .
Militiamen have fired 700 missiles and mortars over the past month in Baghdad , but U.S. forces had said they believed they had reduced the fighters ’ ability to strike the Green Zone by occupying the part of the Sadr City slum closest to it .
U.S. forces normally respond rapidly to missile firings with helicopter strikes , but those are impossible in dust storms .
MILITANTS KILLED
The U.S. military said it killed six militants in air strikes overnight in Sadr City before the weather turned bad in the afternoon .
Iraqi police and hospital sources said 10 people were killed and more than 40 wounded overnight there .
“ I would like to emphasize that these are not ‘ violent ’ clashes , at least not in our definition .
They are not protracted gunfights , ” said U.S. military spokesman Lieutenant - Colonel Steven Stover .
“ While attacks continue there have been less . ”
Inside Sadr City , a Reuters reporter said the black - masked fighters who have long prowled the streets were keeping a low profile in response to Sadr ’s call for them to observe a truce .
“ This morning , the Americans entered on foot from the Jamila area .
We could have hit them , but we have orders to defend the city against the occupiers but not inside the city , ” said Abu Jassim , a Mehdi Army street commander .
Outside Sadr City a Reuters reporter saw fighters planting a roadside bomb .
The government ’s confrontation with Sadr ’s Mehdi Army began a month ago when Shi’ite Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki launched a crackdown on militias in the southern city of Basra .
Despite initial setbacks , the Basra campaign has since proved largely a success , with government troops taking control of neighborhoods once regarded as militia strongholds .
In Sadr City , the cleric ’s main Baghdad stronghold , U.S. forces have advanced only into a small portion of the slum to put 107 millimeter missiles out of range of the Green Zone .

Fighting and air strikes in the district over the past month have killed hundreds .
Food prices have skyrocketed and residents say they feel under siege .
Many schools have shut .
Major - General Qassim Moussawi , Iraqi military spokesman for security in the capital , acknowledged civilian casualties were inevitable in fighting in a crowded slum .
“ The area of this ( Sadr ) city is around 25 square kilometers ( 10 square miles ) with an estimated population of 3 million .
This means if a bullet is shot , it will hit a person , ” he said .
Um Aziz is an elderly woman whose three daughters and a son were killed when the roof of her house collapsed because of the force of an explosion nearby .
She cursed U.S. forces .
“ I do n’t want any reparations from the government .
I want my revenge from God , ” she said outside her ruined home , wearing bandages from her own injuries and a broken leg .
“ Let the Americans listen :
If they kill all the men , we will fight them .
We : the women and the children .
And if they take our weapons we will fight them with stones and knives . ”
In a sign of progress towards national reconciliation , Maliki met Sunni Arab Vice President Tareq al - Hashemi to discuss the eventual return of the main Sunni Arab bloc to Maliki ’s government , which it quit last year .
Uncovering a rare , two - billion - year - old window into the Earth 's mantle , a University of Houston professor and his team have found our planet 's geological history is more complex than previously thought .
Jonathan Snow , assistant professor of geosciences at UH , led a team of researchers in a North Pole expedition , resulting in a discovery that could shed new light on the mantle , the vast layer that lies beneath the planet 's outer crust .
These findings are described in a paper titled " Ancient , highly heterogeneous mantle beneath Gakkel Ridge , Arctic Ocean , " appearing recently in Nature .
These two - billion - year - old rocks that time forgot were found along the bottom of the Arctic Ocean floor , unearthed during research voyages in 2001 and 2004 to the Gakkel Ridge , an approximately 1,000 - mile - long underwater mountain range between Greenland and Siberia .
This massive underwater mountain range forms the border between the North American and Eurasian plates beneath the Arctic Ocean , where the two plates diverge .
These were the first major expeditions ever undertaken to the Gakkel Ridge , and these latest published findings are the fruit of several years of research and millions of dollars spent to retrieve and analyze these rocks .
The mantle , the rock layer that comprises about 70 percent of the Earth 's mass , sits several miles below the planet 's surface .
Mid-ocean ridges like Gakkel , where mantle rock is slowly pushing upward to form new volcanic crust as the tectonic plates slowly move apart , is one place geologists look for clues about the mantle .
Gakkel Ridge is unique because it features -- at some locations -- the least volcanic activity and most mantle exposure ever discovered on a mid-ocean ridge , allowing Snow and his colleagues to recover many mantle samples .
" I just about fell off my chair , " Snow said .
" We can't exaggerate how important these rocks are -- they 're a window into that deep part of the Earth . "
Venturing out aboard a 400 - foot - long research icebreaker , Snow and his team sifted through thousands of pounds of rocks scooped up from the ocean floor by the ship 's dredging device .
The samples were labeled and cataloged and then cut into slices thinner than a human hair to be examined under a microscope .
That is when Snow realized he found something that , for many geologists , is as rare and fascinating as moon rocks -- mantle rocks devoid of sea floor alteration .
Analysis of the isotopes of osmium , a noble metal rarer than platinum within the mantle rocks , indicated they were two billion years old .
The use of osmium isotopes underscores the significance of the results , because using them for this type of analysis is still a new , innovative and difficult technique .
Since the mantle is slowly moving and churning within the Earth , geologists believe the mantle is a layer of well - mixed rock .
Fresh mantle rock wells up at mid-ocean ridges to create new crust .
As the tectonic plates move , this crust slowly makes its way to a subduction zone , a plate boundary where one plate slides underneath another and the crust is pushed back into the mantle from which it came .
Because this process takes about 200 million years , it was surprising to find rocks that had not been remixed inside the mantle for two billion years .
The discovery of the rocks suggests the mantle is not as well - mixed or homogenous as geologists previously believed , revealing that the Earth 's mantle preserves an older and more complex geologic history than previously thought .
This opens the possibility of exploring early events on Earth through the study of ancient rocks preserved within the Earth 's mantle .
The rocks were found during two expeditions Snow and his team made to the Arctic , each lasting about two months .
The voyages were undertaken while Snow was a research scientist at the Max Planck Institute in Germany , and the laboratory study was done by his research team that now stretches from Hawaii to Houston to Beijing .
Since coming to UH in 2005 , Snow 's work stemming from the Gakkel Ridge samples has continued , with more research needed to determine exactly why these rocks remained unmixed for so long .
Further study using a laser microprobe technique for osmium analysis available only in Australia is planned for next year .
This is the second in a series of occasional interviews with people I find interesting or who work on interesting projects .
By now , you either recognize the name , or you ’re wondering who Seetharaman Narayanan is , and the difference probably depends on what you do for a living .
If , like me , you have a job where you launch Photoshop on a daily basis , then maybe , like me , you ca n’t stop staring at this guy ’s name on the Splash Screen every time it launches .
Seetharaman Narayanan .
It ’s hard to look away .
Sure , other people worked on Photoshop .
But nobody else has a name like Seetharaman Narayanan .
If you too have been unable to look away from his name as you open Photoshop , you may be thinking , “ I thought I was the only one ! ”
Take comfort in knowing you ’re not alone .
Back in 2004 , a simple comment was posted on the ConceptArt.org forum .
It said , “ Every time I open up photoshop I am mezmorized by this guy ’s name .
It ’s all I can look at .
Do n’t know why … ”
Six pages of “ Me , too ! ” responses followed .
He has gone on to inspire a Seetharaman Narayanan fan club group on Flickr , and being unable to get his name out of your head has been recognized as a sign of Photoshop addiction .
So I decided to find out just who this mysterious Seetharaman Narayanan is .
What does he do ?
What does he think of his notoriety ?
And what ’s interesting about him other than his name ?
Mr. Narayanan , who goes by the much shorter name “ Seetha , ” was nice enough to answer these questions and more .
When did you become aware of the fascination with your name among Photoshop users ?
Jeff Schewe [ Photographer ] sent me an e-mail sometime in the fall of 2005 about the existence of Seetha ’s fanclub thread from ConceptArt.org .
What do you think about it ?
I thought it was funny and was amazed at the amount of free time people had at their disposal .
I always thought that I was fortunate in getting hired by Adobe at the right time since any Tom , Dick or Harry would have done the same thing I did and perhaps better than what I did .
They may not have become famous unless they had some weird last name that is almost un-pronouncable .
How long have you been at Adobe ?
I have been with Adobe for 15 years to date .
I joined Adobe as a peon on Photoshop 2.5 on September 23 , 1991 .
Peter Merrill ( who now works on Acrobat and is still with Adobe ) was the lead engineer on the task of making Photoshop run on Windows 3.1 and I was his deputy in the early days .
Peter is one of the brightest engineers I have ever worked with in my 20 year career ( he may just be the smartest of all ! ) .
I still remember the interview I had with Peter before I got hired at Adobe .
Peter had this toy application ( that later became Photoshop ) with ugly Icons and Cursors he showed me and mentioned to me that he had that code ported over from the Mac and he could even open an image ( Flower.psd which by the way , shipped as a sample file with Photoshop 2.5 ) on Windows .
I had previously worked at CrystalGraphics and we had just ported over Crystal ’s TOPAS over to the Mac platform just weeks prior to my interview with Adobe and I was totally under whelmed by Peter ’s demo of Photoshop on Windows .
In spite of my lack of enthusiasm , Peter hired me anyway and the rest is history .
Former spy gives US intel D+ in exploiting open info Nick Juliano

The US intelligence community is slowly coming to the realization that most of its vital information does not have to be stolen from a secret vault in an enemy country but is available by surfing the Web .
Since 9/11 , the exploitation of so - called " open- source intelligence , " has increased among intelligence agencies , but many obstacles remain .
Primary among those is a bureaucratic culture in which analysts dismiss documents not marked " classified " or " eyes only . "
USA Today reports that this intelligence , known within the intel community as OSINT , is becoming a fixture among the Intelligence Community .
Open sources can provide up to 90 % of the information needed to meet most U.S. intelligence needs , Deputy Director of National Intelligence Thomas Fingar said in a recent speech .
Harnessing that information " is terribly important , " he said .
" It ought to be a normal part of what we do , not being fixated on secrets dribbling into the computer 's in - box . "
But progress has been slow .
Robert David Steele , a former CIA and Marine Corps intelligence officer , gives the intelligence community a D+ for its use of information available from the Internet , commercial satellite imagery and other open sources .
" There 's still a cult of secrecy  nothing is seen as important unless it 's classified , " says Steele , founder of OSS .
Net , a commercial intelligence provider for private companies and the government .
Information from unclassified sources has been responsible for dialing back heated rhetoric about Iran 's nuclear program , among other things , the newspaper reports .
Publicly available photos from the country 's Natanz nuclear facilities provided vital clues to its capabilities .
Throughout much of the 20th century , open - source intelligence gathering focused primarily on translating foreign newspapers and broadcasts .
As more and more information was available online , the nation 's 16 intelligence - gathering agencies were slow to adapt .
Such basics as desk - top Web access was unavailable for most intelligence agents , and even today 19,000 FBI agents are unable to log on to the Web from their offices or cubicles ( 11,000 agents have Internet access ) , according to USA Today .
Although they may have been slow to arrive to the party , the nation 's intelligence agents are quickly adapting to exploit Web 2.0 hallmarks such as YouTube , MySpace and personal blogs .
The CIA also is working with Google to help them better search for and share intelligence .
Valuable information from open sources has been exploited as long as the US has had an intelligence community , and even before .
During World War II port watchers in the pacific tracked ship movements , and information on encryption was gleaned at German trade shows after the war , writes Jennifer Sims in the book Transforming U.S. Intelligentce .
During the Cold War , though , the emphasis on secret information became ingrained , as the CIA and other intelligence agencies focused on the highly secretive Soviet Union .
Sims says failure to fully exploit OSINT is potentially debilitating , especially now that US adversaries are not nearly as good at keeping information hidden .
" [ A ] fixation on secret sources now amounts to a debilitating cognitive bias , " Sims writes .
" A number of US adversaries are less secretive than the Soviet Union was , and they do not necessarily know how to keep their actions out of the public eye . "

Because these loans go to people stretching to afford a house , they come with higher interest rates  even if they ’re disguised by low initial rates  and thus higher returns .
The mortgages were then sliced into pieces and bundled into investments , often known as collateralized debt obligations , or C.D.O. ’s ( a term that appeared in this newspaper only three times before 2005 , but almost every week since last summer ) .
Once bundled , different types of mortgages could be sold to different groups of investors .
Investors then goosed their returns through leverage , the oldest strategy around .
They made $ 100 million bets with only $ 1 million of their own money and $ 99 million in debt .
If the value of the investment rose to just $ 101 million , the investors would double their money .
Home buyers did the same thing , by putting little money down on new houses , notes Mark Zandi of Moody ’s Economy.com .
The Fed under Alan Greenspan helped make it all possible , sharply reducing interest rates , to prevent a double - dip recession after the technology bust of 2000 , and then keeping them low for several years .
All these investments , of course , were highly risky .
Higher returns almost always come with greater risk .
But people  by “ people , ” I ’m referring here to Mr. Greenspan , Mr. Bernanke , the top executives of almost every Wall Street firm and a majority of American homeowners  decided that the usual rules did n’t apply because home prices nationwide had never fallen before .
Based on that idea , prices rose ever higher  so high , says Robert Barbera of ITG , an investment firm , that they were destined to fall .
It was a self - defeating prophecy .
And it largely explains why the mortgage mess has had such ripple effects .
The American home seemed like such a sure bet that a huge portion of the global financial system ended up owning a piece of it .
Last summer , many policy makers were hoping that the crisis would n’t spread to traditional banks , like Citibank , because they had sold off the underlying mortgages to investors .
But it turned out that many banks had also sold complex insurance policies on the mortgage debt .
That left them on the hook when homeowners who had taken out a wishful - thinking mortgage could no longer get out of it by flipping their house for a profit .
Many of these bets were not huge , but were so highly leveraged that any losses became magnified .
If that $ 100 million investment I described above were to lose just $ 1 million of its value , the investor who put up only $ 1 million would lose everything .
That ’s why a hedge fund associated with the prestigious Carlyle Group collapsed last week .
“ If anything goes awry , these dominos fall very fast , ” said Charles R. Morris , a former banker who tells the story of the crisis in a new book , “ The Trillion Dollar Meltdown . ”
This toxic combination  the ubiquity of bad investments and their potential to mushroom  has shocked Wall Street into a state of deep conservatism .
The soundness of any investment firm depends largely on other firms having confidence that it has real assets standing behind its bets .
So firms are now hoarding cash instead of lending it , until they understand how bad the housing crash will become and how exposed to it they are .
Any institution that seems to have a high - risk portfolio , regardless of whether it has enough assets to support the portfolio , faces the double whammy of investors demanding their money back and lenders shutting the door in their face .
Goodbye , Bear Stearns .
Some people were born to be scientists .
The girl in this video clip is certainly one of them .
" I always wanted to find out if the reaction of vinegar and baking soda would burn the skin , " said SquabAttack , the amateur chemist .
" I eat a lot of sour foods and therefore did n’t find the vinegar to be too unbearable . "
How hardcore is that ?
She was willing to risk hurting herself to answer a scientific question !
This is is why bright kids should be encouraged to work in real research labs — with close supervision !
They have a level of energy and curiosity surpasses jaded graduate students such as myself .
When I was her age , I would have killed to do the kind of repetitive benchwork that drives me nuts today .
Every single time that I mentor some teenage kid that is working on a science project , they are thrilled to play with pipetters , vortex mixers , pH meters , and other tools that may seem mundane to an experienced scientist .
Some universities allow talented high school students to work in real research labs during the summer , but those opportunities are few and far between .
In my opinion , the best things that an aspiring teenage scientist can do are : read lots of science magazines , try to visit the labs at local universities , search for summer research experience programs , and do lots of backyard experiments .
Would anyone else care to offer some advice ?
Peggy Noonan , a Republican speechwriter ( Reagan ’s among others ) , was perplexed last night on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart as to “ why Rudy fell . ”
It was a mystery to her .
Probably because she gets all her information from FOX News and the other corporate media .
Of course those who ’s heads are n’t buried in the corporate idiot box , know that 9/11 truth was Rudy ’s demise .
First of all , how did Rudy , a Mayor even become a possible GOP nominee .
Corporate media and the Bush Administration began a myth about Rudy Giuliani beginning on 9/11/2001 ?
Evidence suggests that a quid pro quo may have begun Rudy 's ascendance , whereby Rudy would help destroy the WTC steel BEFORE A FORENSIC 9/11 INVESTIGATION COULD OCCUR ( by sending it to India and China to be melted down ) . . . and in exchange the powers made him President .
Of course that did n’t work out quite the way Rudy wanted .
Rudy even began using remains of WTC victims to fill pot holes because he was in such a rabid hurry to get rid of evidence .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxycV4fNPnQ
Over 6 months ago , when Rudy Giuliani was expected to be a shoe - in for the GOP nomination as Mr. 9/11 , he was confronted on the campaign trail by a very courageous young woman , Sabrina Rivero , who ’s father died in the 9/11 attacks , and by Luke Rudkowski , and Tom Foti of WeAreChange New York , a 9/11 truth organization .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAGYB4LvfY0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n7uJnKGTGg
This video made network news after being posted on YouTube and flying fiercely around the internet .
The original video on YouTube has been viewed over 61,000 times , however this video has been posted by others and linked through countless websites and articles .
Corporate media tried to laugh it off , but viewers who watched began to re-think Mr. 9/11 Giuliani .
In this video , Giuliani was confronted because he ’d told network news on 9/11 that he and his command team had been warned that World Trade Center 7 , which mysteriously collapsed at 5:20 pm on 9/11/2001 , was about to collapse “ before ” it actually did .
It was not hit by a plane and its damage from the collapse of WTC 1 and 2 was much less severe than other buildings in the World Trade Center complex , which did not collapse .
See video of WTC 7 as well as 1 and 2 , at :
http://www.ae911truth.org/
No one in the world knew that WTC 7 would collapse on 9/11 , so Ms. Rivero wanted to know who told Giuliani that it was about to collapse .
She also wanted to know why Giuliani did n’t warn people like her father who were present in the WTC complex on 9/11 , in order to save lives , rather than just evacuating the building and not warning others .
Giuliani denied having told network news that he knew WTC 7 was going to collapse , and denied anyone told him it would on 9/11 , even though it is public knowledge that the Command Center was evacuated by his command crew .
Not only did Giuliani know BEFORE it came down that it would come down but police and emergency workers were told by someone it would “ blow up . ”
See Giuliani ’s admission he was told , at :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4lWM0BECZ8
WTC 7 fell in a classic controlled demolition fashion at near free fall speed of about 7 seconds for a 47 story building , tipping in in the center just like the Vegas hotels we ’ve all seen blown on TV .

Representatives of the EU's 27 member states formally agreed today to harmonize their respective countries ' definitions of criminally prosecutable acts of terrorism by expanding them to include three new types of crimes : " public provocation to commit a terrorist offence , [ terrorist ] recruitment , and training for terrorism . "
The definition of " public provocation " was especially controversial , and it encompasses content posted on the Internet , including not only direct incitements to violence but also terrorist propaganda and bomb - making expertise .
The decision was n't without controversy , and misgivings about the possible limits on freedom of expression implied in the Amendment to the 2002 Council Framework Decision on combating terrorism were aired in a round - table session on Monday .
An EU Parliament report on the round - table summarized the concerns of one British representative , who recounted how British law enforcement had allegedly threatened to use anti-terror laws to arrest some of the protesters at the London leg of the Olympic torch relay .
Her concern , much like those who 've been raising objections to this " public provocation " language since it was proposed last year , is that the Amendment will push member states down a slippery slope toward criminalizing legitimate political expression .
We covered the earlier controversy around this proposal , as well as the technical difficulties with actually stamping out " terrorist propaganda " once it 's identified , in an report last year .
The concerns with enforcement mechanisms — e.g. , what authority will issue the take - down notice to a hosting provider , and what happens if the provider is in a non-EU country — appear to be addressed in to some degree by the new legislation .
The press release announcing the Amendment claims , " the new legislation will make it easier for law enforcement authorities to get cooperation from internet service providers , to prevent crimes and identify criminals while , at the same time , ensuring that fundamental rights remain well protected . "
Aversion to inbred men is n't just a sensible cultural tradition .
It might be biologically hard - wired into women who are literally able to sniff out the scent of incest .
In a study published today in Current Biology , researchers from the
University of Liverpool bred two groups of male mice to be identical in every way but one : the diversity of their so - called major urinary proteins .
Lacking Google stalking and the advice of embittered friends , female mice rely on urinary proteins for information about potential mates .
In the wild , mice born to genetically unrelated parents have more varied proteins than the offspring of related parents – and in the Liverpool lab , female mice consistently picked males with the most complex urinary bouquet .
Do human women have the same ability ?
Scientists do n't know
\– but it 's certainly plausible .
Olfactory cues are among the tricks we instinctively use to detect unsuitable mates .
( That said , some animals prefer inbreeding – and in certain circumstances ,
" kissing cousins " might have an advantage . )
A non-scientific aside : a lot of jokes came to mind for this post and are entirely unfit to print .
That 's probably for the better .
But it 's a shame this study did n't come out five years ago – it would have made a great plot device for an episode Friends or Seinfeld .

Psst !
George Bush has a secret
While you Democrats are pounding each other to a pulp in Pennsylvania , the President has snuck back down to New Orleans for a meeting of the NAFTA Three : the Prime Minister of Canada and the President of Mexico .
You ’re not supposed to know that – for two reasons :
First , the summit planned for the N.O. two years back was meant to showcase the rebuilt Big Easy , a monument to can - do Bush - o - nomics .
Well , it is a monument to Bush ’s leadership :
The city still looks like Dresden 1946 , with over half the original residents living in toxic trailers or wandering lost and broke in America .
The second reason Bush has kept this major summit a virtual secret is its real agenda – and the real agenda - makers .
The names and faces of the guys who called the meeting must remain as far out of camera range as possible : The North American Competitiveness Council .
Never heard of The Council ?
Well , maybe you ’ve heard of the counsellors : the chief executives of Wal - Mart , Chevron Oil , Lockheed - Martin and 27 other multinational masters of the corporate universe .
And why did the landlords of our continent order our presidents to a three - nation
pajama party ?
Their agenda is “ harmonization . ”
Harmonization has nothing to do with singing in fifths like Simon and Garfunkel .
Harmonization means making rules and regulations the same in all three countries .
Or , more specifically , watering down rules – on health , safety , labor rights , oil drilling , polluting and so on – in other words , any regulations that get between The Council members and their profits .
Take for example , pesticides .
Wal - Mart and agri-business do n’t want to reduce the legal amount of poison allowed in what you eat .
Solution : “ harmonize ” US and Canadian pesticide standards to Mexico’s .
Can they do that ?
Can Bush just say , “ Eat your peas – even if they ’re radioactive ” ?
Under NAFTA , at least the way George Bush reads it ( or has it read to him ) , he can .
When the three chiefs of state meet privately with the thirty corporate chiefs , they are also expected to erase a bit more of our borders .
Technically , they will expand the “ NAFTA Highway ” – which is , in addition to lots of new blacktop , a set of regulations governing transcontinental shipment .
Some fear NAFTA Highway expansion will allow a new flood of cheap Mexican products into the US and Canada .
Not so .
The Council 's hunger to widen the NAFTA highway is to bring in even cheaper Chinese goods .
Say what ?
As trade expert Maude Barlow explained to me , the new NAFTA Highway will allow Chinese stuff dumped into Mexico to be hauled northward as duty - free “ Mexican ” products .
That ’s one of the quiet aims of this “ Summit for Security and Prosperity , ” the official Orwellian name for this meet .
Think of the SPP “ harmonization ” as the Trojan Taco of trade with China .
Barlow is Chairwoman of the Council of Canadians .
She is known as the “ Ralph Nader of Canada ” ( not Nader version 2.0 , The Spoiler Candidate , but Nader 1.0 , the consumer advocate ) .
Because Americans are too distracted by the Punch - and - Judy primaries to complain about this lobby - fest on the bayou , Canadian Barlow is leading street protests against the SPP greed - grab .
I caught up with this courageous Canadian ( I ’ve seen her face down corporate bullying we can’t imagine in the US ) on her way down to New Orleans .
Barlow is especially horrified that the SPP agreement promotes a five - fold increase in the mining of Canadian tar sands for import , as liquid crude oil , into the USA , an idea filthier than a re-make of Debbie Does Dallas .
“ This is an insane model of development , ” she says , especially given Bush ’s recent claim that he wants to slow global warming .
Bush himself is pushing his Canadian and Mexican counterparts to adopt US - style “ Homeland Security ” measures so that , says Barlow , “ we ’ll all be zip - locked together in one security bag . ”
There will be other anti-SPP protesters in New Orleans as well , from America ’s populist Right .
They are concerned that the Summit is worse than the “ NAFTA on steroids ” that Barlow fears .
The populists see in the SPP a nascent “ North American Union , ” and the elimination of the good old US of A .
They ’re wrong , of course .
The USA was eliminated years ago , at least economically .
The globalizers , the Competitiveness Council members , are a multinational crew , with one shared set of country clubs , beach homes , art collections , union busters and lobbyists knowing no borders .
The populist radio hosts railing against the coming North American Union do n’t realize that these CEOs wo n’t take away our flags or Fourth of July or Star - Spangled Banner .
The rags and flags will always be kept around to con the schmucks along the Yahoo Belt into donating their children to the Iraq Occupation or other misadventures .
Likewise for Mexico 's rulers : A billionaire like Carlos Slim , the richest man on the planet ( sorry , Mr. Gates ) , did n’t buy the Mexican government to “ protect ” his nation from Gringos but to protect his media monopoly .
The corporation that purchases Canada 's leaders , Barrick Gold of Toronto , has looted treasuries from Tanzania to Nevada to Chile – and shared the spoils on both sides of the border with their well - greased advisors Brian Mulroney , former Prime Minister of Canada , and George Bush Sr. , former head of the US CIA .
So there is no United States of America nor Canada nor Mexico – at least as we like to imagine ourselves in our national fairy tales : self - governing democracies run by we the people or nosotros el pueblo .
There ’s just the diktats of the North American Prosperity Council .
Get used to it .
To underscore the fact that you are n't invited , nor our elected representatives , Barlow related to me that the US Ambassador to Canada told her the legal changes wrought in New Orleans will not be put before the three national Congresses for a vote .
“ We do n’t want to open up another NAFTA , ” he told her .
So , they ’ll skip the voting stuff .
Democracy is so , like , 20th Century .
Is Bush just a reluctant participant in this “ harmonizing ” of our economic fate ?
The meetings are secret , so I ca n’t say for sure .
But I note that , at the opening ceremony , if you read his lips , you can see our president singing the national anthem as , “ José , can you see ? ”

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The federal government , eager to boost the flagging economy , will start distributing special stimulus payments Monday - four days earlier than expected .
" Beginning Monday , the effects of the stimulus will begin to reach households , " President Bush said Friday .
" This money is going to help Americans offset the high prices we 're seeing at the gas pump and at the grocery store . "
The department announced the early arrival of the payments Thursday after saying last month that it would begin sending out the money on May 2 .
As of next week , 800,000 tax filers daily will begin to have their checks directly deposited Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday .
No checks will be distributed Thursday , and 5 million payments will be made Friday .
The payments will go out ahead of schedule because of a new computer program that updates records daily - faster than an older program that updates weekly , according to Andrew DeSouza , a Treasury spokesman .
Overall , the Treasury will distribute more than $ 110 billion to 130 million taxpayers by July and hopes to get the first $ 50 billion out by the end of May , DeSouza said .
The checks are the centerpiece of an economic stimulus program signed into law by President Bush in February .
The aim is to boost consumer spending and help mitigate problems caused by the slowing economy .
Checks are being distributed to people who file 2007 tax returns .
Those who opt for direct deposit with the Internal Revenue Service will start getting payments before those who use the mail .
The program calls for rebates of up to $ 600 for single filers making less than $ 75,000 .
Couples making less than $ 150,000 would receive rebates of up to $ 1,200 .
In addition , parents would receive $ 300 rebates per child .
Filers who do not owe income taxes but have at least $ 3,000 in income would get a $ 300 payment .
Payments to taxpayers slated to get paper checks will start to go out May 9 - one week earlier than originally planned .
The order in which tax filers will receive their payments will be based on the last two digits of their Social Security numbers .

Moby wants to marry " weird " Britney Spears .
The ' Go ' singer revealed his feelings for the 26 - year - old ' Toxic ' star increase with every drama in her troubled life .
He said : " Britney is like this Tennessee Williams tragic figure .
The fatter she gets , the weirder she gets , the more I love her .
I found her moderately appealing in the late 90s , but now I would marry her in a heartbeat ! "
If these words were people , I would embrace their genocide .
Lately I 've been hearing a lot of stupid people parroting stupid buzz words .
There are too many to list all of them here , but I 'll be damned if I 'm not going to try .
I propose that we all agree , here and now , to strike these words and phrases from our collective for the betterment of humanity , and the improvement of my blood pressure .
Thank you .
Blog :
The word " blog " is literally shorthand for " boring ; " a vulgar , overused word that strikes your ear with the dull thud of a cudgel to the soft spot of a child 's head .
It 's an abbreviation used by journalism drop outs to give legitimacy to their shallow opinions and amateur photography that seems to be permanently stuck in first draft hell .
Looking in the archives of the blogs , one would expect someone who has been at it for years to slowly hone their craft and improve their writing and photographs , since it 's usually safe to assume that if someone does something long enough , he or she will eventually not suck at it .
Even with lowered expectations , you 'll get a shotgun blast of disappointment in your face .
It 's an unspoken rule that every blog must use the same layout as every other blog : long , slender columns of annoyingly condensed text , thousands of links to other blogs , plugs for shitty political books , and more links to yet more blogs :
The problem with this layout is that there 's too much shit to click on .
Seriously , who 's ever going to click on all those links ?
The worst blogs are the ones that make every other word a hyperlink to another website so by the time you finish reading this sentence , you 've forgotten what you were reading , or why you were reading it in the first place .
Hey , this article is great but you know what would make it better ?
If I could read another article in the middle of it .
Great design , morons .
If the thousands of mid-sentence links do n't annoy you , the long slender columns of text will .
Most of the screen on a blog is blank for an imaginary populace of readers still using 640x480 resolution .
I did n't buy a 19 " monitor to have 50 % of its screen realestate pissed away on firing white pixels , you assholes .
They do n't print books on receipt paper for a reason .
Every time I see this layout , I want to choke the creator with my dry , crackled , and bleeding hands for making my fingers so calloused from having to keep scrolling the mouse wheel to read your dumb " blog . "
Blogger :
Term used to describe anyone with enough time or narcissism to document every tedious bit of minutia filling their uneventful lives .
Possibly the most annoying thing about bloggers is the sense of self - importance they get after even the most modest of publicity .
Sometimes it takes as little as a referral on a more popular blogger 's website to set the lesser blogger 's ego into orbit .
Then God forbid a blogger gets mentioned on CNN .
If you thought it was impossible for a certain blogger to get more pious than he was , wait until you see the shit storm of self - righteous save - the - world bullshit after a network plug .
Suddenly the boring , mild - mannered blogger you once knew will turn into Mother Theresa , and will single handedly take it upon himself to end world hunger with his stupid links to band websites and other smug blogger dipshits .
Blogging :
If minds had anuses , blogging would be what your mind would do when it had to take a dump .
Blogged :
What you call a trivial or largely inconsequential topic once bloggers have processed through every tired detail .
For more on this , look into : every minor news story .
Blogosphere : The " blogosphere " is the new buzz word that has replaced " information super highway . "
It 's what idiots like to call a collection of " blogs , " otherwise known as a tragedy .
Blogomania : Like all other manias , except relating to the infatuation of blogs .
It 's one step above the more caustic phrase " blog - o - rama . "
Thankfully the latter has n't caught on to the extent of its brethren , but that does n't stop me from punching anyone who says it in the dick .
Blogroll : A long list of links that nobody will ever click on .
Bloggers not only link to their friends and fellow bloggers , but their eventual goal is to link to every linkable document on the Internet .
Most " blog rolls " are so full of links that it can bring even the mightiest of search engines to a crawl as they sort through all the frivolous bullshit bloggers link to .
Thankfully , since most blogs are shallow in content , it wo n't take you long to load , and in turn , to close the browser quickly if you 're duped into clicking one of these links .
If you shut down quickly enough , you may be able to avoid downloading the mandatory 2 gigs of political banners on every blogger 's website .
Blogshare :
An imaginary share of a blog 's worth , which is ironic , since most blogs have an imaginary share of readers .
Blogstorm :
A zany phrase news anchors like to use any time they think there 's an abnormal amount of posts on blogs regarding any particular topic .
Of course , they fail to consider any amount of posting to a blog is abnormal since people who are well adjusted usually have better things to do , i.e. , work , or failing that , anything else .
Blog Swarm : Stupid .
Blogging community : Losers , goths , bedwetters , and journalism dropouts .
Blawg :
Some prick thought it would be clever to spell " blog " phonetically using the word " law " in the title .
It 's a phrase used to describe blogs primarily dealing with the law and legal issues .
Wow , real clever , dipshit .
How did you come up with that one ?
Blogumentary :
There was recently a bit of a feud regarding this word among two bloggers .
Apparently some guy decided that they had exclusive right to use the word , not realizing that similar words ( docudrama , dramedy , rockumentary , etc ) have been free to use for all people since you can't just copyright an entire genre , and more importantly , that it 's stupid .
Who cares ?
Blogumentary ?
Really ?
Eat shit you morons .
Blogebrity : Wow , guess what this one stands for ?
Too easy .
Hey , anyone can do it : take a blogger who 's a chef , and you get : BLEF .
A blogger who 's a dentist ?
BENTIST .
A female blogger with an itch ?
You guessed it : a BITCH .
Photoblog : Photoblogs make me yearn for the day when cameras were n't digital , film cost money , and it took time to develop pictures .
I remember back when it was n't easy for any random asshole with a camera to go out take countless pictures of nothing .
Nothing is exactly what these pictures are of .
No focus , no theme , no message , no posturing .
Just countless pictures of Denny 's at 2 AM .
We do n't care that you went to Denny's .
You 're not an artist .
You 're not deep .
Get a new hobby .
Podcast : Someone had the revolutionary idea of taking a compressed audio file and putting it online .
Yeah , does n't sound so sexy when I describe it for what it is , does it you morons ?
It would have been a great idea if streaming audio was n't already around for over a decade before the word " podcast " entered the lexicon .
Man , I can't stand the word " lexicon . "
Talking about all these shitty words has made me start using shitty words .
I 'm so pissed , I just slammed the door shut on some kid 's nuts .
Podcasting :
It 's snob for " streaming audio . "
Podcatcher :
Any idiot with an iPod , web browser , or ears .
Warblog :
A blog that primarily deals with war .
Filled with whiny blow hards who are fixated on their stubborn ideas and conspiracy theories .
For example , there are countless hours pissed away by conspiracy theorists who think the WTC towers were demolished by bombs planted by the government .
These armchair engineers write endlessly about how the physics of the collapse was impossible , how the temperature was n't hot enough to melt steel , and how the planes were carrying missiles .
Of course , the one thing they do n't postulate is a REASON .
My personal favorite warblog was one that had a flash animation with people who were quoted as saying " it did n't sound like a plane to me ... it sounded like a missile . "
Thank you Joe Nobody for giving me your expert opinion on what missile sounds like , because gas station superintendents are usually the best people to ask about the sonic signature of ballistic missile thrust .
Warblogger : Like all other bloggers , an idiot .
Usually a self - righteous prick with a political axe to grind .
Tragically , these dullards fail to realize that nobody cares what they think .
And no , the 2 comments per post you get on average does n't count .
Get some real opinions , then maybe you 'll get some real feedback .
Warblogging :
The act of writing amateur , unfounded , and borderline illiterate opinions about war and war strategy .
i Pod :
This is one of those inventions that makes people say : " why did n't I think of that ? "
On news shows anyway .
One of the anchors on FOX News said " now the music industry is waiting for someone to come along and invent the next iPod . "
Wow , if only I had thought of the bright idea of putting an mp3 player on a portable hard drive .
Damn that 's brilliant .
I had that idea years ago .
I also have another idea : a car that can fly .
I will sue anyone who makes it .
i Podder : A pompous ass who thinks he 's eclectic .
Wake up asshole : you 're not living in an iPod commercial .
You can't dance .
Everything you listen to sucks .
Get a job .
e -nable : E-nable ?
How about I e-nable my foot to your mouth ?
URL ( as pronounced " ERL " ) :
Few things invoke more contempt for humanity than someone who pronounces URL as " erl . "
It 's an acronym , not a word you douche !
Between people who say " erl " and programmers who pronounce char ( an abbreviation for character ) as " ch�r " ( with the " ch " pronounced like in " chart " ) , I get so pissed that I just want to saw my arms off .
The suffix " pundit : " Stupid .
The prefix " pundit : " Stupid .
Liberal media :
Whiny , bitching , cry -baby conservatives love to prattle on and on about the " liberal media . "
To be fair , except for FOX News ( Bill O'Reilly , Sean Hannity , John Gibson , Neil Cavuto , Steve Doocy , E.D. Hill , Brian Kilmeade , Brit Hume ) , Clear Channel , Laura Ingraham , Dr. Laura , Rush Limbaugh , Hugh Hewitt , Ann Coulter , Newsmax , G. Gordon Liddy , Michael Reagan , Michael Savage , The New York Post , Sinclair Broadcast Group ( WLOS13 , Fox 45 , WTTO21 , WB49 , KGAN , WICD , WICS , WCHS , WVAH , WTAT , WSTR , WSYX , WTTE , WKEF , WRGT , KDSM , WSMH , WXLV , WURN , KVWB , KFBT , WDKY , WMSN , WVTV , WEAR , WZTV , KOTH , WYZZ , WPGH , WGME , WLFL , WRLH , WUHF , KABB , WGGB , WSYT , WTTA ) , David Horowitz , Rupert Murdoch , PAX , and MSNBC's Joe Scarborough , they 're right .
The suffix " gate " : Watergate , Filegate , Rathergate , eat shit already .
Xanga :
The bottom of the barrel of blogs .
It 's incredible that the user base is able to write so much , yet say so little .
I have to give a bit of kudos though , considering the fact that many of the users have the reading comprehension of a bowl full of pubes .
LiveJournal :
Here 's a little trick you can use to find out whether a link someone sends you is worth checking .
If it contains the words " live , journal , " or any combination thereof , you can safely ignore the link without missing out on anything .
Content Management System : A pretentious way of saying " text editor . "
The acronym CMS : Man , it 's like you guys create these words , then you turn them into acronyms to make this shit even cornier .
Killer App :
I can't stand this phrase , mostly because it 's applied so loosely .
App is short for " application , " but that does n't stop people from using it every chance they get : " the fast food industry needs a killer app . "
What ?
What does that even mean ?
An application ?
Webmistress :
You 're not a webmistress , shut up .
It 's a word used by uppity women who , in spite of a woman 's inherent flaws , has been able to land a job as a webmaster .
Then they have to go and piss all over years of civil rights they 've wrestled away by calling themselves " webmistresses . "
trackback :
It 's snob for " referrer . "
travelblog : Guess .
Emo :
An abbreviation for loser .
Emo is the new goth , except goths are still around , so it 's becoming almost unbearable .
Metrosexual : A gay guy still in the closet .
This word is so contemptible that even the man who coined it has since apologized for being such a douche .
I cringe every time I hear this word .
Retrosexual :
This word would n't exist if " metro " did n't happen to rhyme with " retro . "
It 's supposed to mean the opposite of a " metrosexual , " which makes it another superfluous word since we already have a word for the opposite of a metrosexual called " straight . "
Friendblog :
None are known to exist since bloggers do n't have friends .
Watchblog : Let 's not .
Videoblog :
Another idiot who had the bright idea of coining a term for posting a file online , except instead of music , it 's crappy home videos .
Vlog :
I do n't even know if this is being used yet , but I suspect it will be used soon if it has n't , so preemptive strike , bitches .
Vog : I
Vloggers : CAN'T
Vlogging : GO
Vlogged : ON
Moblog : ANYMORE .
In observation of all these shitty phrases and acronyms , I 've decided to coin another phrase that can be used for " blog " called : comment - log or CLOG for short .
What users do is labor over documenting their inconsequential lives , trivializing man 's greatest invention , the microprocessor , until the Internet is so CLOGGED that commerce comes to a screeching halt .
Anyone contributing to the congestion would be known as a CLOGGER .
I hate blogs .
3,688,068 smarmy assholes coin new phrases to be more annoying .

One of the few positive developments from the housing bubble is that many mainstream economists have recognized the pernicious role played by the Federal Reserve .
Indeed , some analysts on CNBC have discussed the outright abolition of the Fed .
The case against the Fed is straightforward :
In an attempt to jumpstart the economy out of recession , Greenspan slashed the federal funds target from 6.5 % in January 2001 down to a ridiculous 1 % by June 2003 .
After holding rates at 1 % for a year , the Fed then steadily ratcheted them back up to 5.25 % by June 2006 .
The connection between these moves by the central bank , versus the pumping up and popping of the housing bubble , seemed to be more than just a coincidence .
On the contrary , it looked like a classic example of the Misesian theory of the business cycle , in which artificially low interest rates lead to malinvestments , which then require a recession to correct .
Ironically , just as many mainstream analysts are seeing the wisdom of the Austrian view , two prominent libertarian economists , Jeffrey Rogers Hummel and David Henderson , have claimed the opposite .
Hummel and Henderson ( H&H ) argue that despite its bad press as of late , the Fed really is n't to blame for the housing mess .
Coming from other writers , one might suspect political motives for such views .
Yet H&H are certainly no tools of the powers that be .
We have here a purely academic disagreement , but even so I hope to show that H& H 's position falls apart under scrutiny .
Real Versus Nominal Interest Rates
One of H&H 's arguments to defend the Fed is that the low interest rates in the early 2000s were n't really that low after all , once we adjust for inflation .
In their words ,
Why do people judge the Federal Reserve , whether under Alan Greenspan or Ben Bernanke , to be a major cause of the subprime bust ?
They note how low interest rates were from 2002 through 2004 and make the classic mistake of using interest rates to judge monetary policy .
If interest rates are low , they reason , monetary policy must have been excessively expansionary .
Years ago , Milton Friedman pointed out one problem with this reasoning by emphasizing the distinction between nominal and real rates .
Nominal rates can be low because expected inflation is low , an indicator of tight monetary policy .
Although the general point is correct , it still does n't exonerate Greenspan 's Fed .
As Figure 1 below indicates , even if we adjust the federal funds rate for the ( forward - looking ) actual annual rates of price inflation that occurred , rates were still remarkably low .
One has to go back to the 1970s to see an " easier " monetary policy .
Growth in Money Supply
As the excerpt above alluded to , H&H think that interest rates are a poor gauge of Fed policy .
Much better indicators , in their view , are the growth rates of various monetary aggregates :
The better way to judge monetary policy is by the monetary measures : MZM , M2 , M1 and the monetary base .
Since 2001 , the annual year - to - year growth rate of MZM fell from over 20 % to nearly 0 % by 2006 .
During that time , M2 growth fell from over 10 % to around 2 % , and M1 growth fell from over 10 % to negative rates .
The Fed most directly controls the monetary base .
Its year - to - year annual growth rate since 2001 fell from 10 % to below 5 % in 2006 and now is 2 % .
Also , nearly all of the growth of the monetary base went into currency , much of which is held abroad .
Now something is a bit suspicious in the above figures .
Few doubt that the Fed had been fairly moderate by 2006 in its handling of affairs ; after all , the housing bubble popped .
So the statistics given by H&H really do n't help us to evaluate whether the housing boom can be blamed on the Fed .
We get a much better idea by looking at the plots of the growth rates over time .
Figure 2 below contrasts the federal funds target rate with the annual growth rate in the monetary base ( i.e. , total bank reserves plus currency ) .
Figure 2 seems to be the textbook illustration of how the Federal Reserve conducts its open market operations :
When it cuts the federal funds target rate , it pumps reserves into the system , i.e. , expands the monetary base .
On the other hand , when the Fed raises interest rates , it slows the rate of monetary expansion .
Except for the large blips due to the Y2 K scare — when the Fed flooded the system with liquidity and then sucked it right back out — the early 2000s fit the pattern perfectly .
That is , when Greenspan cut the target rate from January 2001 through June 2003 , the monetary base grew rapidly .
Eventually the base growth came back down to moderate territory , but that was when the Fed was ratcheting up interest rates , just as we would expect .
Indeed , to see just how inflationary the Fed 's monetary policy was during the early 2000s , we can consult Figure 3 below .
This shows a longer plot , this time of annual growth rates in both the monetary base and M1 ( i.e. , currency , traveler 's checks , and checkable deposits ) .
Studying Figure 3 , it is hard to make sense of the H&H thesis .
When the Fed was ( I allege ) irresponsibly fueling the housing boom from 2000 to 2004 , both the monetary base and M1 grew at annual rates that were comparable to the experience of the 1970s .
( In addition to the Y2 K blips up and down , there was also a sharp injection and pullback due to the September 11 , 2001 attacks that make the black line bounce around . )
Unless H&H want to argue that the Fed conducted a tight policy throughout the 1970s , it seems their defense of Greenspan falls apart .
Conclusion
The Fed 's role in the housing boom and bust is a classic illustration of the Austrian business cycle theory .
Indeed , the Misesian explanation in this case is so compelling that more and more economists and financial analysts are being persuaded .
Hummel and Henderson 's attempt to argue otherwise fails .

' Bird boy ' : The Russian boy was treated like another pet by his mother
A seven - year - old boy who can only communicate by chirping after his mother raised him as a pet bird has been rescued by Russian care - workers .
Reports in Russian media claim the child , suffering from " Mowgli syndrome " , was found in a tiny two - room apartment that appeared to double as an aviary , filled with cages containing dozens of birds , bird feed and bird droppings .
Social worker Galina Volskaya , who helped rescue the " bird - boy " from his home in Kirovsky , Volgograd , told Russian newspaper Pravda that he was treated like another pet by his 31 - year - old mother .
Because she never spoke to him , Ms Volskaya explained , the boy 's only communication was with the birds he was surrounded by .
" When you start talking to him , " she said , " he chirps . "
Russian authorities say the child was not physically harmed but is suffering from " Mowgli syndrome " , named after the Jungle Book character raised by wild animals , and cannot engage in any normal human communication .
Pravda reported : " ( His mother ) had her own domestic birds and fed wild ones .
( She ) neither beat him nor left him without food .
She just never talked to him .
It was all the birds that communicated with the boy and taught him birds ' language .
" He just chirps and when realising that he is not understood , starts to wave hands in the way birds winnow wings . "
The boy is temporarily living in an asylum , but soon will be transferred to a centre of psychological care , according to reports .
His mother signed an abdication form to release him into care after he was discovered last week .
Though admittedly unusual , the case is not without precedent .
In February 2006 , social workers took three weeks to catch a four - year - old " wolf - boy " discovered living on the streets with a pack of stray dogs and cats in the Stavropol region of southern Russia .
Arthur Zverev barked and ran on all fours .
And in January 2007 , a Cambodian woman named Rochom P'ngieng was found wandering naked in the jungle , unable to speak after living among animals since she disappeared from home aged eight .
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexico , widely thought to be the birthplace of corn , said on Wednesday it will begin allowing experimental planting of genetically modified crops , despite resistance from some farmers who question their safety .

The regulations published in the official gazette are the last step needed to implement a law passed by Mexico ’s Congress in December 2004 that authorizes controlled GMO plantings .
Supporters of GMO foods , whose DNA is altered to be resistant to pests , say they are a way to boost world food supplies .
But farmers in Mexico ’s rural south , where corn has been grown for thousands of years , worry GM corn will cross-pollinate with native species and alter their genetic content .
Under the new rules , the farmers who want to plant GMO crops must register with the agriculture ministry and environmental authorities to request a permit .
GMO corn seeds will not be allowed into certain parts of the country that are determined to be “ centers of origin ” for genetically unique corn strains found only in Mexico .
Bio -tech food producer Monsanto
Co welcomed the decision in a statement , although the company noted that “ the passage of these rules does not mean that permission will automatically be granted ” to plant GMO crops .
Some farmers decried the decision .
“ This is a step in the government ’s intention to bow to pressure from Monsanto to allow the contamination of Mexico ’s native corn , ” said Victor Suarez , who leads a group of small farmers opposing GMO crops .
Corn was first planted in Mexico as some 9,000 years ago and the country is now home to more than 10,000 varieties .
The grain was adopted by Spanish conquistadors in the early 1500s and eventually spread to the rest of the world .
On Jan 1 Mexico , the United States and Canada lifted all corn tariffs under the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement .
Mexico now imports between 8 million and 9 million tonnes of U.S. yellow corn a year , close to 35 percent of local consumption .
More than 70 percent of U.S. corn is genetically modified .
With U.S. corn prices hitting record highs near $ 6 a bushel on increased demand for corn - based ethanol , corn farmers in the north say GMOs will help Mexicans cut down on expensive U.S. imports by producing more at home .

Thousands of guests have welcomed Pope Benedict XVI to the White House for his meeting with President George W Bush .
The Pope was greeted with a singing of Happy Birthday on the day he turned 81 .
Mr Bush said the Pope 's message that " God is love " was needed to " save man from falling prey to the teaching of fanaticism and terrorism " .
Pope Benedict said he had come as a friend of the US and urged Americans to use their faith to inspire " reasoned , responsible and respectful dialogue " .
I am confident that the American people will find in their religious beliefs a precious source of insight and an inspiration

This was the first visit by a pope to the White House in almost 30 years .
There were huge cheers as the Pope and Mr Bush took the podium for the national anthems of the Holy See and the US .
The Pope was treated to two Happy Birthdays , the first an impromptu rendition before a more formal chorus later .
Famed soprano Kathleen Battle also sang The Lord 's Prayer .
Mr Bush quoted St Augustine in greeting the Pope with the words " peace be with you " .

He added : " In a world where some evoke the name of God to justify acts of terror and murder and hate , we need your message that God is love . "
Such a message would " save man from falling prey to the teaching of fanaticism and terrorism , " he said .
The Pope responded by saying he came as " a friend of the US " .
He praised Americans for their " concern for the greater human family " and hoped this would " continue to find expression in support for the patient efforts of international diplomacy to resolve conflicts " .

Rome correspondent David Willey , who is travelling with the pontiff , said Pope Benedict studiously avoided any direct reference to the war in Iraq or to the current campaign to elect a successor to President Bush .
He did however , our correspondent says , make an oblique reference to the tragic sacrifice of human lives caused by past conflicts and by implication , as a result of the current war in Iraq .
Abuse cases
The topic was discussed in the private talks , the White House said , with the leaders expressing concern about the plight of Iraq 's Christian minority .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The head of the Catholic Church should be welcomed , but he needs to address some of the skeletons in the cupboard before preaching to others David , Leicester A joint statement said they both hoped for a " prompt and comprehensive solution to the crises " inflicting the Middle East .
One key issue the Pope said he would raise was immigration , as he feared the danger of family break - ups caused by mass migration of mainly Catholic people from Latin America .
The statement said the leaders considered " the need for a coordinated policy regarding immigration , especially their humane treatment and the wellbeing of their families " .
" They further touched on the need to confront terrorism with appropriate means that respect the human person and his or her rights , " the statement said .

There was no reference in the statement to any discussion of the scandal that has cost the US Catholic Church $ 2bn ( £ 1 bn ) in settling clergy sexual abuse cases .
The pontiff then left the White House for a short parade in his Popemobile .
The White House will hold a gala birthday dinner on Wednesday evening but the Pope will not be there - he will attend a prayer service in Washington instead .
The Pope will celebrate a Mass for 48,000 people in Washington on Thursday and another later at Yankee Stadium in New York .
He will also address the UN General Assembly .
On Sunday he will visit the site of the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York .

What are these ?
New University of Michigan psychology research suggests that the sex hormone estrogen may be for women what testosterone is for men :
The fuel of power .
Until recently , some researchers doubted whether women had a biologically anchored need for dominance .
" Women have long been overlooked in biological research on dominance , " said psychology researcher Steven Stanton .
" Using a male model , the small body of existing research has struggled to link testosterone to dominance motivation and behavior in women .
" However , estrogen is very behaviorally potent and is actually a close hormonal relative to testosterone .
In female mammals , estrogen has been tied to dominance , but there has been scant research examining the behavioral roles of estrogen in women . "
The study by Oliver Shultheiss , a psychology professor who directs the Human Motivation & Affective Neuroscience Lab , and Stanton , who is completing doctoral work at the lab , was recently detailed in the journal Hormones and Behavior .
Schultheiss and Stanton measured women 's power needs and then assessed salivary estrogen levels both before and after they entered a one - on - one dominance contest .
The researchers found that even before women got involved in the contest , higher power motivation was associated with higher levels of estrogen .
Winners of the contest showed even further increases in estrogen after the contest , but only if they had a strong need for power .
Notably , this increase could still be detected one day after the contest was over .
In contrast , power - motivated losers showed a post - contest decrease in estrogen .
These effects were not observed among women who did not possess a strong need for power .
" Our findings perfectly parallel what we have observed for power motivation and testosterone in men , " Schultheiss said .
" In men , power motivation is associated with heightened levels of testosterone , particularly after a contest victory .
In women , estrogen appears to be the critical hormone for power motivation . "
It is crumbling , water - stained and written in Medieval Latin , but the Magna Carta has managed to remain relevant to the cause of human rights even today , 800 years after it was scrawled on parchment and affirmed with the sticky wax seal of the English king .
England 's " Great Charter " of 1215 was the first document to challenge the authority of the king , subjecting him to the rule of the law and protecting his people from feudal abuse .
Although most of the charter 's ideas were revised or have since been repealed , the Magna Carta 's fundamental tenets provided the outline for modern democracies .
One of its clauses , still in the English law books , has been credited as the first definition of habeas corpus – the universal right to due process .
Taking a cue from the document more than five centuries later , American revolutionaries incorporated many of the Magna Carta 's basic ideas into another important piece of parchment – the U.S. Constitution .
Robin Hood 's King John reviled by all
Feudalism was the framework by which all landowning was governed in England during medieval times .
It essentially granted the king control of all the land in his kingdom , which was worked by peasants and overseen by feudal barons .
Everyone in the hierarchy had financial and social responsibilities to the rank above them , including the barons , who reported directly to the king .
Most of England 's kings did n't exercise all of their feudal rights , such as the power to control who their tenants married .
That was n't the case , however , with King John , the ruler fictionalized as the bad guy in " Robin Hood . "
John 's abuses of the feudal system were frequent and angered the barons , who were regularly extorted of their lands and profits .
Fed up , in 1215 the barons rebelled and pressured the king into signing the Magna Carta , a list of 63 clauses drawn up to limit John 's power .
It was the first time royal authority officially became subject to the law , instead of reigning above it .
Multiple copies of the parchment were inked and sealed in 1215 , and read throughout the realm .
In 2012 , a copy of the Magna Carta created in 1297 was put into a high - tech encasement to protect it .
The case was crafted from a single block of aluminum to minimize the number of joints or spots that could cause leaks .
And in 2015 , researchers with the Magna Carta Project , tasked with studying the history of the document ahead of the 800th anniversary , reported they had found an original copy of the Magna Carta in a scrapbook of sorts in Kent , England .
The seventh surviving copy from the 13th century , the newfound Magna Carta brings the tally of the number of surviving versions from that century to 24 , the researchers said .
Early colonists sailed over with their rights
Tucked inconspicuously near the middle of the Magna Carta is what historians consider one of the document 's most enduring legacies .
Habeas corpus , or the right to due process and a trial by jury , is a universal legal concept today , but did n't exist in the law books until the barons noted in the Magna Carta that :
" No free man shall be seized or imprisoned , or stripped of his rights or possessions , or outlawed or exiled … except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land . "
Though the statement was n't a standout feature of the Magna Carta when it was first published , it was invoked over the centuries – especially during tumultuous times – to preserve civil liberties .
The English Civil War crisis of the 17th - century was one such time , and it was also during this period that many Englishmen set off for the American colonies .
By the mid 18th - century , the New World colonies were populated by a group of first - generation new Americans highly educated in English law , such as Thomas Jefferson and John Adams .
At the end of the Revolutionary War , when it was time to draft a constitution for the new United States of America , those men included the best of the English rights they 'd been taught , adapted to the circumstances of the monarch - free land .
Still of great significance today , the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution reads almost identically to that statute , written 575 years earlier .

I 'm sure many of you have had or are currently working in a tech support position .
Consider yourself fortunate if you 've never had experiences like these .
Duly Noted from Ed
Back in the early ‘ 90s , I worked as a tech / salesguy at a local computer shop in London .
In those days , Atari ST ’s , Amigas , and Amstrad PCWs were all the rage , and we sold all sorts of software over the counter and through mail order .
One of the more popular applications was the Mini-Office Professional .
It was easy to use and relatively inexpensive .
One day , one of our frequent customers – a very nice , little old lady – called up , complaining about some issues with the application on her Amstrad PC 1640 .
After a pleasant couple of minutes , I deduced that there was a sector fault on the second 5 1/4 " disk .
The old dear was more than happy to send the offending disks back to me for replacement , and I asked her to include a small note so that I ’d remember what the issue was .
A few days later , a Jiffy bag ( ED : translation “ padded envelope ” ) duly arrived at the shop with a large , red “ FRAGILE ” stamp on the front .
Enclosed were two pieces of thick cardboard to hold the offending 5 1/4 " disk , a long , handwritten note with the most beautiful penmanship I ’ve ever seen that detailed the exact error message she ’d encountered — all neatly stapled to the disk .
Not Too Bright from Tony
In the early 1980s , I was working on the helpdesk at a computer center in the north - west of England .
Our system was an ICL 2988 with ( for then ) a massive memory of 32 M ( and a huge 42G of disc - store which filled a very large hall ) , which users interacted with using dumb terminals .
As you can imagine in those days , what showed on terminals was pretty basic — little more than labels for fields where data could be typed and the input fields themselves .
The labels ( known as " protected fields " were differentiated on - screen by being half - intensity .
One day , I received a call from one of the application - support engineers .
" I know this will sound stupid , but all of the protected fields have disappeared from my terminal . "
I thought about his problem for the best part of a micro-second and replied : " On the right - hand side of your terminal , you 'll find a little knob marked ' brightness . '
Can you just try turning that up a little bit ? "
" Oh , yeah — that fixed it .
Thanks ! "
I 'd be lying if I said I did n't give him a hard time about it afterwards .
Denied Wireless Access from Muki
A coworker of mine named " Jim " got a call from his manager , " Susan . "
She was in a panic because her inventory management software was n't working .
Not a good thing to happen to the Inventory Manager .
Moreover , the software was the only software installed on the system , so Jim feared that it was a total system crash .
Upon arriving to Susan 's office , Jim was pleasantly surprised to see a blank monitor — the computer was probably just turned off or there was a loose cable or something .
Upon almost no further investigation , Jim found the source of the problem .
The laptop dock had no laptop in it .
" Susan , where is your laptop , " Jim asked .
" At home , " she replied .
Jim was n't quite sure how to take that and thought for a few seconds about how to proceed without sounding insulting .
" This workstation wo n't work without the computer plugged in . "
Without hesitation , Susan insisted " But it 's wireless ! "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A gas tax holiday proposed by U.S. presidential hopefuls John McCain and Hillary Clinton is viewed as a bad idea by many economists and has drawn unexpected support for Clinton rival Barack Obama , who also is opposed .
“ Score one for Obama , ” wrote Greg Mankiw , a former chairman of President George W. Bush ’s Council of Economic Advisers .
“ In light of the side effects associated with driving ... gasoline taxes should be higher than they are , not lower . ”
Republican McCain and Democrat Clinton , who is battling Obama for their party ’s nomination , both want to suspend the 18.4 - cents - per - gallon federal gas tax during the peak summer driving months to ease the pain of soaring gas prices .
The tax is used to fund the Highway Trust Fund that builds and maintains roads and bridges .
Economists said that since refineries cannot increase their supply of gasoline in the space of a few summer months , lower prices will just boost demand and the benefits will flow to oil companies , not consumers .
“ You are just going to push up the price of gas by almost the size of the tax cut , ” said Eric Toder , a senior fellow at the Urban - Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington .
Obama criticized the plan as pure politics and said the only way to lower the price of gas is to use less oil .
“ It would last for three months and it would save you on average half a tank of gas , $ 25 to $ 30 .
That ’s what Senator Clinton and Senator McCain are proposing to deal with the gas crisis , ” he said on Tuesday in Winston - Salem , North Carolina .
“ This is n’t an idea designed to get you through the summer , it ’s an idea designed to get them through an election . ”
This stance has prompted Clinton to accuse him of being out of touch with ordinary Americans as she campaigns ahead of key presidential nomination contests in North Carolina and Indiana on May 6 .
CLINTON AT THE PUMP
The New York senator was commuting to work in South Bend , Indiana , on Wednesday and planned to pump gas at a gas station to draw attention to her plan to suspend the gas tax on consumers and businesses .
“ We will pay for it by imposing a windfall profits tax on the big oil companies , ” she said on Tuesday .
“ They sure can afford it .
This is a big difference in this race .
My opponent opposes giving consumers a break from the gas tax but I believe the American people are being squeezed pretty hard . ”
The cost of a gallon of gasoline has touched $ 4 in some parts of the country as oil prices nudge toward a record $ 120 per barrel , hammering drivers at a time when higher food prices and falling home values are already crimping U.S. consumers .

Many economists implicitly agreed with Obama and said the McCain - Clinton gas tax plan sent the wrong signal on energy efficiency and was at odds with their pledges to combat climate change by encouraging lower U.S. carbon emissions .
“ I think it is a very bad idea , ” said Gilbert Metclaf , a economics professor at Tufts University currently working with the National Bureau of Economic Research .
“ If we want people to invest in energy - saving cars , we need some assurance that the higher price paid for these cars is going to pay off through fuel savings , ” he said .
“ It is a very short - sighted , counterproductive proposal . ”
Economists also saw it is a poor way of getting money to the households that need it most and warned that it might end up in the cash tills of the oil companies .
“ If you want to provide households tax relief , a direct rebate ... is more effective .
Not all of the tax relief from a gas tax holiday will be passed on to consumers .
Some will likely be kept by refiners , ” Mankiw said in an e-mail response .
New York Times columnist Paul Krugman was similarly underwhelmed : “ It ’s Econ 101 : the tax cut really goes to the oil companies , ” he wrote on his blog on Tuesday .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to put an exclamation point on its string of interest - rate cuts with a small reduction this week and may signal that its rate - cutting cycle is done for now .

Rising global inflation and the Fed ’s hope that a blend of monetary and fiscal stimulus will shore up the anemic U.S. economy suggest the central bank is ready to pause in the sharp easing cycle it kicked off in mid-September .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues have lowered benchmark overnight lending rates 3 full percentage points to 2.25 percent over that span .
Policy - makers meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday look set to lower them by a slim quarter point and then step aside to see whether their handiwork has the desired effect in spurring an economy socked by a housing slump and credit market disarray .
While officials still worry about downside risks for the economy , which they think may be facing recession , they also are concerned forecasts for an ebbing in inflation may prove off track .
Soaring prices for oil and food have fed a global inflationary surge , sparking food riots in some countries .
“ The Fed ’s intention to pause its easing cycle may be part of an international effort to stabilize the falling value of the dollar , in light of the deteriorating state of world food prices , ” said Ashraf Laidi , chief foreign exchange strategist at CMC Markets US in New York .
A Reuters survey on Friday of the 20 big bond firms that deal directly with the Fed in the markets found that all of them expect a quarter - point rate cut this week .
Interest - rate futures markets are less certain .
Late on Friday , rate futures showed a 76 percent chance of a cut , but an almost one - in - four chance the Fed would hold steady .
They also suggest rates will end the year back at 2.25 percent .
The policy - setting Federal Open Market Committee will announce its decision at around 2:15 p.m. EDT on Wednesday .
THE FISHER FACTOR
The FOMC slashed rates by three - quarters of a point in March , but drew two dissents by officials concerned lower rates could exacerbate price pressures .
Wednesday ’s announcement will be pored over for hints the Fed now intends to pause .
The statement should have “ somewhat stronger language justifying concerns over inflationary pressures , inflationary expectations , and soaring food and energy prices , ” said Dan North , chief economist at Euler Hermes in Owings Mills , Maryland .

Several
Fed officials across the dove - hawk spectrum have already sharpened their rhetoric on inflation , while expressing guarded confidence the economy will have turned for the better by the second half of the year .
“ Monetary policy decisions depend critically on the outlook for the economy over the medium term , ” Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser said on April 18 .
Plosser and Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher voted against the Fed ’s big rate cut on March 18 , preferring less aggressive action .
Fisher has emerged as the FOMC ’s anti-inflation ringleader , with two dissents this year .
He has urged the Fed to lean less on rate cuts and more on measures to provide liquidity to clogged financial markets as a way of easing the credit crisis without stoking inflation .
“ It ’s really a question of , are we getting the bang for the buck ( from interest rate cuts ) .
And clearly we ’re not , ” Fisher said on Tuesday .
Indeed , some economists argue low rates have encouraged investors to bid up prices for oil and other commodities .
Crude oil prices are up about 24 percent so far this year and the Reuters - Jefferies CRB index of commodity prices .CRB is up about 17 percent .
The past few weeks have brought food riots in Africa , record prices and export restrictions for rice , and even the imposition of buying limits on staples such as rice and flour at some U.S. warehouse stores -- events that should have penetrated the Fed ’s psyche .
“ In a more normal economic downturn , another large Fed rate cut would be a given .
But the huge upswing in global commodity prices complicates matters , ” said Rory Robertson , interest rate strategist at Macquarie Bank in Sydney .
U.S. economic data has been generally weak since the Fed ’s March 18 policy meeting , with reports showing a third straight monthly drop in employment , plunging consumer confidence and soft retail spending .
The government ’s initial estimate of U.S. first quarter gross domestic product is due on Wednesday .
Analysts forecast growth at a median 0.2 percent annual pace , with estimates ranging from minus 0.8 percent to plus 1.5 percent .

FBI Director Mueller personally awards Marion ( Spike ) Bowman with a presidential citation and cash bonus of approximately 25 percent of his salary .
Bowman , head of the FBI ’s National Security Law Unit and the person who refused to seek a special warrant for a search of Zacarias Moussaoui ’s belongings before the 9/11 attacks , is among nine recipients of bureau awards for “ exceptional performance . ”
( See this ) .
The award comes shortly after a 9/11 Congressional Inquiry report saying Bowman ’s unit gave Minneapolis FBI agents “ inexcusably confused and inaccurate information ” that was “ patently false . ”
Bowman ’s unit also blocked an urgent request by FBI agents to begin searching for Khalid Almihdhar after his name was put on a watch list .
In early 2000 , the FBI acknowledged serious blunders in surveillance Bowman ’s unit conducted during sensitive terrorism and espionage investigations , including agents who illegally videotaped suspects , intercepted e-mails without court permission , and recorded the wrong phone conversations

The CIA promoted two unnamed top leaders of its unit responsible for tracking al - Qaeda in 2000 even though the unit mistakenly failed to put the two suspected terrorists on the watch list .
“ The leaders were promoted even though some people in the intelligence community and in Congress say the counterterrorism unit they ran bore some responsibility for waiting until August 2001 to put the suspect pair on the interagency watch list . ”
The head of the CIA , who has been roundly criticized for not stopping 9/11 , was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom because , according to President Bush , he : " played [ a ] pivotal role ... in great events , and [ his ] efforts have made our country more secure and advanced the cause of human liberty .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
An Air Force pilot injured when his F - 15C fighter broke apart over Missouri in November is suing Boeing , the plane manufacturer , over the accident , according to the pilot 's lawyer .
The Air Force grounded the F - 15 fleet last year after tests found problems with key strips of metal .
In the complaint , Maj .
Stephen Stilwell details how the F - 15 began " shaking violently from side to side " at 18,000 feet during a routine training mission .
He says he suffered serious and debilitating injuries to his shoulder and arm when he ejected from the plane as it disintegrated around him , with parts of the plane hitting his body .
" Stilwell has suffered disfigurement and an inability to work and perform useful and productive work activities including service as a military and civilian aircraft pilot , " according to the lawsuit .
Stilwell alleges Boeing knew or should have known the F - 15 was defective , dangerous and could result in a catastrophic in - flight breakup as manufactured .
The complaint was filed Friday in the U.S. District Court 's Eastern District of Missouri , said Morry Cole , Stilwell 's lawyer .
Boeing has not yet been served with a copy of the lawsuit and has not returned calls from CNN .
Air Force investigators said they found cracks in aircraft parts that failed and were installed without proper safety specifications .
The entire fleet of F - 15s was grounded while the planes were inspected .
Most returned to the skies , though several remained grounded with similar cracks discovered .
The planes were built by defense contractor McDonnell Douglas , which was later bought by Boeing Corp .
Cole said he would not answer any specifics about the lawsuit until they were brought up in court .

YOU may well be asking yourself , as I have asked myself , how on earth did the credit crisis on Wall Street become such a catastrophe ?
How did all of the mechanisms operated by the mind - bogglingly well - paid men and women of the Street go so wrong that we saw a major investment bank , Bear Stearns , essentially disappear ?
How did Wall Street firms of ancient lineage take such immense losses that they made banks clam up on lending  at great risk to the economy ?
Were n’t fail - safe devices in place to guard against risk ?
Were n’t government watchdogs there to make sure that catastrophes could not happen ?
Were n’t ratings agencies on the job to police what was going on in the canyons of Lower Manhattan ?

When Sony ’s PlayStation 3 came out last year , purists demanded  and did not receive  game controllers with vibrational feedback like those for the PS2 and the Xbox 360 .
This great wrong has been righted , however , with the Nyko 83009 Zero Wireless gamepad .
This industrial - looking unit , which buzzes in the player ’s hand , replaces the standard - issue PS3 joysticks .
It includes Sony ’s Sixaxis technology for three - dimensional movement as well as vibration feedback on all games .

The $ 60 gamepad comes with rechargeable batteries and a long U.S.B. cable for charging straight from the PS3 .
It lasts 25 hours on one charge .
You can also power the Zero Wireless with two AA batteries .
Rescuers used heavy equipment to reach the child
Army engineers in northern India have rescued a two - year - old girl who spent 27 hours trapped in a deep well .
The child , named only as Vandana , was playing outside her house when she fell more than 40ft ( 12 metres ) down a man-made well in Tehra , Uttar Pradesh .
The army excavated earth parallel to the well in order to tunnel through to the child , who had been heard crying earlier in the day .
Indian TV showed live pictures of crowds celebrating at the scene .
Hundreds of locals had gathered to watch the rescue operation , with many of them performing prayers for the girl 's safety .
Precarious situation
Oxygen was pumped to the young girl during the rescue operation .
Local people have been performing prayers for the trapped girl
Army rescue experts sent down glucose , water and biscuits .
The parents of the girl were also able to communicate with her .
The rescue effort had to proceed slowly amid fears that the excavation work could cause the well to collapse .
Children in rural India frequently fall down wells that have been left carelessly uncovered .
Earlier this year , a young boy was rescued from a deep well in the southern state of Karnataka .
You need to measure a 13C - NMR for all new compounds , that ’s a golden rule .
But what do you do when you ca n’t dissolve more than , say , 5 mg , of your stuff ?
Either you ca n’t afford to dump more of it in DMSO , never to be seen again * , or it just is n’t soluble enough .
In that case you simply try anyway , run an overnight experiment on a 400 MHz machine , and hope for the best .
Sometimes it will work , sometimes it wo n’t .
What you always get is the massive solvent signal .
On the left , there are some tiny bumps in the background noise , mocking me , that might just be the beginnings of real peaks .
Of course there should be many more peaks than the three you can hardly see .
What now ?
I can hand this over to the NMR service .
The first thing they will ask is : “ Why do n’t you give us a more concentrated sample ? ”
In the past , I even had to redo a synthesis in order to get enough material for a missing carbon spec .

The suspension came amid demonstrations in Gaza and fresh clashes with Israeli troops in the West Bank .
Israeli PM
Ehud Olmert vowed to carry on the assault , which came in response to militant rocket attacks on Israel .
The violence intensified on Saturday , when nearly 70 people were killed in one of Gaza 's bloodiest days in years .
The dead included at least 13 Palestinians civilians and two Israeli soldiers .
The negotiations are suspended , because in light of the Israeli aggression such communication has no meaning

In pictures : Mid-East clashes Gazan anger and defiance
Reports say at least 100 people will be allowed in .
The fighting has drawn international calls for restraint , with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the US urging both sides to halt the violence .
But Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said his country needed to prepare for an escalation of its air and ground operations in Gaza .
' Pointless ' talks
Rocket attacks on Israel have continued despite the assault on Gaza .
Uri Bar Lev , police chief in southern Israel , told the BBC that the border town of Sderot had been targeted by 15 rockets on Sunday .
Palestinian rockets have reached as far as the Israeli town Ashkelon , 16 km ( 10 miles ) from the Gaza Strip .
Mr Abbas ' spokesman , Nabil Abu Rudeina , blamed Israel for the suspension of talks on all levels .
" In light of the Israeli aggression such communication has no meaning , " he said .
A spokesman for Israel 's Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , Arye Mekel , told Reuters news agency the Palestinian decision was a mistake , and expressed hope that negotiations would resume .
Mr Abbas restarted the talks after a conference in November in the US city of Annapolis .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is due to visit the region in a few days .
West Bank clashes
Fighting continued in the Gaza Strip on Sunday , with Israeli troops operating in the northern town of Jabaliya for a second day and planes carrying out more raids in the area .
Early in the day , the offices of Ismail Haniya , a senior Hamas leader in Gaza City , were destroyed in an air attack .
A total of 10 Palestinians are reported to have been killed in Sunday 's violence .
Officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross described the health situation as " extremely fragile " .
They say hospitals , particularly in northern Gaza , are under immense strain , and surgeons have been working around the clock .
There have also been clashes in the West Bank .
A Palestinian teenager was killed in Hebron as troops responded to stone - throwing youths with rubber bullets and tear gas .
Other protests were held in Nablus , Ramallah and Bethlehem , AFP news agency reported .
DENVER 
A plan to use only paper ballots in Colorado in this November ’s election , which was announced with bipartisan hoopla in January to replace the state ’s troubled electronic voting machine system , died quietly in a state legislature committee room on Thursday .
Opponents of the plan said it was no longer needed , because what was broken then is now fixed .
But supporters said that questions of reliability and security of the electronic voting and vote - counting machines remained unresolved , and could yet resurface before November .
The debate exploded in December , when Colorado ’s secretary of state , Mike Coffman , a Republican , announced that voting machines used all over the state , including in many of the most populous counties , had failed tests by his office .
The proposed solution of using paper ballots faced immediate and stiff opposition from county clerks , who administer the elections and who said the logistics of a one - year transformation were insurmountable .
Iraq has abundant oil reserves
Iraq has named 35 foreign energy firms who are entitled to apply for contracts to develop the country 's potentially lucrative oil and gas industries .
BP , Shell , ExxonMobil , Total , Petronas and China 's CNOOC are among those firms seeking deals to extract and pump oil .
Oil sales account for nearly 85 % of Iraq 's total revenue , but its infrastructure has been damaged by years of sanctions , war and violence .
Daily oil output is now at a four - year high of about 2.3 million barrels .
Improved security in central Iraq has boosted production levels in recent months , although pipelines and oil refineries are still subject to regular attacks .
The US official charged with monitoring how funds are spent in the reconstruction effort in Iraq said in January that the country could reap an extra $ 15 bn from oil sales if it received more investment and clamped down on corruption .
Of the 120 companies which initially expressed interest in the licensing auction , Iraq 's oil ministry has shortlisted 35 businesses .
Other prominent firms to make it onto the list include Russia 's Lukoil and Norway 's Statoil .
Attempts to create a legal framework for how Iraq 's oil wealth should be distributed among its different ethnic groups have been beset by problems .
Companies already doing business in the autonomous Kurdish region of Northern Iraq are effectively barred from the auction .

Wall Street Journal reports that Mazda decided to destroy " approximately $ 100 million worth of factory - new automobiles " that had been shipped on a tanker that tilted on route to the US .
The freighter , the Cougar Ace , spent weeks bobbing on the high seas , listing at a severe 60 - degree angle , before finally being righted .
The mishap created a dilemma :
What to do with the cars ?
They had remained safely strapped down throughout the ordeal — but no one knew for sure what damage , if any , might be caused by dangling cars at such a steep angle for so long .
Might corrosive fluids seep into chambers where they do n't belong ?
Was the Cougar Ace now full of lemons ?
BAREFOOT labourers , skinny housewives and half - naked , snuffling toddlers wait outside a corrugated - iron and plywood shack in a Delhi slum to see “ the Bengali doctor ” .
Noor Muhammed , the nattily dressed 30 - something inside , is indeed Bengali , but , as he cheerfully admits , not a doctor .
Yet as he makes quick temperature and blood - pressure checks and hands out tablets — many of them antibiotics — his patients nod respectfully , and pay .
Last month the discovery that an unqualified “ doctor ” , Amit Kumar , had run a lucrative organ racket for nearly a decade caused a furore in India .
Operating from Gurgaon , a booming Delhi satellite , Mr Kumar is accused of having paid or forced hundreds of poor people to provide wealthy clients with kidneys .
Organ - trading has been illegal since 1994 .
But India has done little to curb its “ quacks ” , as medical impostors are known .
India has more fake than genuine doctors , according to K.K. Kohli , who chairs the anti-quackery committee of the Delhi Medical Council .
In Delhi alone there are around 40,000 .
In the teeming slums where up to a third of the capital 's population of 14 m live , requests for directions to a doctor will lead to one of many dingy clinic - shacks , where a man who looks more prosperous than his neighbours plies his trade with a stethoscope , a thermometer and a big pile of pills .
“ They take acute patients and make them chronic , ” says Dr Kohli , citing quacks who misdiagnose , prescribe steroids as pick - me-ups , mix their own remedies and buy cheap , out - of - date antibiotics .
Their most common error is prescribing and selling antibiotics unnecessarily .
Sandeep Guleria , a professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences ( AIIMS ) in Delhi , says quacks have helped cause the high levels of drug resistance in India .
Ten years ago Delhi 's state government drew up an “ Anti- Quackery Bill ” of which nothing more was heard .
But the real problem is less the quacks themselves than the health - care vacuum in which they flourish .
India 's private health business is booming , importing flashy technology to serve a growing middle class and foreign “ medical tourists ” .
But the public health system remains skeletal .
There are only 60 doctors for every 100,000 people in India , compared with 257 per 100,000 in America .
In slums , sick poor people go to quacks because government - run clinics are too far away and the queues too long .
In many rural areas , there are no clinics .
Indeed , so essential are quacks to India 's health - care system that the National AIDS Control Organisation says it is planning to include them in its AIDS - control programme , training them in basic care and counselling of people with sexually transmitted diseases .
Some quacks , of course , may be perfectly responsible .
Mr Noor , for example , swears that he refers all “ serious cases ” to government hospitals .
How he diagnoses them is not clear .
Al Qaeda 's No. 2 leader Ayman al - Zawahiri said reprisals were possible in Denmark , Japan , Norway , and Sweden , in an audiotape released Tuesday .
Coming in the wake of messages from Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in March , the comments have raised concerns about the potential for new attacks in the West .
In some European countries , terror - threat levels have been elevated , with both Britain and Dutch leaders announcing in recent weeks that the potential for terror activity appeared to be increasing .
That was attributed to more terrorists operating in Europe and to controversial depictions of Islam in cartoons and in film .
On Tuesday , a tape release by Osama bin Laden 's top lieutenant called for strikes against the US - coalition in Iraq .
The tape , for which a full translated transcript is not available , criticized the Palestinian group Hamas over " reported readiness to consider a peace deal with Israel " and Iran 's " complicity " in the US assault on Afghanistan in 2001 , reports the Agence France - Presse .
Mr. Zawahiri also asserted that the " greed " at the root of global warming would make the world more sympathetic to Muslim " jihad " against the West .
The voice on the tape could not be confirmed , but the two - hour message was the second of two installments in which Zawahiri responded to questions taken from extremist websites , the Associated Press reports .
Responding to a question of whether the terror group had plans to attack Western countries that participated in the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq and subsequent war , al - Zawahiri said , " My answer is : Yes !
We think that any country that joined aggression on Muslims must be deterred . "
The tape follows an assessment April 13 by Britain 's home secretary , Jacqui Smith , describing the threat as " severe " and " growing , " reports the BBC .
Ms Smith said : " We now face a threat level that is severe .
It 's not getting any less , it 's actually growing ….
" There are 2,000 individuals they are monitoring .
There are 200 networks .
There are 30 active plots .
" That has increased over the past two years .
Since the beginning of 2007 , 57 people have been convicted on terrorist plots . "
Some of the elevated risk in Europe and to European forces abroad appears to stem from the lingering effects of right - wing Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders 's film that linked Islam 's holy book , the Koran , with violence .
The film , " Fitna , " was released on the Internet March 27 and received 3 million page views before the website 's host , British company LiveLeaks , shut down a link to the film , citing threats .
The video had been expected to incite the Muslim world , but its effects appeared subdued , especially compared with the violence that erupted after the publication of cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad in 2006 that Muslims considered blasphemous .
Those cartoons , first published by the Jyllands - Posten newspaper led to protests across the Muslim world , reported The Christian Science Monitor .
The protests were reignited when one cartoon was published again in 2008 and a March recording attributed to Mr. bin Laden said that Europe would suffer attacks because of the cartoons .
While much of the film 's impact appears to be taking place in Europe , where ongoing debate surround the freedom of expression , Dutch officials are taking precautions abroad .
On April 17 , reports Pakistan 's Daily Times :
The Netherlands has moved its embassy in the Pakistani capital Islamabad over security concerns following the release of an anti-Koran film by a Dutch politician .
The Danish Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that it has evacuated its staff from embassies in Algeria and Afghanistan because of threats after newspapers reprinted the cartoon depicting the Muslim prophet Muhammad , reports Associated Press .
That followed an April 20 attack on Dutch soldiers in Afghanistan , reports Reuters .
The Taliban said a deadly attack on Dutch soldiers in Afghanistan was in retaliation for an anti-Islamic film made by a politician from the Netherlands , a U.S. terrorism monitoring service said on Sunday ....
The attack was one of " a sequence of missions taking revenge for the insulting film , " the Taliban said in a message in Arabic on its website ....
Earlier this year , Dutch officials had downplayed the risks of showing the film , saying the country had been engaged in diplomacy , reports Reuters .
" I do n't think it will be risky for the military in Afghanistan , " [ Dutch Defence Minister Eimert van Middelkoop said ] .
" But we have to be alert , and we are . "
Although Dutch diplomats met with Islamic leaders in the Mideast , who have conveyed the message that the film does not represent the country , the country 's threat level , was raised , Reuters reports .
And a new report by the head of the Dutch secret service cited more " jihadist activity " in the county , reports Radio Netherlands .
" As to the question of whether it is still safe in the Netherlands , I would say I still think the Netherlands is still safe .
Having said that , I do n't mean we are n't constantly on the alert for possible developments that could possibly lead to an attack .
There has been both an increase in the actual threat and also an increase in the conceivable threat .... "
Dutch officials had anticipated an uproar once the film was released .
On the day of the release , however , one police spokesperson said the opposite was true , reported the Los Angeles Times .
" In fact , it 's quieter than usual here today .
Sort of like a holiday . "
Still , as Egyptian film critic Samir Farid told the Al - Ahram Weekly , the film highlights the polarized debate in both the Western and Muslim worlds .
Mr. Farid sees hope in those who " are beginning to find the blizzard of European anti-Muslim artistic expression tiresome . "
" Freedom of expression and secularism were once the hallmark of our own cultural heritage , " Samir Farid , one of Egypt 's leading film critics , told Al - Ahram Weekly .
" In 1935 an Egyptian writer , Ismail Adham , published a book entitled Why I am an Apostate .
Nobody called for his trial , let alone his death .
Nobody called him an infidel .
That was freedom of expression . "
Farid laments the way in which , over recent decades , Muslim societies have become prey to the dictates of self - styled religious authorities who are seeking power .
" When Westerners watch televised interviews with Osama bin Laden and Ayman El - Zawahri in which they celebrate the attacks of 11 September it should come as no surprise that some of them will go on to produce films , plays and books depicting Islam as a religion that glorifies violence ....
" There is a schism over freedom of speech .
There is the question of the politics of morality , or the lack of it . "
Prior to the film 's release , the German online newsmagazine Sign and Sight said Mr. Wilders seemed to have created in an ideal situation for himself – and a double bind for the Dutch government .
Wilders would consider the banning of his film by the Dutch government proof that the Netherlands is giving in to Islam .
If the film does air and riots break out , this will prove Wilders ' position that Islam is an intolerant religion .
While Europe continues to debate the freedom of expression , the European Union has also taken steps to strengthen its anti-terror rules , making it easier for police to shut down websites that incite violence or recruit for attacks , reports the International Herald Tribune .
Still , the EU policing agency :
" Europol said this month that the number of arrests connected with terrorism doubled in the EU in 2007 from the previous year .
The overwhelming majority of attacks carried out within the bloc , it said , were linked to separatist movements , rather than militant Islam . "
San Diego GOP chairman co-founded international piracy ring Miriam Raftery

Any job applicant knows that background checks are routine  especially for jobs involving authority or oversight of money .
So why didnt the San Diego Republican Party do a simple Google search before naming Tony Krvaric as its chairman ?
Online research reveals that Krvaric is the co-founder of Fairlight , a band of software crackers which later evolved into an international video and software piracy group that law enforcement authorities say is among the worlds largest such crime rings .
After co-founding Fairlight in Sweden , Krvaric established U.S. operations for the organization , including an arm headquartered in Southern Californiaa major center for the computer and video game industry .
Krvaric has also been appointed by California Republican Party Chairman Ron Nehring to head up the state partys budget committee .
RAW STORY 's investigation reveals the California GOP has put an alleged pirate in charge of its treasure trove .
An e-mail sent anonymously this week to a conservative listserv operator in San Diego County revealed an attached document titled  The Secret Life of Tony Krvaric . 
The attachment alleged that Krvaric , using the alias  Strider ,  founded Fairlight to illegally crack and distribute copyrighted software .
Fairlight evolved from an adolescent obsession into a full fledged multinational criminal enterprise ,  the e-mail claimed .
These allegations come as no surprise to RAW STORY , which has been researching Krvarics ties to Fairlight for some time .
Krvaric , alias Strider Currently a financial consultant and licensed securities broker , Tony Krvaric was born in Sweden in 1971 to a family of Croatian immigrants .
He arrived in the United States in 1992 on an H1B visa , wanting to leave Swedish social democracy .
Krvaric had been known even in his teens as a conservative ; his motto was " Kill A Commie For Your Mommie . "
In his official Republican party biography , Krvaric claims that he was inspired by the legacy of Ronald Reagan and criticized the European system for not providing an economic climate that would encourage free enterprise and competition . 
Krvaric obtained American citizenship in 2003 and joined the Republican Party , which welcomed him as a refutation of " those claiming the GOP is non-accepting and non-inclusive of immigrants . "
He made a meteoric rise through Republican party ranks , taking the helm of San Diegos GOP just three years later .
Krvaric " credits the man he succeeds , Ron Nehring with teaching him much about the functions of the Republican Party . 
However , behind this old - fashioned success story lies another and more shadowy version of Krvaric 's life , his time spent as a video game pirate sporting the alias " Strider . "
In 1987 , Strider and two buddies , using the names " Black Shadow " and " Gollum " founded Fairlight , devoted to " cracking " the copy protection on video games for the Commodore 64 and other early systems and redistributing them to acquaintances through electronic bulletin boards .
The " warez d00dz " of that time competed at being the first to get their hands on newly released games .
Strider , who worked in a game store and would " borrow " new games to take home and crack , was one of the very best .
According to an interview that a website claims was published in Scandinavian News in the 1980s , he quickly became " one of the most famous persons in cracking - scene ever seen : STRIDER of FAIRLIGHT . "
A list of Commodore 64 games cracked by Strider is posted at a database of C - 64 computer information -- complete with his photo , recent biographical details , and first name : Tony , described as a coder , cracker , importer and organizer for Fairlight .
The listing confirms that Strider has since become a financial consultant and Republican in San Diego , married with four children .
His impressive list of accomplishments  includes cracking games ranging from PacMan to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom .
The site also lists Striders motto : " Kill a commie for your mommie . "
This pirate site lists Striders accomplishments chronologically including all the games he cracked in his formative years .
It identifies Strider as  Toni K. ( No. 1 )  residing at Hallstorpsv. 38 a - 212 32 Malmoe  Sweden .
It also lists numbers of people he apparently recruited into the cracking business .
Although game cracking was already seen by the Swedish police as illicit in the 80s , trading cracked software was not made explicitly illegal in Sweden until 1993 .
By then Kravic was in the United States , finding new entrepreneurial opportunities for Fairlight in connection with the United Software Association .
According to a website that celebrates the scene , " Strider from the Amiga Fairlight joined up with the USA guys early on and USA basically became the Fairlight PC division with it 's own identity and management staff . "
Kravirc formed Fairlight PC to specialize in games for the new PC's , but by the end of 1992 , a set of high - profile arrests for credit card fraud among his American associates apparently led Krvaric to exit the PC game business as well and into a new operation called FairLight Trading ..
According to an archived Fairlight webpage , FairLight Trading was originally incorporated in Sweden in 1990 .
" For two years prior it operated as a sole proprietorship .
As business grew , the need for incorporating was obvious .
The decision to do so was made in the summer of 1990 when funding was obtained from additional investors .
Business was mainly concentrated to computer parts such as microprocessors , simm modules and hard drives .
A completely different facet also surfaced though ; nonperishable foodstuffs .
. .
In January of 1993 , FairLight Trading , Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of California as a wholly owned subsidiary .
Soon thereafter all operations were run from our offices in San Diego . "
However , even this new enterprise was operating in a legal grey area .
According to a 1996 version of Krvaric 's webpage , " We are a trading company engaged in wholesale of various goods .
Among our current offerings are Super WildCard DX 32MBiT Super Nintento ( tm ) back - up units . "
The Super Wildcard DX was a copier for Nintendo games , put out by a Hong Kong company as a backup system , but also used for illegal copying .
That kind of circumvention device was made illegal by the Digital Millenium Copyright Act , which was already in the works by 1996 , though not passed by Congress until October 1998 .
But by the end of 1997 , Krvaric was apparently out of that business as well , and soon after obtained a Securities Broker license .
After Krvaric 's apparent departure in 1992 , FairLight PC was reconstituted by others and continued to carry on software piracy .
In 2004 , several members of the group were arrested in an international operation that involved police from eleven countries and led to 120 arrests .
Fairlight co-founder Bacchus ( Pontus Berg ) implicated Krvaric as still in charge of in charge of Fairlight PC and C64 activities in an interview published in 2004  shortly before international stings by law enforcement .
 So I 'm on my 15th year as a fairlighter and I 'm seriously considering having the Amiga logo drawn by Angeldawn tattooed on my arm .
Fairlight is now controlled by Strider , JBM and myself .
Currently active sections are the C64 demo section and the PC demo section .
The PC ISO section was put to sleep recently , but who know what the future might hold . "
Krvaric responds privately Tony Krvaric has never fully disavowed his piratical past .
Ever a buccaneer at heart , he even lists an e-mail address with his pirate nickname ( [ email protected ] ) at his business listing under Tony Krvaric with the San Diego County Businesses directory .
Krvaric provided the e-mail address [ email protected ] in his League of Women Voters information materials when he ran for the San Diego Republican Party central committee in 2006 .
Running for reelection in 2008 , Krvaric currently lists [ email protected ] with the Registrar of Voters .
Krvaric has not responded to multiple requests for comment .
But in an email message sent to fellow Republican committee members last week , leaked to RAW STORY , he admitted swapping video files but asserted that the charges were part of a " hit piece . "
" Apparently theres a hit piece floating around on me , exposing  my wild high school , teenage years where I was in a computer club where we swapped Commodore 64 games ( similar to how kids swap mp3 music files these days ) , " he wrote Monday .
" This was in the 80s , on a computer that s long since defunct ! " " 1990 [ sic ]
I graduated high school , grew up and started my own business , and then in 1992 I came to this country , continuing the same business ( selling computer and video game chips and accessories as well as some nonperishable foodstuffs , taking over my fathers business for a while after he died in 1994 ) until I left that field when the profit margins became too thin to make any money  around 1997 or so , " he added .
" That s when I became a financial consultant , which I remain to this day . "
" Im sure glad they didnt look in to my elementary school years , as theres some really embarrassing stuff that I did in 4th grade , " he continued .
" BTW , I also heard a rumor that another fellow committee member ( who shall remain unnamed ) once made a tape copy of his friends favorite vinyl record . "
" I dont know who is spreading this , " he concluded , " but just wanted to let you know whats going on out there .
Likely its someone who wants us to take our eye off the ball in 2008 , be it the democrats , labor or someone else .
Either way , were not going to let them get away with it .
Thanks for your leadership . "
After moving to San Diego , Strider was asked in an interview if he had any regrets about his hacking days .
 No ,  he replied .
Gaming is Big Business for California , nation
In his statement , Krvaric dismissed his game - swapping past as trivial .
But for the fast - growing interactive entertainment industry in California as well as national and international law enforcement authorities , copyright violations and piracy are very big concerns .
In California , the computer and video game industry is a $ 1.7 billion business , employing 40 % of the industry employment nationwide .
California has more than 190 video game facilities , employing over 9,000 people directly and 25,000 indirectly , including industry giants such as Sony in San Diego .
In 2006 , the computer and video game industry added $ 3.8 billion to the U.S. GDP , the Entertainment Software Association reports ( link ) .
Reducing software piracy could create hundreds of thousands of new jobs , billions in information technology ( IT ) spending and economic growth , and new tax revenues to support local services worldwide , according to " The Economic Benefits of Lowering PC Software Piracy , " a 2008 study commissioned by the Business Software Alliance ( BSA ) and conducted independently by International Data Corporation ( IDC ) ( pdf link ) .
In March , U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey met with software and entertainment industry executives in California , warning that huge profits generated from intellectual property crimes including piracy are fostering terrorism : " Criminal syndicates , and in some cases even terrorist groups , view IP crime as a lucrative business and see it as a low - risk way to fund other activities .
A primary goal of our IP enforcement mission is to show these criminals that they 're wrong . "
Video and computer gaming sales " definitely " contribute significantly to the economy of San Diego County , according to Wanda Meloni , president of DFC ( David F Cole Intelligence ) , a market research firm in San Diego that tracks the gaming industry .
Sony , Midway , and High Moon Studios ( owned by Vivendi , which recently merged with Activision ) all have operations here , she noted .
Asked whether piracy is a serious issue for San Diego based gaming manufactures , she replied , " Piracy is a big concern when you are talking about retail products .
All of these companies are selling their products internationally . "
The lowdown on Fairlight According to the Center for Digital Government , an international advisory group , after Krvarics reported departure from Fairlight PC , Fairlight grew to become one of the most notorious online piracy release groups in the world ,  specializing in  the illegal distribution of computer games , including PC and console games .
An article at DVD Recordable in 2004 described Fairlight as  the most sophisticated criminal syndicates on the planet , trading in a commodity worth hundreds of millions of pounds
They are part of the highly secretive ' warez scene ' - an online community of hi-tech criminals responsible for pirating 90 per cent of the world 's music , computer software and DVD movies . 
Globally , piracy is big business .
Pirated PC software approached $ 50 billion in value in 2005 , according to a study by the Business Software Alliance .
 These groups are the tip of the iceberg , if you think of software piracy as a pyramid ,  said John Wolfe , spokesperson for the Business Software Alliance .
 It s the release groups like Drink or Die , like Fairlight , whose sold purpose in life is to get hold of preferably new releases and get it out over the Internet If someone wants to join a group they may charge them money . 
Asked if he would trust his finances to an individual with an alleged background in cracking and pirating products , he replied ,  If I knew that someone was guilty of something or involved in federal crimes in the past , I clearly would be uncomfortable with that If someone has never been convicted of a crime ?
Im not sure .
In 2003 , three men pled guilty to felony conspiracy to commit copyright infringement in the U.S.  including Seth Kleinberg of Pasadena , who admitted that he was a senior member of Fairlight and Kalisto .
Using the online nickname " Basilisk , " Kleinberg supplied those groups with new software titles , assisted in the " cracking " process and served as a courier to distribute pirated products to servers around the globe .
Those busts , made under Operation Higher Education , were part of six U.S. convictions made under a global law enforcement effort known as Operation Fastlink , which has resulted in 50 convictions worldwide and 120 searches in 12 countries including Belgium , Denmark , France , Germany , Hungary , Israel , the Netherlands , Singapore , Spain , Sweden , the United States , Great Britain and Northern Ireland .

PART TWO , WHICH WILL INCLUDE REACTIONS FROM SAN DIEGO REPUBLICANS , WILL RUN WEDNESDAY
ATLANTA  Cars passing O'Terrill 's pub screech to a halt at the sight of a 300 - pound , waist - high robot marked " SECURITY " rolling through downtown long after dark .
The regulars hardly glance outside .
They 've seen bar owner Rufus Terrill 's invention on patrol before — its bright red lights and even brighter spotlight blazing , infrared video camera filming and water cannon at the ready in the spinning turret on top .
" You 're trespassing .
That 's private property , " Terrill scolds an older man through the robot 's loudspeaker .
The man is sitting at the edge of the driveway to a child care center down the street .
" Go on . "
The man 's hands go up and he shuffles into the shadows .
Almost immediately , a group of men behind him scatters too .
The Bum Bot 's reputation , it seems , has preceded it .
The electronic vigilante — on the beat since September — has enraged neighborhood activists , who have threatened protests .
Street people say it 's intimidating .
And homeless advocates question the intentions of its inventor , who uses the Bum Bot as a marketing tool and a political prop .
Terrill , a 57 - year - old ex-Marine , asserts his motives are pure :
He says more police now patrol the area at night , the park across the street feels safer and he's had no break - ins since the cube - shaped robot , which Terrill controls with a wireless remote , has roamed the area .
To Henrik Christensen , director of Georgia Tech 's Robotics and Intelligent Machines Center , the Bum Bot exploits the kind of anxiety that underlies the Terminator movies .
" We have a Hollywood picture that they 're going to run amok , kill people and do bad things .
This Bum Bot plays on that stereotype , " Christensen says .
" For the rest of us who want to use technology to assist people in their daily lives , it 's an obstacle . "
Just north of downtown Atlanta , Terrill 's bar is near luxury apartment complexes , condo towers and Terrill 's home .
But vagrants gather at a nearby homeless shelter .
Break -ins and robberies are common .
And used needles litter the grounds of the child care center , where Terrill sits on the board .
" They 're out here to get money for drugs , to get money from breaking into cars , " he says .
" These are bad guys . "
Terrill bought the bar four years ago , plowing his profit from selling an apartment complex into the smoky dive .
He named it O'Terrill 's , gave it an Irish theme and decorated it with knickknacks he and his wife , Linda , had lying around .
At first , he walked around , indoors and out , with an assault rifle on his shoulder to scare away vagrants , but police told him to put away the gun .
Then he used a spotlight .
But the bar was still being vandalized , and guns were stuck in his face several times .
His wife suggested he patrol a safer way — using a robot .
An environmental engineer by day , Terrill gathered the makings of his vigilante for three months .
A three - wheel scooter gives the Bum Bot mobility .
A home - alarm loudspeaker attached to a walkie - talkie gives it a voice .
Its head is a former home meat - smoker .
The red lights are from a 1997 Chevrolet , and it 's powered by four car batteries .
The bar now welcomes patrons with a sign that says " Home of the Bum Bot , " and Terrill has asked a regular to design a T - shirt with its image .
He says he may use it for a campaign for Atlanta mayor he plans to announce this summer .
" He 'll be my chief of staff .
He 'll be parked in front of my office , " says Terrill , who finished fifth out of five in Georgia 's 2006 Democratic primary for lieutenant governor .
The robot's shell is made of steel and plywood , covered in rubber gym mats painted black and nicked by rocks , bricks and other objects people Terrill was rousting have thrown at it .
Terrill programmed the Bum Bot 's bulky remote himself .
" It 's just like a video game , " he says .
Some nights , he even transmits the robot's video view to the bar 's 60 - inch TV so people indoors can watch .
By day , it stands at attention near a pool table .
Terrill says the Bum Bot is promoting public safety .
" There are children in our neighborhood that use that day care center , " he says .
" People are coming on private property , they 're defecating , they 're throwing crack needles , sometimes they 're throwing crack rocks . "
Some who live on the streets say Terrill 's going too far .
" This is going to intimidate a lot of people , " says Rosetta Watkins , who used to live in a nearby shelter and has worked for Terrill .
" You 're going to intimidate a lot more people than you 're going to help . "
Homeless advocates agree .
" It 's a play for public attention for Rufus .
He 's certainly got a lot of attention — but not the kind we need for housing , living wages , " says Anita Beaty , director of Metro Atlanta Task Force for the Homeless .
" This robot is n't casting attention to the deep , deep poverty in Atlanta . "
Bulky as it is , the Bum Bot is surprisingly quiet .
Terrill always stands about 10 feet behind it and follows a routine .
First he turns on the red eyes , then the spotlight .
Then he has the Bum Bot warn that it 's videotaping the scene .
Sometimes he has to call the police ; usually people move on .
" I cleared out when I saw it , " says Matthew Williams , a 23 - year - old who lives in a nearby shelter .
" People are starting to get used to it .
People leave right when they see it . "
Atlanta police spokeswoman Lisa Keyes says the department has n't received any complaints about the Bum Bot , but Terrill will risk charges if he intentionally sprays water on someone with the cannon or damages someone 's property .
Terrill says he monitors only private property and never has blasted the cannon toward anyone .
He also says he 's employed 70 people from the streets and shelters since he opened the bar and helped 18 move into other full - time gigs .
Beaty is unconvinced of his motives .
" I 'm appalled by the whole idea .
It 's a sham and a shame , " says Beaty .
" Rufus is using this for his 15 minutes . "
Christensen at Georgia
Tech is particularly concerned that the robot is a temporary — if entertaining — solution when Terrill could be helping find a permanent answer to vagrancy .
" He 's moving the problem elsewhere , " Christensen says .
" And that works for him , but it 's really not solving anything . "
Terrill , for his part , seems dedicated to resurrecting his neighborhood — his way .
Each night , he and the Bum Bot chase the same vagrants from the child care center .
And each night , the men typically return within a few hours .
" This is n't fun , " he sighs as he packs up around midnight .
" I do n't like being here every night .
I 'd be able to better run my business .
But I have to spend all my time being the sheriff . "

Exxon earns biggest quarterly profit ever
Government reports a job loss in January or View results
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Exxon Mobil made history on Friday by reporting the highest quarterly and annual profits ever for a U.S. company , boosted in large part by soaring crude prices .
Exxon , the world 's largest publicly traded oil company , said fourth - quarter net income rose 14 % to $ 11.66 billion , or $ 2.13 per share .
The company earned $ 10.25 billion , or $ 1.76 per share , in the year - ago period .
The profit topped Exxon 's previous quarterly record of $ 10.7 billion , set in the fourth quarter of 2005 , which also was an all - time high for a U.S. corporation .
" Exxon can put out some amazing numbers and this is one of those cases , " said Jason Gammel , senior analyst at Macquarie Securities in New York .
Exxon also set an annual profit record by earning $ 40.61 billion last year - or nearly $ 1,300 per second in 2007 .
That exceeded its previous record of $ 39.5 billion in 2006 .
In the fourth quarter , the company said revenue rose 29.5 % from a year ago to $ 116.64 billion .
Analysts were looking for the company to report quarterly profit of $ 10.36 billion on revenue of $ 114.9 billion , according to earnings tracker Thomson Financial .
Despite topping Wall Street 's estimates , Exxon ( XOM , Fortune 500 ) shares slipped in afternoon trading .
The company reported strong results in its worldwide exploration and production , or " upstream , " business .
Profit rose 32 % to $ 8.2 billion during the quarter , offsetting some weakness earlier in the year .
Income in Exxon 's refining , or " downstream , " business rose 15.7 % during the quarter to $ 2.27 billion .
Exxon attributed its impressive results to strong performance across its divisions , but a large part of the profit surge was underpinned by climbing oil prices .
Crude prices skyrocketed nearly 60 % last year .
The surge helped prices break through the $ 100 a barrel mark for the first time ever early last month .
Since crossing that milestone , prices have eased to around $ 90 a barrel .
Natural gas prices also jumped last year , albeit marginally .
But costs have also increased for the oil companies , which is why profits have n't risen as rapidly as crude prices .
Big oil companies that both pump oil and refine crude into gasoline have to spend more for crude but are unable to pass on all the extra cost to consumers , which eats in to gasoline profit margins .
The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline hit an all - time high of $ 3.23 in May , according to the motorist organization AAA .
The high prices were blamed on strong demand and a series of accidents that shut down refineries in the U.S.
But slack demand for gasoline in the latter half of last year kept gas prices from rising as dramatically as crude prices .
Exxon 's record results , which coincide with smaller rival Chevron 's ( CVX , Fortune 500 ) profit jump , drew some fire from both government officials and consumer rights groups , who have argued previously that the the oil industry is deliberately restricting supply and profiting on the back of U.S. motorists .
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. took a swipe at the two firms , calling on fellow lawmakers to break the country 's dependence on foreign oil and rollback unnecessary tax incentives for oil companies .
Judy Dugan , research director of The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights , urged Congress to initiate some oversight into unregulated energy trading markets , which have been accused of helping to drive up the price of oil .
" Exxon is happy to take advantage of these prices , " said Dugan .
But finding oil has also become more costly .
The oil boom has led to a surge in exploration and drilling activity , which has pushed up the price for skilled workers and equipment .
Furthermore , new supplies of oil are increasingly difficult to find and generally tend to be located in harder to reach - and hence more expensive - places .
The new natural gas field discovered this week by Brazil 's Petrobras lies three miles under the ocean .
ExxonMobil representatives also stressed the cyclical nature of the business and noted that growing global demand for energy will require companies to heavily invest in future growth .
The company said it estimates that global demand will grow by 30 percent by 2030 .
" The challenge for all of us in the industry is how to we meet that increased demand , " said Henry Hubble , vice president of investor relations .
Exxon and Chevron are n't the only two oil giants to report impressive earnings recently .
Conoco ( COP , Fortune 500 ) , the nation 's third - largest oil company , trounced profit estimates by nearly 25 % when it reported last week .
And Royal Dutch Shell PLC , Europe 's largest oil company , reported a 60 % increase in profits Thursday .

In 2006 , Andrew Sullivan wrote that there are many forms of belief and that fundamentalism is only one of many forms of religious belief :
The alternative to the secular - fundamentalist death spiral is something called spiritual humility and sincere religious doubt .
Fundamentalism is not the only valid form of faith , and to say it is , is the great lie of our time .
There is also the faith that is once born and never experiences a catharsis or “ born - again ” conversion .
There is the faith that treats the Bible as a moral fable as well as history and tries to live its truths in the light of contemporary knowledge , history , science and insight .
There is a faith that draws important distinctions between core beliefs and less vital ones –that picks and chooses between doctrines under the guidance of individual conscience .
There is the faith that sees the message of Jesus or Muhammad as a broad indicator of how we should treat others , of what profound holiness requires , and not as an account literally true in all respects that includes an elaborate theology that explains everything .
There is the dry Deism of many of America ’s Founding Fathers .
There is the cafeteria Christianity of , say , Thomas Jefferson , who composed a new , shortened gospel that contained only the sayings of Jesus that Jefferson inferred were the real words of the real rabbi .
There is the open - minded treatment of Scripture of today ’s Episcopalianism and the socially liberal but doctrinally wayward faith of most lay Catholics .
There is the sacramental faith that regards
God as present but ultimately unknowable , that looks into the abyss and hopes rather than sees .
And there are many , many more varieties .
Though I do n’t agree with Sullivan ’s insinuation that secularists are part of the problem , this excerpt from his article does illustrate an important point to me .
Many people would , if required to divide people into basic religious types , choose these two : Believers in “ God ” and Skeptics ( or Non-Believers in “ God ” ) .
Sullivan ’s writing reminds me that there are many types of believers , many of them hard to distinguish from certain types of Skeptics .
I am convinced that our culture war is not primarily between Believers and Skeptics , but between Fundamentalists and everyone else ( that group of “ everyone else ” is a stew of believers and skeptics ) .
Two previous posts here at DI touch on the need to carefully define what one means when it comes to designating who is religiously distinct from whom .
Consider this post regarding Einstein ’s God and this post , Yana Kanarski ’s urging that we categorize types of Believers with utmost care .
It ’s much more nuanced than the mass media proposes .
Also , keep in mind Jimmy Carter ’s definition of fundamentalism .
Measuring the welfare gain from new goods
Karen Kopecky , Jeremy Greenwood
Since 1900 , consumers have enjoyed a dramatic explosion in the number and quality of goods available .
This column discusses a simple method for quantifying welfare gains from the introduction of new goods into the economy and their subsequent quality improvements using the personal computer as an example .
New goods are constantly introduced .
Some have a major impact , others little .
Consider the recent case of the Apple iPhone .
How much has the iPhone improved your welfare ?
If you own one of these revolutionary devices , you will no doubt appreciate any number of its innovative features .
Even if you do n't own an iPhone , you might benefit from its introduction indirectly as Apple 's competitors scramble to create rival devices , yielding a wider variety of goods and additional quality improvements .
Either way , it ’s tough to measure .
Are we better off thanks to the availability of new goods ?
Yes .
People prefer more to less in both quantity and variety .
Consumers are better off when there is greater choice in both the type and quality of products available .
But while the welfare gains realised by consumers from the introduction of new goods are presumably large , they can be difficult to quantify .
First , it is hard to quantify the number of new goods entering the market .
Second , it is difficult to estimate the change in consumer welfare due to the introduction of a particular product and its subsequent improvements in quality .
1
Quantifying the gains from new goods is particularly important for issues such as constructing the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) , which aims to measure the cost of maintaining the same level of welfare over time .
Underestimating the welfare gains from the introduction of new goods biases the CPI upwards , adversely affecting policy decisions at governments and central banks .
A century of innovation
The iPhone is just one of a myriad of new goods that , thanks to technological innovation , have emerged over the past century .
Markets that have seen some of the largest increases in the number of goods include automobiles , packaged and processed food , consumer electronics , and health care .
For example , in 1908 one of the few cars available was Ford ’s Model T , sold in a single colour – black .
By the early 1970s there were 140 different vehicle models on the market in the US .
By the late 1990s , the number of models had increased to 260.2 Automobiles have benefited from vast improvements in quality .
Over time , adjustable steering columns , airbags , air conditioning , anti-lock brakes , cruise control , power locks , remote control keys , and remote controlled side view mirrors have all become standard features .
One of the most significant new goods in the twentieth century was the personal computer ( PC ) .
The first successfully mass - produced PC was the Apple II .
Released in 1977 , it consisted of a 1 megahertz microprocessor , 4 kilobytes of random - access memory ( RAM ) , no hard disk , and an audio cassette interface for program loading and data storage .
The computer retailed at approximately US $ 1,200 .
Rapid technological progress led to consistent improvement in the Apple II following its release .
For example , in 1978 the floppy disk drive peripheral , far superior to cassettes , became available .
Rapid technological progress has since fueled continual quality improvements and declining costs of production .
Today ’s computers are often equipped with multi-core processors running at over 3,000 megahertz , gigabytes of RAM , and hard drives capable of storing hundreds of gigabytes of data .
Quality improvements in computers and computer production have resulted in an enormous fall in quality - adjusted PC prices .
In fact , prices have dropped at an astounding rate of 25 % per year .
Thus , a PC today is more than 700 times less expensive than one in 1977 .
Starting from virtually zero demand for personal computers prior to 1977 , the fall in prices throughout the last thirty years has been synonymous with a rapid rise in demand , as shown in Figure 1 .
As the demand for personal computers rose , so did their share of total expenditure , climbing from zero in 1977 to more than 0.6 % in 2004 , as shown in Figure 2 .

Source : U.S. National Income and Product Accounts , Tables 2.4.4 and 2.4.5
When constructing price and quantity indices , it is vital to adjust for the improvements in product quality that have occurred over time .
When calculating the price of a computer , an economist must take into account that an amount spent today will buy much more than it would have yesteryear .
In light of this tremendous improvement in quality , economists at the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) try hard to produce price and quantity indices for an idealised standardised computer .
One way they do this is by estimating hedonic price regressions , in which the price of a computer is estimated as a function of its characteristics - say hard drive size , memory , processor speed , etc. , and time .
The coefficient on time measures the decline in the price of a standardised computer , so to speak , after controlling for characteristics .
For the period 2001 to 2005 , Wasshausen and Mouten ( 2006 , Table 3 ) report that quality adjustment accounts for 11.5 percentage points of the 16.4 % decline in the BEA 's price index for computers .
What ’s a PC worth ?
How much have consumers benefited from the invention of PCs and the fall in their quality - adjusted price since 1977 ?
One measure of a welfare gain is called the compensating variation .
The compensating variation is the amount of income a consumer would have to give up to attain the level of utility he or she would have realised if computers had never been invented or sold at some ridiculously high unaffordable price .
A growing number of studies have dealt with how to measure the welfare gain from a new good such as the PC.3
While some techniques are quite involved , Jerry Hausman ( 1999 ) proposes an easy way to estimate the welfare gain from a new product based on a linear approximation to the demand function for that good .
His formula for the welfare gain is to simply approximate the compensating variation as one half of the new good ’s share of expenditure divided by its price elasticity of demand .
When applied to PCs , this formula yields a welfare gain of 0.16 % of 2004 expenditure .
Is this number reasonable ?
Using an alternative technique , Hausman ( 1996 ) estimates the welfare gain to consumers from the introduction of Apple - Cinnamon Cheerios in 1989 , a minor product innovation , to be 0.002 % of 1992 consumption expenditure .
Could the welfare gain from PCs in 2004 be only 80 times the welfare gain from Apple - Cinnamon Cheerios in 1992 ?
The linear demand approximation may not work well for major innovations , where the first few units of a good yield a lot of extra utility .
For example , electricity was 1.5 % of personal consumption expenditure in 2001 .
If one uses Reiss and White ’s ( 2002 , p. 26 ) price elasticity of demand for electricity of 0.39 , then the welfare gain from the introduction of electricity would be about 1.9 % of personal consumption expenditure .
Electricity reached a high of 2.4 % of personal consumption expenditure in 1984.4
If one now supposes that the price elasticity of electricity is 0.15 , a very low estimate , then a very liberally computed welfare gain is about 8 percent .
5
Surely , this formula underestimates the welfare gain from the introduction of electricity .
It might be best to view it as a lower bound , as Hausman ( 1999 ) himself suggested .
Greenwood and Kopecky ( 2008 ) suggest an alternative technique that uses a simple model of consumer demand and aggregate quality - adjusted price and quantity data to calculate the welfare gain directly .
Computing the compensating variation requires defining a representative consumer ’s utility function .
Economists most commonly use isoelastic utility functions .
However , these utility functions are problematic for measuring the welfare gain from new goods .
The problems arise because computing the welfare gain requires calculating the utility of the consumer when his computer consumption is zero .
At zero consumption , the utility function returns a value of minus infinity for some parameterisations .
This is illustrated in Figure 3 .
The dashed red line is the standard utility function .
Notice that as computer consumption goes to zero the function goes to minus infinity .
In this case the welfare gain from the introduction of the new good is infinitely large .
In addition , regardless of the parameterisation , the marginal utility at zero consumption is infinite .
This is also illustrated in Figure 3 by the green dashed line .
Infinite marginal utility at zero consumption means the consumer will never choose this point regardless of the price since he will always want to consume at least a small amount of the good .
These problems can be avoided by shifting the utility function to the left , using the constant ν .
This yields a utility function similar to the solid red line and a marginal utility function similar to the solid green line in Figure 3 .
Notice that the new utility function gives finite levels for marginal and total utilities at zero consumption .
Thus , high prices may result in the consumer optimally choosing to purchase zero computers .
Greenwood and Kopecky ( 2008 ) calibrate / estimate such a utility function using quality - adjusted national income and product account data to calculate the welfare gain from the introduction of PCs .
What is your PC worth to you ?
About 4 % of your total expenditure on consumption , according to the simple approach discussed here .
That number is 25 times larger than the one found using Hausman ’s approach and 2,000 times larger than the welfare gain from Apple - Cinnamon Cheerios .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - A Japanese man was arrested for calling a food company ’s toll - free number 500 times in 16 months because he wanted to hear the woman ’s voice on the automated tape , police said on Monday .
The 38 - year - old plumber , who was arrested on Sunday , made 3,100 hours worth of free calls to the company , costing it almost 4 million yen ( 19,500 pounds ) in phone bills , a police spokesman in Takasaki , northwest of Tokyo , said .
“ He gets excited by the woman ’s voice on the guidance tape , ” the spokesman said , adding that the voice sounded normal to the detective who was involved in the investigation .
The food company asked for its name to be withheld .
The spokesman said police are investigating if the man placed an excessive number of calls to any other firms .

The cells may repair cartilage ( Copyright : Cardiff University )
Stem cells offer a potential way to repair cartilage damaged by osteoarthritis , say scientists .
They have identified a type of stem cell which can be transformed into cartilage cells known as chondrocytes .
In theory , it should be possible to create new chondrocytes in sufficient numbers to achieve a real therapeutic effect for osteoarthritis patients .
The Cardiff University work was presented to the UK National Stem Cell Network Annual Science Meeting .
If we can translate these successes from the laboratory into treating patients the possibility opens up of making a remarkable impact on this common painful and disabling condition
Professor Alan Silman
Arthritis Research Campaign Osteoarthritis , which affects more than two million people in the UK , occurs when changes in the make - up of the body 's cartilage causes joints to fail to work properly .
At its worse it can bring about the break - up of cartilage , causing the ends of the bones in the joint to rub against each other .
This results in severe pain and deformation of the joint .
One current treatment for younger patients is to harvest cartilage cells from neighbouring healthy cartilage and transplant them into the damaged area .
Unfortunately , only a limited number of cells can be generated .
Immature stem cells have the ability to become any tissue in the body .
However , the cell identified by the Cardiff team is at a more advanced stage , where it has lost some of its plasticity but not its ability to become a chondrocyte if cultured in the lab in the right way .
Real benefits Lead researcher Professor Charlie Archer said : " We have identified a cell which , when grown in the lab , can produce enough of a person 's own cartilage that it could be effectively transplanted .
" There are limitations in trying to transplant a patient 's existing cartilage cells but , by culturing it from a resident stem cell , we believe we can overcome this limitation .
" This research could have real benefits for arthritis sufferers and especially younger active patients with cartilage lesions that can progress to whole scale osteoarthritis . "
The Cardiff team have now started animal tests , and hope to launch a clinical trial next year .
Professor Alan Silman , medical director of the Arthritis Research Campaign , which part - funded the study , said : " How to stop or even reverse the wearing away of cartilage that is the hallmark of osteoarthritis has been a treatment goal which up to now has not proved possible .
" If we can translate these successes from the laboratory into treating patients the possibility opens up of making a remarkable impact on this common painful and disabling condition . "

The study by Centris , a market research firm in Los Angeles , found gaps in broadcast signals that may leave an estimated 5.9 million TV sets unable to receive as many channels as they did before the changeover .
It may affect even those who bought the government - approved converter boxes or a new digital TV .
To keep broadcast reception , many viewers may have to buy new outdoor antennas , the study found .
The Centris study predicts greater disruption of service than government agencies like the Federal Communications Commission have acknowledged .
The federal government estimates that 21 million American households have primary TV sets that receive only over - the - air signals .
But it says most will continue to get a digital signal by means of a digital - to - analog converter box , which costs about $ 50 to $ 70 .
It is helping to underwrite the cost of a converter box by issuing $ 40 coupons .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks jumped Tuesday , with the Dow surging 420 points , its fourth - biggest one - day point gain ever , after the Federal Reserve cut the fed funds rate by three - quarters of a percentage point , surprising investors looking for a larger cut .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) rose 420 points , its biggest one - day point gain since July 2002 , for a gain of 3.5 % .
The broader Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index added over 54 points , its biggest one - day point gain since Jan. 2001 , for a gain of 4.2 % .
The tech - fueled Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) advanced over 91 points , its biggest one - day point gain since May 2002 , for a gain of around 4.2 % .
" The market reaction was certainly positive after a little pullback , " said Matt King , chief investment officer at Bell Investment Advisors .
" It seems like they found the sweet spot with the decision today . "
The central bank cut the fed funds rate , a key short - term lending rate that impacts consumer loans , by 75 basis points , to 2.25 % , missing bets for a cut of 100 basis points .
There are 100 basis points in one percentage point .
( Full story ) .
Stocks had rallied ahead of the news as investors welcomed better - than - expected quarterly earnings from Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs .
But the market stumbled in the minutes after the 2:15 p.m. ET
Fed announcement , before recharging in the last hour of trade .
The initial setback was likely a knee - jerk reaction because people looking for a bigger cut did n't get it , said Harry Clark , CEO at Clark Capital Management .
However , after digesting it , Wall Street was perhaps realizing that 75 basis points was the right decision , Clark said , in that it suggest both that the Fed remains on top of the problems in the economy , but is not so panicked as to need to cut rates by a full percentage point .
" I think a one - point move would have been too much , even if its what the Street thought it wanted , " said Clark .
" I think it was the right thing to do . "
The Fed also cut the discount rate , which affects bank loans , by three - quarters of a percentage point , leaving it at 2.25 % , after announcing an emergency quarter - point cut to that rate this weekend .
In the statement accompanying Tuesday 's decision , Fed policy makers acknowledged the continued strain in the financial markets , the softer consumer spending environment and labor market , and also talked about higher inflationary pressure .
( Read the statement here . )
Ongoing Fed action .
The Fed has cut rates steadily since September as a means of shoring up the economy and combating a credit market crisis that has left Wall Street in its most precarious position in years .
The Fed has also injected billions into the economy .
Most recently , the bank announced over the weekend that it has created another lending facility that allows big Wall Street firms access to short - term funding .
More moves along this line are what is needed said Clark , rather than additional rate cuts .
" They 've taken some innovative measures lately , " said Wan -Chong Kung , senior fixed - income portfolio manager at First American Funds .
" They get it and they want to do what it takes to restore confidence to markets and to help the economy . "
However , she said that the stock market 's response has been skeptical in general , with any Fed - motivated gains tending to peter out after a session or two .
" Hopefully the market will look at all the things the Fed has done on a cumulative basis and acknowledge that at some point , these things will have a broad impact , " she said .
Financial earnings impress .
Lehman Brothers ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) surged 46 % after it reported lower quarterly sales and earnings that beat estimates , despite taking $ 1.8 billion in writedowns for bad mortgage bets .
Lehman also sought to reassure investors that it was not in danger of seeing a fate similar to that of Bear Stearns .
The company said it has maintained a strong liquidity position .
Lehman shares plunged Monday on worries about its solvency .
Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) managed to report another quarter of better - than - expected sales and earnings , despite the ongoing market turmoil .
Results , however , were sharply lower versus a year ago .
Shares gained 16 % .
Bear Stearns ( BSC , Fortune 500 ) added 23 % to trade at nearly $ 6 a share after tumbling 84 % Monday on news that it had sold itself to JP Morgan Chase for $ 2 a share , marking a stunning collapse for the former No. 5 Wall Street brokerage .
The stock traded at roughly $ 160 per share a year ago .
Here 's why the stock is trading so far above that $ 2 a share price .
Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) jumped nearly 18 % ahead of its quarterly earnings , due before the start of trade on Wednesday .
A slew of other financial stocks surged as well , on both the Lehman and Goldman earnings and on the Fed announcement .
Other gainers included Dow components Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , up 11 % , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , up 8 % and AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) , up nearly 10 % .
Blue chip gains were broad based , with all 30 Dow components rising , and all by at least 1 % .
In addition to the financial stocks , the Dow 's other big gainers were General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , Home Depot ( HD , Fortune 500 ) , Alcoa ( AA , Fortune 500 ) and Intel ( INTC , Fortune 500 ) .
Intel also trades on the Nasdaq and was one of many tech stocks advancing on the session .
Other big tech advancers included Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) , Cisco ( CSCO , Fortune 500 ) , Oracle ( ORCL , Fortune 500 ) , Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) , Yahoo ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) and Dell ( DELL , Fortune 500 ) .
Market breadth was positive .
On the New York Stock Exchange , winners trounced losers 7 to 1 on volume of 1.95 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , advancers topped decliners 3 to 1 on volume of 2.41 billion shares .
Economic news .
New home construction fell in February to an annual pace of just over a million properties , beating forecasts for a bigger drop .
Building permits , a measure of builder confidence , tumbled more than expected .
The Producer Price Index ( PPI ) , which measures inflation at the wholesale level , rose as expected in February .
But core PPI , which excludes volatile food and energy prices , came in higher than expected .
Other markets .
U.S. light crude oil for April delivery climbed $ 3.74 to $ 109.42 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .

The Permanent Republican Majority , Part IV : How corporate - GOP interests sought to topple Democrats in Mississippi
Since the deregulations of the Reagan era , the electoral strategy of the Republican Party and the interests of the corporate lobby have become intimately entwined .
Karl Rove  President George W. Bushs former Deputy Chief of Staff and campaign maestro  capitalized on this alliance in Texas in the early 1990's , when he made campaigning against " activist judges " a cornerstone of Republican victories .
He then applied the same technique in Alabama , where he and Republican consultant William Canary began systematically working in 1994 to elect pro-business judges .
As reported in Raw Storys The Permanent Republican Majority - Part One , Canary reemerged in 2002 as the advisor to Alabama Republican gubernatorial candidate and now governor , Bob Riley .
Canarys wife , Leura , meanwhile , used her position as the US Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama to investigate Rileys Democratic opponent , incumbent governor Don Siegelman , helping ensure his defeat and leading to his prosecution on bribery charges , conviction , and imprisonment in 2007 .
During the mid-90s , a series of state lawsuits against the tobacco industry delivered a heavy blow to American business interests in the South .
Initiated by Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore , they sought compensation for the costs of smoking - related diseases .
Other state attorneys general joined the suit , and eventually the industry was forced to settle , culminating in a Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement that exempted the tobacco companies from liability in exchange for a $ 246 billion dollar payment and other concessions  the largest settlement in US history .
Alabama , however , refused to join the lawsuits .
The decision , by the states Republican governor and then - Attorney General William Pryor , led to a political firestorm .
The conflict was a major factor in then - Democratic Lieut .
Gov. Don Siegelmans election as governor in 1998 .
Almost as soon as Siegelman took office , however , Pryor initiated a series of corruption investigations against him .
After the Bush administration took office in 2001 , these state probes were elevated to the federal level at the hands of US Attorney Leura Canary .
As reported in The Permanent Republican Majority  Part Three , Rove and Canary also helped promote the Siegelman investigations .
In neighboring Mississippi , meanwhile , the tobacco suit had produced several extremely wealthy trial lawyers , who became major funders of the local Democratic Party .
In 2003 , a Bush - appointed US Attorney , Dunnica Lampton ( above right ) , brought federal charges against one of those lawyers , plaintiffs attorney Paul Minor , alleging that he had bribed a Mississippi Supreme Court Justice , Judge Oliver E. Diaz , Jr .
Just as in the case of Governor Don Siegelman in Alabama , when the first trial of Diaz failed to produce the desired result of removing him from his elected seat in 2005 , fresh charges were brought almost immediately .
Diaz and Siegelman also shared the ire of tribal casinos .
Siegelmans attempt to introduce an Alabama state lottery to support education initiatives had ruffled the feathers of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians , who saw it as a threat to their interests , while Diaz stood against the Choctaws by ruling in favor of more regulation of tribal casinos .
Diaz himself had previously been the target of GOP - allied business interests during his 2000 election campaign , when the United States Chamber of Commerce ran issues advertising supporting his opponent .
The United States Chamber of Commerce
Despite its seemingly bipartisan name , the Chamber of Commerce has operated as a pro-Republican powerhouse since the fervently anti-regulation Thomas J. Donahue became president in 1997 .
 The chamber has become a significant force in state and national politics under Donohue 's decade of leadership ,  the LA Times  Tom Hamburger wrote this past January .
 Once a notably bipartisan trade association with a limited budget and limited influence , it has hugely increased its political fundraising and developed new ways to spend money on behalf of pro-business candidates . 
Under Donohue , the organization has frequently aligned itself with GOP priorities .
Donahue recently announced an intention to play a major role in electing pro-business candidates in 2008 , proclaiming , " We plan to build a grass - roots business organization so strong that when it bites you in the butt , you bleed . 
William Canary , the Alabama political consultant who was central to the defeat and prosecution of Governor Don Siegelman , is closely tied to Donohue and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
When Donohue was president of the American Trucking Association in the 1990s , Canary served under him as a counselor , political advisor , and eventually Senior Vice President for State , Federation and Intergovernmental Affairs .
Canary and Donohue were also friends .
According to two Alabama Republican lawyers recently interviewed by RAW STORY , it was Donohue who recommended that Canary be named president of the Business Council of Alabama , a position he assumed in March 2003 .
The Business Council is currently the Alabama affiliate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , and it has played an active role in Alabama politics since at least 1994 , when it invited Karl Rove to the state to work with Canary .
 You know it was Donohue who helped place Billy Canary at the [ Council ] , dont you ?  said one of the Alabama lawyers several weeks ago , during our second trip to Alabama .
The attorney asked to remain anonymous for fear of backlash .
A second attorney interviewed in Alabama familiar with the events also said Donohue had a hand in getting Canary the job at the Council .
The US Chamber of Commerce did not respond to repeated requests for comment .
Diaz faces pro-business challenge
Keith Starrett ran in the Mississippi Supreme Court judicial election against Oliver E. Diaz Jr in 2000 .
In the state of Mississippi judges are not allowed to run on a party ticket or represent a party .
But it was no secret that Starrett was supported by Republicans and Diaz by Democrats .
In the two weeks preceding the vote , the Chamber purchased over a million dollars of campaign ads on behalf of Starrett and three other Republican candidates .
Starrett lost the election anyway .
Starrett told RAW STORY Tuesday he had no knowledge of the Chamber running the ads .
" It was a complete surprise to me and when I found out , I asked that they be stopped , " he said .
" Oliver 's [ Diaz ] comments about Lampton and me [ to other publications ] being involved in his prosecution is a boldface lie and a pipe dream . "
Diaz did not mention Starrett as being involved in his investigation and prosecution to us .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce refused to reveal their membership list after concern over the ads surfaced .
According to Mississippi law , campaign donors must be disclosed , and strict limits are placed on the amount of total contributions an individual , group , or corporation can donate .
The state of Mississippi sued the Chamber over the pro-Starrett advertisements and won a ruling on the federal level .
The Chamber , however , had friends in high places .
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia granted an emergency appeal to vacate injunctions challenging the legality of the ads .
During that same election cycle , Dunnica Lampton ran on the Republican ticket to represent Mississippis fourth Congressional district .
He lost .
In 2001 , the Federal Election Commission fined Lamptons campaign $ 5,800 for failure to file campaign finance reports .
These fines trigged an accounting audit by the FEC , which cited Lamptons failure to disclose debts and obligations and receipt of contributions in excess of campaign limits .
Despite the FEC fines , President Bush nominated Lampton to be US Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi in September 2001 .
Lampton took office in November .
Early the following year his office began investigations into Diaz , Minor and other Mississippi judges .
A similar nomination - prosecution pattern was seen in Alabama .
As soon as Leura Canary  wife of Chamber ally Bill Canary  was appointed the US Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama , she began targeting Democratic governor Don Siegelman .
Starrett made out well after his defeat .
In 2005 , he was appointed to a federal judgeship for the Southern District of Mississippi by President Bush .
And just as in Alabama , the US Attorney in Mississippi targeted his friends Democratic opponent .
The case against Paul Minor and Oliver Diaz
Paul Minor was a prominent Mississippi trial lawyer whose firm made more than $ 70 million in the late 1990's from the state 's tobacco lawsuit settlement .
He was also a generous donor to Democratic candidates , contributing more than $ 500,000 between 1996 and 2003 .
It was partly because of the 1997 tobacco settlement that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce spent over a million dollars in 2000 to help elect pro-business judges to the Mississippi Supreme Court , in an attempt to follow the pattern set by the Republican takeover of the Alabama Supreme court led by Karl Rove and William Canary in the 1990s .
Judge Diaz managed to retain his seat despite the Chambers advertising but wound up deeply in debt .
Minor helped Diaz raise money to pay off the debts , including signing a loan guarantee .
This became the basis for the prosecution of both men on bribery charges .
In October 2002 , news of an ongoing FBI investigation of possible judicial misconduct was leaked to Mississippi newspapers just weeks before the upcoming judicial elections .
One story , which was typical of the leaked reports , stated , " Federal authorities are investigating whether state court judges took out loans that were repaid by nationally prominent trial lawyers from South Mississippi whose cases the judges handle . "
Overnight , donations by lawyers like Minor became " radioactive , " and six pro-business Republican judges were elected .
As one Mississippi attorney explained in an interview ,  In war , you first cut off the supply lines of the enemy troops . 
Minor was the supply  target because of his large donations to Democratic candidates .
Diaz was the obstacle to corporate interests seeking to reduce plaintiff cases and keep tribal casinos deregulated .
US Attorneys conflicts of interest in the Diaz case
In July 2003 , Paul Minor , Oliver Diaz , and two former judges 
Wes Teel and John Whitfield  were charged with a range of federal crimes based on Minor 's loan guarantees .
Lampton claimed during the Diaz trial that he had recused himself from the case and that it was being handled by lawyers from Washington .
He later acknowledged that he had not recused himself , although it does seem that the Washington lawyers were taking the leading role .
When Lamptons office began investigating Diaz , Lamptons own ties to Starrett should have been enough reason for the US Attorney to recuse himself .
Starrett was Diazs 2000 opponent in the judicial election , and Lampton and Starrett apparently have been friends as far back as childhood .
During Starretts investiture ceremony , Lampton discussed their long - standing friendship .
 U.S. Attorney Dunn Lampton , who has known Starrett since they played Little League baseball together , praised the new judge for his tremendous work ethic , compassion and knowledge of the law ,  the local Daily Leader wrote in 2005 .
" He will do everything he can to be fair ,  Lampton said .
 He does not have an agenda . 
In addition , a relative of Lamptons , Donna Lampton , was and continues to be the legal administrator for now federal judge Starrett .
Lampton also had an additional reason to target Diaz .
In 1998 , a case involving his Dunnicas twin brother Dudley Lampton , was reviewed by the Mississippi Appellate Court .
This three judge panel , with Diaz as one of the judges , ruled against Dudley .
Lampton was not available for comment as he is on sick leave from the US Attorney office as a result of a car accident .

Class war could replace culture war
For most of the election season , from Iowa to Pennsylvania , the American media have focused relentlessly on the politics of race , culture and gender .
Yet as we look down the next decade , these are likely to become less important issues as we enter a new era centered instead on issues related to globalization and its impact on upward mobility and economic growth .
This shift will test the adaptability of both parties and of baby - boom - dominated media more comfortable following the rhythms of identity and racial politics than focusing on economics .
Elite journalists tend to come from the best schools and affluent families , and they have been shaped , either personally or through their schooling , by the cultural and racial obsessions of the 1960s .
Unlike journalists and politicians who emerged from the Depression era , they tend to focus much less on a growing sense of economic drift that cuts across racial differences , cultural divides and generations .

The emerging new paradigm also reflects some good news .
Those who were around in 1960 may be astounded to see a bracing presidential campaign waged between a mixed - race senator and a woman long identified with liberal social causes .
And those who grew up during the Depression might also recognize the issues of class and social mobility that are now moving to the forefront .
Increasing numbers of Americans find it ever more problematic to maintain a “ middle class ” lifestyle .
The current mortgage crisis , which has eroded the value of the most valuable asset of millions of Americans , only exacerbates these concerns .
In such a situation , it ’s hard to see how micro fractures among ethnic and gender identities will continue to be the defining issues of our politics as they were during the last half of the 20th century .
For example , suburbs — once derided for their homogeneity — have become laboratories for an increasingly hybridized society .
Barely 5 percent minority in 1970 , they are nearly 27 percent so today .
Kids who grow up in these diverse suburbs and then go on to attend highly integrated colleges are showing a remarkable tendency to mix it up both culturally and personally .
These trends are being accelerated by the growing role of Asians and Latinos , who in the second generation intermarry at rates as high as one in three .
Mixed - raced couples are no longer an oddity .
Some multiracial Americans — Barack Obama , Tiger Woods and Mariah Carey come to mind — are among the country ’s most celebrated figures .
In contrast , economic issues seem certain to become more important in the next decade .
This is a matter for not only older Americans :
As the large millennial generation ages , it could well face an increasingly difficult economic climate .
In the past , a college education alone has been the sure ticket to upward mobility ; in this century , the newest research shows that it no longer guarantees any such thing .
Wages for recent college graduates , particularly males , have been dropping since 2000 , even as less - educated workers , at least in some places , have done better .
This trend may well reflect the unintended consequences of technology and globalization , as well as changed demographics .
The current high tide of college graduates , including many immigrants , has flooded the market precisely as new telecommunications technology has facilitated the shift of high - end work to distant locations .
By some estimates , outsourcing to other countries accounted for as many as 40 percent of the 900,000 technology jobs lost in the first four years of this decade .
All this makes the prospect of a post - industrial “ golden age ” — a re-creation of the prosperity , if not the mores , of 1950s America — an increasingly distant prospect , even for relatively skilled Americans .
Yet , sadly , this predicament has been only crudely addressed by the kind of boilerplate anti-NAFTA populism espoused first by Hillary Rodham Clinton and , more recently , by Obama .
What the country really needs is a strategy to expand middle - class opportunities and American competitiveness on the global stage .
This approach would require a powerful new commitment to public works — such as fixing our often dilapidated roads , bridges , transit and ports — that would employ people at decent wages and make our companies more competitive against our global rivals .
Such an approach would be a departure from both parties ’ overemphasis on boosting consumer spending and protecting asset speculators , in the form of individual investors or great financial institutions .
Instead , we need incentives that encourage productive investment , practical skills training and competitive , export - oriented industries .
These are precisely the policies that offer the best hope to assure the younger generation — both college - educated and not — a reasonable shot at a sustainable middle - class living standard .
Republicans , saddled with the unenviable legacy of George W. Bush , seem poorly positioned to adopt such a program .
During the Republican primaries , only former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee seemed willing to grapple with deepening middle class angst .
Like a traditional “ progressive , ” the Arkansan proposed a strong infrastructure investment agenda to provide good paying domestic jobs and enhance productivity .
For his trouble , the self - appointed “ movement ” conservatives lambasted Huckabee as an apostate to those who adhere to the right - wing gospel on Wall Street .
Democrats , too , may have trouble effectively addressing the new paradigm .
Despite their self - image as “ the party of the people , ” Democrats have been morphing into a more plutocratic party for almost a generation .
Democrats routinely get more votes than the GOP among the fast growing population earning over six figures annually , and their financial advantage comes largely from the business elite , particularly on Wall Street , in Silicon Valley and in Hollywood .
Once the need to pander to the middle and working classes is over in November , Democrats may have too large a stake in the economic status quo to push a strong shift toward an agenda for broad - based economic growth .
It ’s difficult , for example , to foresee that either Clinton , whose own daughter works for a hedge fund , or Obama , who raised significant money early on from the industry ’s young bulls and continues to score big among Silicon Valley ’s venture community , would rein in tax breaks for this prized constituency .
Far easier to picture is that the party will adopt the platform of its powerful and well - funded green constituency ; many of these enviros are also among the richest Americans and most generous Democratic donors .
An Al Gore - style global warming jihad would be sure to gain support from the media , the academy , Silicon Valley , Hollywood and even Wall Street .
But it might not be so popular among American manufacturers and workers forced to compete against largely unregulated competitors in Brazil , China , Russia and India .
Finally , and arguably with the most difficulty , Democrats will have to confront their constituency among public employee unions .
A large - scale infrastructure and energy development program will require a significant rise in public resources .
Yet many states and localities , given the pensions and benefits lavished on their workers , wo n’t have these resources unless they enact huge , politically problematic boosts in taxes and fees .
For our entire political class and the media as well , the shift in focus from culture and race to class and upward mobility seems certain to present an enormous challenge .
Yet it should be done as quickly as possible if Americans want to secure a decent future for themselves and for the 100 million more of their fellow citizens who will inhabit this country over the coming decades .

Voice of Reason : Attributing the survival of the passengers to a miracle is an insult to the bravery , skill , and experience of the Flight 358 crew .
On Aug. 2 , 2005 , amid heavy rain and lightning , Air France Flight 358 from Paris , France , to Toronto , Canada , crashed .
The plane had attempted to land at least once before but the pilot had pulled away for safety .
The plane touched down , and the passengers cheered , forgetting that just because the airplane 's wheels hit the tarmac does not mean the flight is over .
The plane struggled to slow down but failed , overshooting the runway by 200 yards and eventually slamming into a ravine .
Flames emerged from the aircraft body as the twelve crew members evacuated the 297 passengers .
Most of the passengers were out of the plane in less than a minute , many of them taking time to grab their belongings ( a no - no , by the way ) and taking photographs of dazed fellow passengers and the smoldering wreckage ( these would later be sold to evening news programs ) .
The copilot searched the plane for any remaining passengers and left the wreckage .
When the smoke cleared and the passengers were counted , every single person was found to have made it out alive .
Canada 's transportation minister , Jean Lapierre , proclaimed that the 100 percent survival rate was " nothing short of a miracle . "
Passengers , pundits , and the news media quickly adopted the " miracle " tag , with hundreds of headlines touting the miraculous nature of the crash .
London 's Daily Mail called it " The Miracle of Toronto " and Reuters dubbed it " The Toronto Miracle Crash . "
Toronto Sun columnist Mike Strobel wrote a piece titled , " Flight 358 was a 2nd miracle , " and lamented the news media 's overuse of the word miracle .
" In the news game , we use it to death , " he wrote .
" Our [ Toronto Sun ] clipping file lists the word 240 times this year alone and 239 times , it did not fit .
Except today .
Miracle Flight 358 . Paris to Pearson .
We all saw that awful black smoke .
A funeral pyre , surely ....
No one gets out of that alive . "
The miracle label was perfect .
It was a great news handle and a great silver lining in a dark storm cloud .
However , it does n't fit the circumstances of Flight 358 .
Aviation experts said that while the outcome of the crash is certainly fortunate , there was little miraculous about it .
Mark Rosenker of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) , was quoted in an MSNBC article as saying that " There is this myth out there that says if you 're involved in a catastrophic aircraft accident the odds are extremely low .
[ In fact ] , the odds are extremely high . "
According to an NTSB study of 568 crashes between 1983 and 2000 , only five percent of passengers were killed ; the remaining 95 percent escaped unharmed or without life - threatening injuries .
In another study of more serious crashes , the odds were better than 50/50 that passengers got out alive .
And crashes that occur on the ground , as Flight 358 did , often have very high survival rates .
In Biblical times , miracles seemed truly miraculous : walking on water , turning water into wine , that sort of thing .
In modern hyperbole , however , a miracle often simply means " unexpected good fortune " from the labeler 's perspective .
( Of course , it was not such good fortune that the accident happened in the first place . )
Many journalists , preferring sensationalism over statistics , saw the burning metal wreckage and incorrectly assumed the crash was unsurvivable without consulting experts .
The traveling public , primed by a fear - mongering news media to assume the worst , dramatically overestimate the dangers of air travel .
The fact that all the passengers survived is almost certainly due to science , skill , and circumstance .
Attributing the survival of the passengers to a miracle is an insult to the bravery , skill , and experience of the Flight 358 crew , who trained for years to handle just such emergencies .
By all accounts , the Air France crew acted quickly and professionally during the emergency .
They made sure that all passengers were buckled in for the landing and evacuated quickly .
The miracle designation also ignores the countless engineering safety measures and devices built into the Airbus A340 .
After all , the airplane design is the result of decades of safety engineering .
With just under a century of commercial flight , airplanes are safer than they ever have been , and remain far safer than autos on the nation 's highways .
Science helps make aircraft materials stronger and lighter , and crashes more survivable ( designing impact - resistant fuel tanks , for example , and flame - snuffing foam ) .
The 100 percent survival rate on Flight 358 was fortunate and wonderful , but it was not an accident , nor was it a miracle ; it was the result of careful preparation , thorough training , sound science , and modern technology .

I ’m back from my precinct caucus tonight — Super Tuesday .
There were about eight or ten precincts at this caucus location , one of which looked like it might have only half a dozen or so people showing up .
If you ’ve been looking for an insider ’s perspective on how the caucus process worked , with enough detail to actually know how everything hashed out rather than having to guesstimate based on mainstream media accounts .
It was n’t until tonight until I realized just how awry those accounts can be .
My precinct had 36 people qualified to participate in the proceedings , and one or two observers .
For some reason , one of the 36 people did n’t vote on anything , apparently .
Before the straw poll , an opportunity was given for people to speak about the candidates .
A deacon spoke in support of John McCain , a retired woman spoke in favor of Mitt Romney , an elderly lady threw in a very brief two cents in favor of Mitt Romney , and at prompting from my SigO I stood up to speak for Ron Paul .
Of course , I think I gave the best speech — and the SigO seems to agree .
In the straw poll ( aka “ Presidential Preference Poll ” ) :
21 votes — Romney was a clear winner for our precinct .
I was n’t terribly surprised at this , considering the number of people I saw wearing Mitt Romney stickers .
There were a couple of ( obviously below - voting - age ) teenagers handing out these stickers at the entrance .
8 votes — Ron Paul came in second .
6 votes — McCain came in third .
0 votes —
Everybody else had no supporters tonight .
That included Duncan Hunter , Mike Huckabee , Fred Thompson , and Rudy Giuliani .
Apparently , everyone heard that Giuliani and Thompson dropped out , and nobody heard of Hunter .
Of course , that means essentially nothing in terms of who gets the party nomination .
Party nomination is decided by delegates to the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis , MN this September .
Our precinct chose four delegates plus alternates to the county assembly , and one each delegates to the State assembly and Congressional district assembly .
In order to be a State or Congressional district delegate , you have to also be a county delegate .
For the county assembly delegate vote , people nominated themselves and were given an opportunity to speak briefly about why they ’d be a good choice to be a delegate .
Each of the 36 qualified caucus attendees could give four votes , one for each person he or she supported as a delegate .
I , for one , did n’t use all my votes — but I did use three of them .
My brief speech was probably the longest of them given at this point , but in retrospect I think I did an excellent job of “ resume BSing ” — casting myself in the best possible Republican flavored light , of course , while speaking honestly about my convictions and background .
The vote for county delegates :
32 votes — Me. Apparently , I speechify very well .
30 votes — A Ron Paul supporter ( I ’ll call him G ) came in second .
28 votes —
This was the Mitt Romney supporter retiree .
26 votes —
The McCain - supporting deacon took the fourth delegate position .
My SigO , also a Ron Paul supporter , is the alternate — in case someone else ca n’t show up .
There were n’t really any more speeches after that point .
We moved on to the State and Congressional district assemblies , in that order , next .
The only people eligible for these positions were county delegates and alternates .
For State assembly , I won with 19 votes — second place had 13 .
I thought I might be a shoe - in for this one , considering the vote for county .
I think the impressive vote total I got for county may have discouraged the deacon and retiree from getting into this one after I announced my intent to be the state delegate .
The other two people who threw their hats in the ring ( G and my SigO ) ended up on the “ delegate wait list ” — our precinct had two wait list slots .
The way the wait list works is , simply , that if some precincts lack delegates , fill - in delegates are chosen from the wait list .
For Congressional district assembly , the deacon won with 28 votes , and my SigO got waitlisted here as well with all the rest of the votes .
The wait - list works the same as for the State assembly delegates .
Remember , the Congressional district assembly delegates are the alternates to the State assembly , and vice versa .
The last vote was for whether to support people who volunteered to be election judges .
Two people volunteered , and both were confirmed by an informal voice vote ( ayes vs. nays ) .
Not that it matters , really , but one was a Ron Paul supporter , and one was a Mitt Romney supporter .
They both struck me as relatively honest types .
Neither self - nominated for any delegate positions or spoke in favor of any candidates .
In other words , I ’ve had all my suspicions confirmed : it looks like Ron Paul comes in second or third in every single straw poll ( although I hear he ’s running a very close second in Montana so far on the straw polls ) , and probably gets the biggest percentage of delegates of all candidates in most precincts .
The weighting toward Ron Paul will probably only increase at state levels in caucus states , as the number of delegates chosen for the county weigh in on additional delegates to send to the state , as will happen here in Colorado .
Based on what I ’ve seen in personal descriptions of caucus proceedings in other states , and in my own personal experience , it looks like Ron Paul may well be winning .
I ’ve heard it said that what Ron Paul supporters really want is a brokered convention , which is what happens when there are n’t enough delegates voting for a single candidate to make him or her the clear winner at the national convention , but I ’m beginning to think maybe that ’s not what we want after all .
Maybe Ron Paul will just win this thing outright — and the mainstream media will continue in its misinformed ignorance , basing its projections of “ winners ” and “ losers ” on straw polls where a bunch of people are asked what they prefer , but do n’t care enough to actually do anything about it .
The winner is the guy who shows up .
HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - A drop in wind generation late on Tuesday , coupled with colder weather , triggered an electric emergency that caused the Texas grid operator to cut service to some large customers , the grid agency said on Wednesday .
Electric Reliability Council of Texas ( ERCOT ) said a decline in wind energy production in west Texas occurred at the same time evening electric demand was building as colder temperatures moved into the state .
The grid operator went directly to the second stage of an emergency plan at 6:41 PM CST ( 0041 GMT ) , ERCOT said in a statement .
System operators curtailed power to interruptible customers to shave 1,100 megawatts of demand within 10 minutes , ERCOT said .
Interruptible customers are generally large industrial customers who are paid to reduce power use when emergencies occur .
No other customers lost power during the emergency , ERCOT said .
Interruptible customers were restored in about 90 minutes and the emergency was over in three hours .
ERCOT said the grid ’s frequency dropped suddenly when wind production fell from more than 1,700 megawatts , before the event , to 300 MW when the emergency was declared .
In addition , ERCOT said multiple power suppliers fell below the amount of power they were scheduled to produce on Tuesday .
That , coupled with the loss of wind generated in West Texas , created problems moving power to the west from North Texas .
ERCOT declares a stage 1 emergency when power reserves fall below 2,300 MW .
A stage 2 emergency is called when reserves fall below 1,750 MW .
At the time of the emergency , ERCOT demand increased from 31,200 MW to a peak of 35,612 MW , about half the total generating capacity in the region , according to the agency ’s Web site .
Texas produces the most wind power of any state and the number of wind farms is expected to increase dramatically as new transmission lines are built to transfer power from the western half of the state to more populated areas in the north .
Earlier on Tuesday , grid problems led to a blackout in Florida that cut power to about 1 million electric customers across that state for as much as four hours .
highest levels
Former CIA director George Tenet says that “ a group of assets from a Middle Eastern service ” , working for the CIA , penetrated al - Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan by September 2001 .
Bin Laden was dropping hints about the upcoming 9/11 attacks to training camp trainees in the summer of 2001 , and US citizen John Walker Lindh was told details of the 9/11 attacks within weeks of joining a training camp that summer
Indeed , in the summer of 2001 , the CIA allegedly told President Bush that the highest levels of Al - Qaeda had been penetrated
The Pentagon also tracked the hijackers before 9/11
And Saudi intelligence was " actively following " most of the September 11 , 2001 , plotters " with precision " prior to the attacks .
Saudi Arabia , like Israel , is a very close ally of the U.S .
The CIA and the NSA had been intercepting phone calls by the hijackers for years
The National Security Agency and the FBI were both independently listening in on the phone calls between the supposed mastermind of the attacks and the lead hijacker .
Indeed , the FBI built its own antenna in Madagascar specifically to listen in on the mastermind 's phone calls .
The day before 9/11 , the mastermind told the lead hijacker " tomorrow is zero hour " and gave final approval for the attacks .
The NSA intercepted the message that day and the FBI was likely also monitoring the mastermind 's phone calls .
( The NSA claims that it did not translate the intercept until September 12th ; however , the above - mentioned FBI translator said that she was frequently ordered to falsify dates of translations regarding 9/11 )
Shortly before 9/11 , the NSA also intercepted multiple phone calls from Bin Laden 's chief of operations to the United States
Only two days before 9/11 , Osama Bin Laden called his stepmother and told her " In two days , you 're going to hear big news and you 're not going to hear from me for a while . ”
US officials later told CNN that “ in recent years they 've been able to monitor some of bin Laden 's telephone communications with his [ step ] mother .
Bin Laden at the time was using a satellite telephone , and the signals were intercepted and sometimes recorded . "
Indeed , before 9/11 , to impress important visitors , NSA analysts would occasionally play audio tapes of bin Laden talking to his stepmother
9/11 family member and " Jersey Girl " Patty Casazza was told by whistleblowers that -- before 9/11 -- the government knew the exact day , the type of attack , and the targets
One of France 's largest newspapers claims that the CIA met with Bin Laden in an American hospital in Dubai in July 2001
If a domestic gang were this highly infiltrated and closely monitored by the FBI , and yet the FBI allowed the gang to commit a major crime , it would be obvious that the FBI allowed the crime to be committed .
Right ?
Why is 9/11 any different ?
Indeed , Al Qaeda was arguably more higly infiltrated and monitored than any domestic gang .
Moreover , something very similar happened in 1993 ,
( summary version is free ; full version is pay - per-view )
( see also this news report ) .
It was supposedly Al Qaeda which carried out that attack also .
No one could have anticipated 9/11 , right ?
While the U.S. knew about Al Qaeda , the 9/11 plotters and hijackers were still somewhat unknown and unpredictable prior to 9/11 .
Right ?
In fact , U.S. and allied intelligence services had penetrated theof Al Qaeda prior to 9/11 .
For example :
In addition , U.S. and allied intelligence services followed the hijacker 's every move : Moreover , the U.S. intercepted many high - level Al Qaeda phone calls : Moreover , the financiers for Al Qaeda were not mysterious and unknown before 9/11 : Other facts point towards penetration of the highest levels of Al Qaeda :
Whatever you might think about 9/11 , it is beyond dispute that U.S. and allied intelligence services had penetrated " the highest levels " of Al Qaeda prior to 9/11 .
Al Qaeda and the 9/11 plotters and hijackers were thoroughly known , monitored , tracked and infiltrated before 9/11 .

Regular , low - intensity workouts such as a leisurely stroll can boost energy levels by 20 percent and decrease fatigue by 65 percent , a team at the University of Georgia found .
“ Too often we believe that a quick workout will leave us worn out , especially when we are already feeling fatigued , ” Tim Puetz , who helped conduct the study , said in a statement .
“ However , we have shown that regular exercise can actually go a long way in increasing feelings of energy , particularly in sedentary individuals . ”
Puetz and a team led by Patrick O’Connor at the university ’s Exercise Psychology Laboratory studied 36 people who did not exercise regularly and who said they were always fatigued .
They were divided into three groups .
One did 20 minutes of moderately intense exercise on an exercise bike three times a week for six weeks , the second did similar workouts but at a much more leisurely pace and the third did no exercise .
The low - and moderate - intensity groups had a 20 percent increase in energy levels over the non-exercisers , the researchers reported in the journal Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics .
To their surprise , the researchers found the low - intensity group reported better reduction in fatigue than those who worked out harder .
“ It could be that moderate - intensity exercise is too much for people who are already fatigued and that might contribute to them not getting as great an improvement as they would had they done the low - intensity exercise , ” O’Connor said in a statement .
“ A lot of people are overworked and not sleeping enough , ” he said .
“ Exercise is a way for people to feel more energetic .
There ’s a scientific basis for it and there are advantages to it compared to things like caffeine and energy drinks . ”
Many studies have shown that exercise can boost energy , especially over time .
O’Connor ’s team published a report in 2006 showing that exercise can reduce fatigue in patients with cancer , heart disease and other medical problems .
This study looked at people whose fatigue did not seem to be associated with any medical condition .

When was the last time you tuned in to the dialogue while watching porn ?
If you 're deaf or hard of hearing , maybe never .
While many a hearing person has muted a porn video , it 's nice to have a choice about what you want to hear – or see – and what you do n't .
Deaf Bunny ( NSFW ) , the first deaf - owned and deaf - staffed porn company , launched in August with the mission of making porn accessible to deafies and their hearing partners in as many forms as possible .
Through subtitles , sign language , cartoonish thought bubbles , full audio and blatant use of technology , anyone can understand the complex plot and tangled relationships portrayed in the company 's first DVD release , Naughty Deaf Roommates .
I caught up with Deaf Bunny founder Dino Capone by e-mail to find out what makes deaf porn unique , how his company educates while it entertains , and what hearing people can learn about sex by watching deaf porn actors .
Wired News : Hearing and non-hearing partners can both understand the dialogue in Deaf Bunny productions , but what are the performers saying ?
Many hearing folks mute the sound on porn .
Dino Capone : Deaf Bunny 's playmates have lots to say in the movies !
First of all , deaf people value ASL ( American Sign Language ) and " deaf culture " as a key component to their identities .
When deaf people get together , it 's an opportunity to share , interact and express themselves , either sexually or platonically .
The dialogue in our movies represents all the emotions , facial expressions and sexual gratification that the playmates are experiencing .
We embrace the importance of allowing our viewers full access to everything that is said in our movies .
WN : You use deaf performers to create adult entertainment for an audience that includes deaf , hard of hearing ( HH ) and hearing people .
What is unique about the performers ' interaction that viewers wo n't find in mainstream porn ?
Capone : Deaf Bunny uses deaf and HH actors and actresses primarily to connect with the majority of the viewers , who are deaf and HH .
ASL is the common thread of the deaf community and the social behaviors – such as eye contact , body language , facial expressions and vocals ( deaf people are loud ! ) – are unique to our culture .
You wo n't find that in mainstream adult movies .
WN : How has the internet affected sexual education , experience and health among the deaf and hard of hearing ?
Capone : Deaf and HH people are very visually inclined , for obvious reasons , and the internet allows for their visual needs to be met through the use of ASL and subtitles .
WN : Have you encountered resistance in marketing the combination of porn with what used to be considered a disability ?
In the internet / mobile - device age , does deafness count as a disability for porn ?
Capone :
The fact that we are marketing porn with a " disability " actually invites people to discover what we 're about .
We are reaching out to a population that has encountered many obstacles in using media sources , and we function as a link for the deaf community to the adult entertainment industry as well as ( to ) hearing people .
WN : What can hearing people learn about sexuality from Deaf Bunny movies or deaf folks in general ?
Capone : Hearing people will , first and foremost , understand that deaf people can do just about anything , except hear .
We want to expose the mainstream to our language , our use of technology ( relay services , captioners , etc. ) and to the sexual activities in the movies – the importance of eye contact , facial expressions and body language while engaging in sex acts .
We hope to help hearing people in their own relationships with either a deaf or hearing partner and perhaps instill an appreciation that people with disabilities are just like everyone else !
WN : Deaf Bunny tries to provide education as well as entertainment .
Do you think adult sex ed can reach people better than traditional sex ed ?
Capone : Deaf Bunny educates viewers in using ASL and provides full access to information .
Our general manager has an advice column , " Ask Shania " ( NSFW ) , which offers feedback in a variety of topics , ranging from relationships to personal health .
Deaf Bunny provides deaf and HH viewers a resource to explore and learn about sexuality in a positive and healthy way .
WN : You just launched a few months ago and have a lot of plans for expansion .
What 's next ?
Capone :
We 're developing more websites and more movies .
We have several new cast members for our third main movie ( as we also feature " deaf amateurs " movies ) at the end of January , and we 're going to announce the 2009 New Year 's Eve bash sometime in May .
Also , we are working on Deaf Strippers ( NSFW ) , which will enable members to locate deaf strippers at each venue or on tour .

As for the reaction to Deaf Bunny 's offerings among the deaf community , my friend Kathryn Hill , author of the deaf - tech blog Stone Deaf Pilots , pretty much sums it up : " So that 's what they talk about in porn .
Huh . "
See you in a fortnight ,

Imagine All the People , Loving in 3 - D
Astronomers ' mental image of Titan , the solar system 's second - largest moon , used to be that of a vast swimming pool .
But maybe they should have imagined a water bed instead .
Last year , researchers reported that radar mapping of Titan by the Cassini spacecraft had found a peculiar shift in landmarks on the moon 's surface of up to 19 miles ( 30 kilometers ) between October 2004 and May 2007 .
Now investigators say the best explanation is a moon - wide underground ocean that disconnects Titan 's icy crust from its rocky interior .
" We think the structure is about 100 kilometers of ice sitting atop a global layer of water … maybe hundreds of kilometers thick , " says Cassini scientist Ralph Lorenz of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel , Md .
If confirmed , Titan would be the fourth moon in the solar system thought to contain such an internal water ocean , joining Jupiter 's satellites Ganymede , Callisto and Europa .
Researchers believe that heat from radioactivity in a moon 's core or gravitational squeezing may melt a layer of frozen water .
On Titan , Ganymede and Callisto , the liquid would become sandwiched between two different forms of ice , one that floats on water and one that sinks .
Astronomers believe that of the four bodies , Europa has a larger and hotter core that directly borders its ocean , which lies beneath a thin layer of ice .
A hidden water layer would add to Titan 's impressive resume : Larger in diameter than both Earth 's moon and the planet Mercury , Titan is the only satellite in the solar system with a true atmosphere — a dense , rotating fog of nitrogen supporting hydrocarbon clouds made of methane and ethane .
For decades researchers suspected that its frosty surface temperature of around – 290 degrees Fahrenheit ( – 180 degrees Celsius ) would cause hydrocarbons to pool on its surface in a vast ocean .
But during Cassini 's first flyby in October 2004 , its radar instruments detected no surface - spanning ocean , only methane lakes near the moon 's north pole .
The shift in Titan 's geologic features is strange because the moon is locked in a synchronous orbit around Saturn , meaning it always presents the same face to the planet .
" It 's a little bit improbable that Titan would be rotating asynchronously , " Lorenz says .
Writing in Science , he and his colleagues instead connect the geologic displacement to models in which Titan 's atmosphere pushes against mountains on the surface .
The exact thickness of the crust is an important component of the group 's model of Titan but is not known precisely .
Based on the dimensions of the Menrva impact crater , they estimate a thickness of about 60 miles ( 100 kilometers ) .
That would make the crust thinner than those of Ganymede or Callisto , where the oceans are thought to lie below as much as 125 miles ( 200 kilometers ) of rock and ice .
For Titan 's presumed ocean to remain liquid at such a distance from the hot core , the researchers argue that it must contain ammonia .
There may also be other explanations for the observed shifting .
In an editorial accompanying the report , planetary scientists Christophe Sotin of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) , Gabriel Tobie of the University of Nantes in France , observe that a periodic wobble in Titan 's rotation or , less likely , a recent asteroid impact could also explain the finding .
The ocean interpretation is still the most plausible one , according to David Stevenson , professor of planetary science at Caltech .
" This is a perfectly natural thing to do in a water–ice dominated world , provided there is enough heat , " he says .
What is less clear , he adds , is the ocean 's depth .
The movement of the crust likely depends on additional , poorly understood factors , such as seasonal weather patterns and gravitational attraction between the crust and the core , he says .
Luckily , the group 's model is testable .
It predicts a quickening of Titan 's rotation rate in the coming year or two followed by a slowdown — something that can be measured on succeeding Cassini flybys .
As always , the possibility of water leads to talk of potential life .
Researchers have speculated that Titan may have long ago harbored life or its building blocks , catalyzed by sunlight reacting with atmospheric carbon and hydrogen .
Experts have considered Europa a better candidate , however , because of the presumed contact between ocean and core , which would provide a steady supply of heat energy .
Lorenz and his colleagues note that Titan 's ocean might be stirred instead by cryovolcanism or warmer ( but still cold ) water welling up from below .
The addition of water , Lorenz says , makes Titan " astrobiologically very appealing . "
Stevenson , for one , says he still sees Europa as a better bet for life .
He agrees that Titan is an attractive natural laboratory for the kind of chemistry that would lead to life , but when it comes to energy sources , sizzling rock " is much better than ice . "
One of the greatest things about teaching is that you get to witness first - hand the workings of young minds .
As any idealistic teaching recruitment advert will tell you , there is nothing better than seeing a young person grapple to make sense of something , only to grab the fucker intellectually with both hands and receieve that sense of satisfaction that us really , really , really smart people get all the time .
On the other hand , there are also few things more frustrating than seeing a child struggle painfully to grasp even the simplest of concepts , no matter how much assistance they receieve .
Yet this is part of the job , and despite the frustration it 's probably the most rewarding part - assuming that they do get it in the end .
When they do n't , the best thing to do is just to point at an imaginary angry looking badger over their shoulder and then run to the nearest pub post - haste for a nice , numbing pint .
Mmmm , denial never tasted so good .

" We went to Iraq coz they bombed us , innit sir ? "
I often ask them why they think it was Iraq who attacked us , and the response is always the same :
" Them lot who bombed us were from Iraq , innit ? "
I then go on to explain that the London bombers were not from Iraq .
The next question is funnily enough more apt than they often realise :
" Well then why the hell did we invade Iraq sir ? "
Good question my young friend , good question indeed .
The music industry 's legal campaign against campus P2P activity marked its one - year anniversary in late February , and the RIAA is still at it .
The group has sent off another 569 prelitigation settlement letters to students at 26 schools , only a couple of which have attempted to thwart the RIAA .
One of those schools , Marshall , was told by a judge last week to cough up the names and addresses of seven " John Doe " students .
Marshall University was served a subpoena seeking the identities of seven students after the RIAA filed one of its usual John Doe lawsuits ( Arista Records v. Does 1 - 7 if you 're scoring at home ... or if you 're alone ) .
The school resisted , arguing that the RIAA made false representations in order to obtain the subpoena and begin ex parte discovery , and also that the subpoena imposed an undue burden on the school .
Marshall said that four of the seven students lived in dorm rooms with at least one roommate .
As a result , it would be unable to figure out who was using the PC flagged by MediaSentry without " the expense and inconvenience of an investigation . "
One of the others was using the school 's wireless network , while the other two were in single - occupancy dorm rooms .
Even then , Marshall pointed out that it could only furnish the names of the students , not identify the actual P2P users uncovered by MediaSentry .
The school 's attorneys also argued that federal privacy laws prevented the disclosure of the students ' identifying data and that the RIAA 's subpoena was invalidated by the DMCA .
Citing a decision in a similar lawsuit against students at the College of William and Mary , Marshall argued that the RIAA should be forced to follow the infringement notification provisions outlined by the DMCA .
The judge disagreed , saying that an amended subpoena asking only for " identifying information with respect to the person associated with the IP address at the date and time of the alleged infringing use " would alleviate any " undue burden " on Marshall .
He also disagreed with Marshall 's take on federal privacy law , but curiously failed to address the DMCA argument raised by the school .
In the Pacific Northwest , the University of Oregon has raised many of the same issues in its fight against the RIAA 's attempts to learn the identities of 17 students .
Oregon 's Attorney General has been critical of the RIAA in court filings , and his office wants the chance to take its own look at the RIAA 's investigative practices .
The judge in that case has yet to rule on the University of Oregon 's motion to quash .
So far , schools willing to stand up to what former EFF attorney Wendy Seltzer has described as the RIAA 's " copyright bullying " are few and far between .
Still , resistance from individual students and schools appears to have slowed the RIAA 's legal campaign against college students .

SANAA ( Reuters ) - A Yemeni court ordered the marriage of an eight - year - old girl terminated on Tuesday because she had not reached puberty .
The court also ordered the child ’s family to pay about $ 250 in compensation to the 30 - year - old ex-husband .
The girl ’s lawyer and human rights activist Shatha Nasser said the minor had filed a suit in April asking for divorce and told the court that her husband had been physically abusing her and forcing her to have “ sex with him after hitting her . ”
One of the people attending the trial volunteered to pay the compensation , the lawyer said , but did not explain the reason why the court ordered the compensation .
The ruling terminated the marriage instead of granting a divorce to prevent the husband from seeking to reinstate the marriage , according to the lawyer .
Many minor girls in Arab countries that observe tribal traditions are married to older husbands but not before puberty .
Such marriages are also driven by poverty in countries like Yemen , one of the poorest countries outside Africa .
Nunchuks were used in the fatal Halloween party attack
Police charged Richard McGarvey Martin , from Heath Way , Horsham , West Sussex , with the murder of Ricky Butler , who was 15 - years - old .
He died in a nunchaku attack at the party , in Horsham , on Saturday morning .
The victim was taken to hospital following the attack , where he died .
Nunchuks are made up of two sticks connected with a short chain or rope .
The dead youngster was one of two teenagers found with head injuries after police were called to the address in Horsham early on Saturday .
The other youth , a 16 - year - old , needed stitches for his injuries .
Officers identified the 15 - year - old , who lived in Leith View Road , Roffey , Horsham , on Sunday evening .
There were about 15 people aged in their early 20s and late teens at the fancy dress party when police arrived .
A hawk was found dead along a California highway with the claw of a songbird protruding from its chest .
It 's not clear , however , if the partially digested meal , one claw somehow managing to get back out from a terribly wrong location , had anything to do with the hawk 's death .
On the evening of Sunday , March 30 , Julia Di Sieno of the Animal Rescue Team in California noticed the dead sharp - shinned hawk ( Accipiter striatus ) while driving a sick night heron to the Solvang Veterinary Hospital .
Sharp - shinned hawks are birds of prey and considered stellar hunters .
They are the smallest hawks that reside in the United States and Canada .
" So I did a U - turn , put on my gloves and picked the bird up , and immediately rushed him to the vet where he died in my hands , " Di Sieno told LiveScience .
" Upon examination , we noticed that there was a small bird claw protruding out of its chest . "
A pouch in the hawk 's chest area called the crop had ripped open and the songbird , which had been a meal for the hawk , was spilling out .
" We removed a good portion of this bird [ the songbird ] , which was partially digested , " Di Sieno said by telephone yesterday .
The hawk had apparently just finished downing what might have been a sparrow , she said .
" He [ the dead hawk ] even still had down feathers and meat on his beak . "
Birds of prey , like sharp - shinned hawks , typically leave behind the legs and head of their avian meals , Di Sieno said .
Perhaps this hawk 's failure to do so was the reason Solvang hospital vet George Bertram got such a sight — something he had never seen in his 25 years of practice .
News of the strange hawk death was first reported by Noozhawk , a Web site in Santa Barbara .
However , Di Sieno said she is not sure how the hawk died or what caused its crop to burst open .

Health experts denounced President George W. Bush ’s 2009 federal budget request on Monday , calling it a disaster for the health of Americans and saying they would look to Congress to change it .
Bush ’s $ 3.1 trillion spending plan proposes a 7 percent cut in funds for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as less money for Medicare and Medicaid — the joint federal - state health insurance programs for the poor and elderly .
The budget for the fiscal year starting October 1 , 2009 would reduce spending on Medicare by $ 12.8 billion and lower federal funds for Medicaid by $ 18.2 billion over five years .
The National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration would receive more funds , but critics said the increases were too small to counteract rising costs .

In most cities of the world a person might expect to be feted for surviving a single bomb attack .
In Baghdad , survival stories can be found on every street corner .
Ali is a painter and a student at the academy of art in north Baghdad .
A few years ago he moved to the Baghdad suburb of Karrada , where many artists live because of its art market .
When I meet him , Ali is limping slightly .
A white bandage protrudes from the sleeve of his striped jumper , and he frequently drops his left shoulder so that his arm rests on his thigh .
These are the only outward signs of the injuries he sustained in the previous week .
In a shy , soft voice Ali tells me how he had been standing with a friend in Karrada when a bomb went off at the side of the road .
" I heard an explosion very close by , " he says .
" I saw smoke and chaos and people screaming .
I saw my friend Hassan , who was running and carrying a child who had lost an arm .
I saw a nice - looking girl - the Karrada girls , you know how beautiful they are .
She was dead .
And I saw a girl who had only one eye .
" I could n't bear it , " he tells me .
" I started to scream and cry .
" Then suddenly there was another explosion .
This time , you know , I did n't hear much , I just saw a tall column of orange fire a few metres away from me and then smoke .
I did n't know what had happened , but the people who had run over to tend the injured from the first bomb were now lying on the street screaming .
" I stood there in the middle of it all .
I saw people picking bodies up and carrying them .
A police car arrived and the police started to fire bullets in the air .
I ran away and hid at the entrance of a shop .
When a woman saw me , she started screaming .
There was blood on my arm and on my leg . "
A friend of Ali 's stopped a passing ambulance and helped him into it .
Inside , he found a man whose face was black from burns and whose shoulder was covered with blood .
A younger man was bleeding from his legs .
" When he tried to lift one of them it bent not at the knee but from the middle of his thigh , " Ali says .
" He was screaming , ' Fix my leg !
Fix my leg ! ' "
At the hospital , Ali and the others sat in a corridor waiting to be treated by the overstretched medical team .
" There were children there who were all red , " he remembers .
" It looked as if they had no faces , they were so covered with blood . "
After waiting a while he was transferred to another hospital , where a doctor examined him .
" The doctor told me I just had two bits of shrapnel in my arm and leg , " Ali says .
" He asked me why I was crying .
I told him it was n't for myself but for all the boys and girls around me . "
The doctor took out what looked like pliers and asked Ali to look away .
" He got the first bullet out , but the second did n't come so easily and I screamed . "
After Ali has finished telling me this story I look around at his immaculately clean apartment .
On one side of the room are a pile of paintings .
He points at three small ones hanging on the wall , a mixture of orange and red splashes .
" These are my attempts at surrealism , " he says .
" Immediately after the war , I had a strong feeling of optimism .
I was sure the Saddam era would n't come back , we had money and were spending all the money .
" But then the conspiracy theories started .
I began hearing my brothers and friends say the Americans were here only for the oil , and after that I would go to bed and lie awake thinking how much oil they were stealing from me .
Now I do n't care if they steal the money , I am so tired . "
" I ask myself why life in Iraq is so cheap .
We are living in a nightmare .
It is like there is a camera recording us and by its light we see images of death and carnage everywhere .
The Iraqi have good hearts , but we are living in a state of hysteria . "
This is Ali 's second apartment .
His first was blown up .
On a mobile phone he shows me grainy video footage of smoke mixed with broken furniture .
There are some muffled sounds and then I make out someone shouting : " Are you OK ?
This is a mortar .
We 're getting shelled . "
In fact it was a car bomb , Ali says .
He shared that flat with two other friends , Mamdouh and Sarmad .
" They were the best people in the world .
Mamdouh and I would listen to [ the Arab singer ]
Fairuz and paint all night .
" The night before that bomb , Mamdouh told me he felt guilty he had n't done any work for so long .
He told me he would go out for breakfast early in the morning .
" I stayed in the flat , sleeping .
Then I heard the first explosion .
It was at the end of the street .
I went to the window to look , and then as I was walking back the second bomb went of , just under my window . "
Emotional
As Ali ran down the stairs , he saw someone who lived on the first floor wrapped in a blanket .
He was dead .
" I asked if anyone had seen Mamdouh and Sarmad .
They told me no one had seen them .
I was crying in the street .
A few hours later a friend called me and told me that Sarmad was dead and Mamdouh was in hospital . "
Ali went to the hospital .
His eyes and voice are calm - as usual - while he recounts the scene .
" He was lying on a bed there in the Kindi hospital , there was a filthy smell all around , the smell of urine .
He looked like Mamdouh , but he was like someone else ... he smiled and I smiled back , but I felt a great pain in my heart . "
Two days later , Ali tells me , Mamdouh died .
" We came , his friends , me and Hassan and Hadi , and washed him and put him in a shroud .
You know I am too emotional .
I cry very quickly .
For six months I did n't talk to anyone , I was just sad and silent .
Ali loves Arabic calligraphy and has studied it for many years .
Now , he says , all he writes are the black mourning signs for his dead friends , which , according to Iraqi custom , he hangs in the street .
Lurita Doan finally forced out at GSA
Lurita Doan , head of the General Services Administration , was forced to offer her resignation tonight , according to an e-mail she sent out this evening .
Doan was appointed in late May , 2006 , becoming the first woman to serve as GSA Administrator .
With 12,000 empioyees and a $ 20 billion annual budget , GSA has responsibilty for overseeing the thousands of building and properties owned by the federal government .
Doan became the subject of congressional scrutiny last year for allegedly using GSA to help Republican lawmakers win re-election .
Doan denied the allegation , but her appearance before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee was disastrous .
Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) , chairman of the panel , called on Doan to resign over the allegations , but Doan refused to do so .
Here is the text of the e-mail that Doan sent out earlier this evening announcing her forced resignation :
" Dear Friends and Colleagues at GSA ,
Early this evening I was asked to submit my resignation , and I have just done so .
It has been a great privilege to serve with all of you and to serve our nation and a great President .
The past twenty - two months have been filled with accomplishments : together , we have regained our clean audit opinion , restored fiscal discipline , re-tooled our ability to respond to emergencies , rekindled entrepreneurial energies , reduced bureaucratic barriers to small companies to get a GSA Schedule , ignited a building boom at our nation ’s ports of entries , boldly led the nation in an aggressive telework initiative , and improved employee morale so that we were selected as one of the best places to work in the Federal government .
These accomplishments are made even more enjoyable by the fact that there were lots of people who told us they could never be done .
Best of luck to all of you , it has been a true honor . "
Update - Waxman issued this statement in reaction to Doan 's resignation : “ I know this decision was difficult for the White House and Lurita Doan , but it was the right thing to do .
GSA should now be able to return to its nonpartisan tradition and its work as our government ’s premier contracting agency . "
Rep. Tom Davis ( R - Va. ) , ranking member on Oversight and Government Reform , offered praise for Doan 's tenure at GSA , although he noted that Doan 's " management style was not everyone 's cup of tea , " and admitted that Doan suffered from " personality conflicts " at the agency .
Davis also criticized Special Counsel Scott Bloch , who found last year that Doan had violated the Hatch Act and urged President Bush to remove her from office .
That law prohibits federal employees for using their offices for political activities .
“ It would be a shame if this decision had anything to do with the hyperbolic and unfounded allegations of Scott Bloch and others who were after her just to claim another administration scalp , " Davis said in a statement released by his office .
" There 's no doubt personality conflicts played a role .
Certainly , her management style was not everyone 's cup of tea .
Davis added : “ But the administrator appears to have fallen victim to a bureaucratic culture that fears , rather than rewards , entrepreneurial spirit , innovation and bold leadership .
Lurita Doan 's legacy at GSA should be viewed as a positive one , and her attempts to bring private sector best practices to the agency should be applauded . ”

The BBC's Radiophonic Workshop , a pioneering force in sound effects , would have been 50 this month .
Ten years after it was disbanded , what remains of its former glory ?
Deep in the bowels of BBC Maida Vale studios , behind a door marked B11 , is all that 's left of an institution in British television history .
A green lampshade , an immersion tank and half a guitar lie forlornly on a shelf , above a couple of old synthesisers in a room full of electrical bric - a - brac .
These are the sad remnants of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop , set up 50 years ago to create innovative sound effects and incidental music for radio and television .
Not a laptop in sight : Delia Derbyshire at work
The corporation initially only offered its founders a six - month contract , because it feared any longer in the throes of such creative and experimental exercises might make them ill .
Using reel - to - reel tape machines , early heroines such as Daphne Oram and Delia Derbyshire recorded everyday or strange sounds and then manipulated these by speeding up , slowing down or cutting the tape with razor blades and piecing it back together .
The sound of the Tardis was one sound engineer 's front - door key scraped across the bass strings on a broken piano .
Other impromptu props included a lampshade , champagne corks and assorted cutlery .
Ten years ago the workshop was disbanded due to costs but its reputation as a Heath Robinson - style , pioneering force in sound is as strong as ever , acknowledged by ambient DJs like Aphex Twin .
Although much of its equipment has long been sold off , every sound and musical theme it created has been preserved .
To mark its 50 years , there are plans for a CD box - set .
Here Dick Mills and Mark Ayres , who both worked there , use the surviving equipment to revive four sounds from the past .
GREEN LAMPSHADE
This was a stroke of genius from Delia Derbyshire , who died in 2001 and famously created the Doctor Who theme tune from Ron Grainer 's score .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
She would hit the tatty - looking aluminium lampshade to create a sound with a natural , pure frequency .
After recording it on tape , she would play with it to make the desired sound effect .
For a documentary on the Tuareg people of the Sahara desert , she took the ringing part of the lampshade sound , faded it up and then reconstructed it using the workshop 's 12 oscillators to give a whooshing sound , allied to her own voice .
" So the camels rode off into the sunset with my voice in their hooves and a green lampshade on their backs , " she once said .
The green lampshade has since gained near - mythical status and Peter Howell , who succeeded Derbyshire in the early 1970s and reworked the Doctor Who theme tune , can see why .
" It 's a useful thing to cling on to because everyone knows what a lampshade is because it symbolises the use of domestic objects to produce sounds . "
The workshop fascinates his music students today because of all the kit used back then , he says , and its influence is still clearly seen - an advert for a VW Golf that uses only sounds of the car , for example .
" The sampling era we 're now in is the next generation of the same principle . "
DALEK VOICE
The sound that sent youngsters , and many adults , cowering behind sofas was co-created by Mills , a sound engineer who joined the workshop in its first year and left 35 years later .

" We tried to give the impression that whenever a Dalek spoke , it was n't speaking like we do , it was accessing words from a memory bank , so they all sound the same - dispassionate , mechanical and retrievable . "
He used a centre - tap transformer plugged into the microphone of an actor standing at the side of the set , and the threat in the voice was all in the performance .
Sometimes the tape got played at the wrong speed and the voice came out slightly differently , but the arrival of the EMS VCS3 synthesiser in the late 60s did not signal the end for this tried and tested method .
In other ways , however , the synthesisers changed the way the workshop operated and - despite some resistance by individuals - offered a bigger choice .
WORKSHOP HIGHLIGHTS
Sound effects : Quatermass and the Pit , The Goon Show , Blake 's 7 , The Hitch - Hiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , Doctor Who Music : Woman 's Hour , Tomorrow 's World , Blue Peter , John Craven 's Newsround , Doctor Who " Synthesisers provided a wide open pallet of colours and sounds to play with , but you still had to choose what you wanted to do and learn the discipline of this new technological form , " says Mills .
" So on the one hand , it was easy but you still had the original difficulty of thinking of the idea in the first place . "
SCI - FI DOOR OPENING Sci- fi fans will recognise the " swooshing " door from programmes such as Doctor Who and Blake 's 7 , plus in the odd hotel scene in other programmes .
The suitcase synthesiser was a portable version of the VCS3 , useful for jobs out of the studio .

Recalling the early days and influences , Mills says : " We would take a pre-recorded sound effect from the BBC 's vast library but treated them to produce cerebral effects .
If you wanted a character to appear to be thinking , you got him to read the line and put in a strange echo . "
Similar techniques were already used in Europe in " musique concrete " .
" They did it for their own investigation and research , but our way of life was we never did anything until a commission .
So all our experimentation and research was taking place in the context of that radio or television programme . "
One of Mills ' proudest creations was the slimy monster sound , which was him spreading Swarfega cleaning gel on his hands and then slowing down the sound .
And he made the upset tummy of Major Bloodnok in The Goon Show , a colonial officer who liked curry , by using burp sounds and an oscillator to give a violent , explosive gastro - effect .
Using contrasting sounds very quickly is a trick in audio comedy .
" We did our own thing in the name of artistic creation .
Working here was a bit like surf riding .
Every so often a creative wave of energy kept you going until the wave ran out . "
BROKEN GUITAR
One pluck of a guitar string became the famous Dr Who bass line .
Derbyshire and Mills sped it up and slowed it down to get the different notes , and these were cut to give it an extra twang on the front of every note .

" It slides up to the note every time if you listen carefully , " says Mills .
" Delia fabricated the baseline out of two or three lines of tape .
" You'd be scrabbling around the floor saying ' Where 's that half - inch of tape I wanted to play on the front of that note ? ' "
Every sound generated by the workshop and used in radio or television is preserved , partly in thanks to archivist Mark Ayres , who worked there while a student .
He believes one of its greatest legacies is that it made listeners more used to hearing such sounds as part of everyday entertainment and education .
" [ It led to ] the steady integration of experimental sound into popular culture and the placement of such sound into the mainstream rather than it being confined to various strictly academic studios .
" Certainly , much of this took place in parallel with developments elsewhere - The Beatles ' Sergeant Pepper and Pink Floyd 's Dark Side of the Moon for example .
" Later on , the workshop housed a couple of the most advanced computer - based MIDI studios in the world , but by that time competition from the outside world was too great and , under [ the BBC 's policy ]
Producer Choice , the workshop could not compete on price and its demise was inevitable . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
Truly a national treasure .
That we can do similar things now with a synth costing a few hundred pounds or a cheap software plug - in on our computers should never detract from the importance of these pioneers .
Mark Ayres is fully justified in putting the Workshop 's output alongside late Beatles and Dark Side of the Moon in terms of its role in bringing electronic music to the masses .
Ed Webb , Carlisle , PA ( ex - UK )
Only the BBC with endless amounts of money to spend , could disband and destroy the most widely recognised music lab in the world .
It 's almost obscene that they now pretend to cherish it in some manner .
As if the current crop of unimaginative marketing - led managers were connected to its achievements .
Hang your heads in shame .
Gary Threlfall , Liverpool
This is great .
My weekend was just made .
Keith Seekwhensir , Brooklyn , NY United States Absolute giants .
Everything that 's happened since owes them a colossal debt - the opening " scream " of Doctor Who is surely one of the most iconic sound effects ever created .
Ian , Brighton
Oh boy .
Just listened to the Dalek voice .
I am now 50 years old and it was so strange to be taken back 45 years .
Early Saturday teatime - Dad in garden , Mum in kitchen ... oh-er , want to watch - do n't want to watch ... someone hurry up and come to watch with me !
Can I come out from behind the sofa yet ?
Thanks for the memory Beeb .
Jeanette Gray , Istanbul Awesome , a nice quick trip down audiological memory lane ...
I remember cutting together a " sound story " tape at school ( strange music lessons , yeah ) using one of the published RPW LPs and much use of the pause button and split - second timing , it seemed so cool at the time !
Fair bit easier now with computerised wave editors and the like , but this does show just how much you can produce with some simple materials ( and what were probably quite expensive synths .. ) and a lot of ingenuity and talent .
Happy virtual 50th !
Mark P , UK
It all sounds so run -of - the - mill these days , but I still remember the awe in which the Dr Who theme tune was held by the young ( and not so young for that matter ) fans of the very early series .
It was like nothing we had heard before , and with Ron Grainer 's skilful composition it became a masterpiece .
Nostalgia rules OK .
Alan , Wootton Bassett , UK Sadly the money went to the heads of the current generation of Dr Who and they paid for a full orchestra .
The result is just not in the same league as the old Dr Who , no atmosphere at all .
Shows it is not money but imagination that matters .
Stephen , Brighton
Ah yes , the mighty Radiophonic Workshop shame it has now been consigned to the annals of history .
Delia Derbyshire is one of the most important , but sadly forgotten , figures in modern music .
Her influence is everywhere .
I look forward to the box set with relish !
Jason , London
This was just terrific .
D Chadd Portwine , Albany NY
I still think that closing down the Radiophonic Workshop was one of the most misguided decisions in the Corporation 's history .
The costs of running the department should have been offset against the creativity and innovation displayed by what was a national institution .
I was one of a generation of musicians inspired to create electronic music after listening to the workshop 's creations .
Even after ten years , reading about its demise makes me profoundly sad , and more than a little bit angry .
Chris , Bristol , UK
It is good to hear that the sounds have been preserved by Ayres - he is a real Dr Who freak and the sounds are in good hands with him .
Nigel Peacock , Hartfield , East Sussex Another example of an innovative and successful department that the BBC disbanded .
PBOB , London I remember an intensely radiophonic production of one of Ray Bradbury 's Silver Locust stories .
Good to know it 's still in the archive .
Any chance of a download ?
It would be too long to put on even a generously large CD box set !
Tom , Lisbon Just as the BBC wiped hundreds of video tapes back in the 70s , they also scrapped one of the milestones in modern music .
The Radiophonic workshop was THE founder of modern commercial electronic music , and all the synthesiser users of today should owe a debt to this outstanding group of people .
There should be a museum to house this and other early electronic music memorabilia for future generations .
I just hope the BBC of today are rather more careful what they kill off .

What are these ?
Biologists have just confirmed what poets have known for centuries : eyes really are windows of the soul - - or at least of the brain .
In a new study Harvard researchers describe the development of gene probe eye drops that -- for the first time -- make it possible to monitor and detect tissue repair in the brain of living organisms using MRI .
Current methods involve a risky , invasive , and relatively slow process of penetrating the skull to extract tissue samples and then examining those samples in a laboratory .
" We hope our study provides a tool for better treatments of neurological diseases , diagnosis , prognosis during therapy , and improved delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain , " said Philip Liu of Harvard , one of the researchers involved in the study .
Liu also said that more research is necessary to determine exactly how these gene probes reach brain tissue .
In this report , Harvard researchers describe how they link a relatively common MRI probe ( superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles ) to a short DNA sequence that binds to proteins in cells responsible for brain tissue repair ( glia and astrocytes ) .
Then , researchers used the eye drops on mice with conditions that cause " leaks " in the blood - brain barrier .
When the animals ' brains were scanned using MRI , brain repair activity was visible .
Glia and astrocytes help repair brain and nerve tissue , and have a role in numerous diseases and disorders that cause at least microscopic breaches in the blood - brain barrier , including traumatic brain injury , multiple sclerosis , stroke , cardiac arrest , and glioma , among others .
Furthermore , the researchers believe that the probes may also help diagnose thinning of vascular walls in brains , which occurs as Alzheimer 's disease progresses .
" When people are sick , the last thing you want to do is puncture their skulls for a biopsy , " said Gerald Weissmann , MD , Editor - in - Chief of The FASEB Journal , " but sometimes this is unavoidable .
These probes of genes in action go a long way toward ushering in an age where extracting brain tissue to identify a disease will seem as crude as when doctors measured skulls to diagnose a mental disease . "
This research is published in the April 2008 print issue of The FASEB Journal .
UPDATE : Sources close to Arianna Huffington are claiming just that .
Arianna Huffington is currently on book tour for her new political tome Right Is Wrong : How The Lunatic Fringe Hijacked America , Shredded The Constitution , And Made Us All Less Safe , in which she goes after Tim Russert ( and justifiably so ) .
She ’s booked all over CNN , ABC , and CBS ( but not Fox News Channel because she chose not to go on there ) .
And NBC ?
Well , one insider says she was booked on Keith Olberman and Morning Joe to talk about her tome — and then unbooked .
“ These are shows that call her regularly to come on .
And then the word came from on high that she had to be cancelled . ”
Arianna ’s accolytes are pointing the finger at Tim Russert , well known to be ridiculously thin - skinned , for blackballing her internally at NBC and not permitting her on any of the NBC network or cable outlets .
It ’s certainly possible , considering how much clout the Washington bureau chief wields at the company ( not to mention how much profit his Meet The Press yields for the company ) .
NBC did confirm to me that Arianna Huffington wo n’t be booked on any of the NBC network or cable shows past or present or future for her book .
( Interestingly , a Knopf source says the publisher was never given a definitive no .
“ We were just told to ‘ Call back tomorrow . ’
There was never any explanation . ” )
Granted Right
Is Wrong is only # 209 on Amazon.com , but Huffington pals are arguing to NBC it ’s a big book tour by a big name .
“ We get pitched countless books , and most of them do n’t make it on the air .
And this one did n’t , ” the network news spokesperson told me .
The spokesperson points out that Huffington has had nasty things to say about Russert “ for years ” through HuffPo ’s RussertWatch but she ’s still been booked on NBC shows .
“ Arianna must be dialing for dollars again , ” the spokesperson snarked .
Meanwhile , the respected Columbia Journalism Review just announced it will pick up HuffPo ’s RussertWatch as a regular online feature .
So what does Huffington say about Russert in her tome ?
— Russert ’s July 1 , 2007 , Meet The Press interview with Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff “ was about as priapic a display as you ’re ever likely to see outside of a porno film or the monkey cage at the zoo , with Russert desperately trying to get Chertoff to pump up the panic meter … ”
— Russert ’s Meet The Press has been the Bush - Cheney “ administration ’s top choice for push - back as its lies about Iraq were unraveling , because the White House could ‘ control ’ the message more easily there . ”
— Russert is “ one of the temple guards of conventional wisdom ” and “ a conventional wisdom zombie ” .
— A 7 - page scathing analysis of Russert and Meet The Press , based on this premise : “ The reason the conventional wisdom survives no matter how many times its lies are exposed is that shows like Meet The Press allow their guests to go unchallenged . ”
Western Digital picked an appropriate name for its new 10,000 - rpm ( rotations per minute ) hard drive .
Dubbed the WD VelociRaptor , this new drive roared through the PC World Test Center 's performance tests in April 2008 , besting all other models in the field at that time .
( We have subsequently updated our Top 10 Internal Hard Drives chart . )
Most hard drives tend to show strengths and weaknesses in our tests , but the $ 300 VelociRaptor demonstrated its strength across the entire suite of hard - drive measures .
In one of its most impressive feats , the VelociRaptor required just 89 seconds to write 3.06GB of files and folders , besting another strong - performing model from Western Digital , the Caviar SE16 750 GB , by 32 seconds -- a 26 percent improvement .
The latest in Western Digital 's family of Raptor 10,000 - rpm drives , the 300GB VelociRaptor also doubles the capacity of WD 's previous - generation 150GB Raptor drive .
The company plans to market the drive to gamers and PC enthusiasts first , but the VelociRaptor is suitable for enterprise - class applications , too .
The drive 's rating for mean time between failure is 1.2 million hours , which puts it on a par with enterprise - grade drives .
Installing the drive was easy ; but as soon as you take the drive out of the box , you 'll notice that the VelociRaptor is no ordinary hard drive .
Western Digital squeezed it into a 2.5 - inch chassis ; traditionally , desktop hard drives -- whether 7200 - rpm or 10,000 - rpm models -- are 3.5 inches long .
( Though the drive itself measures only 2.5 inches , the VelociRaptor is designed to fit in a 3.5 - inch drive bay . )
WD says that it chose the 2.5 - inch form for a couple of reasons .
First , from a mechanical standpoint , maximum flutter occurs at the outer edges of a spinning hard disk ; but advances in areal density , even in smaller 2.5 - inch disk platter designs , meant that WD could reduce the area , and still have double the areal density of the two - year - old 150 GB Raptor drive .
Second , the company devised a new way to manage heat generation , which remains a major concern with hard drives , particularly 10,000 - rpm models .
Western Digital tackles the issue head - on by mounting the 2.5 - inch VelociRaptor drive into a heat sink sled .
The IcePack heat sink helps the VelociRaptor run cooler than the previous - generation Raptor ; WD says that the Ice Pack reduces the temperature by about 5 degrees .
And because the sled doubles as the VelociRaptor 's mounting adapter , the 2.5 - inch drive fits smoothly into a 3.5 - inch drive bay .
The VelociRaptor WD3000 GLFS shipped in RAID 0 configuration on the high - performance Alienware Area -51 ALX gaming desktop by the end of April .
The $ 300 drive subsequently entered mass distribution at Western Digital 's Web site and at selected resellers .
WASHINGTON 
The dispute over Indiana 's voter identification law that is headed to the Supreme Court next week is as much a partisan political drama as a legal tussle .
The mainly Republican backers of the law , including the Bush administration , say state - produced photo identification is a prudent measure to cut down on vote fraud — even though Indiana has never had a prosecution of the kind of fraud the law is supposed to prevent .
The opponents , mainly Democrats , view voter ID a modern - day poll tax that disproportionately affect poor , minority and elderly voters — who tend to back Democrats .
Yet , a federal judge found that opponents of the law were unable to produce evidence of a single Indiana resident who had been barred from voting because of the law .
The Supreme Court , which famously split 5 - 4 in the case that sealed the 2000 presidential election for George Bush , will take up the Indiana law on January 9 , just as the 2008 presidential primaries are getting underway .
A decision should come by late June , in time to be felt in the November elections in Indiana and in Georgia , the other state with a strict photo ID requirement , as well as in a handful of other states .
The justices will be asked to decide whether the law is an impermissible attempt to discourage certain voters or a reasonable precaution among several efforts aimed at cutting down on illegal voting .
" There 's more than a little bit of irony in going to the Supreme Court and asking them to rise above partisan politics in election cases , " said Richard Hasen , an election law expert at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles .
The court 's decision in the disputed 2000 election is partly responsible for the ensuing increase in election - related lawsuits and the loss of confidence by some groups in the voting system , Hasen said .
Yet , the other branches of government seem more politicized than ever , leaving the court as the best option despite the 2000 election dispute , he said .
Indiana argues that demands for identification are frequent in today 's society , and producing a photo ID at polling places is hardly onerous .
" In light of such widespread demands for ... government - issued photo identification , it is almost shocking that in late 2007 Indiana can be characterized as even unusual in requiring it at the polls , " the state said in its court filing .
IDENTIFICATION : Tougher measures fuel debate
The Bush administration maintains states need not wait for fraud to occur to take action to prevent it .
" The state 's interest in deterring voter fraud before it happens is evident from the monumental harm that can come from such fraud , " the government said in its supporting brief .
The law 's opponents counter that an ID may be just one card among many in most people 's wallets , but some groups are far less likely to have them .
Homeless people wanting to vote might face the most difficulty under the law .
While the state will provide a voter ID card free of charge to the poor , applicants still must have a birth certificate or other documentation to get the ID card .
" I think it 's wonderful , but if you can't prove who you are , you ca n't get an ID , " said Carter Wolf , executive director of Horizon House , which provides services to homeless people .
Getting a birth certification is n't always easy , Wolf said , or cheap .
Sometimes it can cost $ 60 to $ 70 to get a birth certificate from other states .
" Obtaining a photo identification card under Indiana law requires documentation that is difficult , if not impossible , for many homeless individuals to provide , " Carter Phillips , a leading Supreme Court lawyer , wrote in a supporting brief .
Even without an ID , indigent people can cast provisional ballots , then show up within 10 days at county offices and sign a form attesting to their vote .
But the Marion County Election Board , which includes Indianapolis , said just two of 34 voters who cast provisional ballots because they lacked voter ID showed up at county offices to validate their vote in the 2007 municipal election .
Their signatures all matched those on file , but could not be counted because of the photo ID requirement .
Hasen said while neither side has abundant evidence to back its position the fraud argument is far less plausible than the claim that and ID requirement will reduce voter turnout .
Someone wanting to sway an election through fraud would be unlikely to get individuals to show up at the polls , pretend to be someone else and then ask them to cast a secret , unverifiable ballot , said Hasen .
But he said , " When voting is more difficult , people tend to not vote . "
Opponents to the law argue the real potential for voter fraud lies in the filing of absentee ballots and that Indiana has made it easier to vote absentee in recent years .
The cases are Crawford v. Marion County Election Board , 07 - 21 , and Indiana Democratic Party v. Rokita , 07 - 25 .

The former pastor of a Northumberland County church acknowledges using parishioners ' personal information to obtain credit cards .
The Rev. Raymond Clayton pleaded guilty Monday in federal court in Williamsport to a charge of access device fraud .
He awaits sentencing in June .
The 43 - year - old Clayton is the former pastor of Grace Fellowship Church near Mount Carmel .
Following the plea , 83 - year - old church member Patricia Tomedi said , " Thank God . "
Tomedi says she 's lost 20 pounds since Clayton was charged with stealing church members ' identities .
Her 's was one of the Social Security numbers he used .
Clayton 's attorney , Assistant Public Defender Toni Byrd , has negotiated a plea agreement promising full restitution and calling for one year and one day in jail .
The church has since disbanded .

The Black Death , 1348
Printer Friendly Version >>>
Coming out of the East , the Black Death reached the shores of Italy in the spring of 1348 unleashing a rampage of death across Europe unprecedented in recorded history .
By the time the epidemic played itself out three years later , anywhere between 25 % and 50 % of Europe 's population had fallen victim to the pestilence .
The plague presented itself in three interrelated forms .
The bubonic variant ( the most common ) derives its name from the swellings or buboes that appeared on a victim 's neck , armpits or groin .
These tumors could range in size from that of an egg to that of an apple .
Although some survived
the painful ordeal , the manifestation of these lesions usually signaled the victim had a life expectancy of up to a week .
Infected fleas that attached themselves to rats and then to humans spread this bubonic type of the plague .
A second variation - pneumonic plague - attacked the respiratory system and was spread by merely breathing the exhaled air of a victim .
It was much more virulent than its bubonic cousin - life expectancy was measured in one or two days .
Finally , the septicemic version of the disease attacked the blood system .
Having no defense and no understanding of the cause of the pestilence , the men , women and children caught in its onslaught were bewildered , panicked , and finally devastated .
The Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio lived through the plague as it ravaged the city of Florence in 1348 .
The experience inspired him to write The Decameron , a story of seven men and three women who escape the disease by fleeing to a villa outside the city .
In his introduction to the fictional portion of his book , Boccaccio gives a graphic description of the effects of the epidemic on his city .
The Signs of Impending Death " The symptoms were not the same as in the East , where a gush of blood from the nose was the plain sign of inevitable death ; but it began both in men and women with certain swellings in the groin or under the armpit .
They grew to the size of a small apple or an egg , more or less , and were vulgarly called tumours .
In a short space of time these tumours spread from the two parts named all over the body .
Soon after this the symptoms changed and black or purple spots appeared on the arms or thighs or any other part of the body , sometimes a few large ones , sometimes many little ones .
These spots were a certain sign of death , just as the original tumour had been and still remained .
ADVERTISMENT
No doctor 's advice , no medicine could overcome or alleviate this disease , An enormous number of ignorant men and women set up as doctors in addition to those who were trained .
Either the disease was such that no treatment was possible or the doctors were so ignorant that they did not know what caused it , and consequently could not administer the proper remedy .
In any case very few recovered ; most people died within about three days of the appearance of the tumours described above , most of them without any fever or other symptoms .
The violence of this disease was such that the sick communicated it to the healthy who came near them , just as a fire catches anything dry or oily near it .
And it even went further .
To speak to or go near the sick brought infection and a common death to the living ; and moreover , to touch the clothes or anything else the sick had touched or worn gave the disease to the person touching .
" Varying Reactions to Disaster " ... Such fear and fanciful notions took possession of the living that almost all of them adopted the same cruel policy , which was entirely to avoid the sick and everything belonging to them .
By so doing , each one thought he would secure his own safety .
Some thought that moderate living and the avoidance of all superfluity would preserve them from the epidemic .
They formed small communities , living entirely separate from everybody else .
They shut themselves up in houses where there were no sick , eating the finest food and drinking the best wine very temperately , avoiding all excess , allowing no news or discussion of death and sickness , and passing the time in music and suchlike pleasures .
Others thought just the opposite .
They thought the sure cure for the plague was to drink and be merry , to go about singing and amusing themselves , satisfying every appetite they could , laughing and jesting at what happened .
They put their words into practice , spent day and night going from tavern to tavern , drinking immoderately , or went into other people 's houses , doing only those things which pleased them .
This they could easily do because everyone felt doomed and had abandoned his
property , so that most houses became common property and any stranger who went in made use of them as if he had owned them .
And with all this bestial behaviour , they avoided the sick as much as possible .
In this suffering and misery of our city , the authority of human and divine laws almost disappeared , for , like other men , the ministers and the executors of the laws were all dead or sick or shut up with their families , so that no duties were carried out .
Every man was therefore able to do as he pleased .
Many others adopted a course of life midway between the two just described .
They did not restrict their victuals so much as the former , nor allow themselves to be drunken and dissolute like the latter , but satisfied their appetites moderately .
They did not shut themselves up , but went about , carrying flowers or scented herbs or perfumes in their hands , in the belief that it was an excellent thing to comfort the brain with such odours ; for the whole air was infected with the smell of dead bodies , of sick persons and medicines .
Others again held a still more cruel opinion , which they thought would keep them safe .
They said that the only medicine against the plague - stricken was to go right away from them .
Men and women , convinced of this and caring about nothing but themselves , abandoned their own city , their own houses , their dwellings , their relatives , their property , and went abroad or at least to the country round Florence , as if God 's wrath in punishing men's wickedness with this plague would not follow them but strike only those who remained within the walls of the city , or as if they thought nobody in the city would remain alive and that its last hour had come . "
The Breakdown of Social Order " Brother
abandoned
brother " " One citizen avoided another , hardly any neighbour troubled about others , relatives never or hardly ever visited each other .
Moreover , such terror was struck into the hearts of men and women by this calamity , that brother abandoned brother , and the uncle his nephew , and the sister her brother , and very often the wife her husband .
What is even worse and nearly incredible is that fathers and mothers refused to see and tend their children , as if they had not been theirs .
Thus , a multitude of sick men and women were left without any care , except from the charity of friends ( but these were few ) , or the greed , of servants , though not many of these could be had even for high wages , Moreover , most of them were coarse - minded men and women , who did little more than bring the sick what they asked for or watch over them when they were dying .
And very often these servants lost their lives and their earnings .
Since the sick were thus abandoned by neighbours , relatives and friends , while servants were scarce , a habit sprang up which had never been heard of before .
Beautiful and noble women , when they fell sick , did not scruple to take a young or old man-servant , whoever he might be , and with no sort of shame , expose every part of their bodies to these men as if they had been women , for they were compelled by the necessity of their sickness to do so .
This , perhaps , was a cause of looser morals in those women who survived . "
Mass Burials
" The plight of the lower and most of the middle classes was even more pitiful to behold .
Most of them remained in their houses , either through poverty or in hopes of safety , and fell sick by thousands .
Since they received no care and attention , almost all of them died .
Many ended their lives in the streets both at night and during the day ; and many others who died in their houses were only known to be dead because the neighbours smelled their decaying bodies .
Dead bodies filled every corner .
Most of them were treated in the same manner by the survivors , who were more
concerned to get rid of their rotting bodies than moved by charity towards the dead .
With the aid of porters , if they could get them , they carried the bodies out of the houses and laid them at the door ; where every morning quantities of the dead might be seen .
They then were laid on biers or , as these were often lacking , on tables .
Such was the multitude of corpses brought to the churches every day and almost every hour that there was not enough consecrated ground to give them burial , especially since they wanted to bury each person in the family grave , according to the old custom .
Although the cemeteries were full they were forced to dig huge trenches , where they buried the bodies by hundreds .
Here they stowed them away like bales in the hold of a ship and covered them with a little earth , until the whole trench was full . "

Conyers to torture memo author : Testify voluntarily or face subpoena
Nick Juliano
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers has threatened to subpoena several former officials in the Bush administration if they do not agree to testify about their roles in the preparation of the so - called “ torture memos ” that authorized severe interrogation tactics in the war on terror .
Conyers ( D - MI ) sent letters to former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John C. Yoo , Chief of Staff to the Vice President David Addington , and former Attorney General John Ashcroft .
In each of the letters , Conyers provides a May 2 deadline for response or , he says , “ I will have no choice but to consider the use of compulsory process . ”
The three officials have offered various excuses as to why they are unable to testify , but Conyers said those excuses are not good enough .
“ Today we face a severe national challenge over charges related to the allegedly harsh treatment of detainees in U.S. custody , reportedly done with legal authorization of the Department of Justice and explicit approval from the highest officials in our government , ” Conyers wrote to Addington ( .pdf ) .
“ These are serious matters that substantially impact our national security , the safety and well - being of our troops around the world , and our nation ’s legal and moral standing .
…
[ M] ultiple sources place you at the center of these momentous events . ”
Conyers goes on to recount reports that Addington helped shape the infamous Bybee memo authorizing harsh interrogation techniques and that he was the author of a legal memo arguing that some provisions of the Geneva Conventions were “ quaint . ”
In letters to lawyers representing Yoo ( .pdf ) and Ashcroft ( .pdf ) , Conyers said they had provided no basis for refusing to testify about the memos at a planned hearing May 6 , and he said concerns about executive privilege were n’t enough to simply turn down the invitation .
“ Such issues are properly addressed on a question - by - question basis , as current DOJ officials have done , not by a blanket refusal to testify , ” Conyers wrote .
Whether the subpoena threat will have its desired affect remains to be seen , but the Bush administration and its former members have been adept at delaying testimony and ignoring congressional subpoenas .
The House issued contempt of Congress citations against White House chief of staff Josh Bolten and former counsel Harriet Miers in February .
Those came six months after Bolten and Miers ignored subpoenas from Conyers ’ committee , and the issue is still tied up in court .
Geologists at the University of Illinois have confirmed the discovery of Earth 's inner , innermost core , and have created a three - dimensional model that describes the seismic anisotropy and texturing of iron crystals within the inner core .
" For many years , we have been like blind men touching different parts of an elephant , " said U. of I. geologist Xiaodong Song .
" Now , for the fist time , we have a sense of the entire elephant , and see what the inner core of Earth really looks like . "
Using both newly acquired data and legacy data collected around the world , Song and postdoctoral research associate Xinlei Sun painstakingly probed the shape of Earth 's core .
The researchers report their findings in a paper accepted for publication in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters , and posted on its Web site .
Composed mainly of iron , Earth 's core consists of a solid inner core about 2,400 kilometers in diameter and a fluid outer core about 7,000 kilometers in diameter .
The inner core plays an important role in the geodynamo that generates Earth 's magnetic field .
The solid inner core is elastically anisotropic ; that is , seismic waves have different speeds along different directions .
The anisotropy has been found to change with hemisphere and with radius .
In the latest work , Sun and Song describe another anomaly -- a global structure -- found within the inner core .
" To constrain the shape of the inner core anisotropy , we needed a uniform distribution of seismic waves traveling in all directions through the core , " Sun said .
" Since the seismic waves we studied were generated by earthquakes , one challenge was acquiring enough seismic waves recorded at enough stations . "
In their analysis , Sun and Song used a three - dimensional tomography technique to invert the anisotropy of the inner core .
They parameterized the anisotropy of the inner core in both radial and longitudinal directions .
The researchers then used a three - dimensional ray tracing method to trace and retrace the seismic waves through the inner core iteratively .
What they found was a distinct change in the inner core anisotropy , clearly marking the presence of an inner inner core with a diameter of about 1,180 kilometers , slightly less than half the diameter of the inner core .
The layering of the core is interpreted as different texturing , or crystalline phase , of iron in the inner core , the researchers say .
" Our results suggest the outer inner core is composed of iron crystals of a single phase with different degrees of preferred alignment along Earth 's spin axis , " Sun said .
" The inner inner core may be composed of a different phase of crystalline iron or have a different pattern of alignment . "
Although the anisotropy of the inner core was proposed 20 years ago , " this is the first time we have been able to piece everything together to create a three - dimensional view , " Song said .
" This view should help us better understand the character , mineral properties and evolution of Earth 's inner core . "
The work was funded by the National Science Foundation .

A hypnotherapist had an 83 - minute operation on his arm with no anaesthetic .
At one point , Alex Lenkei even heard the surgeon say : " Can I have the saw , please ? "
Because he had put himself into a hypnotic trance , however , he said he felt no pain as the doctors chiselled out a walnut - sized chunk of bone from his wrist .
Mr Lenkei , 61 , had the operation to treat his painful osteoarthritis .
He said : " The results have been amazing .
I feel ace . "

Trance : Alex Lenkei could hear doctors chiselling his bones
The hypnotherapist amazed doctors by asking how things were going halfway through the surgery , at Worthing Hospital in West Sussex on Wednesday .
He said he could hear his surgeon talking as he made a four - inch - long cut into his right wrist and chiselled the bone to move a tendon .
The married father - of - one , who lives in the town , said : " It took me about 30 seconds to put myself under and I was n't aware of any part of my body apart from my arm .
" I could feel the surgeon pulling and manipulating me - then I heard the cracking of bones .
" I heard him say , ' Can I have the saw please ? ' and imagined him holding this great big thing in his hand .
But fortunately he then said ' I think we 'll use the smaller one . ' "
" He used a hammer and chisel at one stage and I could hear him hammering away at the bone .
" I heard everything he was saying to his assistants and anaesthetist , but there was no gossip .
It was a shame - I was hoping to hear something juicy . "
Surgeon David Llewellyn - Clark said the operation went well and Mr Lenkei showed no reaction during the surgery .

David Llewellyn - Clark carried out surgery
He added : " If he had been grinning and bearing it we would have known - but his heart rate and breathing remained constant throughout .
" I was n't aware he could hear us but halfway through he asked how things were going . "
Mr Lenkei , who is a registered hypnotherapist , has been practising the technique since he was 16 .
In 1996 he was hypnotised by a colleague before a 30 - minute hernia operation .
He was the one who asked to undergo the latest surgery without anaesthetic .
He said he had felt nothing , adding : " I would have certainly told them if I was in pain - I told them to zap me straight away if I cried out . "
Anaesthetist Richard Venn said the surgery would usually be carried out under general anaesthetic .
He added : " Conducting surgical operations under hypnosis has been done before , particularly in Africa , but we are very reluctant to use it over here .
You have to have medical proof
and research done . "
Studies have suggested that using hypnosis instead of anaesthetic can reduce recovery time after surgery .
But the technique 's associations with stage hypnotism have kept it at the margins of medicine .
Hypnoanaesthesia , where the patient enters a deep trance state and is told they will not feel pain , has been used to ease fears over surgery and childbirth , and to help burn victims manage their pain .
Dr Leon Gevertz , of the British Society of Medical and Dental Hypnosis , said that heart operations had been carried out under hypnosis .
Studies found that the practice relaxes the patient and can alter the perception of pain or increase the pain threshold .
However , it works only on those susceptible to the technique .
Mr Lenkei has taught students at the Royal College of Nursing how to induce hypnoanaesthesia and said he would consider undergoing further operations without anaesthetic .

If there ’s one thing I love , it ’s academics who take on the work of investigative journalism , because they are dogged .
This has been a bad week for the SSRI antidepressants .
First there ’s the stuff you already know : bad data got buried .
In a cracking new analysis of the “ publication bias ” in the literature , a group of academics this week published a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine which listed all the trials on SSRIs that had ever been formally registered with the FDA , and then went to look for the same trials in the academic literature .
37 studies were assessed by the FDA as positive , and with one exception , every single one of those positive trials got properly written up and published .
Meanwhile , 22 studies that had negative or iffy results were simply not published at all , and 11 were written up and published in a way that described them as having a positive outcome .
You ’re a sophisticated reader , so you understand this does n’t mean that they ’re necessarily rubbish drugs , but you also understand that this is dodgy behaviour , all the same .
That ’s the easy bit .
The second paper is more interesting .
Over the past few decades , we have been subjected to a relentless medicalisation of everyday life by people who want to sell us sciencey solutions .
Chancers from the $ 56 billion international food supplement industry want you to believe that intelligence needs fish oil , and that obesity is just your body ’s way of crying out for chromium pills ( “ to help balance sugar metabolism ” etc ) .
Similarly , quacks from the $ 600 billion pharma industry sell the idea that depression is caused by low serotonin levels in the brain and so – therefore – you need drugs which raise the serotonin levels in your brain : you need SSRI antidepressants , which are “ selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ” .
That ’s the serotonin hypothesis .
It was always shaky , and the evidence now is hugely contradictory .
I ’m not giving that lecture here , but as a brief illustration , there is a drug called tianeptine – a selective serotonin reuptake enhancer , not an inhibitor – and yet research shows this drug is a pretty effective treatment for depression too .
Meanwhile in popular culture the depression / serotonin theory is proven and absolute , because it was never about research , or theory , it was about marketing , and journalists who pride themselves on never pushing pills or the hegemony will still blindly push the model until the cows come home .
Which brings us on to our second new study on antidepressants .
Two academics , a lecturer and an associate professor of neuroanatomy , decided to chase journalists , in the style of this column – or rather , in the style of this column on crack – and fired off multiple emails , demanding unrealistic levels of referencing from doubtless irritated and baffled hacks .
They proudly document their work with an excessive number of examples , and I will pick just a few .
“ In the New York Times ( 12/31/06 ) , Michael Kimmelman wrote about the life and work of Joseph Schildkraut , one of the founders of the chemical theory of depression .
The Times reporter stated , ‘ A groundbreaking paper that he published in 1965 suggested that naturally - occurring chemical imbalances in the brain must account for mood swings , which pharmaceuticals could correct , a hypothesis that proved to be right [ italics added ] . ' ”
The prof ’s gave chase .
“ E - mails to the author requesting a citation to support his statement went unanswered . ” A victory for the noble pedantry .
“ In another New York Times article ( 6/19/07 ) , ‘ On the Horizon , Personalized Depression Drugs , ’ Richard Friedman , the chairman of Psychopharmacology at the Weill Cornell Medical College , stated : ‘ For example , some depressed patients who have abnormally low levels of serotonin respond to SSRIs , which relieve depression , in part , by flooding the brain with serotonin . ' ”
They chased , and they give no quarter .
“ For his evidence he supplied a 2000 paper by Nestler titled , “ Neurobiology of Depression , ” which focuses on the hypothalamic pituitary system , but not on serotonin . ”
The serotonin hypothesis will always be a winner in popular culture , even when it has flailed in academia , because it speaks to us of a simple , abrogating explanation , and plays into our notions of a crudely dualistic world where there can only be weak people , or uncontrollable , external , molecular pressures .
As they said in the Pittsburgh Tribune Review ( 4/2/07 ) “ It ’s not a personal deficit , but something that needs to be looked at as a chemical imbalance . ”
The real world is more complicated than this simple dichotomy .
But when you probe the evidence for simple fables about serotonin stories in popular culture , you ’ll find “ the quote was attributed to a psychiatric nurse practitioner , the author did not respond to e-mails , and the nurse ’s e-mail was not available ” .

The subprime mortgage crisis constitutes the worst banking error in my lifetime .
Nothing else comes close .
It has visibly begun to unravel .
The European Central Bank on Tuesday , December 18 , opened a line of credit of $ 500 billion to commercial banks .
The Federal Reserve System under Greenspan was the prime instigator .
It forced down short - term interest rates by supplying the overnight bank - to - bank loan market with sufficient liquidity to drop the rate to 1 % .
This encouraged banks to make loans at low rates .
These loans were short - term loans .
The borrowers then went out and bought long - term assets : bonds and mortgages .
This is known as the carry trade .
The pioneering central bank in the carry trade was the Bank of Japan .
It lowered short - term rates from about 7 % in 1990 to just above zero in 1999 , where it stayed until mid-2006 .
But the yen is not the world ’s reserve currency .
The U.S. dollar is .
Through a complex combination of government - licensed monopoly ( Federal Reserve System ) , implied government safety nets for mortgage investors ( Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac ) , creative finance ( asset - backed securities ) , and credit - rating services that were either stunningly naïve or compensated in ways not beneficial to objective analysis , brokers marketed a series of high - commission , fast - sale investment packages that sold like hotcakes until August , 2007 .
Then , without warning , they stopped selling .
These packages had sold all over the world .
European banks got in on the action , marketing these investment packages to their clients .
Americans have seen all this before : the savings and loan crisis of the 1980’s .
The S&L ’s were borrowed short ( depositors ) and lent long ( home buyers ) .
Then the rules changed .
The government in 1980 abolished Regulation Q , which had limited the rate of interest that banks and S&L ’s could pay to depositors .
A rate war began .
The government had little choice .
Money market funds , which had been invented around 1975 , were not under the banking system .
They were not bound by Regulation Q .
They were paying high rates on short - term money .
Depositors were pulling funds out of banks and buying money - market funds .
The banks were hemorrhaging .
As soon as the banks could compete with money market funds , the S&L ’s were doomed .
Their money was tied up for 30 years .
Depositors ( legally , owners ) were cashing in .
It was It ’s a Wonderful Life without the honeymoon money .
Then Congress stepped in with its own honeymoon money : about half a trillion dollars , if you count interest on the national debt .
That was the test of the mortgage carry trade .
The system failed .
We are now in the midst of another similar test .
It is much larger .
It is worldwide .
It is affecting capital markets that were once far - removed from mortgages .
MAKING HAY WHILE THE SUN SHINED
You have heard of NINJA loans : no income , no job or assets .
These were loans made by local mortgage brokers to first - time home buyers .
Poor people were offered loans at rates far lower than conventional loans .
The brokers told the prospective debtors that they could re-finance later to get long - term loans .
This was not put in writing , and so it can not be proven .
But everyone in the industry knew it was being done .
Therein lies the trap for America ’s largest banks .
“ Everyone knew . ”
If lawyers can persuade juries that everyone knew , America ’s largest banks are on the hook for more money in reparations than they have as capital .
Why ?
Fraud .
They sold investors , including European banks , investments known to be fraudulent .
Here it is , folks : what we have dreamed about .
The money - grubbing lawyers are about to wipe out the money - grubbing bankers .
There is only one hitch : the world ’s economy could crash .
Darn !
In the December 9 issue of the San Francisco Chronicle ran a great headline :
It had even better subheads :
Interest rate ‘ freeze ’ — the real story is fraudBankers pay lip service to families while scurrying to avert suits , prison
The author , Sean Olender , is a lawyer .
He explained what he thinks the Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson and the banks are really up to .
It ’s not about helping poor homeowners .
( You probably suspected this . )
The present bailout proposal was not the first one .
He describes earlier ones .
First the Treasury Department urged the creation of a new fund that would buy risky mortgage bonds as a tactic to hide what those bonds were really worth .
( Not much . )
Then the idea was to use Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy the risky loans , even if it was clear that U.S. taxpayers would eventually be stuck with the bill .
But that plan went south after Fannie suffered a new accounting scandal , and Freddie ’s existing loan losses shot up more than expected .
The first was the old standby : a government - funded bailout .
This was the now - familiar S&L solution .
It did not pass muster .
It may a year from now .
The second was a bailout by two of the perps .
But their capital is tied up in mortgages .
The flow of investors ’ new funds is faltering .
These two agencies need honeymoon money .
They are in no position to provide it .
Now , just unveiled Thursday , comes the “ freeze , ” the brainchild of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
It sounds good :
For five years , mortgage lenders will freeze interest rates on a limited number of “ teaser ” subprime loans .
Other homeowners facing foreclosure will be offered assistance from the Federal Housing Administration .
Mr. Olender is not persuaded by the sincerity of the offer .
He perceives this as a judicial move , not an economic move .
He sees it as the government ’s attempt to place a legal moat around the banks ’ castles .
The sole goal of the freeze is to prevent owners of mortgage - backed securities , many of them foreigners , from suing U.S. banks and forcing them to buy back worthless mortgage securities at face value — right now almost 10 times their market worth .
Not being a lawyer , I am willing to ascribe economic motives as well .
If whole neighborhoods face eviction , they are likely to decline very rapidly into residences of illegal drug salesmen and crackheads .
These houses are not in upscale parts of town .
Once in decline , borderline neighborhoods are almost impossible to restore .
The value of the lenders ’ capital is at risk .
Keeping homeowners in their homes does make economic sense .
The flow of mortgage payments remains .
The houses are maintained .
But I digress .
The ticking time bomb in the U.S. banking system is not resetting subprime mortgage rates .
The real problem is the contractual ability of investors in mortgage bonds to require banks to buy back the loans at face value if there was fraud in the origination process .
And , to be sure , fraud is everywhere .
It ’s in the loan application documents , and it ’s in the appraisals .
There are e-mails and memos floating around showing that many people in banks , investment banks and appraisal companies — all the way up to senior management — knew about it .
That is the supposed key to the prosecution : “ Everyone knew . ”
If everyone knew , then defrauded investors have a legal case .
Anyway , they would have a case if they were not trying to collect from the real masters of America , the multinational banks .
There are lots of people who would like to muzzle subpoena - happy New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to buy time and make this all go away .
Cuomo is just inches from getting what he needs to start putting a lot of people in prison .
I bet some people are trying right now to make him an offer “ he ca n’t refuse . ”
Here we have an attorney general who understands how his immediate predecessor became the Governor of New York : handing out lots of subpoenas to big business CEO ’s .
Cuomo has a severe case of subpoena envy .
Mr. Olender then gets to the heart of the matter : the bottom line .
What is the bottom line ?
The bottom line .
The catastrophic consequences of bond investors forcing originators to buy back loans at face value are beyond the current media discussion .
The loans at issue dwarf the capital available at the largest U.S. banks combined , and investor lawsuits would raise stunning liability sufficient to cause even the largest U.S. banks to fail , resulting in massive taxpayer - funded bailouts of Fannie and Freddie , and even FDIC .
I see what he is getting at .
There appears to have been fraud at every level .
But this , it seems to my judicially untrained eye , is the very loophole the banks need .
If everyone knew , as seems likely , and nobody blew the whistle , which is clear in retrospect , then these practices were common .
If they were common , then they were not criminal .
The government knew , and the government did nothing .
Ditto for the Federal Reserve , the Comptroller of the Currency , and every other regulatory agency — Federal , state , and local .
When a criminal conspiracy acts in a criminal fashion , it can be prosecuted .
But when a criminal conspiracy has been licensed by the government , and has de facto run the government of every major nation for a century , it will be difficult to get a conviction .
None dare call it criminal .
Mr. Olender is correct in his observation regarding the magnitude of this economic liability .
The problem is n’t just subprime loans .
It is the entire mortgage market .
As home prices fall , defaults will rise sharply — period .
And so will the patience of mortgage bondholders .
Different classes of mortgage bonds from various risk pools are owned by different central banks , funds , pensions and investors all over the world .
Even your pension or 401 ( k ) might have some of these bonds in it .
This is the domino effect .
The subprime mess cannot be contained .
It is like an untreated cancer cell .
It will spread .
Mr. Olender means well , but he suffers from an affliction that is almost universal where the banking system is involved : terminal naïveté .
Perhaps some U.S. government department can make veiled threats to foreign countries to suggest they will suffer unpleasant consequences if their largest holders ( central banks and investment funds ) do n’t go along with the plan , but how could it be possible to strong - arm everyone ?
How ?
The same way the Bank of England and Parliament have been strong - arming the British since 1694 .
If you were to identify the longest - running , most successful example of political strong - arming in modern history , you could do no better than to study the Bank of England ’s relationship with Parliament .
This example is today universal .
Every nation on earth has a central bank except Andorra and Monaco .
Monaco has a casino instead .
Andorra has sheep , but at least only the sheep get sheared .
It is different for the rest of us .
What would be prudent and logical is for the banks that sold this toxic waste to buy it back and for a lot of people to go to prison .
If they knew about the fraud , they should have to buy the bonds back .
The time to look into this is before the shredders have worked their magic — not five years from now .
What would be even more prudent and even more logical would be to abolish central banking .
But the world is neither prudent nor logical when it comes to fractional reserve banking and the bubbles it creates .
Yet this bubble is like no other in my lifetime .
It is tied to housing , and the entire Western world has been affected .
The home - owning masses feel rich because their homes have risen in price .
Why has this happened ?
Because buyers of houses just one price range down have sold and want to move up .
Houses are rising because suckers at the bottom were lured into preposterous loans .
I do n’t mean the home buyers , who got in with no money down .
I mean the suckers who lent them the money .
Here is why the government is getting in .
If the government bails out the new homeowners , it baptizes the entire procedure retroactively .
The goal of the freeze may be to delay bond investors from suing by putting off the big foreclosure wave for several years .
But it may also be to stop bond investors from suing .
If the investors agreed to loan modifications with the “ real ” wage and asset information from refinancing borrowers , mortgage originators and bundlers would have an excuse once the foreclosure occurred .
They could say , “ Fraud ?
What fraud ?!
You knew the borrower ’s real income and asset information later when he refinanced ! ”
This is what the freeze bill is all about .
It is going to sail through Congress .
The President will sign it .
As soon as it ’s law , the banks are far safer than before .
There may be lawsuits , but judges will know where their bread is buttered .
Mr. Olender goes on to name names and identify culprits .
Here , I have decided not to follow his lead .
CONCLUSION
The economic losses are gigantic and will grow .
The trickle of bad news is going to become a flood over the next year .
It will wear down the resistance of perma-bulls , who believe that the Federal Reserve can save the day and save the stock market .
All over the world , the repercussions of bad loans , carry - trade leverage , and relatively tight money are going to be felt .
This has been a huge pool of investment errors .
This has sucked in the best and the brightest people on earth , those who allocate capital .
They trusted Alan Greenspan .
They trusted artificially low interest rates .
They trusted fiat money .
That trust has been betrayed , as always .
But this time , it has been betrayed on a scale that puts the world ’s banking system at risk .
The bailouts have only just begun .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Found : drinking companions to join elderly gentleman for a friendly beer at his local pub .
Mike Hammond was bombarded with offers after advertising in his village post office for someone to accompany his 88 - year - old father Jack on visits to a southern England pub from a nursing home .
He offered the lucky winner 7 pounds ( $ 14 ) an hour plus expenses and , after sifting through the applicants , decided on a job - share .
Drinking duties are to be divided between a retired doctor and a former military man .
“ Dad ’s now going to be going down to the pub several times a week -- three with his new friends and twice with me , ” Mike Hammond told The Times on Thursday .
“ I want to give him some of his old life back . ”

I recently had dinner with a friend of mine , a physician - turned - businessperson - turned - founder .
We were discussing the virtues of transferable skills , and I asked him what management tools he brings to entrepreneurship from his earlier career in medicine .
He pondered a bit before confessing that radiology skills do n’t , in fact , translate so easily .
Instead he referred me to what he called “ one of the most valuable books ” he ’s ever read .
Turns out he was referring to one of the original publications to come out of the famed Harvard Negotiation Project , a seminal workshop that was started in 1979 with a mission to improve dispute and conflict resolution .
Harvard ’s researchers focused on negotiation for all kinds of conflicts , from the interpersonal to the international geopolitical .
But since conflict negotiation is something businesspeople do daily , it ’s not surprising that the fruits of their work were also published as a business book just two years later in the now classic best - seller , “ Getting to YES : Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In , ” by Roger Fisher , Bill Ury and Bruce Patton .
I picked it up .
As my friend suggested , it ’s as relevant as it always was , a common sense approach to effective negotiation rooted in five basic ideas .
And if you can manage to absorb and apply these five rules , you ’ll be much better off going into your next deal .
1. Do n’t Bargain Over Positions
Most of us begin negotiation by identifying a position and arguing for it , such as : “ I want to retain the CEO title . ”
But such positional bargaining can limit your ability to arrive at a “ wise agreement ” that benefits both parties — the proverbial middle ground and the whole purpose of negotiation .
Instead of thinking of a “ position , ” identify the goal .
You want remuneration for the sweat you put into your company .
You want , for example , status ( to remain CEO ) .
But a specific position is binary — you either get it or you do n’t .
A goal can be attained in many ways , giving you many more options for arriving at a solution .
2. Separate the People From the Problem
Most negotiation is emotional .
You want something , after all .
And emotion clouds our objectivity .
But you can limit the emotional content of your negotiation by thinking of the person you ’re talking to as your partner and the problem you ’re trying to solve as an object .
Take , for example , the question of how much a company ’s equity is worth .
In this case , you ’re not negotiating against the investor over a position , you ’re engaged with that person to arrive at the right answer to the question .
Some will urge you to make your negotiation opponent a partner , but this can lead to Stockholm Syndrome .
Instead just think of engaging the other person , using their input to arrive at the right answer .
Maintain your independence .
3. Focus on Interests
We all have interests .
The pursuit to fulfill our interests leads up to adopt positions .
But bargaining for stated positions , such as titles , will not necessarily produce a wise agreement that takes care of the interests that led you to adopt the positions in the first place .
Think instead : I want to remain engaged in the business .
There are many ways to achieve goals without having specific positions .
4. Invent Options for Mutual Gain
This is the creative part .
You must examine each other ’s interests to come up with options in which both parties gain .
Your investors have an interest in a pro-CEO who can sell into large corporations ( you ’ve never done that ) .
You need funding , but also want to remain engaged .
Both parties can draft a list of options for your new role that satisfy everyone ’s needs : COO , president , chief innovation officer , etc. Negotiate from this list .
5. Insist on Using Objective Criteria
We all have personal standards .
CEO conveys more status than chairman , etc .
The key is to let go of personal standards in favor of objective ones upon which both parties can agree .
( Think of the Kelley Blue Book , a set of agreed - upon standards for those looking to buy or sell a car ) .
But here you have to do some real homework and investigate the objective standards that apply to your negotiation ahead of time .
Some to consider : market value ; legal or business precedent ; scientific judgments ( patents ) ; efficiency ; and reciprocity .
McCain ’s proposal , which he called the “ HOME Program , ” would let some homeowners replace their mortgage for one that is more in line with the depressed value of their home .
McCain unexpectedly moves on housing
After saying last month that he was “ prepared to examine new proposals ” for addressing the mortgage crisis , John McCain instead came out on Thursday and unveiled a new plan of his own .
With yet another monthly government report showing more job losses — and some economists describing the country as already in recession — McCain ’s stepped - up response reflects the political peril of not doing enough to respond to homeowners .

So in a speech at a window contacting business in Brooklyn , N.Y. , the presumptive GOP nominee rolled out a plan to aid those who have lost their homes or are in danger of foreclosure .
McCain ’s proposal , which he called the HOME Program , would let some homeowners replace their mortgage for one that is more in line with the depressed value of their home .
He said the plan , to be guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration , would be limited to those defaulting on only a primary residence and to those who could afford a new mortgage .
“ There is nothing more important than keeping alive the American dream to own your own home , ” McCain said in a midday speech at Windows We Are Inc .
“ And priority number one is to keep well - meaning , deserving homeowners who are facing foreclosure in their homes . ”
While McCain was detailing his initiative , his Senate colleagues in Washington were passing a housing package of their own .
But McCain offered criticism of that legislation , suggesting that it did n’t address the central problem .
“ Tax breaks for builders , funds to purchase homes in foreclosure , and tax credits that are not targeted to where the need is greatest do not constitute the federal help that is warranted , ” McCain said .
The Senate bill , which passed 84 - 12 , contains all three : billions in tax breaks for the home building industry , $ 4 billion in grants to communities to purchase abandoned foreclosed houses and tax credits to people who buy homes in foreclosure .
None of the three presidential candidates showed up to vote .
But both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama noted their Republican rival ’s previous hesitation to offer solutions and hammered him for what they described as a plan both overdue and insufficient .
Douglas Holtz - Eakin , a top economic adviser to McCain , said his candidate was n’t being inconsistent .
“ This plan is designed to reward deserving homeowners , ” Holtz - Eakin noted .
“ He ’s always said that . ”
Plainly , though , McCain and his campaign aides are grappling with finding a middle ground between the interventionist approach favored by Obama and Clinton and the preference of most conservatives not to reward what they view as careless behavior on the part of home buyers who got in over their head .
In a speech late last month on the topic , McCain said he would evaluate new proposals based on the principle that it “ is not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly , ” but he offered no concrete solutions .
After facing criticism for not addressing the problem , McCain issued an unusual statement that same week reiterating that he would consider proposals .
But he only called on private lending institutions to help homeowners .
As on other issues , McCain is hearing from a wide range of voices on the credit crunch , which may explain his decision to unveil a plan Thursday .
“ He ’s got to make a decision , ” said one experienced Republican economist who requested anonymity to speak candidly .
“ He ’s got a Phil Gramm on one extreme with the view of , ‘ Let 's not get involved . ’
But many of his other advisers would take the interventionist position . ”
The pragmatists in McCain ’s circle seem to have won out .
“ He sounded like the old John McCain , the ' Teddy Roosevelt ' John McCain , ” observed Georgetown University professor John Haskell of the candidate ’s speech Thursday .
“ That is , that an energetic federal government needs to be there as countervailing force to the market when the market does n’t perform properly . ”
But the issue highlights the balancing act McCain has to walk to avoid a laissez - faire tag in tough times while also not unduly angering his limited - government base .
“ We ’re going to be smart about it and not just throw money at the problem , but government does have a role , ” is how Haskell characterized the third way .
McCain ’s proposal Thursday , though , has already raised the antennae of some in the libertarian wing of the GOP coalition .
“ I do worry that he has instincts toward government activism , ” said David Boaz , executive vice - president of the Cato Institute .
Citing an imaginary young couple making a combined $ 72,000 who bought a $ 500,000 home they could n’t afford , Boaz said that “ a lot of people out there who see this are saying , ' What is this nonsense [ about intervening ] ? ' ”
The truer indicator of McCain ’s intentions will come next week , when he is to give a major speech that Holtz - Eakin said would include both a broad vision for an improved economy and specific proposals for how to get there .
In his final sentence Thursday in Brooklyn , though , McCain appeared to signal that his prescription for bolstering the economy would include at least a helping hand from Washington .
“ But let me make it clear that in these challenging times , I am committed to using all the resources of this government and great nation to create opportunity and make sure that every deserving American has a good job and can achieve their American dream . ”

Expected to debut on May 2 , the Surface Pro 5 is reported to keep the Microsoft Connector instead of moving on to the USB type C .
Soon to be taking place , Microsoft ’s new hardware event will be taking place and will hopefully be showing off the much anticipated Surface devices .
The Surface Pro 5 is one of the most anticipated hybrids to have been announced and hints at massive changes happening to it .
Most of the relevant education information will be announced at the hardware event but no one knows for certain if there will be an announcement involving any of the Surface devices .
According to previous reports , the next generation of hybrid tablets made by Microsoft will be targeted for the educational sector .
Tech enthusiasts are expecting a refresh from the old Surface Pro 4 tablet due to the fact that Microsoft is holding such a large event , a new tablet has to be on the list in one form or another .
What information is almost sure to be accurate is the fact that the event on the 2nd of May will not host any Surface Book 2 presentations as the device might not be ready for release yet .
An informant for The Verge has reported that the Surface Phone will not be released either .
With these out of the way , the Surface Pro 5 would be the only good reason for Microsoft to put up such an event .
From what is known about the iPad Pro 2 , tech groups have found out that Apple will be marketing the 10.5 - inch tablet for educational segments .
Knowing this , it would be logical for Microsoft to be taking the same approach with their Surface Pro 5 and Windows 10 Cloud in order to maintain competition with their Apple counterpart .
Sandwalk , PZ and Greg Laden all picked up on this story of creationists providing false information on science to students at Denver area museums .
I first caught the story about a week ago at ABC News .
Reading through the news article I quickly realized that there was not a single correct observation about science that the tour guides discussed .
Everything mentioned to the students was either absolutely false , taken out of context , or told in a directly misleading way .
I was going to blog about it as theocracy , but parents are entitled to send their kids to hear this message even the information their kids are getting is incorrect .
It is more correctly termed educational child abuse .
I was particularly intrigued by the explanation given for the long , sharp teeth of tyrannosaurs in the context of a Garden of Eden in which there was no death ( hence , no meat - eating ) :
Jack asked , “ If this creature was designed to eat meat from the very start , what would he have to do until Adam and Eve sinned and death entered the world ?
What would he have to do ? ”
The children replied in chorus , “ Starve . ”
“ Fast and pray for The Fall .
Is that likely ? ” Jack asked .
“ The answer is , everyone look at me and say , ‘ No . ’
Try that with me . ' ”
“ No ! ” the children replied .
Ok , so much for an “ explanation ” .
I noticed these kids were all very young and well …. gullible .
( P.T. Barnum would have had a field day with this group ! ) .
Like I ’ve said before , creationists need small kids and stupid people to form an audience ; otherwise they have no one who will listen to them .
The tyrannosaur teeth reminded me , however , of a post I had last year marking the opening of Ken Ham ’s Creation Museum .
I was honored that this post was nominated for Open Lab 2007 , but unfortunately did not make the cut ( given the quality of the entries , I was just glad to have been nominated ) .
The post addressed the very issue of tyrannosaur teeth and how science really operates ( a method lost on intelligent design proponents and other creationists ) .
I ’m re-posting it for your reading pleasure below the fold :
A reader , responding to my Creation Museum Carnival post on what Ken Ham ’s Creation Museum wo n’t be telling kids about teeth , cautioned me that one argument in particular was weak and that Answers In Genesis views could not be so easily dispatched .
The argument in question is that differential tooth form clearly reflects differential diet among animals today .
We can use this to infer diets for extinct species by comparing their teeth with what we know of the dentition and diets in modern animals .
This is contrary to the view held by Ken Ham and the AIG PhDs who maintain that all animals were vegetarian prior to the Fall of Adam , including tyrannosaurs .
This aspect of natural history has to be true for Ham and fellow creationists in order for them to retain consistency with a specific verse in Genesis .
So they argue that the dietary inferences paleontologists and other evolutionists make from teeth cannot be correct .
As an example of this , Ham himself has pointed out that tyrannosaur teeth and bear teeth are both “ sharp ” and yet the bear ’s diet is comprised of a significant portion of plant foods ; hence there is no real reason to think tyrannosaurs could n’t have also been vegetarians .
My response was that bear teeth and tyrannosaur teeth are not alike at all , as Ham suggests .
( Of course Ham only indicated that both species possessed teeth that were “ sharp ” , not necessarily similar in morphology .
But this is an example of deliberate subterfuge the AIG staff does best : gloss over the specifics and make the necessary generalization to prove your point .
There is not doubt that in describing the teeth of tyrannosaurs and bears as “ sharp ” Ham is expecting that his audience will understand him to mean “ the same ” ) .
If you are interested in the simple question of why bear teeth are different from tyrannosaur teeth , the observation still remains that tyrannosaurs have teeth much more in common with those of modern carnivores than plant eaters .
Again , from this I would have to infer that tyrannosaurs were clearly carnivores .
At this point , the only defense Ken Ham can come back with is a line from the bible† .
However , my reader pointed out some additional issues to consider that at first glance would re-open the case for tooth morphology having anything to do with diet and at least force us to ask if AIG might have a viable alternative .
He basically made three points ( except for words in quotes I ’m paraphrasing ) :
1 ) polar bears feed exclusively on other animals , yet their teeth are “ hardly different ” from other bears ;
2 ) flat teeth are for grinding / chewing and the fact dinosaurs had gizzards would mean that scimitar - toothed species like Tyrannosaurus could have eaten plants , swallowed them whole and let their gizzards do the work ;
3 ) “ As for serrations ” the pro-sauropod group of dinosaurs , thought to be herbivores , “ … had them on their teeth like Tyrannosaurus ” .
Certainly the responses to these observations are important , but that is not what prompted me to write this post .
What really intrigued me was the process I engaged in while obtaining the information .
It is the process of discovery that , as much as the answers , serves to radically distinguish science from creationism in all its forms .
As I said , my reader raised several issues that , on face value , would be sufficient for most people to stop and wonder if Ham and AIG were n’t at least raising a legitimate issue .
For Ham , AIG , and on a different level , the intelligent design advocates , inquiry would completely cease at this point .
See , O’Brien is wrong : polar bear teeth are hardly different from other bear teeth and they exclusively eat meat … hence it is possible that tyrannosaurs ate vegetation at one time .
Here , the entire goal is accomplished : raise reasonable doubt with the general populace at large .
But science follows a completely different process .
Upon reading the phrase “ polar bear teeth are hardly different from other bears ” the first thing I did was ask myself , “ is that true ? ” and reach for a book on mammalian anatomy ; and I did it so sub-consciously and automatically that the significance of the act did not become apparent until a few hours later .
Scientists constantly question whether their data ( and others ’ ) are correct …it ’s ingrained as part of the process .
The same can not be said for creationists .
Turns out , polar bear teeth are not “ hardly different ” – their back teeth are distinctly more carnassial ( for ripping meat , not grinding ) than those of their ursid ( bear family ) cousins .
They are not completely like the back teeth of obligate carnivores like wolves , but it also turns out that mostly what they eat is seal fat and they are not entirely carnivorous ( although clearly more so than brown or black bears ) .
On the heels of an automatic question when being confronted with a new “ observation ” also came an automatic mental prediction ( also an inherent part of science but not of creationism or intelligent design ) :
IF tooth morphology is largely explained by diet , THEN another species of bear with a radically different diet should also exhibit radically different tooth morphology from other bears .
Sure enough , the Panda , which subsists on bamboo , exhibits a much different tooth morphology than seen in other bears .
But the scientific process did n’t stop there .
It came along with me as I read through my reader ’s list of observations .
The gizzard idea was interesting , but do all dinosaurs have gizzards ?
No , they are suspected in only a few species because of the presence of “ gastroliths ” or gizzard stones .
And again , IF tooth morphology is a good predictor of diet , then I was betting that the only dinosaurs found to have them so far are probably those with teeth expected to be good for chewing vegetation and probably limited to sauropods and not found in carnivorous dinosaurs – sure enough , that ’s the case .
Finally , I wondered if the “ serrated ” teeth of pro-sauropods were really like tyrannosaurs .
Of course I had n’t mentioned tyrannosaurs having serrated teeth in my original post , but that ’s part of the overall morphology of a tooth and they do have a serrated edge .
But “ serration ” is not equivalent to meat eating , and in fact iguanas , which are mostly vegetarian , also have serrated teeth .
Turns out pro-sauropod teeth are also a lot like iguanas , and in addition are very small , unlike the very large carnivorous teeth of tyrannosaur – i.e. much more in line with eating vegetation than meat .
But science is also about “ multiple lines of evidence ” … so are there other observations about diet that are consistent with the hypothesis that tooth morophology is largely explained by diet ?
Yes .
Many readers of the Creation Museum Carnival pointed out in the comments that tyrannosaur coprolites ( fossil feces ) do n’t contain plant materials – another observation consistent with the hypothesis .
Microscopic analysis of early hominid teeth show that Paranthropus , thought to subsist almost exclusively on hard seeds , nuts and roots because of the unique structure of its teeth and skull , actually shows pitting and gouging expected of that kind of diet .
And Australopithecus , suspected of having a more omnivorous diet like humans ( again , because of their tooth morphology ) ?
Microscopic analysis shows a smooth surface on the tooth as in modern humans .
So where does that put us with regard to evidence consistent with the null hypothesis that tooth morphology is a very good indicator of diet ? :
– bear teeth unlike tyrannosaur teeth
– bear teeth showing variation in tooth morphology with diet ;
– gizzard stones highly correlated with dinosaur species whose teeth suggest plant eating
– tooth morphology in pro-sauropods consistent with largely vegetarian ignuanas
– microscopic analysis of tooth wear consistent with dietary differences between early hominids Paranthropus and Australopithecus
And evidence that is consistent with the AIG hypothesis that tooth form has nothing to do with diet ?
– a line in the bible
I may be off here , but I ’m guessing it ’s a bit early to reject the null hypothesis in favor of helping Ken Ham maintain his belief in a literal meaning of Genesis .
There is no reason to think that the diet of tyrannosaurs was vegetarian at any stage of its evolution and Ken Ham ’s personal interpretation of that line is clearly in error .
I would suggest he look at some alternative explanations of his own … and he can start with those I outlined in my footnote …
† I have to digress here a moment :
If you believe the bible to be authoritative from the start , then perhaps that ’s enough evidence for you and you can dismiss any observational evidence of the real world .
And that ’s fine … but it is n’t science .
However , those who accept creationism never consider other alternatives on this matter themselves ( although they expect everyone else to consider theirs ) : 1 ) the bible is not divinely inspired at all , but merely a collection of different types of writing form Bronze and Iron Age people who were trying to explain the world around them without reference to the scientific knowledge we have today ; 2 ) the bible is not divinely inspired , but has been rewritten multiple times , other texts of the time lost or purposefully destroyed , and certain texts available at the time specifically selected , all to give the appearance that the bible was divinely inspired ; 3 ) the bible was divinely inspired but never meant to be anything more than allegorical , metaphorical and symbolic in its broader meaning ; 4 ) the bible is divinely inspired but humans are too evolutionary primitive to understand the complex meaning that is really behind its passages ; 5 ) there is a god and he was responsible for creating the world , but how it was done is best captured in one of the hundreds of other creation stories around the world and not in the bible .
Of course , although some alternatives have historical and scientific angles to them and can be tested ( for example , we know parts of the bible were re-written to appear more consistent with theological statements from historical documents and early biblical texts themselves ; there is also good evidence to suggest the bible texts were purposely selected to convey specific theological arguments as if they were prophesized or demonstrated historically ) , the alternatives listed are largely theological and can be accepted or rejected pretty much solely on the basis of personal preference .
The Democratic candidates for president , Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois , have championed legislation to reduce such disparities , as have some Republicans , like Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi .
Peter R. Orszag , director of the Congressional Budget Office , said : “ We have heard a lot about growing income inequality .
There has been much less attention paid to growing inequality in life expectancy , which is really quite dramatic . ”
Life expectancy is the average number of years of life remaining for people who have attained a given age .
While researchers do not agree on an explanation for the widening gap , they have suggested many reasons , including these :
¶ Doctors can detect and treat many forms of cancer and heart disease because of advances in medical science and technology .
People who are affluent and better educated are more likely to take advantage of these discoveries .
¶ Smoking has declined more rapidly among people with greater education and income .
¶ Lower - income people are more likely to live in unsafe neighborhoods , to engage in risky or unhealthy behavior and to eat unhealthy food .
¶ Lower - income people are less likely to have health insurance , so they are less likely to receive checkups , screenings , diagnostic tests , prescription drugs and other types of care .
Even among people who have insurance , many studies have documented racial disparities .
In a recent report , the Department of Veterans Affairs found that black patients “ tend to receive less aggressive medical care than whites ” at its hospitals and clinics , in part because doctors provide them with less information and see them as “ less appropriate candidates ” for some types of surgery .
Texas educators split over teaching English basics
AUSTIN —
The inability of many Texas students to write and speak good English is like a dreadful disease requiring aggressive treatment , say some education advocates who want to use different teaching approaches .
Social conservatives on the State Board of Education , influenced in part by a retired teacher , are backing a new curriculum that increases the focus on basics , including grammar .
They 've met fierce resistance from teachers and educators who warn this emphasis will prepare students for the 1950s , not the 21st century , and embarrass Texas in the process .
They fear the state 's proposed new standards for reading and English language arts contradict established research and will only make things worse .
" The results will be bloody , " predicted one of those language experts , former English professor Joyce Armstrong Carroll .
A fight over the board 's perceived exclusion of Hispanic experts from development of the curriculum has overshadowed this larger struggle .
A public comment period on the proposed curriculum will end May 18 , and the 15 - member board is to take final action on May 22 .
If approved , it will guide how the state 's 4.7 million public schoolchildren learn English and reading over the next decade .
Much of the debate focuses on grammar and reading comprehension .
The controversy is being fanned , in part , by Donna Garner , a retired English and Spanish teacher in Hewitt .
Garner writes education - related e-mails and contributes to My StudyHall.com .
Students must learn precise communication skills , and grammar requirements must be spelled out with explicit language , she argues .
" We have a disease in Texas — our students do not know how to write and speak English well , " Garner said .
" We need to treat the disease aggressively .
" The skills need to build upon each other as the student progresses from one grade level to the next .
Learning the basics of the English language will provide students with a strong foundation upon which to write sophisticated papers and upon which to base clear communication , " she said .
The integration of grammar with writing has been taught in Texas for the past 15 years without much success , Garner said , citing statistics showing half of Texas college freshmen are in need of remedial education , compared to only 28 percent nationally .
Teachers , parents and employers are appalled by the lack of speaking and writing skills , she said .
Ignoring research
But some experts warn of dire consequences of teaching grammar separately from writing and skimping on reading comprehension .
Standardized tests like TAKS and the SAT do n't examine grammar skills in isolation — they test comprehension , said Carroll , a former professor of English and writing at McMurry University , author and co-director of Abydos Learning International in Texas .
Carroll was part of a professional educators ' coalition that offered input during the three - year process of writing standards for the state 's proposed English curriculum .
Some coalition members take a dim view of State Board of Education Chairman Don McLeroy , a Bryan dentist , and board member David Bradley of Beaumont , who have helped lead the push for a back - to - basics approach .
" Would anyone believe that the coalition 's research is bogus , but a dentist from Bryan is right ... and a man without a degree from Beaumont is right ? "
Carroll said .
Bradley says he and McLeroy " are eminently qualified because , first of all , we 're parents , we 're businesspeople and we 're taxpayers . "
Many parents , he said , complain that the current curriculum standards are " so confusing , so vague , so mushy that nobody can understand them , so we have this industry to help people interpret and explain and develop strategies and techniques to teach this mush . "
The proposed standards ignore at least 50 years of research on grammar instruction , counters Kylene Beers of The Woodlands , president - elect of the National Council of Teachers of English and a senior reading adviser to secondary schools in the Reading Writing Project at Teachers College at Columbia University .
People who yearn for a return to the basics usually attended school in the 1950s , and by the end of that decade only 20 percent of the best paying jobs required at least some college , she said , in contrast to today 's figure of 56 percent .
" When we talk about getting back to the basics in literacy education , the first thing that smart people have to do is to realize that literacy demands have shifted .
What 's basic now is n't the same as what was basic when middle - aged adults of today were in school , " she said .
Both sides view the fight over reading comprehension as bigger than the one over grammar .
" They have renamed ' whole language ' as comprehension .
It 's down to the classic debate of phonics versus whole language , " Bradley said .
Keeping it professional
Decades of research into how children learn shows that drilling the basics does not achieve desired results , said Alana Morris , language arts program director of the Aldine school district and president of the Coalition of Reading and English Supervisors of Texas .
" If you drill the basics on handouts and worksheets , then that 's where kids will be able to apply them , " she said .
" The bottom line is that drilling does n't transfer into solid writing . "
Teaching grammar is important , " but we want to teach it clearly so that kids can actually transfer it into their writing , " Morris said .
" Teaching grammar in drills makes no sense , whatsoever , to them . "
The proposal calls for students to learn how to infer the importance of a setting in a story in one grade level , visualize the setting in the next grade and then summarizing the setting two grade levels later , she said .
" It 's the most ludicrous thing I have ever seen in my entire life , " Morris said .
" Each year with higher level text you should learn how to draw inferences , how to ask questions , how to synthesize information , how to summarize . "
