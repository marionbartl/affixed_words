The BBC wants to offer content across all platforms
Full - length programmes , as well as scripts and notes , will be available for download from the BBC 's website .
The pilot is part of the BBC 's plans to eventually offer more than a million hours of TV and radio from its archive .
The BBC's Future Media boss Ashley Highfield made the announcement at an industry conference in Cannes .
" Our audience increasingly want and expect to dictate how , when and where they get our services , " he told the conference .
Mr Highfield , director of Future Media and Technology , said the BBC was starting to deliver content in a " hybrid environment " , in which digital TV , radio , the web , set - top boxes and personal video recorders were combining to offer interactive services .
The iPlayer will be re-engineered to work with Macs
He said the corporation 's end ambition was " one day enabling any viewer to access any BBC programme ever broadcast via their television " , and highlighted the need to bridge the divide between TV and content with online connections .
Broadcasters around the world are grappling with the shift to on - demand media , with many firms now offering content online or via mobile devices .
Channel 4 in the UK has launched its on - demand service via the net and cable services , while networks in the US are shifting content to platforms such as iTunes and the web .
At the Cannes event Mr Highfield announced :
The BBC 's proposed iPlayer service , offering catch - up TV via the web and cable TV , would be re-engineered to work with Apple Macs and would eventually roll out to digital terrestrial TV ( DTT ) and set - top boxes .
A trial of hybrid set - top boxes which are connected to the net and can record TV to access BBC archive material .
The desire to " future - proof Freeview with additional advanced interactive and digital functionality " so it could offer catch - up TV and access archive material .
The archive trial will make available 1,000 hours of content drawn from a mix of genres to a closed number of people .
About 50 hours - of both TV and radio programmes - will be available in an open environment for general access .
Mr Highfield said : " It will test what old programmes people really want to see , from Man Alive to The Liver Birds , how they want to see them - full length or clip compilations , and when they want them - in ' lean - forward ' exploratory mode similar to web surfing , or as a scheduled experience more akin to TV viewing . "

The trial would also be used for the BBC to understand just how much content should be offered free to viewers and " where we should draw the line between a licence fee funded service and a commercial service , " said the BBC executive .
The BBC hopes that the archive would one day be available online , and on TVs via set - top boxes , either future Freeview players or via Internet Protocol TV .
" Getting our BBC iPlayer seven day , catch - up TV service and our archive pilot out on to the web is one thing , but clearly the biggest available audience is sat in front of the television , " explained Mr Highfield .
The BBC iPlayer is expected to be launched later this year but is still subject to approval from the BBC Trust .
If launched , it is designed to offer a seven - day catch - up service for viewers who can download content onto their computers .
The BBC said it planned to offer the service first on computers running the Windows operating system and then on cable TV and other platforms such as Apple Macs , media centre PCs and smart handheld devices , such as mobiles or PDAs .
" Once we 've done all that , we 'll turn to the really tricky platforms : DTT via either PVRs or IP hybrid boxes . "
The BBC 's plans for the iPlayer were put on hold earlier this year after its regulators , the BBC Trust , asked the corporation to look at whether the iPlayer should be platform agnostic .
Mr Highfield said Apple 's " proprietary and closed framework for digital rights management gives us headaches , " but , " it is one of our top priorities to re-engineer our proposed BBC iPlayer service to work on Macs " .
Of Freeview 's future , Mr Highfield said : " It 's critical that Freeview evolves as a compelling and competitive alternative to cable and satellite . "
Mr Highfield said the BBC would be lobbying regulator Ofcom for allocation of spectrum to develop free high definition services for Freeview .
" New , hybrid set - top boxes , that combine broadcast TV with an IP connection , give us additional opportunities to deliver on - demand services via Freeview , " he said .
" Hybrid boxes are a part of the future , as important - if not more so - than standard PVRs , " he added .

Amazing is n't it ?
However ...-

Washington Post Redesign as a Wiki
After our last post on “ The Future of News ” we have been asked again and again to illustrate :
What does a newspaper as a wiki look like ?
How can newspapers bring their online and offline identity together ?
What is appropriate advertisement ?
What is an easy - to - read newspaper website ?
Of course we are still not allowed to show the work we did for our client .
So instead we made a sketch this afternoon of how the Washington Post might look as a wiki made by iA :
In the meantime it still looks like this :
Here is the direct comparison :
Now of course you want to look at it in detail , do n’t you ?
Click on the image to see a 1:1 version :
Washington Post : iA ’s wiki - based concept
Please note that :
This is just a sketch that illustrates the possibilities we ’ve discussed .
The .jpg above is made from this design .
The actual HTML dummy with the original design looks much nicer , as it scales and displays the fonts more clearly .
iA is working on a project that looks very similar to this , meaning : a ) You are not allowed to copy this in any way , and b ) we cannot show you the detail of the wiki interface just yet .
No : Wiki does n’t mean that users cannot do whatever they like , the wiki is a publishing tool for editors , first of all .
No : Users will not need to use wikicode .
We found an elegant solution for that , believe it or not .
Yes , users will be able to see an article ’s history .
We are going to post more on how a newspaper wiki would work very soon .
Before criticizing ( not enough ads , not enough stuff , too much like the printed edition , you are an idiot , etc. ) please read this , or , if you ’re in a hurry , this .
Addendum
Please read our follow - up article Newspaper Wiki : Schematics for more details .
You pull your gun , of course , shoot the guy and you 're a HERO !
Yay !
Second scenario :
There you are when you hear gunshots .
You pull your gun and turn to look for a target .
Wait !
There are two guys with guns and they seem to be shooting at each other !
Whom do you shoot ?
Third scenario :
You turn , gun in hand , looking for a target and there are five people , men , women , black , white , hispanic , all shooting at or towards each other .
It 's a fire fight !
Whom do you shoot ?
Fourth scenario :
Some other guy is drawing a bead on some guy with a gun and that guy happens to be YOU because he does n't know who the bad guy is either .
Who gets shot ?
Given that trained police officers , in several recent incidents , fired dozens of shots at several people and missed most of their shots , and , furthermore , given that no matter how cool and tough and certain and heroic you are or think you are , you CAN make a mistake , what the hell are you thinking ?
Life is n't a movie and you 're not Clint Eastwood .
Target acquisition is a serious problem in any fire fight .
The bad guys do n't always wear black hats to make them easy to identify .
People keep getting killed by mistake in combat ( can anyone say Pat Tillman ? or Giuliana Sgrena ? ) .
How do you identify the " Bad guys ? "
A few years ago an undercover New York cop was shot dead by a transit cop becasue one of them failed to obey the rules of engagement and know the signals identifying undercover cops .
In any fire fight , you can't always be sure you know the players .
That 's one reason cops and soldiers wear uniforms .
And look what keeps happening in Iraq as the bad guys keep killing people while wearing good guy uniforms .
It 's not like on TV .
You never really know what 's going on .
You do n't have a handy editor composing the shots so you cam keep track of what 's what .
Where are the shots coming from ?
Who 's hidden ?
Who 's working together ?
When six people are shooting and none of them know each other , how do you know whom to shoot ?
And given the state of race relations in the US , how many white people will just assume that it 's the black guys ?
And when shooting , how can you be sure you hit your target ?
You can 't .
Bystanders get shot .
Little girls get killed in drive - bys .
Bullets do n't care .
No matter how many times you go to the range , a fire fight is different .
The light is bad , you 're pumped on adrenaline , there 's noise and echoes .
There might be smoke or fire .
Explosions .
People are running around .
It 's terrifying and confusing .
People get killed and it might be you .
No matter how much you think you 're the hero .
I 'm tired of listening to gun-nut 's wish - fulfilment fantasies about being the hero of the day .
One of the first rules established in the old west was that nobody carries in town .
It took about three days for that rule to pass in every town , right after the first drunken brawl when someone got shot or killed .
It was very much NOT like we see in westerns .
The constant , TV - and movie - fueled fantasies of the gun crowd really get to me .
We know what happens when war planning is based on chicken hawk fantasies learned from the 4:30 movie rather than the war college .
We get Iraq .
Why should we set public policy based on Gunsmoke or Dirty Harry ?
It 's insane .
And by the way , I 'm former co-captain of my school 's rifle team , a damn good pistol shot , a former war games designer for the DOD and have researched and written extensively about black powder , guns and their history .
I 'm not anti-gun .
I like guns .
I 'm just tired of the Dirty Harry bullshit .
The Marine Corps said yesterday that the V - 22 Osprey , a hybrid aircraft with a troubled past , will be sent to Iraq this September , where it will see combat for the first time .
But because of a checkered safety record in test flights , the V - 22 will be kept on a short leash .
The Pentagon has placed so many restrictions on how it can be used in combat that the plane — which is able to drop troops into battle like a helicopter and then speed away from danger like an airplane — could have difficulty fulfilling the Marines ’ longstanding mission for it .
In Iraq , the V - 22 will begin to replace the Vietnam - era helicopters that are increasingly facing enemy fire .
The limitations on the V - 22 , which cost $ 80 million apiece , mean it cannot evade enemy fire with the same maneuvers and sharp turns used by helicopter pilots .
As a result , the craft could be more vulnerable to attack , and may result in the Marines keeping it out of the thick of battle , using it instead for less dangerous tasks .
mentioned the growing body of research showing obesity fears and “ healthy eating ” messages have taught children that low - calorie and fat - free foodsgood nutrition .
Even adults , especially women , have come to believe low - fat , low - calorie ( and low everything ) means healthy eating .
But a story in the news today demonstrates how extreme the fears of fat have become , not only among parents , but even degreed professionals caught up in the anti-obesity frenzy .
It points to very real dangers possible for their children and others following their example .
The Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale awarded a mother from South Jordan , Utah , $ 1000 for coming up with “ A + Lunches ” — ideas for parents to give their preschool and school children to “ battle the ‘ global obesity epidemic . ’ ”
It is typical of the menus increasingly being recommended by anti-“ childhood obesity ” activists .
The lunch includes no sweets , no meat and no “ fattening ” foods , only foods believed to be “ healthy ” : carrot and celery sticks , a few apple wedges and berries , a small dollop of peanut butter between flower - shaped pieces of bread , and skim milk .
The mother tested it on her four - year old .
A brief nutritional analysis of this lunch menu revealed that it supplies less than 20 % of the energy needs ( calories ) , dietary fats and iron recommended even by the government ’s Dietary Guidelines for a typical four - year old , let alone an older school child .
It demonstrates the increasingly overzealous adoption of “ healthy ” diets , arising from the belief that if a little restriction of “ bad ” foods is good then more is better .
But unbeknownst to most parents , such diets not only have no sound evidence to support them , but they have been shown to result in harm to children ’s health ....
St. Petersburg has very strange history .
It was built in the middle of the swamp by Russian emperor Peter the First .
He hired the best European architects to build him a city from Europe , but in the middle of the swamp .
Many Russian writers wrote their most dark novels about St. Petersburg .
The dark atmosphere can often be felt in the city , especially in the winter .
This dark atmosphere together with European architecture and swamps beneath create an enjoyable mixture on those photos .
This is a typical St. Petersburg yard .
Most of the yards have only one entrance with an arch , standing closed like wells .
This is a College .
And this is Post .
This is another yard .
And this is the ship in the harbor .
This is a swimming pool and a coffee shop .
Another place in the city .
This is a carwash .
The slogan on the last photo is “ The worst thing you can do with this city is to renovate it ” .
That ’s truth for some sort of native dwellers , they are really fond of the dark side beauty of this city .

In the standup comedy world , Carlos Mencia has quite a reputation with his peers for stealing material ( Joe Rogan famously called him out for it on stage at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles not too long ago ) .
Until now however it ’s pretty much been petty theft ... can anyone even name a Joe Rogan routine ?
But now Mencia has graduated to stealing from the classics , which kind of pisses us off .
Witness above , as Mensia appears to have lifted Bill Cosby ’s great “ Hi , Mom ” football routine almost word - for - word .
Lousy bastard .

By the way , it ’s true , you know :
No matter how many endless hours of catch you play with your kid , if he ever grows up to be a professional athlete , the first thing he ’s going to do when he gets his moment in the national spotlight is to give all credit to mom .
That ’s just the way it is , and we would n’t change it .

amero , North american Union
Debut of the ' amero '
By Judi McLeod
The People 's Republic of China , long lauded by america 's enemies as the world 's next economic power , will be the country that will force the creation of the ` North american Union ' ( NaU ) .
Kofi annan 's former pointman , Canadian Maurice Strong , has been boasting from Chinese soil that China soon would be replacing america as economic king , using the jingo that 's the official language at Turtle Bay .
The billions of dollars China has invested in the flagging american economy will be worthless .
They will have to negotiate the exchange rate to the new amero .
This will then force the creation of the North american Union .
The cloak of the NaU , fashioned in secrecy , will be thrown over an unsuspecting public , erasing the borders of three countries .
Mexico , which already has legions of its citizens living and working inside america , is , in effect already inside the NaU .
Their governments will inform the american and Canadian people that there is no option but the bread line .
Unfortunately , the plan , which has been in place for some time , now , has been all but ignored by the mainstream media .
One of the signs that the NaU is on its way is the collapse of the american greenback dollar paving the way for the debut of the ' amero ' .
" Two analysts who have reconstructed money supply data after the Fed stopped publishing it argue a coming dollar collapse will set the stage for creating the amero as a North american currency to replace the dollar , " ( WorldNetDaily , Dec. 13 , 2006 ) .
The euro followed the same blueprint of stealth and surprise .
It was already issued as replacement currency before the masses could coalesce to fight it .
Who ever would have dreamed that the euro of a secular bureaucracy one day would be accepted for use at the Vatican ?
Pope John Paul II , who repeatedly condemned the " moral drift " of secular Brussels , sanctioned an official Euro for the Vatican .
In appearance , the Vatican coin looks very much like other Euro coins .
But on the flip side of the coin , the image of Pope John Paul II faces left .
" By permitting his image on this new coin , John Paul II has given another symbolic and powerful stimulus to the European Union , which with the issuance of the Euro , is taking an important step towards the Universal Republic , " said atila Sinke Guimarnes in Daily Catholic .
Was it all that long ago when people said the formation of the European Union was impossible ?
Today , the EU European holds 27 nations under its authority with other countries lined up for membership .
In the US , experts are now predicting that the collapse of the dollar is imminent .
" People in the U.S. are going to be hit hard , " says Bob Chapman publisher of The International Forecaster newsletter .
" In the severe recession we are entering now , Bush will argue that we have to form a North american Union to compete with the Euro . "
" Creating the amero , " Chapman explained , " will be presented to the american public as the administration 's solution for dollar recovery .
In the process of creating the amero , the Bush administration just abandons the dollar . "
While the amero is being groomed to enter stage left , another phenomenon has been gathering steam outside of media headlines .
The North american Union , which got its start in secrecy , has been pulled out of the closet by a grass - roots effort , that will force it onto the agenda when Nancy Pelosi and Company open the 100th congress next month .
Pressed on by Conservative Caucus Chairman Howard Phillips ; WND columnist and author Jerome Corsi ; activist and american icon Phyllis Schlafly , leaders of the 50 - member strong coalition are poised to halt any effort by the U.S. to enter into a North american Union with Mexico and Canada .
Members of Schlafly 's Eagle Forum have been in training for the past two months to lobby on Capitol Hill when Congress convenes .
The resolution -- sponsored by Republican Reps. Virgil Goode Jr. of Virginia , Tom Tancredo of Colorado , Walter Jones of North Carolina , and Ron Paul of Texas -- expresses " the sense of Congress that the United States should not engage in the construction of a North american Free Trade agreement ( NaFTa ) Superhighway System or enter into a North american Union ( NaU ) with Mexico or Canada . "
It 's no idle boast when Phillips says , " this could be the most important project on which we 've ever worked . "
armed with the Internet release of about 1,000 documents , obtained in a Freedom of Information act request to the Security ad Prosperity Partnership of North america , the coalition has the potential to embarrass the governments of all three countries .
according to Corsi , " the documents show the White House is engaging in collaborative relations with Mexico and Canada - - outside the U.S. Constitution .
Very little about the NaU has been covered by the Canadian media .
The stage has been carefully set and only intervention will stop North america from taking the same stealth route that Europe took in creating the European Union and its legal tender the Euro .

2006/9/18の敬老の日が登録されてない
投稿者 : ナガサワ ( 2006.09.11 午後 01:05 )
確かに 、Google Calendar、おかしくなってますね。2006年9月23日の秋分の日以外のすべての祝日が消えてしまっています(過去も、未来も ) 。
とりあえず 、Google 以外の第三者が Google Calendar 用に提供している 「日本の祝日」が何種類かあるようですので、代わりにそれらを使ってみてはいかがでしょうか?
投稿者 : tsupo ( 2006.09.11 午後 11:11 )
いま、改め て Google Calendar を見てみましたが、祝日の表示は元に戻ってました(直っていました)。2006年9月18日の敬老の日も問題なく表示されています。
Google Calendar 本体も日本語に完全対応したようです。新しい
Google ツールバーからもボタン一発でアクセスできるようになりました。
投稿者 : tsupo ( 2006.09.19 午後 05:41 )
「 国民の祝日に関する法律の一部を改正する法律 」 が
平 成１９年１月１日から施行されるます。
この法律は簡単に言うと５月３日、４日が日曜日の場合、６日が振替休日になる
と言うものですが 、Google Calendarは対応してないですね。
来年から施行なのに、残念・・・。

No Sleep ‘ Til Brooklyn February 28 , 2007
I ’ve only slept 3.5 hours out of the last 60 .
That ’s probably not good , right ?
I am so tired , that I am now not even tired anymore .
I am just in a state of permanent zombie .
Coding in this state is another thing altogether .
I do not recommend it .
I do not recommend over bidding all kinds of work because you think you are n’t going to get it all —
Murphy ’s law says you will get it all , and then you ’ll spend two months trying to dig through the avalanche of work you have to complete .
The side effect is you make good money , and you do n’t spend much money , because you are always working .
Another issue is that people do n’t understand what you mean when they ask you “ so , what have you been doing ? ” and you respond “ working . ”
Normal people work 40 hours per week , hate their jobs , and go home to do the things they are really interested in .
That ’s the problem with programming .
I ’m interested in it .
I do n’t just stop coding , reading and learning about programming because the workday ends .
If you ’re reading this , it ’s highly likely that you have the same problem that I do .
Have you ever read your way to the bottom of the programming .
reddit.com page , and then thought to yourself “ crap , now I have to wait until tomorrow to read more . ”
I ’ve never programmed in Haskell ( even for fun ) and I have read at least 5 articles on monads .
Do n’t even get me started on currying , or y- combinators — I ’m reading that stuff everyday .
Thing is , I think everybody else is slacking .
The truly driven people do n’t really need to be even exceptional at what they do because everybody else is so poor at it .
On Friday the 13th , April 2007 , the Brattleboro Reformer , the third largest newspaper in Vermont that dates to 1876 , joined the chorus of people calling Bush the worst president in U.S. history and for his impeachment .
Reformer.com —
When the story of our time is written by future historians , there will be but one question asked :
When confronted with the malevolence and mendacity of the Bush administration , how did the people in positions to do something about it react ?
Does Vermont want to go down in the history books as standing up to the worst president ever ?
We , the people of Vermont , have the chance to affect the outcome of this story .
We must seize this opportunity .
( More )
What can WE do ?

“ Our school is all about censorship , ” said James Presson , 16 , a member of the “ Voices of Conflict ” cast .
“ People do n’t talk about the things that matter . ”
After reading a book of first - person accounts of the war , Ms. Dickinson kicked off the spring semester — with the principal ’s blessing — by asking her advanced students if they were open to creating a play about Iraq .
In an interview , the teacher said the objective was to showcase people close to the same age as the students who were “ experiencing very different things in their daily lives and to stand in the shoes of those people and then present them by speaking their words exactly in front of an audience . ”
What emerged was a compilation of monologues taken from the book that impressed Ms. Dickinson , “ In Conflict : Iraq War Veterans Speak Out on Duty , Loss and the Fight to Stay Alive ” ; a documentary , “ The Ground Truth ” ; Web logs and other sources .
The script consisted of the subjects ’ own words , though some license was taken with identity : Lt. Charles Anderson became “ Charlene ” because , as Seth Koproski , a senior , put it , “ we had a lot of women ” in the cast .
In March , students said , Gabby , the junior whose brother is serving in the Army in Iraq , said she wanted to join the production , and soon circulated drafts of the script to parents and others in town .
A school administrator who is a Vietnam veteran also raised questions about the wisdom of letting students explore such sensitive issues , Mr. Canty said .
In response to concerns that the script was too antiwar , Ms. Dickinson reworked it with the help of an English teacher .
The revised version is more reflective and less angry , omitting graphic descriptions of killing , crude language and some things that reflect poorly on the Bush administration , like a comparison of how long it took various countries to get their troops bulletproof vests .
A critical reference to Donald H. Rumsfeld , the former defense secretary , was cut , along with a line from Cpl. Sean Huze saying of soldiers : “ Your purpose is to kill . ”
Seven characters were added , including Maj .
Tammy Duckworth of the National Guard , a helicopter pilot who lost both legs and returned from the war to run for Congress last fall .
The second version gives First Lt. Melissa Stockwell , who lost her left leg from the knee down , a new closing line : “ But I ’d go back .
I would n’t want to go back , but I would go . ”
On March 13 , Mr. Canty met with the class .
He told us “ no matter what we do , it ’s not happening , ” said one of the students , Erin Clancy .
That night , on a Facebook chat group called “ Support the Troops in Iraq , ” a poster named GabriellaAF , who several students said was their classmate Gabby , posted a celebratory note saying , “ We got the show canceled ! ! ”
( Reached by telephone , Gabby ’s mother , Barbara Alessi , said she had no knowledge of the play or her daughter ’s involvement in it . )
In classrooms , teenage centers and at dinner tables around town , the drama students entertained the idea of staging the show at a local church , or perhaps al fresco just outside the school grounds .
One possibility was Wilton Presbyterian Church .

Rep. Phil Gingrey ( R - GA ) , who serves on the House Armed Services Committee , told " Hardball " fill - in host David Gregory that if the ' surge ' has not yielded success in Iraq by August 2008 , then " this president , and the Republican majority from the last Congress , we do have a ' Plan B , ' but we 're not going to give it to the enemy . "
Gregory did not push him to shed light on the back up plan , but Gingrey conceded that " adjustments " would need to be made if victory had not be achieved in Iraq by August 2008 .
Gingrey 's comments are reminiscent of an oft - mentioned contention that any timelines regarding troop withdrawal from Iraq should be kept secret .
Recently , Senator Mark Pryor ( D - AR ) said that he would have supported the Democrat 's Iraq spending bill only if the timeline dates had been secret .
Pryor voted with Republicans on the bill .
Last week , Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney told ABCs Good Morning America that he would only support deadlines for troop withdrawal if they were kept unpublished .
It is unclear if Gingrey 's comments were a reference to " secret " milestones or troop draw down dates .
In March , General Peter Pace , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , reportedly denied the existence of any back up plan saying , " Plan B [ is ] to make Plan A work . "

RONDONÓPOLIS , Brazil —
For more than 2,000 years , the Chinese have turned soybeans into tofu , a staple of the country ’s diet .
But as its economy grows , so does China ’s appetite for pork , poultry and beef , which require higher volumes of soybeans as animal feed .
Plagued by scarce water supplies , China is turning to a new trading partner 15,000 miles away — Brazil — to supply more protein - packed beans essential to a richer diet .
China ’s global scramble for natural resources is leading to a transformation of agricultural trading around the world .
In China , vanishing cropland and diminishing water supplies are hampering the country ’s ability to feed itself , and the increasing use of farmland in the United States to produce biofuels is pushing China to seek more of its staples from South America , where land is still cheap and plentiful .
“ China is out there beating the bushes , ” said Robert L. Thompson , a professor at the University of Illinois who is a former director of agricultural and rural development at the World Bank .
The goal , he said , is “ to ensure they have access to long - term contracts for minerals and energy and food . ”

Early humans developed larger brains as they adapted to colder climates , according to University at Albany researchers .
The study , to be published by Jessica Ash , a graduate student in psychology , and professor of evolutionary psychology Gordon G. Gallup Jr. in the spring edition of Human Nature ( Vol. 18 , Issue 2 , 2007 : Transaction Publishers ) , suggests that human cranial capacity as an indicator of brain size grew dramatically during our evolution , and that variations in global temperature as well as progressive shifts toward global cooling account for as much as 50 percent of the variation in cranial capacity .
The research utilized several measures of paleotemperatures and a sample of 109 fossilized hominid skulls collected over the past 2 million years .
In addition to the impact of global cooling , " By paying close attention to the geographic origin of each of the fossilized skulls , " said Gallup , " it became clear that seasonal variation in climate may also have been an important selective force behind the evolution of human cranial capacity .
Specifically , we found that as the distance from the equator increased , north or south , so did brain size . "
The authors suggest that a key environmental trigger to the evolution of larger brains was the need to devise ways to keep warm and manage the fluctuations in food availability that resulted from cold weather .
In species other than humans , problems posed by cooler climates were solved by adaptations such as hibernation and migration , and by metabolic adaptations including fur and the development of fat deposits .
During human evolution , however , the authors surmise that solutions to the problems of cold weather and a scarce food supply featured detailed and progressively more refined cognitive and intellectual strategies , such as the development of cooperative hunting techniques and more sophisticated tools and weapons .
Increased brain capacity also brought with it the use of fire as a means to keep warm and cook , adaptations in clothing and shelter , and the development of more refined social skills .
Gallup and Ash suggest that while our understanding of brain evolution remains incomplete , the study provides evidence of the role of climate and migration away from the equator as selective forces in promoting human intelligence , and that the recent trend toward global warming may be reversing a trend that led to brain expansion in humans .
I have very fond memories of my first ( and only , so far ) visit to Hong Kong in 2007 .
I was extremely impressed by the architecture and scenery , and by the vibrant street life on display throughout its many neighborhoods .
As a first - time visitor , I also appreciated how easy it was to navigate , and how technology was used to solve problems in novel ways .
I first got a sense of this when I passed through Immigration , and had my body temperature scanned remotely to see if I was running a fever ( important for a region that was then dealing with avian flu ) .
I was further impressed with Hong Kong ’s technological prowess when I discovered I could purchase a stored - value transit pass , called an Octopus card , which I could not only use on trains , buses , and trams , but could also use to buy snacks from a convenience store or food from certain restaurants .
I found out later that locals can also buy rings , watches , and even cell phones that contain the Octopus chip , enabling them to simply wave their hands ( or phones ) over the special card readers to make a purchase .
That may all sound unimpressive nowadays , but it was pretty advanced for 2007 , to say nothing of 1997 , when it was introduced .
While all these things are wonderful , my favorite piece of technology that makes life easier for visitors ( and residents of course ) is the Central–Mid - Levels Escalator .
Stretching from the Central district of Hong Kong Island up to the heights of the Mid-Levels residential neighborhoods , the escalator is a godsend for footsore travelers .
Escalating the Situation
The Central–Mid - Levels escalator system , which opened in 1993 , consists of 18 escalators and three moving sidewalks , and measures 800 meters ( 1/2 mile ) in length , making it the longest outdoor covered escalator in the world .
It takes about 20 minutes to ride the escalators from the bottom to the top ( or vice versa ) , but it takes less than that if you walk while they move , as most people do .
The escalators run from 6 A.M. to midnight , descending for the first 4 hours ( bringing morning commuters down from upper levels ) , and then reversing direction around 10:00 A.M. to carry passengers up the hill .
There are entrances and exits at each street it intersects , making it easy to stop at whichever level you choose .
Up , Up and Hooray
During the time we spent in Hong Kong , we rode the escalators almost every day , finding them an extremely useful way to get from our hotel midway up the slope of Victoria Peak to the center of activity downtown and back again .
One of the things I enjoyed most about riding the escalators was the opportunity to peek at the activity taking place on either side , from apartment life on the upper levels to the bustling bars , restaurants , and stores on the levels closer to the center of the city .
While for many people who rode the escalators alongside us , it was just an ordinary commute to work , we found the journey to be a fascinating glimpse of urban life in Hong Kong .
Not only that , but the ease , efficiency , and simplicity of the system made us , foreigners though we were , feel right at home .
Note :
This is an updated version of an article that originally appeared on Interesting Thing of the Day on February 26 , 2007 .
As of late Wednesday afternoon , U.S. Eastern Time , Research in Motion Ltd. had offered no explanation for the cause of the BlackBerry e-mail service outage that affected users in North America .
Throughout the outage , which started Tuesday evening at about 8:15 p.m. ET and lasted through at least midmorning Wednesday ET , the RIM and BlackBerry Web sites lacked any information regarding the outage .
Multiple inquiries to press representatives made via telephone and e-mail were not answered through Wednesday afternoon , although RIM did issue a statement to European reporters earlier in the day , confirming the outage , saying service had been restored to most users and that it was looking into the cause of the problems .
One crisis management consultant said customers expect more details in crisis situations .
" The general rule is , if it 's really bad get [ information ] out fast , " said James Lukaszewski , CEO of The Lukaszewski Group Inc. , in White Plains , New York .
" It 'd be a far less large situation if they communicated more . "
However , another offered the opposite viewpoint .
While more communication might help to contain a news story , RIM 's focus might instead be on reassuring stock markets , said Mark Towhey , president of the Towhey Consulting Group in Toronto .
His company provides crisis management advance and he thought RIM 's response seemed appropriate for the circumstances .
If the company did n't know the cause of the problem , whether " something broke " or its network was attacked , it may be better to say little .
" In either case , they do n't want to sound like they do n't know what they 're doing , " he said .
For customers who do n't use their BlackBerries when they are n't working , the outage might not have been a major issue , he said .
A BlackBerry customer himself ,
Towhey learned about the outage when he read news reports Wednesday morning and about an hour later , the service was back .
" For me as a customer , it seems like a minor hiccup , " he said .
According to some who posted at BlackBerry message boards -- ironically , one of the larger such boards was on the fritz at least part of Wednesday -- the hiccup was n't quite so minor .
While some posters urged perspective on the situation , others found their ability to work was adversely affected .
While non-BlackBerry users might not quite get the fondness for the handheld devices that leads to them being dubbed " CrackBerries , " a Web poll taken Wednesday by telecom expense management firm ProfitLine Inc. found that 81 percent of respondents representing enterprise IT and telecom professionals reported operations were disrupted by the outage , with 44.5 percent saying that the effect was " moderate or substantial . "
Those findings indicate that " wireless communication has gone from a travel convenience to a mission critical communications tool , " Randall De Lorenzo , ProfitLine 's vice president , Mobility Strategies said in a statement about the " webinar " poll , which had , coincidentally , been scheduled before the outage .
Between 70 and 100 enterprise IT or telecom managers responded to the poll , according to a ProfitLine spokesman .
When a company in a crisis -- which the outage was for at least some users who rely on BlackBerries for e-mail and Internet connectivity -- does n't give out information , the media might turn to others who speculate about what 's going on , Lukaszewski said .
Indeed , many press accounts of the outage include speculation from analysts or others in the telecommunications or handheld industries about what might have caused the outage and how the situation could have been better handled .
" Customers want information -- they want to know what 's going on , " he said .
" They expect reputable companies to communicate . "
A challenge is presented when a company does n't have many answers , but even details about the steps being taken to correct problems and estimates about when those might be resolved is better than no information , Lukaszewski said .
At this point , RIM is in the aftermath stage , he suggested .
" The issue now is how do they get forgiveness ?
How do they get their customers to like them again ? "
The love so many BlackBerry users have for their devices will be a saving grace , said telecom analyst Jeffrey Kagan .
" BlackBerry will take a hit , but it will probably come back because the users are almost rabid .
Palm and other competitors should be up on the news .
However , the bottom line is , after the next few weeks , we will all go back to trusting again .
Until the next disaster . "
The very success of BlackBerry devices could well be a factor , he and others suggested .
There are some 8 million BlackBerry subscribers worldwide , with more than 1 million added in the quarter that ended March 3 , said RIM , which is based in Waterloo , Ontario , when it announced its most recent quarterly financial results .
Revenue for the quarter was up 66 percent to $ 930.4 million , with net income before adjustments of $ 187.9 million .
Wall Street at least was proving forgiving .
With about 20 minutes to go in the trading day on the Nasdaq exchange , shares in RIM ( RIMM ) were trading up 2.68 percent at US$ 134.79 .

KeeWee in the process of retiring LouG from the Rimfire Optical class .
I have no idea how we managed to squeeze in two reasonably nice days , weatherwise , in between all of the wind and rain storms we 've had for the last two weeks , but we did .
The weather was amazingly pleasant for this time of the year with the sun peeking through from time to time brightening up the day .
In qualifying , we witnessed the shot of the year , and the table of the year , both by LarryF .
Chris was timing in with his revolver , and used his first six rounds , leaving several pins still on the table .
He reloaded and cleared the table , except for one pin still standing , with his next six rounds .
Since you get to discard the times from one table anyway , Chris decided to quit on that particular table .
Larry , who was standing behind the firing line , and perhaps eight or ten feet behind the white fence and at least 40 to 45 feet away , picked up a rock and threw it at the sole standing pin .
The rock hit the pin squarely on the red emblem with enough force to send it sailing off the pin table !
WOW !
When Larry was shooting his .45 in qualifying , he shot the table of the year .
His first shot hit the right - most pin on it's edge , sending it into the pin next to it , starting a domino effect which knocked the two left hand pins off of the table , and the shot pin also rolled off of the table , leaving two pins on the table .
Larry then used one shot for each remaining pin , ending up clearing five pins from the table with three shots !
Again , WOW !
After timing in , we got on with the match .
As has been the case lately , " Evil Al " was pretty much unbeatable , so whoever got to shoot against him was done for the day .
That means bad news for anyone who qualifies near the top , as you get to meet Al early in the elimination process .
In optical sight centerfire I met Al in my first round and got eliminated .
Al then eliminated everyone else he met to win the class .
In the revolver class , LouG got to meet Al first , and was quickly eliminated .
I got to go against Al next , with the same results .
I was hoping to get a chance to shoot revolvers against Lou , but it was not to be .
Young
Tony managed to win one table from Al , but then Al got serious and kicked Tony 's backside soundly .
So much for centerfire ......
Rimfire Iron sight , a class where I usually do poorly , was about as expected .
JimP nocked me out in the first round and went on to win the class , beating Mountain Man Phil in the final .
Rimfire Optical sight class was unusual to say the least !
I had a couple of stove - pipes with the long barreled High Standard in qualifying so I ended somewhere down the list a bit .
In the first round with my S&W 422 I came up against Rainy ( Mrs. Al ) , and narrowly got eliminated .
At least I still had my High Standard in the running .
I met up with Tony in the first round and FINALLY managed to not be eliminated in the first dang round !
There was a bye in there somewhere , and I ended up in the semi-final .
KeeWee had already dispatched LouG in an earlier round .
KeeWee had won the first table , and Lou had a jam on the second table , allowing her to advance .
That put me against KeeWee in the semi-final .
On the first table she shot a near perfect table , getting five pins with five shots , and in good time , where I had knocked one over and needed a sixth shot to get it off the table .
Even so , it was very close .
The second table we both used six shots , but she shot quickly , again narrowly winning the table .
At least I can take consolation in the fact that I taught her to shoot !
KeeWee was in the final !
Al had come up against Rainy in an earlier round , and ' helped '
Rainy a bit , allowing her to win the round and also reach the final .
It was an ' All Ladies ' final .
Rainy narrowly won the first table .
KeeWee was leading on the second table , and had one pin to go to tie it up when the red dot went out in the sight .
Unfortunately that allowed Rainy to win the final , with KeeWee in a very respectable second place .
Rainy better watch out for next year ........

Editor 's note : Lou Dobbs ' commentary appears every Wednesday on CNN.com
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Democrats and Republicans are desperately trying to nationalize the midterm elections , now only 48 days away .
Democrats are seeking to focus voter attention on President Bush 's conduct of the war in Iraq , while Republicans are trying to convince voters that the president and all Republicans should be given credit for the conduct of the war on terror , and the fact that there has not been a terrorist attack on U.S. soil since September 11 , 2001 .
And voters will also choose which party to support on a host of other issues , local and national : illegal immigration , border security , the state of the economy , the escalating cost of health care , failing public schools , record budget and trade deficits , and the declining standard of living for the middle class .
Voters will be deciding whether the promise of challengers or the performance of incumbents merits their votes .
The most recent polls reveal a national public mood that is now more supportive of a still unpopular president and about evenly divided over their preferences for , or tolerance of , congressional Republicans and Democrats .
In other words , less than seven weeks before we go to the polls , there is every indication that the partisan quest for power on Capitol Hill will be close .
But there is additional uncertainty about the outcome of our elections that is intolerable and inexcusable , and which could make the contested 2000 presidential election look orderly by comparison .
As of right now , there is little assurance your vote will count .
As we 've been reporting almost nightly on my broadcast for more than a year , electronic voting machines are placing our democracy at risk .
Across the nation , eight out of every 10 voters will be casting their ballots this November on electronic voting machines .
And these machines time and again have been demonstrated to be extremely vulnerable to tampering and error , and many of them have no voter - verified paper trail .
There is simply no way in which election officials and their staffs of thousands of volunteers with limited experience and often poor training can possibly carry out reliable recounts .
Only 27 states have laws requiring the use of voter - verified paper trails in electronic machines .
Eight more states utilize a paper trail in their machines but do n't require it , leaving 15 states with no mandated requirements for safeguarding your vote .
But with no national law in place , our midterm elections are being threatened by a system lacking any real regulation and standards .
The problems with electronic voting are n't necessarily new , yet we 're still not ready for the midterms .
During the 2004 presidential election , one voting machine in a Columbus , Ohio , suburb reportedly added nearly 3,900 additional votes to Bush 's total .
Officials caught the machine 's error because only 638 voters cast presidential ballots at that precinct , but in a heavily populated district , can we really be sure the votes will be counted correctly ?
The May primary election in Cuyahoga County , Ohio , was nothing less than a complete debacle .
A report from the Election Science Institute found the electronic voting machines ' four sources of vote totals -- individual ballots , paper trail summary , election archives and memory cards -- did n't even match up .
The totals were all different , and the report concluded that relying on the current system for Cuyahoga County 's more than 1.3 million people should be viewed as " a calculated risk . "
Are we really willing to risk our democracy ?
This problem is obviously not limited to Ohio. During Illinois ' March primary , Cook County delayed the results of its crucial county board elections for a week as a result of human and mechanical problems at hundreds of sites with the new voting machines .
The recent primary elections in Montgomery County , Maryland , also highlighted just how unprepared many polling places are for the midterms .
The state election administrator is demanding to know what went wrong after election workers did not receive access cards to operate the Diebold voting machines for the county 's 238 precincts on time , forcing as many as 12,000 voters to use provisional paper ballots that ran out quickly .
Some were simply told to come back later and vote .
There are four main manufacturers of electronic voting systems , none of which has been demonstrated to be more secure than the others .
Diebold is the most well - known , but a new Princeton University study concerning Diebold 's AccuVote - TS machine found that hackers can easily tamper with electronic voting machines by installing a virus to disable machines and change the vote totals .
Princeton researchers found that " malicious software " running on a single voting machine can steal votes with little , if any , risk of detection , and that anyone with access can install the software .
The study also suggests these machines are susceptible to voting - machine viruses .
Diebold says the unit used in the test was two generations old and to its knowledge is not used anywhere in the country .
A 2005 Government Accountability Office report on electronic voting confirmed the worst fears of watchdog groups and election officials .
That report said , " There is evidence that some of these concerns have been realized and have caused problems with recent elections , resulting in the loss and miscount of votes . "
That is simply unacceptable .
Congress and the White House need to immediately take steps to assure the integrity of electronic voting with paper trails that could be audited in any recount , or provisions must be made for paper ballots if the reliability of e-voting cannot be assured before November 7 .
When voters lose confidence in our elected representatives , we can vote the bums out .
But what is the recourse if American voters lose confidence in our electoral system ?

Angel Raich has an inoperable brain tumor , a seizure disorder , scoliosis , severe chronic pain , chronic nausea , and some other ailments that leave her unable to eat and cause her to be officially dying .
You may recall that , five years ago , the 41 - year - old Oakland woman sued then - U.S. attorney general John Ashcroft and the federal government over her right to use medical marijuana , which is legal in California .
According to her doctors , she will die without it .
According to a federal appeals court , she can drop dead .
The Supreme Court ruled against Raich two years ago , saying medical marijuana users and their suppliers could be prosecuted for breaching federal drug laws even if they lived in a state such in which medical marijuana is legal .
Today , the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled that Raich and her suppliers could be prosecuted for violating federal drug laws .
However , the court left open the possibility that if Raich were arrested , her attorneys may be able to mount a “ medical necessity defense . ”
Raich says she will continue to smoke and eat marijuana .

Taking a quick break from all things SeekSift , we ’re glad we got the chance to see Chris Blizzard ‘s presentation on the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project at last night ’s New York Linux Users Group meeting .
Chris brought along a few machines for us to play with , and it ’s amazing to see how much progress they ’ve made already .
While the idea to let people to buy one for themselves while simultaneously donating another is off , unfortunately , there are laptops available to developers serious about contributing to the project .
For application developers ( in OLPC terminology , applications are activities ) who want to write activities for the laptop , there are resources for developing in Python , and there ’s also a general development site about the code which drives the OLPC ’s Sugar environment ( less an “ operating system ” in the way we think of computers and more of a human interface that kids will find intuitive ) .
While we ’re not sure how much time we ’ll wind up contributing ourselves ( even though this is exactly the kind of distraction we love to indulge in while procrastinating & avoiding our daily chores ) , we ’d like to wish the OLPC project well , as well encourage everyone who can to contribute .

Why I will never have a girlfriend
Tristan Miller
German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence
20 December 1999
Why do n't I have a girlfriend ?
This is a question that practically every male has asked himself at one point or another in his life .
Unfortunately , there is rarely a hard and fast answer to the query .
Many men try to reason their way through the dilemma nonetheless , often reaching a series of ridiculous explanations , each more self - deprecating than the last : " Is it because I 'm too shy , and not aggressive enough ?
Is it my opening lines ?
Am I a boring person ?
Am I too fat or too thin ?
Or am I simply ugly and completely unattractive to women ? "
When all other plausible explanations have been discounted , most fall back on the time - honoured conclusion that " there must be Something Wrong™ with me " before resigning themselves to lives of perpetual chastity .
Not the author , though .
I , for one , refuse to spend my life brooding over my lack of luck with women .
While I 'll be the first to admit that my chances of ever entering into a meaningful relationship with someone special are practically non-existent , I staunchly refuse to admit that it has anything to do with some inherent problem with me .
Instead , I am convinced that the situation can be readily explained in purely scientific terms , using nothing more than demographics and some elementary statistical calculus .
Lest anyone suspect that my standards for women are too high , let me allay those fears by enumerating in advance my three criteria for the match .
First , the potential girlfriend must be approximately my age — let 's say 21 plus or minus three or four years .
Second , the girl must be beautiful ( and I use that term all - encompassingly to refer to both inner and outer beauty ) .
Third , she must also be reasonably intelligent — she does n't have to be Mensa material , but the ability to carry on a witty , insightful argument would be nice .
So there they are — three simple demands , which I 'm sure everyone will agree are anything but unreasonable .
That said , I now present my demonstration of why the probability of finding a suitable candidate fulfilling the three above - noted requirements is so small as to be practically impossible — in other words , why I will never have a girlfriend .
I shall endeavour to make this proof as rigorous as the available data permits .
And I should note , too , that there will be no statistical trickery involved here ; I have cited all my sources and provided all relevant calculations in case anyone wishes to conduct their own independent review .
Let 's now take a look at the figures .
Number of people on Earth ( in 1998 ) : 5 592 830 000
We start with the largest demographic in which I am interested — namely , the population of this planet .
That is not to say I 'm against the idea of interstellar romance , of course ; I just do n't assess the prospect of finding myself a nice Altairian girl as statistically significant .
Now anyway , the latest halfway - reliable figures we have for Earth 's population come from the United States Census Bureau 's 1999 World Population Profile ( WP/98 ) .
Due presumably to the time involved in compiling and processing census statistics , said report 's data is valid only as of 1998 , so later on we 'll be making some impromptu adjustments to bring the numbers up to date .
… who are female : 2 941 118 000
I 'd 've thought that , given the title of this essay , this criterion goes without saying .
In case anyone missed it , though , I am looking for exclusively female companionship .
Accordingly , roughly half of the Earth 's population must be discounted .
Sorry , guys .
… in " developed " countries : 605 601 000
We now further restrict the geographical area of interest to so - called " first - world countries " .
My reasons for doing so are not motivated out of contempt for those who are economically disadvantaged , but rather by simple probability .
My chances of meeting a babe from Bhutan or a goddess from Ghana , either in person or on the Internet , are understandably low .
In fact , I will most likely spend nearly my entire life living and working in North America , Europe , and Australia , so it is to these types of regions that the numbers have been narrowed .
… currently ( in 2000 ) aged 18 to 25 : 65 399 083 ,
Being neither a pedophile nor a geriatrophile , I would like to restrict my search for love to those whose age is approximately equal to my own .
This is where things get a bit tricky , for two reasons : first , the census data is nearly two years old , and second , the " population by age " tables in WP/98 are not separated into individual ages but are instead quantized into " 15 –19 " ( of whom there are 39 560 000 ) and " 20 – 44 " ( population 215 073 000 ) .
Women aged 15 to 19 in 1998 will be aged 17 to 21 in 2000 ; in this group , I 'm interested in dating those 18 or older , so , assuming the " 15 –19 " girls ' ages are uniformly distributed , we have \[39\,560\,000 \times \ frac{\left| 21 - 18 \right | + 1}{\left| 19 - 15 \right| + 1} = 31\,648\,000 .\]
Similarly , of 1998's " 20 – 44 " category , there are now \[ 215\,073\,000 \times \ frac{\left| 25 - 22 \right | + 1}{\left| 44 - 20 \right| + 1} = 34\,411\,680\ ] females within my chosen age limit .
The sum , 66 059 680 , represents the total number of females aged 18 to 25 in developed countries in 2000 .
Unfortunately , roughly 1 % of these girls will have died since the census was taken ; thus , the true number of so - far eligible bachelorettes is 65 399 083 .
… who are beautiful : 1 487 838
Personal attraction , both physically and personality - wise , is an important instigator of any relationship .
Of course , beauty is a purely subjective trait whose interpretation may vary from person to person .
Luckily it is not necessary for me to define beauty in this essay except to state that for any given beholder , it will probably be normally distributed amongst the population .
Without going into the specifics of precisely which traits I admire , I will say that for a girl to be considered really beautiful to me , she should fall at least two standard deviations above the norm .
From basic statistics theory , the area to the left of the normal curve at z = 2 is \[ \frac {
1} {2 } - \ frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \cdot \int_{0} ^{2} e^{-\frac{1}{2}z^2} dz~\approx~0.022\,75\ ] and so it is this number with which we multiply our current population pool .
… and intelligent : 236 053
Again , intelligence can mean different things to different people , yet I am once more relieved of making any explanation by noting that it , like most other characteristics , has a notionally normal distribution across the population .
Let 's assume that I will settle for someone a mere one standard deviation above the normal ; in that case , a further \[ \frac { 1} {2 } + \ frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{-\frac{1}{2}z^2} dz~\approx~84.1345 \ %\ ] of the population must be discounted .
… and not already committed : 118 027
I could find no hard statistics on the number of above - noted girls who are already married , engaged , or otherwise committed to a significant other , but informal observation and anecdotal evidence leads me to believe that the proportion is somewhere around 50 % .
( Fellow unattached males will no doubt have also noticed a preponderance of girls legitimately offering , " Sorry , I already have a boyfriend " as an excuse not to go on a date . )
For reasons of morality ( and perhaps too self - preservation ) , I 'm not about to start hitting on girls who have husbands and boyfriends .
Accordingly , that portion of the female population must also be considered off - limits .
… and also might like me : 18 726
Naturally , finding a suitable girl who I really like is no guarantee that she 'll like me back .
Assuming , as previously mentioned , that personal attractiveness is normally distributed , there is a mere 50 % chance that any given female will consider me even marginally attractive .
In practice , however , people are unlikely to consider pursuing a relationship with someone whose looks and personality just barely suffice .
Let 's make the rather conservative assumption , then , that a girl would go out with someone if and only if they were at least one standard deviation above her idea of average .
In that case , referring to our previous calculation , only 15.8655 % of females would consider someone with my physical characteristics and personality acceptable as a potential romantic partner .
Conclusion
It is here , at a pool of 18 726 acceptable females , that we end our statistical analysis .
At first glance , a datable population of 18 726 may not seem like such a low number , but consider this : assuming I were to go on a blind date with a new girl about my age every week , I would have to date for 3493 weeks before I found one of the 18 726 .
That 's very nearly 67 years .
As a North American male born in the late 1970s , my life expectancy is probably little more than 70 years , so we can safely say that I will be quite dead before I find the proverbial girl of my dreams .
Come to think of it , she 'll probably be dead too .
So there you have it , my friends — finally , a cogent , scientific , non-self - deprecating argument for why I will never have a girlfriend .
That said , if you happen to be a girl deluded enough to think that you and I have a chance together , feel free to drop me a line , but I warn you , you face odds of 157 060 to 1 .
I would n't bother if I were you .
Update ( 2000 -04-01 ) :
My sarcastic pleas for some e-mail have finally been answered .
Take a look at this letter from a hysterical female reader , which I think perfectly demonstrates the point of this entire essay .
( I think the fact that she 's a WebTV user explains a lot — in fact , I was sure this e-mail was an April Fool 's joke until I noticed the return address . )

A List Apart is pleased to present the introduction of Everyware :
The dawning age of ubiquitous computing ( New Riders Press , first edition , March 10 , 2006 ) .
— Ed .
Article Continues Below
Everyware is an attempt to describe the form computing will take in the next few years .
Specifically , it ’s about a vision of processing power so distributed throughout the environment that computers per se effectively disappear .
It ’s about the enormous consequences this disappearance has for the kinds of tasks computers are applied to , for the way we use them , and for what we understand them to be .
Although aspects of this vision have been called a variety of names — ubiquitous computing , pervasive computing , physical computing , tangible media , and so on — I think of each as a facet of one coherent paradigm of interaction that I call everyware .
In everyware , all the information we now look to our phones or Web browsers to provide becomes accessible from just about anywhere , at any time , and is delivered in a manner appropriate to our location and context .
In everyware , the garment , the room and the street become sites of processing and mediation .
Household objects from shower stalls to coffee pots are reimagined as places where facts about the world can be gathered , considered , and acted upon .
And all the familiar rituals of daily life , things as fundamental as the way we wake up in the morning , get to work , or shop for our groceries , are remade as an intricate dance of information about ourselves , the state of the external world , and the options available to us at any given moment .
In all of these scenarios , there are powerful informatics underlying the apparent simplicity of the experience , but they never breach the surface of awareness : things Just Work .
Rather than being filtered through the clumsy arcana of applications and files and sites , interactions with everyware feel natural , spontaneous , human .
Ordinary people finally get to benefit from the full power of information technology , without having to absorb the esoteric bodies of knowledge on which it depends .
And the sensation of use — even while managing an unceasing and torrential flow of data — is one of calm , of relaxed mastery .
This , anyway , is the promise .
The appeal of all this is easy to understand .
Who would n’t desire a technology that promised to smooth the edges of modern life , subtly intervening on our behalf to guide us when we ’re lost , and remind us of the things we ’ve forgotten ?
Who could object to one that dispensed with the clutter of computers and other digital devices we live with , even while doing all the things they do better ?
The vision is , without doubt , a lovely one : deeply humane , even compassionate .
But getting from here to there may prove unexpectedly difficult .
Everyday life , after all , is something that we already understand and already manage to muddle through , however gracelessly or inelegantly .
We will have to balance whatever improvement we hope to achieve by overlaying our lives with digital mediation against the risk of unduly complicating that which is presently straightforward , breaking that which now works , and introducing new levels of frustration and inconvenience into all the most basic operations of our lives .
We will have to account for what happens when such mediation breaks down — as it surely will from time to time , given its origins in the same institutions , and the same development methodologies , that brought us unreliable mobile phone connections , mandatory annual operating system upgrades , and the Blue Screen of Death .
We will have to accept that privacy as we have heretofore understood it may be a thing of the past : that people will be presented with a bargain where access to the most intimate details of their lives is traded away in return for increased convenience , and that many will accept .
And we will have to reckon with the emergent aspects of our encounter with everyware , with all the ways in which its impact turns out to be something unforeseeably more than the sum of its parts .
What we can already see is this : everyware will surface and make explicit facts about our world that perhaps we would be happier ignoring .
In countless ways , it will disturb unwritten agreements about workspace and homespace , the presentation of self and the right to privacy .
It contains an inherent , unsettling potential for panoptical surveillance , regulation and “ rationalization . ”
Its presence in our lives will transfigure our notions of space and time , self and other , citizen and society in ways that we have n’t begun to contemplate .
We ’re just not very good at doing “ smart , ” and yet it would seem that in everyware we ’re proposing to remake the very relations that define our lives , remodeling them on a technical paradigm nobody seems to be particularly satisfied with .
A close reading of the existing literature on ubiquitous and pervasive systems is all that is necessary to feel the dissonance , trip over the odd dislocations that crop up whenever we follow old maps into a new territory .
We become acutely aware of our need for a more sensitive description of the terrain .
We will surely need one , at any rate , if we are to make sense of the wave of change even now bearing down on us .
And we will feel this need in short order , because whether we ’re ready for it or not , everyware is coming .
It is coming because there are too many too powerful institutions vested in its coming , knowing what enormous market possibilities are implied by the conquest of the everyday .
It is coming because it is an irresistable , “ technically sweet ” challenge , for designers no less than engineers .
It is coming because something like it effectively became inevitable , the moment each of the tools , products and services we ’re interested in started communicating in ones and zeroes .
It is coming — and as yet , the people who will be most affected by it , the overwhelming majority of whom are nontechnical , nonspecialist , ordinary citizens of the developed world , barely know it even exists .
This is not due to any inherent obscurity or lack of interest in the broader field ; to date , there have been some seven annual Ubicomp conferences , three Pervasives , and a wide scatter of smaller but otherwise similar colloquia .
These are established events , in academic terms : well - attended , underwritten by companies such as Intel , Sony , Nokia and Samsung .
There are at least three peer - reviewed professional journals exclusively dedicated to ubiquitous or pervasive computing .
There has been no dearth of discussion of everyware … but little of this discussion , and virtually none that might offer enough information on which to build meaningful choices , has reached the mainstream .
There is a window of time before the issues we ’ve touched upon become urgent daily realities for most of us , but it is quite literally narrowing by the day .
As of this writing , “ u - ” for “ ubiquitous ” has already joined “ e - ” and “ i - ” in the parade of content - free buzz - prefixes used by the marketers of technology to connote trendiness ; literally not a day goes by without the appearance of some relevant news item .
We hear about RFID tags being integrated into employee ID cards , a new modular sensor grid on the architectural market , a networking scheme proposing to use the body ’s own electrical field to carry information — and this in the general press , not the specialist journals .
There ’s already a steady stream of prototype everyware emerging from the research labs and the more advanced corporate design studios , no matter if they ’re answers to questions nobody ’s much asked .
With actual , consumer - facing applications ( and implications ) starting to appear , it ’s time for discussions about its potential for risk and reward to leave the tight orbit of academic journals and conferences behind .
If everyware has n’t yet reached its Betamax vs. VHS stage — that stage in the adoption of any new technology where the standards that will determine the particulars of its eventual shape are ironed out — we can see that it ’s not so terribly far off .
It ’s time for the people who have the most at stake in the emergence of this technology to be invited to the table .
The challenge before us now is to begin thinking about just how we can mold that emergence to suit our older prerogatives of personal agency , civil liberty and simple sanity .
I ’m afraid that readers looking for a technical explanation of RFID tag readers , gestural interfaces , or operating systems capable of juggling the multiple , distributed events of ubiquitous environments , will be sorely disappointed .
My intention in Everyware is simply to describe what ubiquitous computing is ; establish that it is a very real concern for all of us , and in the relatively near term ; explore some of the less - obvious implications of its spread as a paradigm ; and finally develop some ideas about how we might improve it .
How can we deliver the promise of everyware — the part about calm and relaxed mastery , the part that proposes to replace our balky computers with the effortless simplicity of the everyday — while forestalling some of the pitfalls that are already apparent ?
How can we , as users and consumers , hope to influence something that is already in the process of unfolding ?
The pages to come will frame an answer to these questions .
In the balance of this book , we ’ll explore what the emergence of robust , real - world everyware will mean , in terms useful to the designers and developers of such systems , to the marketers tasked with selling them , and to the policymakers charged with bringing them into conformance with our other agreements about the world .
We ’ll consider some of the deeper context in which notions of everyware arise , in the hope that if we stand back far enough we can see how all its pieces fit together , and what is implied in their joining .
And we ’ll do this without ever losing sight of the individual human being encountering everyware , in the hope that what we choose to build together will prove to be useful and valuable to that person , and supportive of the best that is in us .
If we make wise choices about the terms on which we accept it , we can extend the utility and convenience of ubiquitous computing to billions of lives .
We stand a real chance of improving the experience of the everyday , addressing dissatisfactions as old as human history .
Alternately , we can watch passively as the world fills up with ubiquitous systems not designed with our interests at heart – at best presenting us with moments of hassle , disruption and frustration beyond number , and at worst laying the groundwork for the kind of repression the despots of the twentieth century could only dream about .
The stakes , this time , are unusually high .
A mobile phone is something that can be switched off , or left at home .
A computer is something that can be shut down , unplugged , walked away from .
But the technology we ’re discussing here — ambient , ubiquitous , insinuative into all the apertures everyday life affords it — will be environment - forming in a way neither of those are .
There should be little doubt that its advent will profoundly shape both the world and our experience of it in the years ahead .
As to whether we come to regard that advent as boon , burden or blunder , that is very much up to us , and the decisions we make now .

Extreme stress can trigger PTSD
US scientists discovered a brain structure involved with memory and emotion had shrunk in children with post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
A withered hippocampus may make a child less able to deal with stress and raise anxiety , Pediatrics journal reports .
The children in the study also had higher blood levels of a stress hormone called cortisol , which has been shown to kill hippocampal cells in animals .
The major question is whether the smaller hippocampus is a predictor of PTSD or a consequence
Professor Joe Herbert , professor of neuroscience at Cambridge University
This could set up a vicious cycle , where high cortisol causes more hippocampal damage , which in turn raises the anxiety .
The Stanford University Medical Center scientists speculate that the ensuing damage could prolong the stress symptoms and also interfere with therapy .
Lead researcher Victor Carrion explained : " One common treatment for PTSD is to help a sufferer develop a narrative of the traumatic experience .
" But if the stress of the event is affecting areas of the brain responsible for processing information and incorporating it into a story , that treatment may not be as effective . "
Extreme stress
He said stress had to be extreme to cause the damage .
" We are not talking about the stress of doing your homework or fighting with your dad , " Dr Carrion said .
The 15 children he and his team studied all had PTSD as a result of physical , emotional or sexual abuse , witnessing violence or experiencing lasting separation and loss .
Dr Carrion said it would now be important to understand why some children appear to be more resilient to stress than others , and what the long - term effects of extreme stress are .
Experts already know a person 's genes and environment play a role , and that having PTSD as a child increases the risk of depression and anxiety in adulthood .
It is estimated that up to 1 in 10 people may develop PTSD at some stage in life .
Professor Joe Herbert , professor of neuroscience at Cambridge University , said : " There is increasing evidence that adversity in early life can have long - lasting results on subsequent mental and physical health , and that at least some of these associations are the result of changes in the secretion of cortisol .
" The major question is whether the smaller hippocampus is a predictor of PTSD or a consequence . "
He said a study in war veterans with PTSD suggested a smaller hippocampus predisposes to PTSD , not the other way round .
It is hard to find an economist who agrees with this policy .
Gary Becker and Julio Jorge Elias argued in a recent paper that " monetary incentives would increase the supply of organs for transplant sufficiently to eliminate the very large queues in organ markets , and the suffering and deaths of many of those waiting , without increasing the total cost of transplant surgery by more than 12 percent . "
Some noneconomists may well find this reasoning repugnant .
There are many reasons , after all , for banning the sale of organs .
Some people consider it immoral to commodify body parts ( although it is now commonplace to not only sell sperm and eggs but also to rent a womb ) .
Others fear that most organ sellers would be poor while most buyers would be rich ; or that someone might be pressured into selling a kidney without fully understanding the risks .
But why , Becker and Elias ask , should poor people " be deprived of revenue that could be highly useful to them " ?
Even more compelling is the fact that a poor person is just as likely as a wealthy person ( if not more so ) to need a new kidney — and , with no legal market for organs , is just as likely to die while waiting on a list .
Alvin Roth , even though he is an economist , is smart enough to realize that repugnance will keep Americans from embracing a true market for organs anytime soon .
So , along with several other scholars and medical personnel , he has helped design a clever alternative , the New England Program for Kidney Exchange .
Imagine that you have a wife who is dying of renal failure , and that you would give her one of your kidneys , but you are not a biological match .
Now imagine that another couple is in the same bind .
The kidney exchange locates and matches the couples : you donate your kidney to the stranger 's wife , while the stranger gives his kidney to your wife ; the operations are performed simultaneously to make sure no one backs out .
Although this system has yielded only a couple dozen transplants so far , it illustrates an economist 's understanding of incentives : if you can't get someone to give an organ out of altruism , and you can't pay him either , what do you do ?
Find two parties who are desperate to align their incentives .
Otherwise , who in his right mind would step forward to donate a kidney to a stranger ?
In fact , we recently spoke to one such potential donor who asked to remain anonymous .
Donor is married , with four children and a precarious financial situation .
Because Donor had a sibling who nearly needed an organ transplant , the idea got into Donor 's head to perhaps sell a kidney to a stranger .
Through a donor
Web site , Donor met a potential recipient , whom we 'll call Recipient .
It was n't until the process was well under way that Donor learned it was illegal to be paid .
In the end , however , Donor 's moral mission overrode the financial need , and Donor decided to go ahead with the transplant .
Donor has undergone extensive testing at the hospital where Recipient will have the transplant .
Both Donor and Recipient have had to lie repeatedly to the doctors , pretending they are old friends .
" If they find out you met on the Internet , " Donor explains , " they assume it 's for money , and they 'll call off the operation . "
If all goes well , the transplant may happen soon .
Consider the parties who stand to profit from this transaction : Recipient , certainly , as well as the transplant surgeons , the nurses , the hospital , the drug companies .
Everyone will be paid in some form — except for Donor , who not only is n't being paid but , in return for carrying out a deeply altruistic act , also has to pay the additional price of lying about it .
Surely there are some people , and not just economists , who would find this situation — well , repugnant .

Excerpted from : THE ONE PERCENT DOCTRINE : Deep Inside America 's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11 , Ron Suskind , 2006 .
[ Pages 11 - 13 . ]
At noon on September 13 , a passing agent ducked his head into Dennis Lormel 's office .
He said that someone had called from the Omaha FBI office .
A company named First Data Corporation , with a huge processing facility out there , wanted to help in any way it could .
A red-eyed Lormel looked up from his desk .
" Oh , that 's big , " he said , breaking into a weary smile .
" That could be very , very big . "
The son of a New York City cop , Lormel had spent two decades working the financial angle of some of the Bureau 's biggest cases , from corrupt congressmen in the Abscam scandal , to allegations of Billy Carter being bribed by Libyans , to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International , or BCCI , the mother of all international bank frauds .
First Data is one of the world 's largest processors of credit card transactions , a company with $ 6.5 billion in revenues and a global reach .
Lormel knew there would be scores of names to check , starting with the nineteen hijackers , and that each name would produce several hits -- false positives -- that would then have to be checked against the place and time specifics of spending histories .
There would be civil liberty issues -- legally , each crecit card search demanded a warrant .
There might not be time for that ; another attack might be on the way .
But Lormel also knew something most of the agents running sleepless around FBI headquarters two days after 9/11 did n't know -- First Data was not only the world 's leading credit card processor -- an extraordinary ally at this moment .
" Inside that company , " he told the young agent , " is a gem . "
Western Union .
The old telegraph company was the engine of a technological revolution many generations removed from the present .
Its heyday was in the 1850s , when it began stringing wire cables across the Northeast , then the first transcontinental cable in 1861 .
Five years later , those cables carried trading on the New York Stock Exchange to cities up and down the East Coast on " tickers . "
It was hailed as a miracle .
The world moved on .
But many of the twenty - two nations in the Arab world still have a foot planted in this past .
Western Union , with nearly $ 2.7 billion in revenue , remains a destination for a wide slice of the Arab world 's 300 million residents .
In some of the less favored parts of the globe , the only way to wire funds is the old - fashioned way .
You bring your money to the Western Union office .
You hand it over .
They count it .
And soon , transmission is made to another of the company 's offices , a hot flash of cold cash .
The so - called " war on terror " is about unlikely twists , strange alliances , about things you least expect .
The unexpected is , in fact , what catches a swiftly adaptable enemy -- namely , a global village of Islamic terrorists -- by surprise .
Lormel is a financial wizard , who talks like a longshoreman , knows how to play rough , and has a fine - tuned capacity to think like his prey -- a perfect character for a moment that demands innovation .
The previous night , he 'd arrived home for dinner after wandering in a daydream through a frantic FBI headquarters for much of the day .
He told his wife , Molly , " I figured a lot of stuff out . . . we need a massive integrated approach to this -- the whole government working together -- and we can wrap them up , all of them , the bastards .
There 's a lot we can do now on the financial side that we could never do before .
If , for once , we just get everyone organized . "
Now , sitting in his office , Lormel told the young agent to go get him a number for First Data , and he chewed over an idea : " We need to turn this company into a deadly weapon . "
[ Pages 34 - 41 . ]
At the massive Omaha processing center for First Data , Bob Mueller 's troops had settled in .
They were deep inside a Fortune 500 company , a place where federal agents had never roamed so freely , prowling through First Data 's massive computer banks .
The company , with its headquarters in Denver , accounts far nearly half of U.S. charge volume , and is involved in charging activity in countries around the world .
In these early days of panic and fear ofa " second wave " attack that span was seen as a virtue .
There was , after all so much to check , starting with the names of all the hijackers .
Each Atta and Hanjour , around the world , needed to be checked , and followed .
Billing addresses were matched with charging history , locations matched with dates .
Is this the right Atta , or another one ?
If he 's the right one , then his spending could create the spine of a thousand companion searches , nightflares lighting a dark path .
One might illuminate the path of another known terrorist , or a financier , or a safe house , or a place that terrorists frequent .
At least , that was the way it was supposed to work .
To understand this moment , and what was driving the actions -- some of which could infringe upon civil liberties and privacy rights -- it is important to understand how little the U.S. counterterrorism effort had , at this point , to rely on and how desperate they were .
There was not one significant human intelligence , or humint , source inside the al Qaeda operation .
There was no evidence of al Qaeda operatives , or supporters , inside the United States .
The Atta team of nineteen had managed to enter the country , operate within it , communicate with al Qaeda leaders , and execute the worst domestic attack in U.S. history , and investigators still did n't know how !
U.S. officials , in both law enforcement and intelligence , were essentially blind and waiting , with dread , for a " second wave . "
The thinking was to act first , work out logistics later .
Yet when FBI offtcials first sat down with First Data in the days after the company had called the bureau , they felt that they had some precedents to rely on .
There is a long history of American companies , otten large , notable companies , working in secret concert with the U.S. government .
Western Union , in fact , had been at the front of that procession .
A company Western Union bought in the 1860s called the American Telegraph Company banned messages in cipher during the Civil War at the behest of the War Department .
During World War II , all U.S. telegraph companies forwarded copies of international cables to the federal government .
The program , " Operation Shamrock , " continued after the war and was unknown to Congress and top intelligence offtcials .
Every day , a courier would leave NSA 's headquarters in Fort Meade , Maryland , and board a train for New York City .
The clerk would copy onto magnetic tape all international telegrams from the day betore that had been sent by three major companies -- ITT , RCA Global , and Western Union -- and bring the tape back to Maryland for analysts to pore over .
This collection of foreign intelligence also involved U.S. citizens and was blocked when it was uncovered , along with other intelligence abuses , during post - Watergate congressional investigations of CIA in the mid-seventies .
Shamrock , and similar abuses in the wiretapping of U.S. citizens -- some of whom were opponents of the Vietnam War -- was the impetus for the passage of the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1978 , and the creation of the so - called " FISA Court . "
Congress determined that any surveillance involving a U.S. citizen would have to be reviewed and approved by the court .
The law was graciously written , allowing for a three - day lag time , so that eavesdropping could be authorized by the President in an emergency and reviewed later .
For the next hventy years , the court was , essentially , a rubber stamp -- handling nineteen thousand applications in its history , and refusing only five .
In White House strategy sessions in September and October of 2001 , officials from FBI , CIA , and NSA -- in consultation always with the Vice President -- looked in desperation at what tools might be available for the unfolding battle .
It broke into two large sectors : telecommunications and finances .
The two would fit together , like the clasp ofleft and right hand , to lay the toundations of a worldwide matrix .
On one side was NSA , which had been working to expand and perfect its sigint capabilities in an era of galloping communications technology .
By 2001 , U.S. citizens made approximately 1.2 billion landline calls a day and 800 million cell phone calls .
E-mails had been growing by a trillion a year for the past five years .
This raging river of noise and digitalia gets channeled through the huge telecommunications " switches " of companies such as Global Crossing , Worldcom , AT&T .
Yet their switches in the United States handle more than just this country 's traffic .
Modern communications travel at all but unfathomable speeds across tbe globe to find the fastest path to their destination .
That means a call -- or e-mail -- between France and Spain may pass though Oregon : and digital packets , shooting through the network , may carry a bundle of messages from Islamabad and Israel .
Borders , in this realm , are meaningless ; location matters not at all .
NSA black boxes sitting on a wide array of telecom switches in the tall of 2001 could gather calls and e-mails from much of the planet .
Which is what they did , as NSA computer technicians furiously worked to perfcct the algorithms for " search and sort " engines to manage the flow .
This is what was explained to each party 's leaders and representatives on both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees in October 2001 -- four from each party , the so - called " gang of eight . "
According to reports of several attendees at these briefings , administration officials explained that the system would be used to hunt known or probable terrorists , their supporters , and their financiers .
It could also handle broadly wrought searches , like massive keyword searches for those who were speaking about terrorist operations and as was already under way -- all calls between the United States and Afghanistan .
Some concern was voiced by congressional Democrats about civil liberties , but informed questions were difficult to pose : the program was so secret that they could n't even consult their staffs .
That same month , October , Bush signed a secret presidential order allowing the NSA , with its telecom helpers , to carry forward what had already begun and continue to eavesdrop on U.S. citizens .
The FISA Court was ignored .
The specific legislation reads that the court will be the " exclusive " arbiter of issues penaining to domestic surveillance of agents of " a foreign power . "
It would , no doubt , have proven logisticaJly challenging for the administration to work with the court -- creating , essentially , warrant applications to eavesdrop on the communications of thousands of U.S. citizens being surveyed by the " blind eye " of the NSA 's sleepless computers , some of which were citizen - to - citizen caJls .
Clearly , a smaller but significant number of Americans were graduating to higher categories of surveillance based on what they did or said .
In fact , the administration did n't consult the court on that smaller number , either .
According to an intelligence source with intimate knowledge of the NSA program and these early days : " The thinking was that going to the FISA Court , or trying to alter the 1978 act , would somehow expose , with leaks , or just from questions that we'd have to answer , what our system 's capabilities were .
Once you take that first step , the rest falls into place -- including a fear that if we just talked to FISA about the smaller subset that drew our increased interest they 'd feel obligated to trace the legal issues to the huge pool of level - one searches .
Either way , we just went ahead . "
That was one part of the worldwide matrix , the communications side -- what people said or wrote .
The other side was what they did .
That , in large measure , meant what they bought , where they bought it , and , generally , where they brought it home .
For this , the administration relied heavily on First Data .
Covenants with other credit card processors in the United States and abroad meant that -- much like the large telecom switches -- everything could be invisibly blended ; a borderless world of transactions .
Western Union had similar sharing arrangements for wire transfers , which often involve banks and various financial institutions .
To clear or trace transactions , large companies generally have access to one another 's back office processing units .
It 's all interconnected .
You just need a universal passport -- like the one Western Union possesses .
Once these two parts , two rivers , were merged after 9/11 , the data rose to flood stage .
Mil1ions of communications dispatches from NSA swamped CIA and FBI .
The former did its own frantic sifting -- something CIA automatically does , looking for that actionable bit of gold .
FBI does n't sift well .
It 's oriented to gather evidence for prosecution -- every bit , every drop , is saved , and doled out for a next step .
Much of the flow went through FBI , with key information brought to the First Data computers -- FBI 's own in - house search engine .
In the first few weeks after the attacks , thousands of financial searches were conducted based on initial communications leads from NSA .
They cascaded into one subset , then another , of increasing interest , priority . . . and effort , by agents rushing , first , to produce paper .
In the FBI , every action must be " papered . "
That means documented in some legally defendable fashion -- something worthy , if need be , of an appearance in court .
The legal umbrella , as of October 26 , was the newly passed USA Patriot Act .
The act allowed for a vast expansion of surveillance within the United States , including the searching of financial and personal records .
and " sneak and peak " provisions , permitting citizens to have their activities monitored without their knowledge .
The favored mechanism used by FBI was something called the " national security letter , " a legal figleaf created for espionage and terrorism investigations in the 1970s as a way to get around consumer privacy laws .
It allowed the FBI to review the customer records of suspected foreign agents secretly .
On balance , maybe a few hundred would be issued annually .
After 9/11 Justice Department lawyers suggested that the letters be used in a new , expanded way .
They noted that the letters could be issued on the simplest , thinnest suspicion -- no real evidence needed .
An NSA hit was plenty .
Scores of top managers , including special agents in charge of many field offices , could issue the letters .
And they issued them in a flurry -- at a rate of thousands a month -- snatched and used like tissues during cold season .
Not that there were n't good old - fashioned subpoenas as well .
There were .
Thousands were issued , approved by the fistful , at the federal court in Omaha .
A special FBI - First Data facility was soon set up near the company 's processing center , a place where agents and company technicians could commune and tap into the great computers -- and beyond , into the world 's financial system -- in respectful sanctity .
Omaha , for a time , produced more subpoenas than any other courthouse in America .
As to sensitivities of congressional oversight of this vast enterprise , a moment in late October is revealing .
Members of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees entered a secure room in the Capitol for a briefing on the " war on terror . "
Officials from Justice , Treasury , CIA and FBI were due to testify about the " financial war . " [ FBI official ]
Dennis Lormel hovered in the back of the empty gallery , talking to a colleague .
There was a delay -- a Senate vote was holding things up .
He'd be going third or fourth .
With him on the panel would be a top financial enforcement official from Treasury named Jim Gurule , who had jurisdiction over the Office of Foreign Assets Control , or OFAC .
As a peace offering of sorts -- since First Data was an FBI partner -- Lormel had let some officials of the Secret Service , which handles credit card fraud , come by First Data .
They were , after all , experts in trolling the planet of card charges .
Lormel squinted from a distance as he watched Gurule begin to set up .
There was an easel .
Gurule unsheathed a visual aid for his presentation : a large chart showing how First Data was accessing and organizing financial information across the globe .
Lormel , all 220 pounds , rushed him from across the roorn .
" Are you fuckin ' crazy ?
Get that sign out of here .
No one is supposed to know about this .
And , Jesus , it is n't even a Treasury operation ! "
Gurule was stunned .
He took down the poster and hustled it out of the room .
Congressional oversight of covert activities is a principle that distinguishes the United States from other countries .
It is an ideal that is central to the checks and balances -- the counteracting ambitions , as Madison and others had attested -- that prevent abuses of power .
In this case .
and scores of others , those fighting the " war on terror " decided it was an unaffordable luxury .
In that day 's testimony -- and many to follow -- no one uttered the name First Data .
And so a vast search - and - seizure machine , with a financial body and a communications head , was constructed and fired up to match the challenges of this man- on - man war .
History will ultimately judge that machine , and those who encouraged it to be built -- from the President on down -- against words written with ink quills more than two centuries ago .
The Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights to the U.S. Constitution ensures that " The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violatcd , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized . "
It is often called the most forcefully written of the amendments .
You can feel the founders ' ardor , a do n't - tread - on - me fierceness of spirit in the declarative phrasing .
They had , after all , just completed a successful insurgency against the controlling authority of Great Britain ; they were used to being " violated " in Boston and Philadelphia , Concord and Hoboken , and to not being " secure in their persons . "
The words " probable cause " are among the most oft - spoken and colloquial of any in the document : they regulate , artfully , the collision point between citizens and their government under the proposition that reasonable people will be able to agree , for the most part , on that standard .
Whether reasonable people agree or not with this particular course of action -- and the expansion of presidential authority it entails -- will be debated for years ; maybe , even , for as long as the so - called " war on terror " lasts .
What is known and indisputable ?
As this machine searched the landscape , it swept up the suspicious , or simply the unfortunate , by the stadiumful and caught almost no one who was actually a danger to America .
[ Page 211 . ]
[ At a meeting with FBI , CIA and Western Union at CIA headquarters . ]
Lormel talked about what a good friend Western Union has been since 9/11 .
Nervous Phil [ a pseudonym ] talked a bit about what might be done going forward .
Western Union had twelve thousand offices across the globe , thirteen hundred in Pakistan alone .
There was no country more important in battling the terrorists .
Everyone nodded , a show of consensus , until one of the Western Union executives had something to say .
He looked at Tenet .
" Here 's my concern , " he said .
" If it seems that Western Union is a global front for the CIA , we 'll go out of business . "
Tenet leaned forward in his chair and dropped his ace .
" I know we 're asking a lot , " he said .
" But this country is in a fight for its survival .
What I 'm asking is that you and your company be patriots . "
After that , it was all about logistics .
[ pp. 231-233 . ]
Two weeks after Western Union officials met with Tenet , [ head of Israel 's Shin Bet ]
Dichter gave the United States a piece of intelligence to begin the process : the name of a supporter of Palestinian Islamic Jihad who was expected to wire money from Lebanon to a point somewhere in Israel .
Early in April , Western Union 's offices in Lebanon received the expected order .
The Terrorism Section of the Department of Justice , on twnety - four hour call , kicked into gear .
In an arrangement with the U.S. Federal Court for the Eastern District of Virginia , based in Alexandria , they issued an instantaneous subpoena .
It allowed Western Union -- a U.S. - based company -- to notify FBI and CIA about which location the money was being wired to , and who was picking it up .
All of it occurred in minutes .
Israeli intelligence officers were hailed .
They raced , silently to the right Western Union office in Hebron , and then followed the PIJ courier to his safe house in the West Bank .
From , there , electronic surveillance equipment quickly tracked communications to other cells in the Palestinian territories .
Two further wire transfers were targeted in early May .
And , each time , the golden disclosure was handed by the U.S. government to Israeli forces , altering the balance of power in a low - grade war .
A robotic beast of burden , BigDog can carry upwards of 40 kilograms – perfect to take the weight off a tired soldier ( Image : Boston Dynamics )
A nimble , four - legged robot is so surefooted it can recover its balance even after being given a hefty kick .
The machine , which moves like a cross between a goat and a pantomime horse , is being developed as a robotic pack mule for the US military .
BigDog is described by its developers Boston Dynamics as “ the most advanced quadruped robot on Earth ” .
The company have released a new video of the robot negotiating steep slopes , crossing rocky ground and dealing with the sharp kick .
View the impressive clip here ( 28 MB Windows media file ) .
“ Internal force sensors detect the ground variations and compensate for them , ” says company president and project manager Marc Raibert .
“ And BigDog ’s active balance allows it to maintain stability when we disturb it . ”

This active balance is maintained by four legs , each with three joints powered by actuators and a fourth “ springy ” joint .
All the joints are controlled by an onboard PC processor .
Robotic pack mule
The project is sponsored by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , who want the robotic pack mule to assist soldiers in terrain too tough for vehicles .
Ground - based soldiers often need to carry 40 kilograms of equipment .
Raibert says the latest version of BigDog can handle slopes of 35° – a steeper gradient than one in two .
The hydraulics are driven by a two - stroke single - cylinder petrol engine , and it can carry over 40 kg , about 30 % of its bodyweight .
The robot can follow a simple path on its own , or can be remotely controlled .
Kerb climbing
“ They seem to have done a good job with adaptive dynamics and fast reflexes to deal with terrain variation and disturbances , ” says Barbara Webb , at Edinburgh University ’s Mobile Robotics Research Group in the UK .
“ These are hard problems . ”
But she notes BigDog is not shown negotiating higher obstacles such as kerbs , which may pose difficulties .
Roboticist Darwin Caldwell , at the University of Salford , UK , adds : “ It certainly looks very impressive – fast moving , highly reactive , autonomous both in power and possible intelligence and looking fairly robust .
I have seen none that would be better .
But there must always be a certain caution from videos . ”
The legs on the next version of BigDog , V3 , will each have an additional powered joint and will be able to take on even steeper slopes and rougher terrain at higher speed , its makers say .
The DOD regulations make clear that the White House cannot use uniformed military , active duty or veterans , as props in political events .
But that 's what Bush did today when he used current or former troops in uniform as window dressing for his political press conference attacking the Democrats as un-American .
Is this now the official policy of the US military , that Democrats do n't support the troops ?
What are we , a banana republic now ?
Let me quote the relevant regulations ...
Regarding active duty troops
It is DoD policy that :
3.1 . The wearing of the uniform by members of the Armed Forces ( including retired members and members of Reserve components ) is prohibited under any of the following circumstances :
3.1.1 .
At any meeting or demonstration that is a function of , or sponsored by an organization , association , movement , group , or combination of persons that the Attorney General of the United States has designated , under Executive Order 10450 as amended ( reference ( c ) ) , as totalitarian , fascist , communist , or subversive , or as having adopted a policy of advocating or approving the commission of acts of force or violence to deny others their rights under the Constitution of the United States , or as seeking to alter the form of Government of the United States by unconstitutional means .
3.1.2 . During or in connection with furthering political activities , private employment or commercial interests , when an inference of official sponsorship for the activity or interest may be drawn .
3.1.3 . Except when authorized by the approval authorities in subparagraph 4.1.1. , when participating in activities such as unofficial public speeches , interviews , picket lines , marches , rallies or any public demonstration , which may imply Service sanction of the cause for which the demonstration or activity is conducted .
3.2 . Former members of the Armed Forces , unless under another provision of this Instruction or
under the terms of Section 772 of title 10 , United States Code ( reference ( d ) ) , who served honorably during a declared or undeclared war and whose most recent service was terminated under honorable conditions may wear the uniform in the highest grade held during such war service only on the following occasions and in the course of travel incident thereto :
3.2.1 . Military funerals , memorial services , weddings , and inaugurals .
3.2.2 . Parades on National or State holidays ; or other parades or ceremonies of a patriotic character in which any Active or Reserve United States military unit is taking part .
3.2.3 .
Wearing of the uniform or any part thereof at any other time or for any other purposes is prohibited .
3.3 . Medal of Honor holders may wear the uniform at their pleasure except under the circumstances set forth in paragraph 3.1. , above .
And regarding retired vets : So , no one can wear the uniforms at political events , which this most certainly was , vets can't wear them at anything short of funerals , weddings and parades , and medal of honor winners can wear them at more events , but still not at political events , which this was .
But and the Republicans only like our veterans when they can use them , and when they have 4 limbs .
General Petraeus ’s briefing comes in a week when war - related developments are not running in the Bush administration ’s favor .
Nine American soldiers were killed in Iraq on Monday and 20 others wounded .
And members of the family of Pat Tillman , the professional football player and Army Ranger accidentally killed by other American soldiers in Afghanistan , appeared at an emotional House hearing today and accused the Pentagon and the administration of misrepresenting the circumstances of his death .
Even as Mr. Bush and Vice President Cheney repeated their claim that a deadline for beginning a troop withdrawal would cede Iraq to America ’s enemies , it has quietly been setting targets of its own for the Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki to show progress on long - delayed political accommodations .
In a telephone interview from Baghdad , the new American ambassador to Iraq , Ryan Crocker , said both President Bush and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates had bluntly told Mr. Maliki that a failure to show results would undermine the administration ’s efforts to buy him more time .
“ There is Iraqi time and American time , ” Mr. Crocker said .
“ And American time is running away from us , while Iraqi time is running at a slower place . ”
Under the legislation before Congress , the United States would establish benchmarks for the Iraqi government to meet to show progress in securing the country .
If the president determines the Iraqis are complying , he would be directed to begin removing troops by Oct. 1 , with a goal of having most combat forces out within six months .
If the president concludes the Iraqis are not making progress on the benchmarks , the pullout would begin earlier , by July .
The House narrowly approved its version of the spending measure last month when it required a full withdrawal by fall of 2008 to mollify antiwar Democrats .
Several House Democrats said they would support the latest version of the legislation even though the withdrawal date is now in the form of a goal .
“ It is the best we can do under the circumstances , ” said Hank Johnson Jr. , a first - term Democrat from Georgia .
It seems that every time Bill Gates hops up on a stage to promote a new operating system , nothing goes according to plan .
At the launch of the Windows XP Operating System , servers shut down , printers did n’t work and access was denied .
Six years on , Gates has tried his luck again to no avail at the ‘ Get Ready ’ tour in New York .
This time , it was with the gesture movement system and the new Vista platform .
Just recently released on the Scoble show , Microsoft engineer Andy Wilson has been responsible for building the gesture recognition software , which allows you to make a gesture with your hand , have it captured with a $ 30 webcam and then translated into a command of your choosing .
This software was integrated into the live demonstration that Gates was to provide the audience of an estimated 15,000 .
During the live demonstration , audience members had access via videoscreens to Gates ’ hand gestures and the desktop he was using .
In a move of humour that can only be described as ‘ harshly backfiring ’ , Gates made an unscripted and unrehearsed ‘ birdy ’ gesture to the machine , sparking a roar of laughter from the crowd .
The response was less than expected , with the system retorting with “ yeah and my other ride is your mother dude ” flashing across the video screens before locking up and not restoring .
An obviously angered Gates tried to contain his frustration with the system , providing the crowd of onlookers with nothing but a nervous smile .
Andy Wilson ’s reaction to the issue regardless was forthright “ it ’s a windows program – everyone knows you do n’t mess with a windows program in front of a large audience .
You ’re always going to come off second best if you do n’t follow the script ” .

Now you have an opportunity to book an online meeting with me and discuss all possible questions and ideas related to business and finance you might have .
i couldnt ' help but laugh like a maniac at the shit this poor guy had to go through ...... check out this halo movie too !!!!!
A new set of laws has been proposed to govern operations by killer robots .
The ideas were floated by John S Canning , an engineer at the Naval Surface Warfare Centre , Dahlgren Division – an American weapons - research and test establishment .
Mr Canning 's “ Concept of Operations for Armed Autonomous Systems ” presentation can be downloaded here ( pdf ) .
Many Reg readers will be familiar with the old - school Asimov Laws of Robotics , but these are clearly unsuitable for war robots – too restrictive .
However , the new Canning Laws are certainly not a carte blanche for homicidal droids to obliterate fleshies without limit ; au contraire .
Canning proposes that robot warriors should be allowed to mix it up among themselves freely , autonomously deciding to blast enemy weapon systems .
Many enemy “ systems ” would , of course , be themselves robots , so it 's clear that machine - on - machine violence is n't a problem .
The difficulty comes when the automatic battlers need to target humans .
In such cases Mr Canning says that permission from a human operator should be sought .
“ Let machines target other machines , ” he writes , “ and let men target men . ”
The concept document makes the point that various kinds of automated death - tech have been allowed to destroy machinery or even people for years .
He cites anti-shipping missiles which are sometimes sent off over the horizon and told to look around for a target .
Other examples include automatic air - defence systems such as Phalanx or Aegis which blast anything which comes at them too fast , or the “ Captor ” seabed system which torpedoes passing submarines but leaves surface ships alone .
It is n't really made clear how the ask - permission - to - kill - meatsacks rule could really be applied in these cases .
Doppler radar is going to have trouble distinguishing between attacking manned jets and incoming missiles , for instance .
Even if the two could be swiftly and reliably differentiated , adding a human reaction and decision period in an air - defence scenario may not be a survivable thing to do .
Mr Canning also says that the emphasis should be on destroying enemy weaponry rather than people .
“ We can equip our machines with non-lethal technologies for the purpose of convincing the enemy to abandon their weapons prior to our machines destroying the weapons , and lethal weapons to kill their weapons , ” he suggests .
This raises the prospect of American robot enforcers packing the crowd - cookers , strobe pacifier cannons or Star Trek puke blasters already reported by El Reg , and also some conventional exploding stuff .
Once enemy troops had been partially grilled , rendered epileptic or incapacitated by vomit beams , presumably fleeing as a result , the droid assailants could blow up their abandoned tanks , artillery , ships or whatnot .
Of course , this might not work so well with personal enemy weaponry such as the ubiquitous AK47 or RPG .
Interestingly , though , Mr Canning quotes airforce major R Craig Burton of the Judge Advocate General 's Legal Centre :
“ If people or property is n't a military objective , we do n't target it .
It might be destroyed as collateral damage , but we do n't target it .
Thus in many situations , we could target the individual holding the gun and / or the gun and legally there 's no difference . ”
Which seems to suggest that a robot could decide , under Mr Canning 's rules , to target a weapon system such as an AK47 for destruction on its own initiative , requiring no permission from a human .
If the person holding it was thereby killed , that would be collateral damage and the killer droid would be in the clear .
Effectively the robot is allowed to disarm enemies by prying their guns from their cold dead hands .
El Reg 's advice ?
Do what the droids say .
They are our friends . ®

It really was just a few days ago that the entertainment industry folks were claiming that it was the consumer electronics industry that was trying to pervert " fair use , " right ?
Somehow , it seems like it's the entertainment industry that 's the one pushing the boundaries .
Almost exactly a year ago , we had a post about a new service that would sell you a video iPod and DVDs ... and would load the video from the DVDs onto the iPod ( and then ship you both the iPod and the DVD ) .
This should be perfectly legal .
After all , the owner has legally purchased both the iPod and the DVD , and the company is simply making the process easier by transferring the video to the iPod as well -- and it's well established that you can make a personal backup of content you have legally purchased .
However , knowing how the industry views fair use , Carlo titled his post " Sue Me , I Dare You " and noted in the text : " the clock 's ticking on the first lawsuit . "
Well , it turns out the clock ticked a little longer than we expected , but it did happen eventually .
The EFF is noting that the MPAA has sued a company for doing exactly this .
They are , of course , claiming that ripping the DVDs is a DMCA violation , because the DVDs have copy protection , and circumventing that is against the DMCA -- even though physically copying content you own to another format is legal fair use .
As the EFF notes in the post , while the MPAA is focusing on this company that does the ripping for you , the meaning is clear : they do not believe that making a personal copy of a DVD is legal -- despite all of the historical precedent set with CDs and software .
The only " difference " here is that the DVD has some weak copy protection , and therefore the DMCA applies .
In other words , they 're not saying that it 's illegal to make a copy -- because it 's not .
They 're saying it 's illegal to get around the copy protection .
And , of course , they 're doing this because they want to force you to buy the same content over and over and over again .
And , yet , they still claim that it 's folks like us who are changing the meaning of " fair use . "

The appointment of George Bush 's leading hawk as head of the World Bank was heading for a crisis over his relationship with a senior British employee .
Influential members of staff at the international organisation have complained to its board that Paul Wolfowitz , a married father of three , is so besotted with Oxford - educated Shaha Riza he can not be impartial .
Extraordinarily , they claim she played a key role in pushing the 61 - year - old Pentagon official into the Iraq War .
And the row comes amid claims that Wolfowitz 's wife Clare once warned George Bush of the threat to national security any infidelity by her husband could cause .
A British citizen - at 51 , eight years younger than Wolfowitz 's wife - Ms Riza grew up in Saudi Arabia and was passionately committed to democratising the Middle East when she allegedly began to date Wolfowitz .
She studied at the London School of Economics in the Seventies before taking a master 's degree at St Anthony 's College , Oxford , where she met her future husband , Turkish Cypriot Bulent Ali Riza , from whom she is now divorced .
After they moved to America , Shaha worked for the Iraq Foundation , set up by expatriates to overthrow Saddam Hussein after the first Gulf War .
She subsequently joined the National Endowment for Democracy , created by President Ronald Reagan to promote American ideals .
Bulent Riza said Shaha started to " talk to Paul " about reforming the Middle East .
And New Yorker magazine 's respected commentator Paul Boyer observed that a senior World Bank official " named Shaha Ali Riza " was an " influence " .
Downing Street ' furious ' at nomination
Wolfowitz became known around the world as one of the fiercest proponents of invasion of Iraq .
The Mail on Sunday has learned that Downing Street is " furious " about his nomination , fearing his hardline attitude could alienate large sections of the international community .
But it is his tangled private life that could stop him taking up the World Bank post .
Critics say it would be impossible for Wolfie - as he is nicknamed by Bush - to make independent decisions when his lover , who works on Middle Eastern and North African issues , is so committed to overthrowing Middle Eastern regimes .
" His womanising has come home to roost , " a Washington insider said .
" Paul was a foreign policy hawk long before he met Shaha but it does n't look good to be accused of being under the thumb of your mistress . "
One of his opponents at the bank said : " Unless Riza gives up her job , this will be an impossible conflict of interest . "
National security risk
Wolfowitz married Clare Selgin in 1968 .
But they have lived separately since 2001 , after allegations of an affair with an employee at the School of Advanced International Studies where he was dean for seven years .
According to one Republican Administration insider , Clare was so upset by rumours about the affair that she wrote to then President Elect Bush , saying if the story were true it could pose a national security risk .
Yesterday , she refused to comment on whether her husband had been unfaithful before their separation , saying : " I really do not want to share this with you . "
She also refused to confirm her marital status - reports of his appointment repeatedly describe Wolfowitz as divorced but The Mail on Sunday has been unable to find any records .
Asked if she is separated or divorced , Clare replied : " That 's my business . "
On the claim that she wrote a letter to Bush , she said : " That 's very interesting but not something I can tell you about . "
A friend of Wolfowitz insisted last night that he had not been unfaithful : " Paul and Clare have been separated since 2001 .
It is my understanding they are now legally separated . "
By tradition , the United States picks the bank 's president , but the decision must be approved by its board .
The US has a 16 per cent vote , but Europe collectively has about 30 per cent .
The bank 's staff association has told executives it has been swamped with complaints from employees about Wolfowitz .
However , Wolfowitz 's only comment on the complaints has been a terse statement issued through a Pentagon spokesman .
He said : " If a personal relationship presents a potential conflict of interest , I will comply with bank policies to resolve the issue . "
Hace unas semanas publicó mQh unas extravagantes noticias sobre los proyectos e intentos de partidos de la extrema derecha holandesa , con la ministro de Extranjería a la cabeza , de prohibir que en las calles del país se hable otra lengua que el holandés .
La iniciativa parece sacada de una novela sobre el nazismo , y en realidad las ideas de la ministro , que no por nada es llamada en esas mismas calles ‘ la Hija de Hitler ’ , tienen el insoportable tufo de los atavismos germánicos .
También extraordinario es que la iniciativa de la ministro no es nueva y que un proyecto que procuraba que los extranjeros se expresasen en holandés en las calles , que evidentemente fracasó , ya se implementó en una ciudad holandesa .
Y no menos extraordinario es que el actual proyecto es iniciativa del partido fascista de Rotterdam , que se ha hecho en las últimas elecciones municipales , con la complicidad de la derecha tradicional , con el gobierno del ayuntamiento .
Originalmente la idea fue defendida argumentando que facilitaría la integración de los extranjeros , aunque es difícil advertir cómo o en qué sentido una idea tan estúpida puede contribuir a una integración que cuenta con otros obstáculos más importantes , entre ellos las propias políticas racistas y discriminatorias del gobierno .
¿ Qué se ganaría , en efecto , con impedir que los extranjeros hablen en sus lenguas ?
Y se puede además argumentar con bastante solidez que prohibir que los extranjeros hablen en sus idiomas maternos puede tener efectos negativos sobre la integración .
Entre los nuevos argumentos de los fascistas holandeses se lee ahora que los holandeses se sienten inseguros y hasta amenazados de oír lenguas extranjeras en las calles y espacios públicos de su país .
Hay que observar que esto ocurre en un país que fue en el pasado reciente símbolo de tolerancia .
Pero lo que seguramente no dirán las agencias de prensa es que todo este intento de legislar sobre qué idioma hablar en las calles afecta solamente a los extranjeros de origen árabe o musulmanes o ciudadanos de países que Holanda , por razones bastante curiosas , considera no occidentales .
Nadie piensa en vigilar si los turistas ingleses o franceses acatan las nuevas disposiciones municipales .
Nadie les ha dicho que , por ejemplo , el español y el francés causan temor entre los aborígenes .
Es lamentable que un país que mereció durante años el justo elogio de la comunidad internacional esté ahora dominado por una equipo de políticos incapaces y mal paridos que han implantando el odio y el apartheid como forma de gobierno y que de forma subrepticia y haciendo uso de argumentos peregrinos quiere volver a los valores que los aliados destruyeron en Alemania en 1945 .
Sin tener nada que defender en la historia del mundo occidental , Holanda ha vuelto a caer en las tenebrosas ideologías germánicas que pensábamos que habían desaparecido .
Hay mucha gente que cree que es imposible que vuelva a ocurrir .
Yo creo que en la historia nada es imposible .
Y puede volver a ocurrir , en Holanda .

The Securities and Exchange Commission has taken a step toward combating stock spam , the unsolicited bulk e-mail message that promotes cheap stocks for quick profits , which usually prove illusory .
Starting an enforcement effort it is calling Operation Spamalot , the S.E.C. suspended trading in 35 stocks that had been promoted in recent spam campaigns .
The suspensions will last for 10 days .
The S.E.C. said that further investigation could lead to arrests .
Spam over all has swelled during the last six months , and now accounts for more than 90 percent of all e-mail messages , according to the Internet security firm Secure Computing .
Stock spam has been a significant contributor to that growth and now accounts for 30 percent of all spam , the company said .
The e-mail messages seek to persuade recipients to buy shares in a company , generally one that has few shares available to the public .
The spammers buy shares before they send out their e-mail messages , then sell when the price rises .
The victims who buy the stock typically see the value of their shares fall drastically .

Soap puts a new twist on tradional optical mice by adding mid-air functionality .
This technology is “ based on hardware found in a mouse ” and “ consists of an optical sensor device moving freely inside a hull made of fabric . ”
Video demonstration after the jump .
As the user applies pressure from the outside , the optical sensor moves independent from the hull .
The optical sensor perceives this relative motion and reports it as position input .
Soap offers many of the benefits of optical mice , such as high - accuracy sensing

1. Foot Mouse
Back when video games were still fun ( we ’re talking about the 8 - bit glory days here ) ,
graphics were a much simpler matter by necessity .
Bitmapped 2 - dimensional character data
and background scenery was individually drawn , much like today ’s resurgent pixel art .
Hundreds and later thousands of small graphics called sprites were the building blocks
for all things visual in a game .
Article Continues Below
As game complexity increased , techniques developed to manage the multitude of sprites
while keeping game play flowing .
One variation saw sprites being plugged into a master
grid , then later pulled out as needed by code that mapped positions of each individual
graphic , and selectively painted them on the screen .
And what does this have to do with the web ?
#section2
Everything old is new again , and though the rise of 3D games has made sprite maps
obsolete , the concurrent rise of mobile devices with 2D gaming capabilities
have brought them back into vogue .
And now , with a bit of math and a lot of CSS ,
we ’re going to take the basic concept and apply it to the world of web design .
Specifically , we ’re going to replace old - school image slicing and dicing ( and the
necessary JavaScript ) with a CSS solution .
And because of the way CSS works , we ’re
going to take it further : by building a grid of images and devising a way to get each
individual cell out of the grid , we can store all buttons / navigation items / whatever we wish
in a single master image file , along with the associated “ before ” and “ after ” link states .
How do CSS Sprites work ?
#section3
As it turns out , the basic tools to do this are built into CSS , given a bit of creative
thinking .
Let ’s start with the master image itself .
Dividing a rectangle into four items , you ’ll
observe in this master image that our intended “ before ” link
images are on the top row , with “ after ” : hover states immediately below .
There ’s
no clear division between the four links at the moment , so imagine that each piece of text is
a link for now .
( For the sake of simplicity , we ’ll continue to refer to link images as
“ before ” images and the : hover state as “ after ” for the rest of this article .
It ’s possible to extend this method to :active , : focus , and
: visited links states as well , but we wo n’t go into that here . )
Those familiar with Petr Stanicek ’s ( Pixy )
Fast Rollovers may
already see where we ’re going with this .
This article owes a debt of gratitude to Pixy’s
example for the basic function we ’ll be relying on .
But let ’s not get ahead of ourselves .
On to the HTML .
Every good CSS trick strives to add a layer of visuals on top of a clean
block of code , and this technique is no exception :
< ul id =" skyline " > < li id =" panel1b " >< a href= " # 1 " ></a></li> < li id =" panel2b " >< a href= " # 2 " ></a></li> < li id =" panel3b " >< a href= " # 3 " ></a></li> < li id =" panel4b " >< a href= " # 4 " ></a></li> </ul >
This code will serve as a base for our example .
Light - weight , simple markup that degrades
well in older and CSS - disabled browsers is all the rage , and it ’s a trend that ’s good for the
industry .
It ’s a great ideal to shoot for .
( We ’ll ignore any text inside the links for the
time being .
Apply your favorite
image replacement
technique later to hide the text you ’ll end up adding . )
Applying the CSS#section4
With those basic building blocks , it ’s time to build the CSS .
A quick note before we
start — because of an IE glitch , we ’ll be tiling the after image on top of the before image when we need it , instead of replacing one with the other .
The result makes
no real visual difference if we line them up precisely , but this method avoids what
otherwise would be an obvious “ flicker ” effect that we do n’t want .
#skyline { width : 400 px ; height : 200 px ; background : url ( test - 3.jpg ) ; margin : 10 px auto ; padding : 0 ; position : relative ;} # skyline li { margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; list - style : none ; position : absolute ; top : 0 ; } # skyline li , #skyline a { height : 200 px ; display : block ; }
Counter - intuitively , we ’re not assigning the before image to the links at all , it ’s applied
to the < ul > instead .
You ’ll see why in a moment .
The rest of the CSS in the above example sets things like the dimensions of the #skyline
block and the list items , starting positions for the list items , and it turns off the
unwanted list bullets .
We ’ll be leaving the links themselves as empty , transparent blocks ( though with specific
dimensions ) to trigger the link activity , and position them using the containing
< li > s.
If we were to position the links themselves and effectively ignore
the < li > s , we ’d start seeing errors in older browsers , so let ’s avoid
this .
Positioning the links #section5
The < li > s are absolutely positioned , so why are n’t they at the top of the browser
window ?
A quirky but useful property of positioned elements is that all descendent elements contained within them base their absolute position not off the corners of the browser window , but off the corners of the nearest positioned ancestor element .
The upshot of this is that since we applied
position : relative ; to #skyline , we ’re able to absolutely position the
< li > s from the top left corner of #skyline itself .
# panel1 b {left : 0 ; width : 95 px ; } # panel2 b {left : 96 px ; width : 75 px ; } # panel3 b {left : 172 px ; width : 110 p x;} # panel4 b {left : 283 px ; width : 117px;}
So # panel1 is n’t horizontally positioned at all , # panel2b is positioned 96px to the left of
#skyline ’s left edge , and so on .
We assigned the links a display : block ; value
and the same height as the < li > s in the past listing , so they ’ll end up
filling their containing < li > s , which is exactly what we want .
At this point we have a basic image map with links , but no : hover states .
See the example .
It ’s probably easier to see what ’s happening
with borders turned on .
In the past we would have applied some JavaScript to swap in a new image for the after
state .
Instead our after states are in one image , so all we need is a way
to selectively pull each state out for the appropriate link .
If we apply the master image to the : hover state without additional values ,
we make only the top left corner visible — not what we want , though clipped by the link
area , which is what we want .
We need to move the position of the image somehow .
We ’re dealing with known pixel values ; a little bit of math should enable us to offset
that background image enough both vertically and horizontally so that only the piece
containing the after state shows .
That ’s exactly what we ’ll do :
# panel1b a:hover { background : transparent url ( test - 3.jpg ) 0 - 200 px no- repeat ;} # panel2 b a : hover { background : transparent url ( test - 3.jpg ) - 96 px - 200 px no- repeat ; } # panel3 b a : hover { background : transparent url ( test - 3.jpg ) - 172 px - 200 px no- repeat ; } # panel4 b a : hover { background : transparent url ( test - 3.jpg ) - 283 px - 200 px no-repeat; }
Where did we get those pixel values ?
Let ’s break it down : the first value is of course
the horizontal offset ( from the left edge ) , and the second is the vertical .
Each vertical value is equal ; since the master image is 400 pixels high and the after
states sit in the bottom half , we ’ve simply divided the height .
Shifting the whole background
image up by 200 px requires us to apply the value as a negative number .
Think of the top
edge of the link as the starting point , or 0 .
To position the background image 200 pixels
above this point , it makes sense to move the starting point - 200 px .
Likewise , if the left edge of each link is effectively 0 , we ’ll need to offset the
background image horizontally by the width of all < li > s prior to the one
we ’re working with .
So the first link does n’t require an offset , since there are no pixels
before its horizontal starting point .
The second link requires an offset the width of the
first , the third link requires an offset of the combined width of the first two links , and
the last requires an offset of the combined width of all three previous links .
It ’s a bit cumbersome to explain the process , but playing around with the values will
quickly show you how the offsets work , and once you ’re familiar it ’s not all that hard to
do .
So there you have it .
Single - image CSS rollovers , degradable
to a simple unordered list .
There ’s no reason why we have to leave the links touching each other , side - by - side as they
were in the previous example .
Image maps may be convenient in some spots , but what about
separating each link into its own stand - alone button ?
That way we can add borders and
margins , let the underlying background show through , and generally treat them as separately
as we need to .
In fact , the building blocks are already in place .
We really do n’t need to
modify our code too radically ; the main change is in creating a new background image that
does n’t continue from link to link like the last example did .
Since we ca n’t rely on the
< ul > for placing the original background image , we ’ll end up
applying it to all < li > s instead and offsetting each the same way we
offset the after states in the prior example .
With an appropriate image and a bit of spacing between each
< li > , we ’ve got buttons .
Note that in this example we ’ve added 1 px borders which , of course , count toward the final
width of the links .
This affects our offset values ; we ’ve compensated by adding 2 px to the
offsets where appropriate .
Irregular shapes #section8
Up till now we ’ve focused only on rectangular , non-overlapping shapes .
What about the more
complex image maps that image slicers like Fireworks and ImageReady export so easily ?
Relax ,
we ’ve got you covered there too .
We ’ll start the same way as the first example , by applying the background image to the
< ul > and turning off list item bullets and setting widths and so forth .
The big difference is where we position the < li > s ; the goal is to
surround each graphical element with a box that tightly hugs the
edges .
Again , because of the ability to use absolute positioning relative to the top left corner
of the < ul > , we ’re able to precisely place our links exactly where we want them .
Now
all that ’s left is to set up the hover states .
Worth noting is that in this case , a single set of before and after images was n’t enough .
Because of the overlapping objects , relying on only one after state would show pieces of
surrounding objects ’ after states .
In fact , it would show precisely the pieces that fall
within the link ’s borders .
( Easiest to just see it in action . )
How to avoid this ?
By adding a second after state , and carefully selecting which objects go
where .
The master image in this case has split the purple and blue
objects into the first after state , and the green , orange and yellow objects into the second .
This order allows boxes to be drawn around each object ’s after state without including
pieces of the surrounding objects .
And the illusion is complete .
Benefits and pitfalls #section9
A couple of final thoughts .
Our new CSS Sprite method tests well in most modern browsers .
The notable exception is Opera 6 , which does n’t apply a background image on link hover states .
Why , we ’re not sure , but it means that our hovers do n’t work .
The links still do , and if
they ’ve been labeled properly , the net result will be a static , but usable image map in
Opera 6 .
We ’re willing to live with that , especially now that Opera 7 has been around for a
while .
The other concern is familiar to anyone who has spent time with
FIR .
In the rare cases in which users
have turned off images in their browsers but retained CSS , a big empty hole will appear
in the page where we expect our images to be placed .
The links are still there and clickable ,
but nothing visually appears .
At press time , there was no known way around this .
Then there ’s file size .
The natural tendency is to assume that a full double - sized image must be heavier than a
similar set of sliced images , since the overall image area will usually be larger .
All image
formats have a certain amount of overhead though ( which is why a 1px by 1px white GIF
saves to around 50 bytes ) , and the more slices you have , the more quickly that overhead adds up .
Plus , one master image requires only a single color table when using a GIF , but each slice
would need its own .
Preliminary tests suggest that all this indicates smaller total file
sizes for CSS Sprites , or at the very least not appreciably larger sizes .
And lastly , let ’s not forget that our markup is nice and clean , with all the advantages that go
along with that .
HTML lists degrade wonderfully , and a proper image replacement technique
will leave the text links accessible to screenreaders .
Replacing the sprite imagery is dead
simple , since all of our dimensions and offsets are controlled in a single CSS file , and all
of our imagery sits in a single image .
800 Euro für alle Bürger ?
Thorsten Stegemann
Das Hamburgische WeltWirtschaftsInstitut hält ein bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen für " volkswirtschaftlich effizient " und " finanzierbar "
Thüringens Ministerpräsident Dieter Althaus ( CDU ) favorisiert seit geraumer Zeit die Idee eines solidarischen Bürgergeldes , das die deutsche Sozialpolitik auf eine völlig neue Basis stellen könnte .
Wenn sein Konzept jemals umgesetzt würde , bekäme jeder Bundesbürger nach seinem 18 .
Lebensjahr ein garantiertes , bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen von monatlich 800 €. Ein Viertel dieser Summe wäre als Gesundheits - und Pflegeprämie vorgesehen .
Der Spitzensteuersatz für darüber hinausgehende Einkommen läge bei 50 Prozent , allerdings hätten die Empfänger die Chance auf eine deutlich geringere „ Flat Tax “ von 25 Prozent , wenn sie nur die Hälfte des Bürgergeldes in Anspruch nähmen .
Der schonungslose Gebrauch des Konjunktivs macht deutlich , welche Realisierungschancen einem solchen Projekt gemeinhin eingeräumt werden .
Die Vorstellung , die Vielzahl staatlicher Transferleistungen zu bündeln und den Dschungel der Steuertarife zu lichten , ist offenbar zu simpel , als dass jemand ernsthaft glauben könnte , sie ließe sich in der regulierungsfreudigen Bundesrepublik ohne Widerstände und auch noch zeitnah in praktische Politik verwandeln .
Trotzdem findet der Kombilohn für alle offenkundig immer mehr und zunehmend parteiübergreifende Unterstützung .
Deutliche Zustimmung kam nicht nur aus den Reihen von CDU und FDP , sondern auch von Seiten der Linkspartei und der Grünen .
Wenige Tage nachdem Götz W. Werner , Gründer der Drogeriemarktkette „ dm “ , auf der Leipziger Buchmesse mit seinem Plädoyer Einkommen für alle für Diskussionsstoff sorgte , stellte das Hamburgische WeltWirtschaftsInstitut ( HWWI ) nun am Montag in Berlin eine umfangreiche Untersuchung vor .
Die Studie mit dem programmatischen Titel Bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen und Solidarisches Bürgergeld - mehr als sozialutopische Konzepte geht davon aus , dass ein bedingungslos gewährtes Grundeinkommen in Höhe von 600 bis 800 Euro pro Monat für jeden einzelnen Bundesbürger lebenslang kostenneutral finanziert werden kann .
Und damit nicht genug .
Auf diese Weise soll auch noch die Nachhaltigkeit des Sozialstaats gesichert und eine Vielzahl neuer Arbeitsplätze geschaffen werden .
Umverteilungs - und Sozialsystem mit höchster Effizienz
Die federführenden Autoren der Studie sind drei renommierte Lehrstuhlinhaber : Thomas Straubhaar , Direktor des HWWI , unterrichtet an der Universität Hamburg Volkswirtschaftslehre und internationale Wirtschaftsbeziehungen , Michael Opielka lehrt an der Fachhochschule in Jena Sozialpolitik , und Michael Schramm vertritt die Bereiche katholische Theologie und Wirtschaftsethik an der Universität Hohenheim .
Alle drei sind davon überzeugt , dass sich mit dem Grundeinkommen ein „ einfaches und transparentes Umverteilungs - und Sozialsystem mit höchster Effizienz “ entwickeln lässt .
Es blockiert ihrer Einschätzung nach nicht nur die Tendenzen zu Verarmung und Bürokratie , sondern wirkt motivierend und effizienzsteigernd , setzt positive Beschäftigungsimpulse und erweist sich überdies - durch die Vermeidung einer Manipulation der Marktpreisbildung bei gleichzeitiger Einkommensumverteilung - als „ volkswirtschaftlich effizient “ .
Das Bürgergeld soll die meisten anderen Sozialleistungen ersetzen .
Nach seiner Einführung gibt es also voraussichtlich weder Arbeitslosengeld I , Arbeitslosengeld II , Sozialgeld oder Hilfe zum Lebensunterhalt noch BAföG , Kindergeld , Elterngeld , Renten oder Pensionen .
Für alle 82,5 Millionen in Deutschland lebenden Personen gibt der Staat pro Person jährlich insgesamt 8.400 € aus , davon mehr als 7.500 € in Form direkter Leistungen .
Diese Summe stünde also bei einem vollständigen Systemwechsel und einem ebenso vollständigen Verzicht auf alle heute im Rahmen des Sozialbudgets finanzierten Leistungen ( inklusive der Kosten der Sozialbürokratie ) für ein Grundeinkommen zur Verfügung .
Grundeinkommen -Studie
Zur Finanzierung eines Beitrags in Höhe von 800 Euro müssen Konsumsteuern neu gestaffelt und Steuersätze von 10 Prozent auf jedes weitere Einkommen erhoben werden .
Für alle übrigen Staatsausgaben werden weitere 51 Prozent veranschlagt , so dass sich ein Gesamtsteuersatz von 61 Prozent ergibt .
Konkret bedeutet das : Wer ein Bruttoeinkommen von 1.311 Euro hat , zahlt eine Brutto - Einkommenssteuer von 800 Euro , die durch das Bürgergeld aufgefangen wird .
Am Ende fällt hier also gar keine Steuerbelastung an .
Wer nur 1.000 Euro bekommt , erreicht ein Nettoeinkommen von 1.190 € , von einem Bruttoeinkommen in Höhe von 5.000 Euro bleiben 2.750 Euro netto .
Das Projekt sieht trotz gleicher Sätze also eine progressive Steuerbelastung vor .
Das gilt auch für den Fall , dass lediglich ein Grundeinkommen von 600 Euro gezahlt wird .
Der Steuersatz läge dann bei 49 Prozent , ein Bruttoeinkommen von 1.224 Euro bliebe in diesem Fall steuerfrei .
Ein Plus an subsidiärer Befähigungsgerechtigkeit
Die Autoren schlagen vor , das bedingungslose Grundeinkommen zunächst auf der Basis des von Dieter Althaus angeregten solidarischen Bürgergeldes inklusive der geplanten Gesundheitsprämie einzuführen .
Sie rechnen damit , dass ihr Projekt sich wenigstens als kostenneutral erweist , halten einen jährlichen Überschuss von bis zu 50 Milliarden Euro aber für eine durchaus „ realistische Annahme “ .
In der Folge prognostiziert die Studie eine Reihe positiver Effekte für Wirtschaftswachstum und Arbeitsmarkt , den deutlichen Rückgang der Schwarzarbeit und die Schaffung von neuen Arbeitsplätzen im Umfang von über 1 Million Vollzeitstellen im Niedriglohnbereich .
Für den Theologen und Wirtschaftsethiker Michael Schramm reichen die Vorteile eines bedingungslosen Grundeinkommens allerdings weit über den finanziellen , fiskalischen oder arbeitsmarktsmarktpolitischen Bereich hinaus .
Es sei schließlich auch „ ein wichtiger Schritt auf dem Wege zu mehr gesellschaftlicher Solidarität , zu mehr Subsidarität und zu mehr ( sozialer ) Gerechtigkeit “ .
Das Bürgergeld ist in seinen Augen eben gerade keine „ Faulenzerprämie “ , sondern im Gegensatz zu den noch immer heftig umstrittenen Hartz - IV - Regelungen ein „ aktivierendes Sprungbrett “ .
Schramm glaubt , das sich die Vorschläge nicht an moralischen Appellen , sondern an Wirklichkeitsfaktoren orientieren und also einem „ anthropologischen Realismus verpflichtet “ sind .
Davon abgesehen entsprächen sie den Forderungen der katholischen Soziallehre und erzielten so ein „ deutliches Plus an subsidiärer Befähigungsgerechtigkeit “ , sprich : mehr Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe .
Offene Fragen
Ob das im April 2005 gegründete Hamburgische WeltWirtschaftsInstitut seiner Selbsteinschätzung als „ moderner Think Tank “ mit dieser Studie gerecht geworden ist , wird in den nächsten Tagen und Wochen sicher kontrovers diskutiert werden .
Denn es gibt eine Reihe offener Fragen , die noch schlüssig beantwortet werden müssen .
Sie betreffen zunächst die finanziellen Basisdaten , die übrigens schon seit Mitte der 90er Jahre umstritten sind :
Wenn es ohne weiteres möglich wäre , einen Jahresüberschuss von 50 Milliarden Euro zu erwirtschaften , hätten sich voraussichtlich schon deutlich mehr Experten in die Reihe der Befürworter gestellt , und die Autoren konzedieren selbst eine erhebliche Schwankungsbreite in den bisherigen Berechnungen .
Je nach den hierüber getroffenen Annahmen ergeben sich für ein Grundeinkommen von 800 € ( inkl. 200 € Versicherungsgutschein )
Nettokosten im Vergleich zu den heutigen Sozialausgaben zwischen 159 Mrd. und 454 Mrd. €.
Für ein Grundeinkommen von 600 € ergibt sich eine Spannbreite zwischen 39 Mrd. € Netto- Kostenreduktion und 256 Mrd. € Nettokosten jährlich .
Presseerklärung HWWI ´
Wie sich die Einführung eines Bürgergeldes auf die gesamten Sozialsysteme , den Staatshaushalt und den deutschen Arbeitsmarkt auswirken würde , ist derzeit ähnlich schwer abzuschätzen .
Über die Höhe und den Adressatenkreis darf fleißig gestritten werden , und das gilt erst recht für psychologische und sozialethische Aspekte .
Ob das Bürgergeld tatsächlich motiviert , aktiviert und die Empfänger sich moralisch zu einer angemessenen Gegenleistung verpflichtet fühlen , kann niemand seriös vorhersagen , und um die Frage zu klären , ob sich auf eine solche Weise überhaupt soziale Gerechtigkeit herstellen und Solidarität organisieren lässt , bedürfte es vermutlich der Einsetzung einer philosophischen Grundsatzkommission .
Die SPD , der lange Zeit gar nichts zum Bürgergeld einfiel , hat sich mittlerweile entschlossen , das Ganze als „ konservative Stilllegungsprämie “ zu betrachten .
Doch für Pauschalurteile ist die Lage der Arbeitssuchenden , der Hartz - IV - Empfänger und der Menschen , die im Niedriglohnbereich ein von führenden Sozialdemokraten ausdrücklich als sittenwidrig empfundenes Einkommen beziehen , zu ernst .
Es darf und muss also weiter diskutiert und gerechnet werden , und vielleicht bringt in absehbarer Zeit ein Pilotversuch – wie er beim Kombilohn - Modell verschiedentlich initiiert wurde - weitere Aufklärung .
Schließlich bietet das Thema auch diverse Ansatzpunkte und Betrachtungsweisen , die in hohem Maße konsensfähig sein könnten .
Alles auf Erden hat zwei Seiten , weist also komparative Vor- und Nachteile auf .
Auch das „ Solidarische Bürgergeld “ kann da von vornherein keine Ausnahme machen .
Entscheidend ist schlussendlich der Saldo von Vor- und Nachteilen .
Denn nicht das Gerechte , sondern nur das weniger Ungerechte liegt in unserer Hand .
Fazit Michael Schramm , in : Grundeinkommen - Studie

The importance of a semantic URL
I ’m constantly baffled why most companies and web developers do n’t understand , or care about , the importance of using good semantic URLs .
Therefore , I though I ’d outline some reasons to help you understand why you really should care .
What is a semantic URL ?
Semantic URLs , also known as Friendly URLs , are made up of logical parts , therefore showing the actual name of the specific web page you ’re watching , while at the same time displaying where it belongs in the web site hierarchy .
Let me give you some examples :
Bad URLs
http://www.example.com/?id=547
http://www.example.com/aspx?id=547&product=785
http://www.travel-example.com/?continent=3&country=15&city=54
Good URLs , made from the samples above
The bad examples above can actually mean something like this in reality :
http://www.example.com/contact
http://www.example.com/products/screwdriver
http://www.travel-example.com/europe/sweden/stockholm
See just how much better it gets ?
Another thing I dislike is when file extensions , like .php or .aspx , are part of the URL .
What ’s ridiculous about that , too , is that is n’t the content of the PHP or ASP.
NET file that is presented , its the content that it generated that is shown to the end user .
I ’m all against the usage of any file extension in the URL , but the only one that would make sense at least some sense is .html , because that is what is served to the web browser .
Why it ’s important ?
As you can see in the bad vs.good examples above , the proper ones convey meaning and structure , while the bad ones are n’t really useful to anyone ( except for some web developers , but their target should really be the end user , not a digit that helps them find something in , say , the database ) .
Usability
I think that with a web site with a good structure and semantic URLs , you can guess the URL .
Simple things like / contact and / about , but also more complex ones like http://www.tv-example.com/programs/lost .
As long as you know the domain name , it should pretty much be possible to navigate around solely through the web browser location bar .
Just take the travel web site URL as an example ; companies dealing with lots of destinations but do n’t have semantic URLs are far beyond me .
Does n’t the technical solution support it ?
Tough !
Get a better one .
SEO
From a search engine perspective , naturally http://www.example.com/products/screwdriver makes more sense than http://www.example.com/?id=547 , and they can index the web pages in conjunction with their content , to verify what it ’s really about , and just how important it is in the web site ’s context .
For instance , http://www.example.com/products/hammer will most likely be more important than http://www.example.com/products/expired-products/1975/disco-belt .
If the URLs only would have been id - based , there would be now way of telling the difference between the top - seller and the most tiny unimportant one .
For the web developers
To go with the structure of the web site , the web development environment should be mirroring all parts .
Therefore , the web developer can easily find the exact section that needs to be altered , leading to easier maintenance and logical implementations .
Also , in the long run , you can easily change id ’s and structure of the database without the need of worrying about users who have bookmarked certain web pages .
As long as the semantic structure you front with is intact , you can have full control behind the scenes .
How to create friendly URLs
The Unlikeliest Cult in History

THE UNLIKELIEST CULT IN HISTORY
Freudian projection is the process of attributing one 's own ideas , feelings , or attitudes to other people or objects -- the guilt - laden adulterer accuses his spouse of adultery , the homophobe actually harbors latent homosexual tendencies .
A subtle form of projection can be seen in the accusation by Christians that secular humanism and evolution are " religions " ; or by cultists and paranormalists that skeptics are themselves a cult and that reason and science have cultic properties .
For skeptics , the idea that reason can lead to a cult is absurd .
The characteristics of a cult are 180 degrees out of phase with reason .
But as I will demonstrate , not only can it happen , it has happened , and to a group that would have to be considered the unlikeliest cult in history .
It is a lesson in what happens when the truth becomes more important than the search for truth , when final results of inquiry become more important than the process of inquiry , and especially when reason leads to an absolute certainty about one 's beliefs such that those who are not for the group are against it .
The story begins in 1943 when an obscure Russian immigrant published her first successful novel after two consecutive failures .
It was not an instant success .
In fact , the reviews were harsh and initial sales sluggish .
But slowly a following grew around the novel , word of mouth became the most effective marketing tool , and the author began to develop what could , with hindsight , be called a " cult following . "
The initial print - run of 7,500 copies was followed by multiples of five and 10,000 until by 1950 half a million copies were circulating the country .
The book was The Fountainhead and the author Ayn Rand .
Her commercial success allowed her the time and freedom to write her magnum opus , Atlas Shrugged , published in 1957 after ten years in the making .
It is a murder mystery , not about the murder of a human body , but of the murder of a human spirit .
It is a broad and sweeping story of a man who said he would stop the ideological motor of the world .
When he did , there was a panoramic collapse of civilization , with its flame kept burning by a small handful of heroic individuals whose reason and morals directed both the fall and the subsequent return of culture .
As they did to The Fountainhead , reviewers panned Atlas with a savage brutality that , incredibly , only seemed to reinforce followers ' belief in the book , its author , and her ideas .
And , like The Fountainhead , sales of Atlas sputtered and clawed their way forward as the following grew , to the point where the book presently sells over 300,000 copies a year .
" In all my years of publishing , " recalled Random House 's owner , Bennett Cerf , " I 've never seen anything like it .
To break through against such enormous opposition ! " ( Branden , 1986 , p. 298 ) .
Such is the power of an individual hero . . . and a cult - like following .
What is it about Rand 's philosophy that so emotionally stimulates proponents and opponents alike ?
Before Atlas Shrugged was published , at a sales conference at Random House a salesman asked Rand if she could summarize the essence of her philosophy , called Objectivism , while standing on one foot .
She did so as follows ( 1962 ) :
Metaphysics : Objective Reality Epistemology : Reason Ethics : Self - interest Politics : Capitalism
Man cannot survive except by gaining knowledge , and reason is his only means to gain it .
Reason is the faculty that perceives , identifies and integrates the material provided by his senses .
The task of his senses is to give him the evidence of existence , but the task of identifying it belongs to his reason , his senses tell him only that something is , but what it is must be learned by his mind ( p. 1012 ) .
In the name of the best within you , do not sacrifice this world to those who are its worst .
In the name of the values that keep you alive , do not let your vision of man be distorted by the ugly , the cowardly , the mindless in those who have never achieved his title .
Do not lose your knowledge that man 's proper estate is an upright posture , an intransigent mind and a step that travels unlimited roads .
Do not let your fire go out , spark by irreplaceable spark , in the hopeless swamps of the approximate , the not - quite , the not - yet , the not - at - all .
Do not let the hero in your soul perish , in lonely frustration for the life you deserved , but have never been able to reach .
Check your road and the nature of your battle .
The world you desired can be won , it exists , it is real , it is possible , it 's yours ( p. 1069 ) .
The cultic flaw in Ayn Rand 's philosophy of Objectivism is not in the use of reason , or in the emphasis on individuality , or in the belief that humans are self motivated , or in the conviction that capitalism is the ideal system .
The fallacy in Objectivism is the belief that absolute knowledge and final Truths are attainable through reason , and therefore there can be absolute right and wrong knowledge , and absolute moral and immoral thought and action .
For Objectivists , once a principle has been discovered through reason to be True , that is the end of the discussion .
If you disagree with the principle , then your reasoning is flawed .
If your reasoning is flawed it can be corrected , but if it is not , you remain flawed and do not belong in the group .
Excommunication is the final step for such unreformed heretics .
If you find it hard to believe that such a line of reasoning could lead a rational , well - intentioned group down the road to culthood , history demonstrates how it can happen .
The 1960s were years of anti-establishment , anti-government , find - yourself individualism , so Rand 's philosophy exploded across the nation , particularly on college campuses .
Atlas Shrugged became the book to read .
Though it is a massive 1,168 pages long , readers devoured the characters , the plot , and most importantly , the philosophy .
It stirred emotions and evoked action .
Ayn Rand clubs were founded at hundreds of colleges .
Professors taught courses in the philosophy of Objectivism and the literary works of Rand .
Rand 's inner circle of friends began to grow and one of them , Nathaniel Branden , founded the Nathaniel Branden Institute ( NBI ) , sponsoring lectures and courses on Objectivism , first in New York , and then nationally .
As the seminars increased in size and Rand 's popularity shot skyward , so too did the confidence in her philosophy , both for Rand and her followers .
Hundreds of people attended classes , thousands of letters poured into the office , and millions of books were being sold .
Movie rights for Atlas were being negotiated ( The Fountainhead had already been made into a film ) .
Her rise to intellectual power and influence was nothing short of miraculous , and readers of her novels , especially Atlas Shrugged , told Rand it had changed their lives and their way of thinking .
Their comments ring of the enthusiasm of the followers of a religious cult ( Branden , 1986 , pp. 407-415 ) :
After reading Atlas a young woman in the Peace Corps wrote : " I had undergone the loneliest , most inspiring , and heartrending psycho- intellectual transformation , and all my plans upon returning to the United States had changed . "
A 24 - year old " traditional housewife " ( her own label ) read Atlas and said : " Dagny Taggart [ the book 's principle heroine ] was an inspiration to me ; she is a great feminist role model .
Ayn Rand 's works gave me the courage to be and to do what I had dreamed of . "
A businessman began reading Atlas and said " Within a few hundred pages I sensed clearly that I had ventured upon a lifetime of meaning .
The philosophy of Ayn Rand nurtured growth , stability and integrity in my life .
Her ideas permeated every aspect of my business , family and creative life . "
A law school graduate said of Objectivism : " Dealing with Ayn Rand was like taking a post - doctoral course in mental functioning .
The universe she created in her work holds out hope , and appeals to the best in man .
Her lucidity and brilliance was a light so strong I do n't think anything will ever be able to put it out . "
An economics professor recalled : " After you read Atlas Shrugged you do n't look at the world with the same perspective . "
A philosophy professor concluded : " Ayn Rand was one of the most original thinkers I have ever met .
There is no escape from facing the issues she raised .
. . .
At a time in my life when I thought I had learned at least the essentials of most philosophical views , being confronted with her . . . suddenly changed the entire direction of my intellectual life , and placed every other thinker in a new perspective . "
Another philosophy professor , this one disliking Rand and disagreeing with Objectivism , recalled after an all - night discussion with the philosopher - novelist : " She 's found gaping holes in every philosophical position I 've maintained for the whole of my life -- positions I teach my students , positions on which I 'm a recognized authority -- and I can't answer her arguments !
I do n't know what to do ! " ( p. 247 ) .
One of the closest to Rand was Nathaniel Branden , a young philosophy student who joined the Collective in the early days before Atlas Shrugged was published .
In his autobiographical memoirs entitled Judgment Day ( 1989 ) , Branden recalled : " There were implicit premises in our world to which everyone in our circle subscribed , and which we transmitted to our students at NBI . "
Incredibly , and here is where the philosophical movement became a cult , they came to believe that ( pp. 255-256 ) :
Ayn Rand is the greatest human being who has ever lived .
Atlas Shrugged is the greatest human achievement in the history of the world .
Ayn Rand , by virtue of her philosophical genius , is the supreme arbiter in any issue pertaining to what is rational , moral , or appropriate to man 's life on earth .
Once one is acquainted with Ayn Rand and / or her work , the measure of one 's virtue is intrinsically tied to the position one takes regarding her and / or it .
No one can be a good Objectivist who does not admire what Ayn Rand admires and condemn what Ayn Rand condemns .
No one can be a fully consistent individualist who disagrees with Ayn Rand on any fundamental issue .
Since Ayn Rand has designated Nathaniel Branden as her " intellectual heir , " and has repeatedly proclaimed him to be an ideal exponent of her philosophy , he is to be accorded only marginally less reverence than Ayn Rand herself .
But it is best not to say most of these things explicitly ( excepting , perhaps , the first two items ) .
One must always maintain that one arrives at one 's beliefs solely by reason .
But if you leave the " religious " component out of the definition , thus broadening the word 's usage , it becomes clear that Objectivism was ( and is ) a cult , as are many other , non-religious groups .
In this context , then , a cult may be characterized by :
Veneration of the Leader : Excessive glorification to the point of virtual sainthood or divinity .
Inerrancy of the Leader : Belief that he or she can not be wrong .
Omniscience of the Leader : Acceptance of beliefs and pronouncements on virtually all subjects , from the philosophical to the trivial .
Persuasive Techniques : Methods used to recruit new followers and reinforce current beliefs .
Hidden Agendas : Potential recruits and the public are not given a full disclosure of the true nature of the group 's beliefs and plans .
Deceit : Recruits and followers are not told everything about the leader and the group 's inner circle , particularly flaws or potentially embarrassing events or circumstances .
Financial and / or Sexual Exploitation : Recruits and followers are persuaded to invest in the group , and the leader may develop sexual relations with one or more of the followers .
Absolute Truth : Belief that the leader and / or group has a method of discovering final knowledge on any number of subjects .
Absolute Morality : Belief that the leader and / or the group have developed a system of right and wrong thought and action applicable to members and nonmembers alike .
Those who strictly follow the moral code may become and remain members , those who do not are dismissed or punished .
The precept : " Judge not , that ye be not judged " . . . is an abdication of moral responsibility : it is a moral blank check one gives to others in exchange for a moral blank check one expects for oneself .
There is no escape from the fact that men have to make choices ; so long as men have to make choices , there is no escape from moral values ; so long as moral values are at stake , no moral neutrality is possible .
To abstain from condemning a torturer , is to become an accessory to the torture and murder of his victims .
The moral principle to adopt . . . is : " Judge , and be prepared to be judged . "
With this set of criteria it becomes possible to see that a rational philosophy can become a cult when most or all of these are met .
This is true not only for philosophical movements , but in some scientific schools of thought as well .
Many founding scientists have become almost deified in their own time , to the point where apprentices dare not challenge the master .
As Max Planck observed about science in general , only after the founders and elder statesmen of a discipline are dead and gone can real change occur and revolutionary new ideas be accepted .
In both Barbara 's and Nathaniel Branden 's assessment , then , we see all the characteristics of a cult .
But what about deceit and sexual exploitation ?
In this case , " exploitation " may be too strong of a word , but the act was present nonetheless , and deceit was rampant .
In what has become the most scandalous ( and now oft - told ) story in the brief history of the Objectivist movement , starting in 1953 and lasting until 1958 ( and on and off for another decade after ) , Ayn Rand and her " intellectual heir " Nathaniel Branden , 25 years her junior , carried on a secret love affair known only to their respective spouses .
The falling in love was not planned , but it was ultimately " reasonable " since the two of them were , de facto , the two greatest humans on the planet .
" By the total logic of who we are -- by the total logic of what love and sex mean -- we had to love each other , " Rand told Barbara Branden and her own husband , Frank O'Connor .
It was a classic display of a brilliant mind intellectualizing a purely emotional response , and another example of reason carried to absurd heights .
" Whatever the two of you may be feeling , " Rand rationalized , " I know your intelligence , I know you recognize the rationality of what we feel for each other , and that you hold no value higher than reason " ( B. Brandon , p. 258 ) .
Unbelievably , both Barbara and Frank accepted the affair , and agreed to allow Ayn and Nathaniel an afternoon and evening of sex and love once a week .
" And so , " Barbara explained , " we all careened toward disaster . "
The " rational " justification and its consequences continued year after year , as the tale of interpersonal and group deceit grew broader and deeper .
The disaster finally came in 1968 when it became known to Rand that Branden had fallen in love with yet another woman , and had begun an affair with her .
Even though the affair between Rand and Branden had long since dwindled , the master of the absolutist moral double - standard would not tolerate such a breach of ethical conduct .
" Get that bastard down here ! , " Rand screamed upon hearing the news , " or I 'll drag him here myself ! "
Branden , according to Barbara , slunk into Rand 's apartment to face the judgment day .
" It 's finished , your whole act ! " she told him .
" I 'll tear down your facade as I built it up !
I 'll denounce you publicly , I 'll destroy you as I created you !
I do n't even care what it does to me .
You wo n't have the career I gave you , or the name , or the wealth , or the prestige .
You 'll have nothing . . . . "
The barrage continued for several minutes until she pronounced her final curse : " If you have an ounce of morality left in you , an ounce of psychological health - - you 'll be impotent for the next twenty years ! " ( pp. 345-347 ) .
Rand 's verbal attack was followed by a six - page open letter to her followers in her publication The Objectivist ( May , 1968 ) .
It was entitled " To Whom It May Concern . "
After explaining that she had completely broken with the Brandens , Rand continued the deceit through lies of omission : " About two months ago . . .
Mr. Branden presented me with a written statement which was so irrational and so offensive to me that I had to break my personal association with him . "
Without so much as a hint of the nature of the offense Rand continued : " About two months later Mrs. Branden suddenly confessed that Mr. Branden had been concealing from me certain ugly actions and irrational behavior in his private life , which was grossly contradictory to Objectivist morality . . . . " Branden 's second affair was judged immoral , his first was not .
This excommunication was followed by a reinforcing barrage from NBI 's Associate Lecturers that sounds all too ecclesiastical in its denouncement ( and written out of complete ignorance of what really happened ) : " Because Nathaniel Branden and Barbara Branden , in a series of actions , have betrayed fundamental principles of Objectivism , we condemn and repudiate these two persons irrevocably , and have terminated all association with them . . . . " ( Branden , 1986 , pp. 353-354 ) .
Confusion reigned supreme in both the Collective and in the rank - and - file membership .
Mail poured into the office , most of it supporting Rand ( naturally , since they knew nothing of the first affair ) .
Nathaniel received angry responses and even Barbara 's broker , an Objectivist , terminated her as his client .
The group was in turmoil over the incident .
What were they to think with such a formidable condemnation of unnamed sins ?
The ultimate extreme of such absolutist thinking was revealed several months later when , in the words of Barbara , " a half - demented former student of NBI had raised the question of whether or not it would be morally appropriate to assassinate Nathaniel because of the suffering he had caused Ayn ; the man concluded that it should not be done on practical grounds , but would be morally legitimate .
Fortunately , he was shouted down at once by a group of appalled students " ( p. 356n ) .
It was the beginning of the long decline and fall of Rand 's tight grip over the Collective .
One by one they sinned , the transgressions becoming more minor as the condemnations grew in fierceness .
And one by one they left , or were asked to leave .
In the end ( Rand died in 1982 ) there remained only a handful of friends , and the designated executor of her estate , Leonard Peikoff ( who presently carries on the cause through the Southern California based Ayn Rand Institute , " The Center for the Advancement of Objectivism " ) .
While the cultic qualities of the group sabotaged the inner circle , there remained ( and remains ) a huge following of those who choose to ignore the indiscretions , infidelities , and moral inconsistencies of the founder , and focus instead on the positive aspects of the philosophy .
There is much in it from which to choose , if you do not have to accept the whole package .
In this analysis , then , there are three important caveats about cults , skepticism , and reason :
Criticism of the founder of a philosophy does not , by itself , constitute a negation of any part of the philosophy .
The fact that Christians have been some of the worst violators of their own moral system does not mean that the ethical axioms of " thou shalt not kill , " or " due unto others as you would have them do unto you , " are negated .
The components of a philosophy must stand or fall on their own internal consistency or empirical support , regardless of the founder 's personality quirks or moral inconsistencies .
By most accounts Newton was a cantankerous and relatively unpleasant person to be around .
This fact has nothing at all to do with his principles of natural philosophy .
With thinkers who proffer moral principles , as in the case of Rand , this caveat is more difficult to apply , but it is true nonetheless .
It is good to know these things about Rand , but it does not nullify her philosophy .
I reject her principles of final Truth and absolute morality not because Rand had feet of clay , but because I do not believe they are either logically or empirically tenable .
Criticism of part of a philosophy does not gainsay the whole .
In a similar analogy as above , one may reject parts of the Christian philosophy while embracing others .
I might , for example , attempt to treat others as I would have them treat me , while at the same time renounce the belief that women should remain silent in church and be obedient to their husbands .
One may disavow Rand 's absolute morality , while accepting her metaphysics of objective reality , her epistemology of reason , and her political philosophy of capitalism ( though Objectivists would say they all follow from her metaphysics ) .
Which leads me to the third caveat .
The critic of part of a philosophy does not necessarily repudiate the whole philosophy .
This is a personal caveat to Objectivists and readers of Skeptic alike .
Rand critics come from all political positions -- left , right , and middle .
Professional novelists generally disdain her style .
Professional philosophers generally refuse to take her work seriously ( both because she wrote for popular audiences and because her work is not considered a complete philosophy ) .
There are more Rand critics than followers .
I am not one of them .
Ayn Rand has probably influenced my thinking more than any other author .
I have read all of her works , including her newsletters , early works , and the two major biographies .
I have even read the Brobdingnagian Atlas Shrugged no less than three times , plus once on audio tape for good measure .
Thus I am not a blind critic .
( Some of Rand 's critics have attacked Atlas without ever reading it , and Objectivism , without ever knowing anything about it .
I have encountered many of these myself .
Even the pompously intellectual William Buckley spoke of the " desiccated philosophy " of Atlas , " the essential aridity of Miss Rand 's philosophy , " and the tone of Atlas as " over - riding arrogance , " yet later confessed : " I never read the book .
When I read the review of it and saw the length of the book , I never picked it up . "
Nothing could be more irrational . )
I accept most of Rand 's philosophy , but not all of it .
And despite my life - long commitment to many of Rand 's most important beliefs , Objectivists would no doubt reject me from their group for not accepting all of her precepts .
This is ultimately what makes Objectivism a cult .
So far so good .
I might have even made it into the Rand inner circle .
But I would have been promptly excommunicated as an unreformed heretic ( the worst kind , since reformed heretics can at least be retrained and forgiven ) , with my belief that no absolute morality is scientifically or rationally tenable , even that which claims to have been derived through pure reason , as in the case of Rand .
The reason is straightforward .
Morals do not exist in nature and thus can not be discovered .
In nature there are just actions -- physical actions , biological actions , and human actions .
Human actors act to increase their happiness , however they personally define it .
Their actions become moral or immoral when someone else judges them as such .
Thus , morality is a strictly human creation , subject to all the cultural influences and social constructions as other such human creations .
Since virtually everyone and every group claims they know what right and wrong human action is , and since virtually all of these moralities are different from all others to a greater or lesser extent , then reason alone tells us they cannot all be correct Just as there is no absolute right type of human music , there is no absolute right type of human action .
The broad range of human action is a rich continuum that precludes its pigeonholing into the unambiguous yeses and noes that political laws and moral codes require .
Does this mean that all human actions are morally equal ?
No .
Not any more than all human music is equal .
We create standards of what we like and dislike , desire or not , and make judgments against these standards .
But the standards are themselves human creations and not discovered in nature .
One group prefers classical music , and so judges Mozart to be superior to the Moody Blues .
Similarly , one group prefers patriarchal dominance , and so judges male privileges to be morally honorable .
Neither Mozart nor males are absolutely better , only so when compared to the group 's standards .
Thus , male ownership of females was once moral and is now immoral , not because we have discovered it as such , but because our society has realized that women also seek greater happiness and that they can achieve this more easily without being in bondage to males .
A society that seeks greater happiness for its members by giving them greater freedom , will judge a Hitler or a Stalin as morally intolerable because his goal is the confiscation of human life , without which one can have no happiness .
As long as it is understood that morality is a human construction influenced by human cultures , one can become more tolerant of other human belief systems , and thus other humans .
But as soon as a group sets itself up to be the final moral arbiter of other people 's actions , especially when its members believe they have discovered absolute standards of right and wrong , it is the beginning of the end of tolerance and thus , reason and rationality .
It is this characteristic more than any other that makes a cult , a religion , a nation , or any other group , dangerous to individual freedom .
This was ( and is ) the biggest flaw in Ayn Rand 's Objectivism , the unlikeliest cult in history .
The historical development and ultimate destruction of her group and philosophy is the empirical evidence to support this logical analysis .
What separates science from all other human activities ( and morality has never been successfully placed on a scientific basis ) , is its belief in the tentative nature of all conclusions .
There are no final absolutes in science , only varying degrees of probability .
Even scientific " facts " are just conclusions confirmed to such an extent it would be reasonable to offer temporary agreement , but never final assent .
Science is not the affirmation of a set of beliefs but a process of inquiry aimed at building a testable body of knowledge constantly open to rejection or confirmation .
In science , knowledge is fluid and certainty fleeting .
That is the heart of its limitation .
It is also its greatest strength .

Worrying about how you 'll perform on a math test may actually contribute to a lower test score , U.S. researchers said on Saturday .
REUTERS / Catherine Benson
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Worrying about how you ’ll perform on a math test may actually contribute to a lower test score , U.S. researchers said on Saturday .
Math anxiety -- feelings of dread and fear and avoiding math -- can sap the brain ’s limited amount of working capacity , a resource needed to compute difficult math problems , said Mark Ashcroft , a psychologist at the University of Nevada Los Vegas who studies the problem .
“ It turns out that math anxiety occupies a person ’s working memory , ” said Ashcroft , who spoke on a panel at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San Francisco .
Ashcroft said while easy math tasks such as addition require only a small fraction of a person ’s working memory , harder computations require much more .
Worrying about math takes up a large chunk of a person ’s working memory stores as well , spelling disaster for the anxious student who is taking a high - stakes test .
Stress about how one does on tests like college entrance exams can make even good math students choke .
“ All of a sudden they start looking for the short cuts , ” said University of Chicago researcher Sian Beilock .
Although test preparation classes can help students overcome this anxiety , they are limited to students whose families can afford them .
Ultimately , she said , “ It may not be wise to rely completely on scores to predict who will succeed . ”
While the causes of math anxiety are unknown , Ashcroft said people who manage to overcome math anxiety have completely normal math proficiency .
KitKat is one of the best - selling candy bars in America .
Says Wikipedia :
In recent years , Kit Kats have also become very popular in Japan , a phenomenon attributed to the coincidental similarity between the bar 's name and the Japanese phrase kitto katsu , roughly translating as " I hope you succeed ! "
This has reportedly led to parents and children buying them for school examination days as a sort of good luck charm .
True enough .
But it did n't happen by coincidence .
It happened by a brilliant , subtle , incredibly patient advertising and public relations campaign .
Year 1 : Hotels in Tokyo began giving complementary KitKat bars to students who came to the city by the thousands to take the fiercely competitive university entrance exams .
The KitKat was presented as a little " lucky charm " .
Students were surprised and touched .
They did n't know the candy giveaway was sponsored by the manufacturer .
Year 2 : The advertising agency behind this stealth campaign wangled some news stories ( not ads ) about the hotels ' candy giveaway .
The reason for the stealth : Japanese young people are suspicious and scornful of advertising .
Year 3 : Some ads began to appear .
They did n't look like ads .
They were cute little stories about teachers , mothers , students and the lucky charm .
The ads were fiction , but real Japanese moms began packing KitKats for their kids when they left home to take the exams .
Year 4 : Real people began to appear in the ads that did n't look like ads .
No product was ever shown .
Just a subtle little KitKat logo .
And KitKat -- a candy that 's been around for 70 years , that was considered just a few years ago an old - fashioned candy in Japan , the opposite of trendy or cool -- became Japan 's top seller .
Besides sales , here 's how the success of KitKat 's Japanese advertising campaign is tracked : Number of mentions in the press and in personal blogs , which are booming in Japan .
The blogs are often emotional and touching .
Japanese moms post loving and fearful notes about sending their kids off to the examinations , making sure they have their lucky KitKats .
Over the past months more BitTorrent users noticed that their ISP is killing all BitTorrent traffic .
ISP 's like Rogers are using bit - shaping applications to throttle the traffic that is generated by BitTorrent .
But , at the same time two of the most popular BitTorrent clients are working together to implement header and message stream encryption in order to take out these traffic shapers .
Currently both Azureus and uTorrent included this new form of encryption ( specs ) in their latest Beta’s .
The fact that these two clients are actively working together to implement this new feature is promising and will make this form of encryption the new standard since the users of these two clients cover the majority of all BitTorrent users .
There are two “ encryption modes ” available .
The 2 different payload encryption methods plaintext transmission and RC4 provide a different degree of protocol obfuscation , security and speed .
Where the plaintext mode only provides basic anti-shaping obscurity , no security and low CPU usage the RC4 encryption obfuscates the entire stream and not only the header and adds some cryptographic security at the price of spent CPU cycles .
The question now is ..
Does it work ?
and how effective is it ?
If it works it will definitely offer a great solution to all BitTorrent users who suffer from traffic shaping ISP’s .
Bram Cohen , the creator of the BitTorrent protocol reacted quite negatively on these new developments .
He questions the need for encryption since only a few ISP ’s are actively shaping traffic .
Among other things he also fears incompatibility between clients and increased cpu usage .
Although these arguments can be countered quite easily , developers should keep them in mind .
But the fact is , if this new encryption method is launched successfully it will be a huge step forward for the BitTorrent community .
It has been attacked many times in its short life , most notably by a former aide to Robert F Kennedy and the editor of Encyclopaedia Britannica .
But now the online reference site Wikipedia has a new foe : evangelical Christians .
A website founded by US religious activists aims to counter what they claim is " liberal bias " on Wikipedia , the open encyclopedia which has become one of the most popular sites on the web .
The founders of Conservapedia.com say their site offers a " much - needed alternative " to Wikipedia , which they say is " increasingly anti-Christian and anti-American " .
Although entries on Wikipedia are open for anyone to edit , conservative campaigners say they are unable to make changes to articles on the site because of inherent bias by its global team of volunteer editors .
Instead they have chosen to build a clone which they hope will promote Christian values .
" I 've tried editing Wikipedia , and found that the biased editors who dominate it censor or change facts to suit their views , " Andy Schlafly , the founder of Conservapedia , told the Guardian .
" In one case my factual edits were removed within 60 seconds - so editing Wikipedia is no longer a viable approach . "
Among his criticisms listed on Conservapedia , Mr Schlafly explains how many Wikipedia articles often use British spelling instead of American English and says that it " refuses " to give enough credit to Christianity for the Renaissance .
" Facts against the theory of evolution are almost immediately censored , " he continues .
Mr Schlafly , a lawyer by day , is the son of a prominent American conservative , Phyllis Schlafly , renowned for her opposition to feminism and the Equal Rights Amendment .
He says Conservapedia was created last November as a project for home - schooled children - and believes it could eventually become a reference for teachers in the US .
" It is rapidly becoming one of the largest and most reliable online educational resources of its kind , " he said .
Wikipedia has come in for criticism for its open approach , notably from Dale Hoiberg , the editor - in - chief of Encyclopaedia Britannica .
Mr Hoiberg disputed a survey in the scientific journal Nature which found that the website was just as accurate as its venerable counterpart .
Meanwhile , a Tennessee journalist , John Seigenthaler , attacked the site for suggesting he had been accused of involvement in the assassinations of both John and Bobby Kennedy in the 1960s .
The arrival of Conservapedia has been met with derision by much of the internet community .
But Jimmy Wales , the co-founder of Wikipedia , said he was not upset by the rightwing site 's claims .
" Free culture knows no bounds , " he said .
" We welcome the reuse of our work to build variants .
That 's directly in line with our mission . "
How they compare :
Dinosaurs

" Vertebrate animals that dominated terrestrial ecosystems for over 160 m years , first appearing approximately 230 m years ago . "
Conservapedia
" They are mentioned in numerous places throughout the Good Book .
For example , the behemoth in Job and the leviathan in Isaiah are almost certainly references to dinosaurs . "
US Democratic party
Wikipedia
" The party advocates civil liberties , social freedoms , equal rights , equal opportunity , fiscal responsibility , and a free enterprise system tempered by government intervention . "
Conservapedia
" The Democrat voting record reveals a true agenda of cowering to terrorism , treasonous anti-Americanism , and contempt for America 's founding principles . "
As with E=mc² and the universe , everything that you need to know about Google — how it works , why it works , where it comes from , and where it ’s likely going — can be summarized in one line .
It ’s the basic equation that underlies Google ’s search engine :
Do n’t worry if you do n’t understand it just yet .
What you likely do understand is that Google is currently in a heap of legal trouble — because of YouTube , its newest acquisition .
Three weeks ago , Viacom filed a $ 1 billion lawsuit claiming that Google has turned a blind eye to teenagers ’ illicitly uploading clips from Viacom properties , such as The Daily Show and MTV videos , onto YouTube .
There ’s a strong whiff of Napster in the air , so Googlewatchers are now consumed by an eye - glazing debate over the finer points of modern copyright law , the stake that Big Media hammered so decisively into Napster ’s heart a few years ago .
Is Google protected by the “ safe harbor ” provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ?
Or is YouTube illegally hosting , with prior knowledge , copyrighted video , rendering it as ultra-suable as Napster ?
Why in God ’s name did Google buy YouTube anyway , since this lawsuit was probably inevitable ?
Pundits have posited several possible reasons why Google wound up in this fight .
Maybe it was pure greed : Viacom had spent months trying to work out a deal to legally distribute its TV shows on YouTube , but Google would n’t give it a big - enough slice of online ad revenue .
Or maybe Google was just cocky , confident that copyright law would shield it no matter how much piracy gleefully went down on YouTube .
Or maybe it was Machiavellian : Blogger Michi Kono argued that Google ’s executives bought YouTube precisely because they knew YouTube was bound to get sued — and they wanted their smarty - pants lawyers heading up the legal defense of online video sharing .
All those reasons are probably partly true .
But the real reason Google has wound up facing the biggest copyright lawsuit in history is considerably stranger .
It ’s a question of corporate culture : Google is a nerd company , following nerd logic .
It ’s the equation , as it were , that got them in trouble .
Nerd logic holds that smart ideas deserve to trump dumb ones .
Indeed , nerds are fierce believers in meritocracy .
This is somewhat self - serving , of course : Nerds love the idea of intellectual Darwinism because they think they ’re smarter than everyone around them , thus fated to win every contest .
But at Google , nerd logic is a particularly potent force because the technology that made its executives rich — the very equation reproduced above — is a living embodiment of that culture .
Consider for a second how the formula , and thus Google ’s search engine , works .
If you type in “ fly - fishing Massachusetts , ” Google will find the 937,000 pages containing those words .
Then , crucially , the algorithm ranks each page to see how many “ inbound links ” it has — how many other Websites point toward it .
The one with the most links wins the No. 1 spot on a Google search , just like the person with the most votes wins an election .
This is also why it ’s so good .
Google ’s search engine is mostly impervious to PR bunk , political spin , and big - bucks marketing .
You can trust Google ’s search results because they ’re pure : driven by the crystalline logic of a superb mathematical algorithm .
And so we have a world in which the majority of Web searchers use Google , endowing the company with a ridiculously high stock price and ridiculously wealthy employees .
At Google , right makes might .
But Google ’s pursuit of meritocratic results has a side effect :
It has given the company a sort of corporate version of Asperger ’s syndrome .
It ’s like the kid who does n’t play well with others because he ’s too busy realphabetizing his stamp collection .
Or for that matter , breaking into your house and reorganizing your stamp collection .
Google ’s battle with Viacom over YouTube ’s modus operandi is n’t really new : Google ’s M.O. has always been to hoover up other people ’s content without asking permission .
When Google first started organizing the Web , it realized that it needed to “ crawl ” the Internet every day , making a copy of every Web page it could find , so it could know what ’s out there .
At first , Website owners howled : Was n’t this a massive form of copyright violation ?
Sure , except that upon reflection , Website owners realized it was far more important to play ball with Google because Google brought so much traffic to their sites .
But then two years ago Google went one step further — and decided to start organizing old media : things like books and TV shows .
It started Google Book Search , a project whose first step was to scan 8 million books in order to make them subject to its search algorithm .
It also set up Google Video and announced that it was uploading TV shows to make them searchable , too .
For info - hounds like me , this stuff was deliriously cool :
The idea of having all human knowledge at my fingertips made me giddy .
Except , of course , Google was now horning in on a very different culture .
The culture of the nerds slammed headfirst into the culture of New York ’s Big Media — which is radically different from , even diametrically opposed to , Google’s .
TV executives are creatures of PR , spin , synergy , and backroom deals .
They ’re really good at making money — TV advertising is a $ 70 billion business — but you would n’t exactly call it meritocratic .
Sumner Redstone , after all , originally acquired Viacom in a hostile takeover .
Over the next two decades , he built his business by buying up media companies such as Paramount and CBS , tossing their content into his increasingly huge vault , then spinning them off again .
The path to riches in media , as Redstone has adroitly observed , is in owning a boatload of TV shows and movies and syndicating them endlessly .
And for guys like Redstone , this requires a take - no - prisoners approach to the enforcement of copyright in the courts , and endless lobbying in D.C. to extend the rights of intellectual - property owners .
It is the total inversion of nerd logic : For Big Media , might makes right .
So when Redstone realized that YouTube ’s hottest clips tended to be from The Daily Show , The Colbert Report , and South Park , he freaked , demanding that Google pull 100,000 clips from YouTube .
“ If you want to use us , ” Redstone thundered to the press , “ pay us . ”
Then he defected to Joost , the copyright - friendly YouTube clone .
A month later , Viacom arch-rival News Corp. pulled a similar move :
It announced that it was teaming with NBC Universal and posting all their content on their own as - yet - unnamed “ NewTube . ”
I happened to be in Google ’s New York office the very day that Redstone demanded that the clips be yanked .
The rank and file were unperturbed .
As always , programmers cruised serenely to and fro on their Xootr scooters .
The view from the Googleplex is that Redstone should n’t have been mad at Google .
He should have been grateful .
After all , Google was just doing what it had always done : making stuff easier to find , organizing the world .
Why would n’t Viacom want its shows to be more easily found ?
If everything is promiscuously available digitally , and easily findable , this will be a cosmic win -win for everyone .
We consumers will find more and better stuff to read and listen to and watch — and that will bring more business for media giants .
Lovely !
The only person who I found really sweating it was David Eun , Google ’s vice - president in charge of “ content partnerships ” — essentially , the guy whose job it is to persuade Redstone to play nice with Google .
But as a former TV exec himself , Eun knows that the broadcast industry fundamentally does not believe that a win - win is possible .
Hell , the entire industry is based on win-lose propositions — stealing audience from one another .
From the perspective of TV execs , the online world is pretty much a big hassle :
Piracy is sapping their ability to charge for their goods , and Google ’s suspiciously central role in the online ecosphere allows it to hog the ad money .
Their business model is crumbling , and someone ’s gotta figure out how to pay for all the cool TV , movies , and books we enjoy .
A zillion teenagers downloading a ripped , ad - free copy of Lost ai n’t gonna keep the lights on at the studio , right ?
Nestled in one of the poufy , Seussian blue couches that dot his office , a suit in a geek ’s world , Eun parses his words with surgical precision .
“ We had a very interesting and healthy relationship with Viacom .
We want to continue to explore ways that we can work together with them , ” he says slowly .
“ Frankly , ” he adds , “ I think companies are still trying to figure out what ’s the right business arrangement . ”
To say the least .
Yet despite the culture clash , the odds are strong that Viacom ’s case will never get to court .
It is more likely a tactic designed merely to drive Google to abandon its high - minded talk about a win - win future and cough up real money for rights .
This will probably work , because neither wants to risk a legal precedent that screws its business .
Both Google and Viacom might actually benefit from keeping the legality of YouTube fuzzy and letting their negotiators hammer out a truce .
They ’ll learn to live together .
But they ’ll never understand each other .

What you DO affects what you THINK
What our users DO with our products -- or even what they see someone else do -- has a bigger effect on their brains than we might believe .
How we move ( or imagine moving ) our bodies changes our thoughts .
And if there 's a mismatch between thought and physical action , brains do n't like it .
Whether you 're designing interfaces or instructional materials , you can't afford to ignore the research on this .
The rest of this post wo n't make sense unless you do the following exercises , so ... you 've been warned .
EXERCISE ONE :
1 ) Say the word " zeal " out loud .
Twice , clearly .
2 ) Without changing the position of your mouth and lips , imagine yourself saying " zeal . "
Make sure you " hear " it .
3 ) Now -- this is the important one -- open your mouth as wide as you possibly can , keep it open , and imagine yourself saying the word " zeal . "
So , what happened when you tried to imagine saying " zeal " with your mouth wide open ?
Did the state of your physical body -- in this case your mouth -- affect your ability to think ?
EXERCISE TWO :
1 ) Tighten your whole body , grit your teeth , clench your jaw , tense the muscles in your shoulders and arms , and clench your fists .
Hold that position and imagine yourself pushing a piece of big heavy furniture across the room .
2 ) Now relax all your muscles .
Let them go as limp as you can , unclench your jaw , relax the face , shoulders , hands , all the way down .
Picture yourself lying on a beach listening to the sound of the waves .
KEEP THAT RELAXATION in your body for the next step .
3 ) Holding that completely relaxed position , imagine yourself pushing a piece of big heavy furniture across the room .
No matter what , do NOT let your muscles tense up .
What happened ?
Did the state of your muscles affect your ability to think ?
Both of these exercises are from neuroscientist Richard Restak 's latest book , The Naked Brain .
From the book :
" Our mental processes are sufficiently tethered to our bodily senses that we have difficulty with situations when the brain and other parts of the body are n't in sync . "
Even more dramatic , in a test measuring the association of arm posture and attitude , he demonstrates that the way you hold your arms affects how you feel about items you encounter .
Apparently even just imagining items while your arms are extended in the " pushing away " position can cause you to like those items less than if you imagined them while your arms were in a flexed " bringing - to me " position .
One experiment he describes :
" Half of the participants in the experiment were asked to push a lever away from them if they reacted positively to a particular word but pull it toward them if the word gave rise to negative associations , while the other half of the participants were told to do the opposite , pulling forward with positive words and pushing away with negative words .
Overall , people were faster to respond to positive words when they were pulling instead of pushing the lever , and faster to respond to negative words when they were pushing rather than pulling the lever . "
In another experiment , half the participants were told simply to push a lever the instant they saw a word on the screen , regardless of any like or dislike .
The other half were told to pull a lever the instant they saw a word .
You can imagine what happened ... those asked to push the lever reacted more quickly to negative rather than positive words , and those asked to pull reacted more quickly to positive words .
And of course scientists have found evidence now that simply thinking about an action -- or watching someone else do the action -- activates the same brain regions that would be involved in actually doing it yourself .
I 'm sure you can imagine the implications , including one of the key design principles known as natural mapping , outlined so well by Don Norman in The Psychology of Everyday Things ( the title was later changed to " The Design of Everyday Things ) .
A quintessential example of mapping for those new to design :
A switch for moving something up or down should have " up " position move the thing up and the " down " position move the thing down .
The most ridiculous example of bad / incorrect mapping would be to reverse that -- the " up " switch position moves the thing down , and vice - versa .
Usually we think of mapping in the context of usability and " mental models " -- the most natural mapping helps the user intuitively do the right thing without having to consciously think , learn , or remember the switch positions .
But Restak 's brain / body link goes beyond just mapping , and into attitudes .
And when you factor in mirror neurons , then even just the pictures you use on your website can matter .
Consider the following two pictures , and think about your feelings related to each one :
Even if you do n't consciously notice anything significant , your brain is still doing that " pushing away = dislike , bringing in = like " thing .
( Technically , this is an unfair apples - to - oranges comparison because I was forced to switch genders ( I could n't find suitable pictures of two men or two women ) , but you still get the idea . )
I 'd very much like to hear your thoughts about the body / thought connection , and how it might relate to the kinds of work we 're all doing ...

About a year or so ago I bought a desk that requires standing up to work .
Once I got used to it -- which did n't take as long as I thought -- I found my work productivity got a lot better .
I 've been asked WHY that is , and the only answer I have is that I just * feel * more engaged to my work .
Sitting at my desk feels more passive than standing at it .
That physical action of actively choosing to stand has translated into a better mental ability to stay focused , think through tough problems , etc ...

If you put captions to those pictures , you could set up the classic mismatch between words and actions that is a standard dramatic tool .
And what do we believe EVERY TIME ?
The actions or the mood or the flicker in the eye -- anything BUT the words .
The inadequacy or limitation of words is also why demonstrations are far more powerful than descriptions , particularly if the user participates .
The more they interact with it , the more real it is .
Basically , we do n't trust words , not when there are more potent cues around .

C.S. Lewis said that the body 's position ( kneeling ) had a profound effect on one 's ability to pray .
I 'd disagree with him , but I have no doubt that Lewis was far more engaged ( and efficacious ) in his praying than I am in my own feeble and infrequent attempts at it .
So maybe there 's something to it .
I do n't have a direct quote regarding that on me , but e-mail me if you want me to dig one up .
Posted by : Charlie Park | Dec 22 , 2006 3:39:19 PM
There is a quick experiment that I use a lot in my training to show this :
Sitting or standing , point your right arm and then twist your body and point as far around you as possible .
Notice where you point to .
Now close your eyes and imagine doing the same thing and pointing much further .
Now physically repeat the same thing and notice what happens .
So can your users imagine doing more with your product ?
How do you give them a story or two , that not only shows them what they can do , but also has them thinking further than before ?

WOW .
This post got me thinking about alot of neuro - linguistic programming stuff I read as a kid .
Likewise , it made me think about Joseph Chilton Pearce 's Crack in the Cosmic Egg ( yes dating myself somewhat ) .
I put a TON of faith in keep mind / body / attitude in synch .
I try to instill it in my team .
I use alot of guided imagery with them to help them see themselves succeeding .
Likewise in problem solving , we try to return to the metaphors ( hopefully very visual ones ) we use to describe our products and picture how the system would look with the problem solved .
Sometime its helpful and other times not .
The most important aspect of it all is the boost in attitude .
I 've experienced that when the individuals on the team picture themselves succeeding ( getting the release out , finishing a feature , resolving a dispute ) that they tend to invariably adopt a more positive attitude which strongly influences the positive outcome .
The thoughts / body / attitude connection is a Moebius strip as well in that I find my staff members who are runners or are more athletically inclined tend to have a performance edge .
There body being better tuned tends to allow their mind / thoughts to be more fully engaged and integrated .
The last piece I am trying to instill in my team is exercising their grey matter .
Even software development can get staid and routine once you 've mastered a particular skill set .
To help move to the next level I challenge them to read a book like HF Design Patterns or pick up the RoR book , read blogs on the cutting edge of their technology or just READ !
The last thing I 'll say on this is my own personal use of the body / thought connection .
I 'm trying very much to use this more and more as I communicate to larger audiences and with upper management .
My thoughts drive my body language and convey a more effective message .
The Presentation Zen site has been particularly helpful in trying to align the two in regards to communications .

If this topic interests you ; you might enjoy the works of Moshe Feldenkrais .
It 's hard to think of a few sentences that would sum his work up without being trite and ineffective , but I will make an attempt .
The gist of it is neurologically mapping physical processes that are underused , unknown , or distorted .
The result is an expanded range of possible movements and some psychological benefits .
He also manages to avoid being " touchy feely " by being a physicist and an atheist - which may be a pro or a con to you depending on your outlook .
His approach is food for thought , and if you have chronic back pains , etc. you may sort them out in the process of furthering cognitive science interests .

You really could n't find any pictures of women pushing someone away ?
My photo album is sadly full of them !
Posted by : John Dodds | Dec 23 , 2006 3:37:00 AM
Interesting : I saw the picture of the man as inviting me to put my hand against his and the woman as starting to make a rude , dismissive gesture towards me !
This was before I had scrolled down and read the text below .
Note that Feldenkrais is a variant of / development from / closely related to ( a point of argument ! ) of Alexander technique .
Alexander 's writings on this kind of thing are a little old fashioned now and quite hard but worth having a go at .
If you can find a ( good ) teacher get some Alexander lessons - it 's amazing what you 'll learn about your body .
( I 'm sure that Feldenkrais is just as good but I have no experience of it to compare with )

I 've been writing about being " intentional " a lot this past year ; about a variety of topics .
I 'll have to include this ..
One " exercise " - quoted only because for me it is n't an exercise but a practice - is - during my attempt to solve a programming or technical issue - one that has proven frustrating - to sit back in my seat , relax with a deep breath , and smile .
Not a forced - huge smile - just a casual smile .
The affect is half - contrived but half - and a big half - physiological .
You just feel more in control – confident .
This is can be used during conflict – during Christmas shopping – when you get cut off on the freeway – etc .
For years the gesture of smiling has been tied to so many – unforced ( spontaneous ) happy moments that your body reacts accordingly .

If we followed what is said - the poor body would always be under a constant stress .
I am sure it is possible to maintain an omnipresent awareness to keep the body relaxed while the mental gears are rotating at top speed for any purpose .
It doesnt come naturally - it is an art - of detachment .
Posted by : yogi | Dec 24 , 2006 1:54:39 AM
I have been reading your blog for some time now and continue to enjoy
it .
It never ceases to amaze me how you bring some of the same
techniques from your HF books to this blog , effectively advocating
change in the way information can / should be presented on a webpage .
I
particularly enjoy your emphasis on education as a user 's experience .
The following is my two pence worth on the mind - body connection .
I believe it is fairly well - known that the brain changes over time and
in response to external stimuli .
This was addressed most recently
with regard to taxi drivers , the memory portions of whose brains were
larger than average seemingly due to the addresses , landmarks , and
other information they had to recall .
But it can be seen in many
parts of life .
In learning , one should not be uncomfortable ( on pins
and needles ) but one should also not be in a lounger either ; too much
pain / pleasure detracts from one 's ability to absorb information .
One
of my uni professors used to say that the classroom should be just
below room temperature , not warmer or colder than 20 degrees C ( 68
degrees F ) .
Any colder and students start to freeze ; any warmer and
they start to go limp and sleep .
I have tried this in my own classes
and it works .
Either extreme distracts the student and causes his / her
body to disengage from the material .
I also found this temperature to
be just right when I did my doctoral research , as well .
In psychological terms , I think it comes down to the fact that it
takes emotion to move a muscle , and emotion is the substance of mental
principles because it is the substance of relationships .
We cannot
understand relational dynamics -- even of inanimate things -- without
attributing some level of emotion ( not passion ) to the relationship .
We often do this through metaphor , both on the linguistic level ( so
Lakoff ) and in the non-linguistic but nonetheless cognitive parts of
our thinking .
I think it all boils down to the fact that we , as
humans , are basically relational and attribute or imagine relationship
even among inanimate things .
If you want a good example of how relational our physical exertion is ,
ask someone to push against your open palm while you try to resist .
You cannot resist by trying to stand still ; you must push back ,
counterbalancing the other person 's pushing .
This effectively invokes
the same emotion as moving the piece of big heavy furniture which you
mentioned in your entry .
If the other person stops suddenly , your hand
will jerk forward -- proving that it was pushing and not merely
resisting .
The emotion involved was dynamic and not static .
This may
seem off - topic , but this relational principle seems to be manifest in
purely physical ways , as well .
I know from experience that major parts
of the muscular system work on it -- the muscles on one side of the
leg balance out the muscles on the other side .
If one side is
overdeveloped , it pulls things out of alignment and you get muscle and
joint problems .
One aspect of these mind - body dynamics that is not discussed very
often is the extent to which some of them are culturally determined .
For example , if you watch a video of a person nodding their head up
then down and saying " No " , you will probably experience a level of
( humourous ) dissonance .
However , a Bulgarian would not .
Bulgaria is
one of , I think , two places on the planet where the nodding of the
head means " no " and the shaking of the head means " yes " .
With respect
to colours and images on websites , you will find similar dynamics with
the disparate meanings / symbolism between the West and , say , China .
Even with cultural sensitivities considered , one is shooting at a
moving target when applying this information .
This is largely due to
micro-evolution on the part of the user .
As you have taught us ,
Kathy , the brain likes puzzles and new stuff .
It also grows
accustomed to that new stuff , and there is a direct relationship
between the newness of the stuff and the effect it has on the person's
learning experience .
As the person gets used to the new stuff , they
want more , and it can become something of an addiction .
However , there are also limits to what people can do with new designs .
As you mentioned recently , too much innovation goes beyond the pale of
the user 's ability to adapt and is called " crappy " just like designs
with insufficient innovation .
It is the Peter Principle 's bell curve
applied to design .
This is seen in designs like the five - button mouse
or the quasi - 3d desktop environments that are around .
For most
people , myself included , working such things requires too much Zen to
be effective .
There is a niche group who uses them , but is n't there
always a long tail niche for just about anything ?
From a user 's perspective , when a person thinks about an action , they
should have the tools closest to hand that they would want to perform
that action .
This is shown in your switch graphic , too , and is
naturally why some old - timers and geeks still prefer keyboard
shortcuts to diverting their ( my ) eyes -- and therefore their ( my ) attention -- from
their ( my ) work to hunt for the damned mouse .
I will show my age in IT - years
by saying that WordPerfect for DOS was , for me , a significantly better
designed program than MS - Word , and the reason was that it thought the
way I thought .
I did not have to crawl into the head of the developer
and ask " Now , where would s/ he have put that ? "
It had a wonderful way
of putting power at the überuser 's disposal whilst keeping it out of
the way for the newbie .
In this way , I think well - designed programs
should shepherd the user ( not to mention not crashing and corrupting
the user 's data like the * other * wordprocessing program does ) .
Again , just my 2p .

The light switch and related examples made sense to me , but I did n't have any problem with the " zeal " exercise .
What was supposed to happen ?
I realize I may not be typical , but I had a different reaction to the pictures .
I felt like the " monk " was protecting me from danger by stopping me and the person in the other picture seemed to be a bit manipulative -- like they wanted me to come to them because they wanted something from me .
I appreciated the monk more .
I 'm a little surprised at this myself since the pictures are obviously selected to invoke the opposite response .
The " pushing away " picture is dark and the person has a serious look , for example , and the " come hither " is light and the person is smiling .
It really does n't prove much about reactions to the pushing away or come hither gestures per se since there is so many other factors that may also influence a viewer 's reactions .
Still , it was an interesting blog entry .
Thank you .

Totally agree with you on this - ' mind ' is much more physical than we usually notice ; ' body ' is much more intelligent than we give it credit for .
So if you 're stuck with a mental or creative block , one of the best things you can do is change your physical state - get up , go for a walk , do some stretches , wash the dishes , do some yoga etc .
The implications for health are even more profound .
Here 's someone ( a friend and colleague ) who 's doing some amazing work with ' bodymind ' : http://reversetherapy.wordpress.com/

I disagree that things that go up should be labelled up .
At least not all the time .
Plane controls are inverted for good reason .
At first , it does seem strange .
But once you start using it , it makes complete sense .
It depends on what your thinking of moving .
If you 're thinking of moving what you see , inverted controls will frustrate you .
But if you 're thinking of rotating the plane , then the controls are in direct accord .
Personally , I can't play 3d games if the controls are not inverted .
And I have n't seen a single one that does n't allow the option for both .
The reason for different people liking different controls is simple .
It 's about perspective .
Not everyone , no matter what those tests seem to suggest , view things the same way .
With levers , they are attached to a static background .
But when both the user and the background move , then it 's all relative .
Every time something goes up , something else must go down .
So how do you determine what 's best ?
Who 's to say who is right or wrong ?
This may seem blunt , but it would be better to come up with your own ideas , Kathy , instead of repeating other people 's words .
What are your thoughts ?
What was your contribution ?
I do n't see it .
And the ideas were not well thought out .

I wish what you said was true for all people .
I can hear music perfectly in my head but can't replicate it
Physically there are some things that I just can't do and have spent too much time feeling bad about
Doctors are increasingly giving people puzzles to solve to check for signs of dementia .
Though I 'm not elderly and my " limitations " are hidden , I feel as if I should walk around with a doctor 's note saying that I could never play games except for Jeopardy and the like
Yes there is a gigantic body mind connection -- and those neurons are always charging , firing and misfiring
If a group of 50 people are taught yoga to relax and four can't master the positions , anxiety takes over .
I have spent a lifetime controlling my body to be completely socially appropriate and did master appearing calm while inside I was a gigantic anxiety attack
Until and unless there is room for individual variables in tests such as the ones you showed -- and by definition there can't be , we 're forcing individuals to be the round cookie when they would rather be the oval one

Very interesting ... but not stupid .
I think there is a lot to mind over matter .
Another component that may play a part in this : culture .
While living in France , I never was able to fully wrap my brain around the fact that light switches are the opposite over there ... up is off and down is on .
Go figure .
And I have never had the courage to drive in London or Australia or Japan ... my brain aches at the thought of driving on the opposite side of the road .

The chinese do not actually make a difference between the brain and the body , they are both part of a single organism , you .
Being a bit of an intellectual , I always separated them but you do think better after exercising and there is something to be said about the greek ideal ( a healthy mind in a healthy body ) .
Watching my wife , it is becoming more obvious how the chemistry of your body has an influence on your personality and everything else .
The point I suppose is that they are not actually two separate things and work best when they are both going in the same direction .

In meditation such as Vipassana meditation you get to observe very clearly a constant connection between mind and body .
You trend towards greater awareness of conscious / semi-conscious / unconscious sensations in your body and you see how your thoughts are connected .
You do n't think about it or casually notice it , you vividly EXPERIENCE this connection throughout your body .
For example , you might be thinking an angry thought and see how closely correlated it is with some pain in your body , and the act of calmly accepting the pain and not reacting to it becomes synonymous with , say , forgiving the object of your angry thought ( even if it 's Windows ) .
A result is an eventual untangling of internal mental / physical knots which you could call an internal state of flow much like has been discussed on this blog so much .

In the UK , the magician Derren Brown ( www.derrenbrown.co.uk) has a trick where he gets someone to hide an object , then he locates the object simply by holding on to the person , and getting them to think about how to get to that object .
In his recent book , he claims that if someone thinks a direction ( e.g. " Move Left " ) , their muscles also react ( I think he calls it muscle memory ) , so that by applying pressure on the person 's arm and feeling for resistance , he can then locate the hidden object .

Antonio Damasio makes a philosophical and neuroscientific case for the interdependence of brain and body in creating " mind " , in his book Descartes ' Error .
It 's a very interesting read , and if you have some spare time you should check it out .

Am hoping desperately this does n't mean I have to wave my arms in the air when I worship .
I do n't mind if OTHER people do it , you understand .... ( she lies )
Not that bad really .
But it underlined for me how important it is to do worship which is fully inclusive of those with learning disabilities by using movements .
SO much of our worship is words , words , words .
I watch my learning disabled son and he is just a spectator , and probably will be all his life .
Where is the worship that includes him ?
Is a banner to wave really all I can offer him ?
And what about those elderly who can't do the silly actions the teens can do , but can do gentler movements , and who may also be having language processing problems , and sensory disabilities due to age .
Hmmmmm .....
Warmest blessings on a good blog ,

It 's interesting how traditional mechanics can result in " bad mapping " e.g. you pull down on a pulley system to raise it and vice versa .

Actually in the UK that " up " switch IS reversed !
I found out rather quickly and still never got used to it .
Also , the toilet flusher - thing NOT on the left side ( if you 're facing the toilet , it 's on the right ) .

Like many Americans I am a bit overweight and this is true even after living a year in China eating indigenous food and shedding 15 % of my body mass .
Coming back to the fattest city in the land of the big helping , I am concerned about regaining that weight given the fact that Americans eat 920 kg of food annually ( 3,800 kcal per person per day ) .
But never fear , the energy crisis will eventually help me maintain my desired weight .
Many are going to wonder what does the energy crisis have to do with being fat .
Well , the modern agricultural system is nothing but a system which turns petroleum and natural gas into food .
Thirteen kilocalories of energy is used to produce each kilocalorie of food we eat ( p. 20 ) .
The first place to look at this is in fertilizer .
Nitrogen fertilizers are made using lots of energy .
In the US it is natural gas which is used but in China it is coal .
The manufacture of nitrogen fertilizer uses 1 % of the world 's energy supply .
And this one percent feeds us .
There is a direct correlation between fertilizer price and natural gas price in the US .
Here is the natural gas price on the same time period ( blue curve ) with the pink dots being the corn price per bushel .
The thing to note here is that the corn price is not following the natural gas curve , so when the natural gas price rises and the corresponding increase in price of fertilizer occurs , the farmer must make a choice as to how to balance the budget .
The decision often includes using less fertilizer to cut costs .
At $ 5.00 per mmbtu ammonia costs $ 200 per ton , but at $ 19 per mmbtu , the price rises to $ 650 per ton .
Clearly one can see that as energy prices rise , fertilizer prices will rise followed by two things , a rise in the price of food and a reduction in the use of fertilizer as farmers try to cut costs .
Farming has narrow margins .
Is there any evidence of a drop in usage of fertilizer ?
Yes .
Since natural gas prices began rising in 2000 - 2001 , sixteen fertilizer factories have been shut permanently and five more suspended operations .
There was a slight dip in reported fertilizer use during the 2001 spike in fertilizer price .
Corn went from 136 lb per acre to 133 with a 2 % drop in treated acres .
With soybeans the pounds per acre remained the same but there was a 7 % drop in treated acres and with cotton there was a 7 % drop in treated acres and a 7 lb / acre reduction in usage .
Here is the historical use of nitrogen fertilizer use on corn in 1000 nutrient tons .
Note the dip in use in 2001 when the gas price spiked :
1992--4,887
1993--4,369
1994--4,954
1995 --4,492
1996 --5,181
1997 --5,118
1998 --5,226
1999 --5,043
2000 --5,301
2001--4,625
2002 --5,188
2003 --5,140
By the end of this century there will be no commercial quantities of oil , natural gas and coal with which to make fertilizer .
So , what is the effect of a lessening of fertilizer use ?
Lower crop yields .
Below is a chart of crop yields vs. fertilizer application in China .
There is a direct correlation between fertilizer and crop yield .
( from Wang , Q. et al , 1995 )
Smith et al . ( 1990 ) studied the impact of fertilizer on crop yields .
They concluded that over a 71 year period fertilizer was responsible for 40 % of the wheat crop ; over a 45 year period fertilizer was responsible for 57 percent of the corn yield .
So , one can easily understand what will happen if fertilizer use drops .
There is a modern example of the impact ; it is seen in the starvation which is taking place in North Korea .
They underwent a power shortage .
which affected lighting , industrial production and agriculture .
The effect was a precipitous drop in fertilizer production with the resultant drop in crop yields followed by starvation .
One of the chief aid requests from the North Koreans is fertilizer .
picture here .
Is there an organic way to avoid this problem ?
Some authors are writing that we can use animal manure to fertilize the farm fields .
A paper ( Pimental et al 2005 ) last year in Bioscience took such an approach and concluded that animal manure could replace fertilizer with no loss of productivity .
They used 5.6 metric tons two years out of five , so that averages out to 2.24 tons per year .
So , how many cows are needed ?
A dairy cow can produce 120 pounds of fresh manure per day .
But that has a water content of 88 % meaning one cow can produce about 1.8 tons of dry manure per year .
Thus it takes more than one cow to produce the fertilizer Pimental et al require .
Other rules of thumb I have found say that one cow can fertilize 1.5 acres .
But if , without fertilizer , it takes 10 acres to run a cow , then that cow can not provide enough for self - fertilization of his own fields , much less for other fields .
And there is another issue , something forgotten by Americans because this knowledge is from the lives of our great - grand parents .
If one does not have energy to the point of needing heat , then cow manure wo n't be available for fertilization .
It will be burned for cooking and heating purposes .
Two months ago , I went to Tibet on business .
I visited a farm and went to areas where nomads live .
I saw manure - as - fuel in action .
On the farm they mixed yak dung with straw , patted it into potato - sized balls and then stored it on the exterior walls of their houses ( what a fun job that must be ) .
This helps insulate the house but is also a convenient way to grab some fuel quickly .
But this use of manure means that it wo n't be available for fertilizer if by the end of this century we have no other source of energy .
We now examine whether ethanol can fuel the required fertilizer .
Using 2.5 gallons per bushel for the ethanol and the record corn crop of 136 bushels per acre we find that an acre produces 340 gallons .
The US uses 146 billion gallons per year of gasoline today , but because ethanol has only 70 % of the energy content of gasoline we would require 1.4 times more or 2.08 billion gallons of ethanol to maintain our lifestyle .
How many acres will this require ?
Well , today the US uses 491 million acres under cultivation and my math says we need 691 million acres to manufacture enough ethanol to manufacture both the fertilizer and enough other ethanol to fuel transportation .
The US has on 945 million acres devoted to agriculture .
Clearly there is a problem .
Without the fertilizer the US would need 3.6 billion acres of corn to make the ethanol , clearly an impossibility .
Another way to look at it is if we and the cows all stop eating corn and use the present corn acreage ( 80 million acres ) all for ethanol , we could produce 27 billion gallons per year , or about 13 percent of what is needed for transportation and fertilizer combined .
To close , a reduction in the available energy will help our weight loss .
As one Pfeiffer observed , to achieve a sustainable US , we must reduce our population by around one third .
I think he is an optimist .

AS DIGITAL music hogs the headlines , the humble CD has made a comeback at the cash register .
However , music retailers may still be feeling the pinch .
Figures released by the Australian Recording Industry Association yesterday show an increase of almost 8 per cent in the volume of wholesale physical music products , such as CDs , in 2006 compared with 2005 , despite a decrease of more than 5 per cent in overall revenue .
The association 's 2006 wholesale recorded music statistics also show that Australians bought three times as much digital music in 2006 compared with the previous year .
The chief executive of the association , Stephen Peach , said the drop in wholesale CD revenue was attributable to tougher competition between retailers and pressure from consumers attracted to the cheaper digital music .
MIKE HALL has taught himself to stretch time .
He uses his powers to make him a better squash player .
“ It ’s hard to describe , but it ’s a feeling of stillness , like I ’m not trapped in sequential time any more , ” he says .
“ The ball still darts around , but it moves around the court at different speeds depending on the circumstances .
It ’s like I ’ve stepped out of linear time . ”
Hall , a sports coach from Edinburgh , UK , is talking about a state of mind known as “ the zone ” .
He puts his abilities down to 12 years of studying the martial art t’ai chi , and now makes a living teaching other sportspeople how to “ go faster by going slower ” .
For most people , getting into “ the zone ” at work or home is n’t a realistic option .
But the idea of stretching time – or at least having more control over its frantic pace – is an attractive one ( see “ Slow living ” ) .
And there may be things we can do .
There is a growing understanding of how our brains measure the passage of time , and it turns out we have more conscious control over it than previously thought .
Biologists traditionally divide our timekeeping abilities into three domains .
At one end are circadian rhythms , which control things such as sleep and wakefulness over the 24 - hour period .
At the other end is millisecond timing , which is involved in fine motor tasks .
The middle ground – the seconds - to - minutes range – is known as “ interval timing ” .
This is the system through which we consciously perceive the passage of time .
Until recently , interval timing was something of a psychological backwater , says John Wearden of Keele University …
SANTA BARBARA , Calif. , March 2 , 2007  --
This is a city for people who have arrived in life .
Located an hour and a half up the coast from Los Angeles , Santa Barbara 's flowery hills are covered with multimillion dollar homes that have a commanding view of the Pacific Ocean .
But the coastal community is also home to a growing population of people who have no roof over their heads , the homeless who wander the streets and sleep on public benches .
And now the city has a new class of resident , not quite homeless -- but does n't have a home either .
They are the working poor who live in their cars , trucks and campers .
Call them the mobile homeless .
" We 've lived in the homeless shelter , and it 's full of people that are drunk and on drugs , " said Carlos Cortez .
Working but too poor to afford rent in this expensive city , Cortez and his wife , Naomi , scraped together enough money to buy an old recreational vehicle they can live in .
It 's a phenomenon that is happening all over the country as people are priced out of local housing and have nowhere else to go where life might be better .
California alone has about 350,000 homeless people .
Santa Barbara has 2,000 , some still trying to make it in the working world .
" Some work in the service industries , some work in the local hotels and motels , " said Gary Linker , director of New Beginnings Counseling Center , which works with the homeless .
" Some of them work for the city and county , " he said .
Finding a Parking Space for Mobile ' Homes '
Naomi Cortez supervises the deli counter at a local supermarket in Santa Barbara .
" I have many co-workers who rent rooms for $ 1,400 a month , and they do n't have a full kitchen like I have … [ or ] their own shower … their own bath , " she said .
For years , people like Carlos and Naomi quietly parked their vehicles near the beach or on quiet roads in residential neighborhoods .
But they were constantly running afoul of the homeowners in this image - conscious city .
And when the city tightened parking restrictions to squeeze out the vehicle - dwellers , they lived in constant fear of having their homes towed away .
" I would be stressed to the max all the time because I did n't want to lose this thing , " said Derek Tuck , standing in the doorway of his RV after a day of work .
But even while the mobile homeless were wandering in search of a safe place to park , many of Santa Barbara 's downtown parking lots were empty all night , every night .
That was until New Beginnings worked with the city to open the municipal parking lots .
Now the mobile homeless are allowed to come home from work in peace and park overnight under something called the Safe Parking Program .
" It brought back into my life a routine , " Derek Tuck said .
" I come here a certain time .
I stay here a certain time .
I get enough sleep . "
There are restrictions ; only five vehicles to a lot , 7 p.m. to 6:30 am .
But after years of trying to push the homeless around , and possibly out , Santa Barbara has come to the realization that if this is the way things are , the city is going to work with it .
The aim is to make this a temporary situation and try to help people get a permanent home .
Helene Schnieder of the Santa Barbara City Council said , " If the reality right now is their only source of safe shelter is their vehicle , then we have to acknowledge that , understand it , and do what we can to move them out of that vehicle and into a home . "
Shaw Talley , a counselor with New Beginnings , makes the rounds of the parking lots at night , visiting mobile homes .
He is credited with helping as many as 100 people find more permanent homes .
" We can't just keep pushing the problem to other cities and counties , Talley said .
" This is a weird alternative , but it is an alternative . "
Relaxing after dinner in his old RV , Carlos Cortez said , " We want to move up .
We just want to get on with our lives . "
But for now , home is where he parks it .

There is no question that traditional African art is beautiful to behold , highly prized , and valuable in today ’s society .
But why ?
How ?
African art raises so many questions because its forms and compositions are so very different from those of western society ; it simply takes time to get used to and understand them .
African art is characterized by its geometric shapes and strongly abstracted representational forms and designs .
The architectonic masses have powerful solid and somber qualities .
From a modern standpoint , the expression can be serene and moving .
Understanding tribal art takes an open mind .
The aesthetics that please a tribesman can be at odds with those we consider beautiful .
For example , an African woman will file her teeth to create jagged edges or stretch her neck with iron rings to look more beautiful , while we in America may consider this vulgar .
Scarification , tattoos , body piercing have always been artistic expressions in African society whereas body art has , only in the last generation , caught on in the US .
Perhaps to better appreciate African art , we should better understand its historical context and setting , as well as the cultural and societal forces at work , least of which are function and religion .
Traditional African art can be ancient .
It also played a highly important social and religious role in African culture .
The art was both functional and religious and existed in a reality totally devoid of western man .
Early contact with west came in the 16th Century , through missionaries in the Congo .
For the most part , the art remained mostly tribal and only watered down during colonization .
It was not until the last hundred years that tribal culture melded with traditional western values , themes , religions , and social and political systems .
Countries regained their independence in the 1950s , but the societal tribal structure is fading away , along with the carvings used in rituals .
African art can also be appreciated independently and without any references to its origins .
This way , the feeling it evokes is based solely on its strong presence and how it makes you feel and what it makes you think .
African art was appreciated for its own sake in Europe at the turn of the 20th Century , where the avant garde in Paris coveted it tremendously , thus directly influencing cubism with its simplified use of planes and forms .
Segy writes , “ In our emotional need we respond to African sculpture because it embodies an intense emotional life .
To the extent that we feel its reality , that we sense the radiations of its emotional vigor , we gain the sensation of fulfillment , of nourishing something starved in ourselves . ”
Background
The huge diverse continent of Africa with its mountains , jungles , deserts , wild life , rivers , and vegetation has great variety of artistic expression .
There are over 800 languages alone and the continent is 3 times the size of the United States .
African art is generally broken down into various geographical regions , each with its own sub-specialties and nuances of style .
For many , the study of African art is a life long pursuit and requires focus and specializing .
Just because someone is an expert on the art in the Western Sudan does not mean that they know about the art of Tanzania in the East .

The Beginnings
From the Sahara to the Cape , African Neolithic man created tens of thousands of beautiful engravings and paintings on the rock walls of caves and shelters .
They depicted a variety of scenes with figures , animals , and cosmologies , dating to about 8000 to 6500 BC .
The Nubians were indigenous peoples occupying a large part of the upper Nile valley .
They had a great civilization before the rise of Pharaohonic Egypt where they were assimilated ; their artistic styles were later subjugated to the canons of Dynastic Egypt , then the Persians , Greeks , Romans , Byzantines and finally the world of Islam .
The next oldest sculptural traditions in Africa are also from the western Sudan in the inland Niger delta .
There were great trade routes in this area going back to 2000 BC for gold , ivory , and salt , and the natives started to embrace Islam in the 14th Century AD .
In Nigeria , the Nok culture is considered the earliest lost African civilization .
The large elongated abstract figures made of grog and iron rich clay TL test to 500 BC - 200 AD .
These figures were discovered within the last 100 years by tin miners , and archaeologists have trouble pinpointing their origins because they have migrated due to floods and alluvial washes .
None of the figures have been found in their original settings .
These exciting sculptures demonstrate that strong abstract figural representation has been an artistic sculptural tradition in Africa for 2500 years .
African art is not something new , haphazard , or primitive .
Sculptures in the area of Jenne date from 1000 to 1300 AD .
The style is similar to that of the local Dogon in Mali with the elongated bodies and bullet shaped heads .
In the 16th Century , there are prized Sherbro - Portugese Ivories arising from trade .
The Akan of Ghana are an old African tribal group who traded with Muslims .
The Akan were skillful with weights .
They are especially famous for their small cast copper and bronze gold weights that come in all forms , from animals , to fruits , to abstract geometric shapes .
In Africa , dress was another way to signify tribal hierarchy .
Many elaborate patterned bold and graphic textile compositions were created to distinguish the upper class and rulers .
One of the largest kingdoms , the Asante , is famous for its ceremonial stools and chairs that symbolize power and organization .
In the village of Igbo - Ukwu in the Niger Delta and the Cross River , the bronze casting tradition dates back to the 9th Century AD .
Bronze casting is a sophisticated means by which African artists expressed themselves .
The important images of Kings , portraits , Oni's , plaques and shrine pieces are well known to everyone .
One of the most famous tribes is the Benin from Nigeria .
Their bronze casting tradition was perhaps at its height in the 15th and 16th Centuries .
The works were produced for the power of the Oba or King and may have had magical powers .
The Largest tribe in Africa is the Yoruba , who number over 12 million peoples .
They are primarily from South West Nigeria .
Traditions for there artistic development go back around 1000 years and some feel there is a direct correlation between them and the Nok people .
Their distinct artistic style grew out of socio-political and religious organizations within chiefdoms and under the rule of a divine King or Ife .
Considered to be some of the finest output in all of Africa , bronzes of very refined Ife sculptures , dating back to the 12th Century , were found in Yoruba shrines .
Usage
As the name suggests , tribal art is just that : art born from settled farmers and hunters with Kings , wise men , elders , secret societies and rites .
Devoid of writing , African art communicates through the iconography and meaning of its visual forms .
Villages were known for certain markings so when a member traveled , one could know when boundaries were crossed and a new village was entered .
Oral tradition was one way to tell a story , whether the history of a kingdom or the origins of mankind .
These allegorical stories were carved as narratives into doors and architectural elements to educate the people .
The traditional art consists of wood carvings , both masks and sculpture , stone carvings , architectural elements , furniture , pottery , which was mostly done by females , metalworks in the form of currencies , bracelets , weights , weapons , pipes , textiles , and beadwork and weavings .

Authenticity
When evaluating a tribal piece for correctness , try to go at it with an experienced eye .
The older pieces are usually finer in details , so take time and study the ears , eyes , hair and overall form for quality .
The fact that a form is more foreign , powerful , puzzling and abstract might be a sign of a purely correct piece .
Train your eye with the visual images in books .
Breaking down a three dimensional work in a two dimensional media brings everything to the picture plane on the page .
Such an exercise should inform what proper proportions and representations are .
Keep studying , go to museums and galleries and auctions and handle the objects when possible .
Patina is surface wear over long periods of time .
Wood can naturally darken , become smooth and build up a shine from natural oils in our skin transferred through touch .
In order to give pieces a dark black surface , a forger may use smoke or stains .
Hold the piece to your nose and see if there is a smell .
Does the patina rub off easily ?
Does the item have wear patterns that are consistent with the type of use ?
For example , if the piece was traditionally used in a procession , is it worn where the piece would have been picked up ?
If it is a mask , the back of the mask should not have the same finish as the front .
All attachment holes should not be uniformly perforated around the edges , and there should be areas of discoloration where the mask was in contact with the face .
There are a number of artificial ways to age pieces .
Objects can be deliberately exposed to the elements to induce weathering .
Objects can be placed in insect and termite infestations to cause damage and disintegration .
They can be left to be pecked at by chickens .
The can be buried and rediscovered .
Patinas and sweat marks can be falsified , although the latter is not easy .
Native mends are common , and fiber wears out quickly so edging is replaced often and can be newer then the wood to which it is attached .
Native repairs can be clever attempts to throw you off .
To add to the dilemma , admitted copies of traditional sculpture are made all over Africa .
Marshall Mount writes , “ Several museum workshops and schools specialize in copying traditional art .
Students at the Maison des Artisanants , a school allied with the museum in Bamako , Mali , are taught to copy some of the old sculpture styles of former French West Africa .
The artists today use traditional materials and techniques in an attempt to simulate the form and finish of the original objects ” .
This is scary when these excellent copies are unleashed into the western marketplace .
Dr. Frank Willet writes , ”
The most obvious authentic works on which all would agree are those made by an African for use by his own people and so used .
However , this category can be subdivided into those of superior , average , or inferior aesthetic quality .
A little lower on the scale is a work made by an African for use by his own people but bought by an expatriate before use .
Then comes sculpture made by an African in the traditional style of his own people for sale to an expatriate ; then made by an African in the traditional style on commission by an expatriate ; then sculpture made by an African in poor imitation of the traditional style of his own people for sale to an expatriate ; made in the style of a different African peoples ( though it may be well done ) for sale to an expatriate ; made by an African in a non-traditional style for sale to an expatriate .
Finally we have works made by an expatriate , i.e. non-African , for sale to other non-Africans but passed off as being African .
( The last one is considered totally fake ) .
In time and with experience ; a dialog between yourself and the object may lead you to an answer to its authenticity but understand that in today ’s world there are various degrees of authenticity .
It is a wise idea to identify a group of specialists that can help vet any new acquisitions to your collection .
Remember that specialization in African art can be down the tribe / culture level .
On Provenance
Provenance is the ongoing scholarly research investigating the ownership history .
Complete provenance of a given work of art , particularly one pre-dating the nineteenth century and the advent of the modern art market , is often difficult if not impossible to establish .
Information is sometimes withheld by dealers and auction houses at the request of previous owners who wish to maintain their anonymity .
Established provenance can help date when a piece was originally acquired .
Ideally with tribal art , if the collector was an anthropologist , or a person with the foresight to take notes on the names of the village , parties involved , and cultural context in which the item was used and the circumstances in which it was acquired , then all the better .
This adds to the appeal and , probably , the value of the piece .
If a collection is known to be specialized in only one area or theme , then the chances of fakes is reduced ; presumably the collector really knew about what he / she was acquiring , which makes provenance particularly valuable .
Published objects are always sought after because they are usually catalogued by scholars , and the publications are usually peered reviewed .
Since today ’s forgeries are so good , it makes sense to consider the collection history of an object as well as the object .
Provenance does add to the price of a piece during resale .
Quality Rating Scale
The quality rating scale used here is that of Dr. Seiber and is as follows :
1. Authentic tribal pieces usually used in tribal ceremonies .
The highest rating for authenticity and quality – usually with some age but even newer pieces if authentic and embodying a spiritual dimension .
2. “ B Grade Authentic ” - Same as 1 except diminished some by condition , newness , or style and quality of the artist ’s effort .
3 . Decorative newer pieces – still good quality , but sometimes copies .
Most often a continuum of an established and traditional tribal piece but with an incorrect patina .
Decorative value .
4. African arts made to be sold to foreigners – Europeans , Americans , and others .
Not necessarily tribal , could be folk or contemporary .
5. “ Airport ” or tourist art ( souvenirs ) .
Lowest grade and made in great quantities .
Enjoy African art for its historical significance .
Enjoy the power of the forms and designs as they move you .
One can gain such personal satisfaction and accomplishment with the formation of a collection .
Because tribal art is very geometric and exists strongly in a three dimensional space , it is very much up front : its presence can be awe inspiring .
Early collectors thought the art was crude and primitive , yet today we understand that the forms and styles in African art are exactly the way the artists chose to represent them .
Strong , focused , and contemplative , tribal art nurtures our souls .
I grew up in a small farming town in upstate New York where my life , and the life of my family , centered on the Presbyterian Church .
I prayed and sang hymns every Sunday , went to Bible school , listened to my father preach the weekly sermon and attended seminary at Harvard Divinity School to be a preacher myself .
America was a place where things could be better if we worked to make them better , and where our faith saved us from despair , self - righteousness and the dangerous belief that we knew the will of God or could carry it out .
We were taught that those who claimed to speak for God , the self - appointed prophets who promised the Kingdom of God on earth , were dangerous .
We had no ability to understand God 's will .
We did the best we could .
We trusted and had faith in the mystery , the unknown before us .
We made decisions - even decisions that on the outside looked unobjectionably moral - well aware of the numerous motives , some good and some bad , that went into every human act .
In the end , we all stood in need of forgiveness .
We were all tainted by sin .
None were pure .
The Bible was not the literal word of God .
It was not a self - help manual that could predict the future .
It did not tell us how to vote or allow us to divide the world into us and them , the righteous and the damned , the infidels and the blessed .
It was a book written by a series of ancient writers , certainly fallible and at times at odds with each other , who asked the right questions and struggled with the mystery and transcendence of human existence .
We took the Bible seriously and therefore could not take it literally .
There was no alcohol in the manse where I grew up .
Indeed , my father railed against the Glass Bar , the one bar in town , and the drinking in the VFW Hall .
We did not work on Sunday .
I never heard my father swear .
But coupled with this piety was a belief that as Christians we were called to fight for justice .
My father took an early stand in the town in support of the civil - rights movement , a position that was highly unpopular in rural , white enclaves where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the most hated men in America .
A veteran of World War II , he opposed the Vietnam War , telling me when I was about 12 that if the war was still being waged when I was 18 , he would go to prison with me .
To this day I carry in my head the rather gloomy image of sitting in a jail cell with my dad .
Finally , because his youngest brother was gay , he understood the pain and isolation of being a gay man in America .
He worked later in life in the gay - rights movement , calling for the ordination and marriage of gays .
When he found that my college , Colgate University , had no gay and lesbian organization , he brought gay speakers to the campus .
The meetings led gays and lesbians to confide in him that they felt uncomfortable coming out of the closet to start an open organization , a problem my father swiftly solved by taking me out to lunch and informing me that although I was not gay , I had to form the organization .
When I went into the dining hall for breakfast , lunch and dinner , the checker behind the desk would take my card , mark off the appropriate box , and hand it back , muttering , " Faggot . "
This willingness to take a moral stand , to accept risk and ridicule , was , he showed me , the cost of the moral life .
The four Gospels , we understood , were filled with factual contradictions , two Gospels saying Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist , while Luke asserted that John was already in prison .
Mark and John give little importance to the birth of Jesus , while Matthew and Luke give differing accounts .
There are three separate and different versions of the 10 Commandments ( Exodus 20 , Exodus 34 , and Deuteronomy 5 ) .
As for the question of God 's true nature , there are many substantive contradictions .
Is God a loving or a vengeful God ?
In some sections of the Bible , vicious acts of vengeance , including the genocidal extermination of opposing tribes and nations , appear to be blessed by God .
God turns on the Egyptians and transforms the Nile into blood so the Egyptians will suffer from thirst - and then sends swarms of locusts and flies to torture them , along with hail , fire and thunder from the heavens to destroy all plants and trees .
To liberate the children of Israel , God orders the firstborn in every Egyptian household killed so all will know " that the Lord makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel " ( Exodus 11:7 ) .
The killing does not cease until " there was not a house where one was not dead " ( Exodus 12:30 ) .
Amid the carnage God orders Moses to loot all the clothing , jewelry , gold and silver from the Egyptian homes ( Exodus 12:35 - 36 ) .
God looks at the devastation and says , " I have made sport of the Egyptians " ( Exodus 10:2 ) .
While the Exodus story fueled the hopes and dreams of oppressed Jews , and later African Americans in the bondage of slavery , it also has been used to foster religious chauvinism .
A literal reading of the Bible means reinstitution of slavery coupled with the understanding that the slavemaster has the right to beat his slave without mercy since " the slave is his money " ( Exodus 21:21 ) .
Children who strike or curse a parent are to be executed ( Exodus 21:15 , 17 ) .
Those who pay homage to another god " shall be utterly destroyed " ( Exodus 22:20 ) .
Menstruating women are to be considered unclean , and all they touch while menstruating becomes unclean ( Leviticus 15:19 - 32 ) .
The blind , the lame , those with mutilated faces , those who are hunchbacks or dwarfs and those with itching diseases or scabs or crushed testicles cannot become priests ( Leviticus 21:17 - 21 ) .
Blasphemers shall be executed ( Leviticus 24:16 ) .
And " if the spirit of jealousy " comes upon a man , the high priest can order the jealous man 's wife to drink the " water of bitterness . "
If she dies , it is proof of her guilt ; if she survives , of her innocence ( Numbers 5:11 - 31 ) .
Women , throughout the Bible , are subservient to men , often without legal rights , and men are free to sell their daughters into sexual bondage ( Exodus 21:7 - 11 ) .

A major spike in activity targeting TCP Port 1025 on Windows systems may be a sign that attackers are gathering intelligence for an upcoming attack against unpatched servers , Symantec Corp. warned Monday .
Symantec 's DeepSight threat network has seen a " pretty sizable " increase in the number of sensors that have registered events on TCP Port 1025 , said Mimi Hoang , group product manager with the company 's security response team .
" A normal level of activity would be 30 or so [ source ] IP addresses , give or take , with the number of events below 100 , " said Hoang .
" But here we 're seeing 1,400 to 1,500 IP addresses and more than 8,000 events .
" A spike like this does n't happen without a reason , " she said .
Hoang would n't definitively connect it with the Windows DNS Server Service vulnerability that Microsoft acknowledged last Thursday , but she did say , " We suspect it 's because any high port above 1024 is associated with Microsoft's RPC [ Remote Procedure Call protocol ] .
And 1025 is the first open port used by RPC . "
The bug in Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003 can be exploited by sending a malicious RPC packet via Port 105 or higher .
Microsoft , in fact , has recommended that businesses block all inbound unsolicited traffic on ports 1024 and greater .
" Considering the recent Microsoft Windows DNS Remote Procedure Call Interface Vulnerability , this traffic spike may be associated with scanning and intelligence gathering aimed at assessing available Windows RPC endpoints , " Symantec 's warning said .
" The traffic may also be indicating an increase in exploit attempts over TCP 1025 , although this has not been verified at the time of this writing . "
By midday Monday , Hoang had reiterated that Symantec had not confirmed any link between the port activity and actual exploits .
Exploits , however , continue to proliferate , Symantec and other security organizations said .
Immunity Inc. in Miami Beach , Fla. , released an exploit for the DNS server bug Monday for its Canvas penetration - testing framework , putting the total of publicly posted exploits at five .
One recent exploit reportedly uses TCP and UDP Port 445 , which Microsoft recommended blocking only yesterday .
Researchers are also positing additional attack strategies , in part because the normal routes through client PCs running Windows 2000 , Windows XP or Windows Vista are n't available .
Maarten Van Horenbeeck , one of the analysts in SANS Institute 's Internet Storm Center , noted that hosting service servers running Windows 2003
Server may be at risk because although they run DNS services as well as others -- HTPP and FTP , for example -- they 're usually not shielded by a separate firewall .
Active Directory servers may be in danger , too , said Van Horenbeeck .
" Active directory servers hosted on the internal network are often combined with DNS functionality , " Horenbeeck said in an ISC research note .
" These machines are usually less protected than DMZ DNS servers , and other functionality provisioned may require the RPC ports to be available .
If your active directory server is compromised , the game is essentially over . "
Microsoft has said several times that it is working on a patch , but it has not yet committed to a release date .
The company 's next scheduled patch day is three weeks away , on May 8 .
This story , " Port Scans Could Foreshadow DNS Server Attack " was originally published by Computerworld .
Moving is almost never easy , but moving out of the country makes those domestic PCS orders look easy .
Fortunately , thousands of people have preceded you on the OCONUS adventure , so there are lots of resources at your fingertips .
Here we ’ll try to answer some of the most frequently asked questions when it comes to planning your first international move with the military .
Getting Started
Look at your orders carefully before you start planning your move .
The military has a lot of resources that can help you , and you need to make sure you know which ones are available .
All PCS orders come with mandatory counseling through your local Transportation Management Office , or online through move.mil .
Your counselor will help answer questions and give guidance specific to your move .
Gather Your Documents
When traveling abroad , carrying your slick blue United States passport is always a must , but for an international military relocation , you ’ll need to also apply for a government passport for the entire family .
Depending on your destination , you may be required to apply for a visa as well .
Additionally , while stateside , you ’ll need to coordinate your medical screening , a process which can be surprisingly lengthy and involved .
Finally , make sure you gather any other pertinent records like your marriage certificate , professional licenses , school records , and birth certificates .
Either carry these with you for the move abroad , or find a safe place for keeping , like a safety deposit box or a family member ’s home , while you are away .
Shipping Logistics
Unfortunately , the military likely wo n’t pay for you to move every last thing you own overseas .
The key to an international relocation is traveling light ; the more things that you bring to your new home , the harder the move will be .
Look and every item that you want to bring with you a think about whether you really need it or not .
You ’ll want to group your belongings into two distinct shipments .
The first , known as unaccompanied baggage , should contain household items that you ’ll need more immediately such as basic pots and pans , kitchen appliances , linens , and extra sets of clothes .
While unaccompanied baggage is an “ express shipment ” , it can still take up to 3 weeks to receive this initial batch of belongings .
Separately , you ’ll also prepare your household goods shipment , which will contain the bulk of your household items .
Expect this second shipment to arrive within about 8 weeks of the shipment date .
When packing your household goods shipment , make sure to consider your weight allowance , as the military wo n’t cover the expense above and beyond your allowance .
It may be more convenient to simply repurchase some items in your destination country if they are n’t particularly expensive or take up a large portion of your allowance .
Put the Rest in Storage
Thankfully , whatever you ca n’t take with you can be stored stateside for your eventual return .
Government - paid storage in conjunction with an international military move is referred to as non-temporary storage ( NTS ) .
In addition to its own storage facilities , the government also contracts with a number of private storage facilities , making it more convenient for members to store their goods .
Make sure to complete either the DD Form 1164 or DD Form 1299 to ensure that your storage expense is covered by the military .
But before designating anything for storage , make sure you think twice about what you ’re hanging onto .
If it ’s stuff that you can live without for 2 - 3 years , is there a chance you could just get rid of it for good ?
You may be thanking yourself later for putting less away in storage now .
Electronics
Electronics deserve some special consideration .
Electrical standards vary all of the world , so you need to make sure that your electronics will be compatible with the systems in your new home .
Sometimes you can fix the problem by buying an adapter , but sometimes you ’ll be out of luck .
This usually wo n’t be a problem if you ’re living on base , but it can lead to some nasty surprises if you decide to take a trip to see the rest of the country .
Be sure to do your research with a guide like this one to avoid running into trouble .
Shipping a Car
Shipping your car overseas and learning to drive your car in a foreign country can be one of the hardest parts of the move .
Before you can even arrange for shipment of your vehicle , you ’ll have to prepare it for transport .
Great Guys Car Transport , a provider of cheap transport services domestically and internationally , has some tips when it comes to prepping your vehicle for shipment :
Complete Clean Out :
Make sure you completely clean - out the interior of your car .
If there are extra items in the vehicle , they may shift during shipment , causing damage to your car , and potentially to other vehicles in the shipment as well .
Now ’s a great time to get your car detailed so it looks great when you go to pick it up at your new base .
Schedule a Tune - Up :
The last thing you ’ll want to deal with when arriving overseas is tuning up your vehicle .
Take your car in for a professional tune - up prior to your departure to make sure everything is in running order .
This process includes topping off critical fluids , checking the battery level , and ensuring that the tires are properly inflated .
Ideal Gas Level :
While you do n’t want an entire tank of gas sloshing around during transport , you do want to ship your vehicle with about ¼ of a tank so that its actually operable when it arrives overseas .
License and Insurance :
Make sure you have adequate auto insurance for driving your vehicle abroad .
Also check with your moving counselor to see how to obtain a driver ’s license in your country of destination .
Of course , there ’s always the option of storing your vehicle while you ’re away and buying an inexpensive vehicle once your reach your destination .
Do your research to make sure that your car will actually be useful before you go to the trouble of shipping it .
When in doubt , look up what the locals do and follow their example .
Enjoy It
Finally , do n’t forget to enjoy this experience .
Moving abroad with the military is a great way to gain exposure to different cultures and do lots of traveling that would be unaffordable for most Americans .
Once you ’ve jumped over the hurdles of moving , you ’ll have plenty of time to enjoy your new home .

Introduction
Even to the casual observer , it is apparent that the time of multicore computing is upon us .
In fact , this shift occurred several years in the past .
The first general purpose CPU to feature Chip Multi-Processing ( CMP ) was the IBM POWER4 , which debuted in 2001 .
Today , there is not a high performance processor family without a shipping multicore design .
Even our video game consoles are shifting in that direction .
The Xbox 360 feature 3 - way symmetrical CMP , while the CELL processor uses up to 8 SIMD Processing Elements .
With the shift towards multicore systems , it is more important than ever to understand the additional complexities of multi-processor systems over traditional uni-processor machines .
Multicore designs bring almost all the difficulties that previously belonged to high - end MP systems to our desktops , laptops and consoles .
Before the shift to CMP , shared memory system design was an esoteric art .
Producing high quality MP systems was so difficult that there were multimillion dollar companies , whose sole purpose was to design , build and support large CPU count systems , using commercially available MPUs .
One such example was Sequent ( which was bought by IBM in 1999 ) and their Balance , Symmetry and NUMA - Q systems , but there were many others including Pyramid , Encore and Alliant .
These companies and many others devoted their engineering resources to tackling three major problems : memory hierarchy , cache coherency and scalability .
This article will cover all three topics in detail , and briefly discuss some additional considerations .

FORTRAN March 20 , 2007
New York , N.Y .
In 1971 I graduated high school and in the fall moved into a dormitory at Stevens Institute of Technology , a small but well - regarded engineering and science college in Hoboken , N.J. overlooking the Hudson River and Manhattan Island .
Stevens
Tech was the very first college to require all freshman to learn computer programming .
At that time , computer - related courses at Stevens Tech were under the domain of the Electrical Engineering department .
The required two - semester programming course was E11/E12 .
The language was FORTRAN .
FORTRAN was a natural for engineering and science students .
It was specifically designed to persuade the computer to do hard - core math .
In her classic text Programming Languages : History and Fundamentals ( Prentice - Hall , 1969 ) , Jean Sammet quotes the opening sentence of the first preliminary report for the specification of FORTRAN dated November 10 , 1954 : " The IBM Mathematical Formula Translating System or briefly , FORTRAN , will comprise a large set of programs to enable the IBM 704 to accept a concise formulation of a problem in terms of a mathematical notation and to produce automatically a high - speed 704 program for the solution of the problem . " ( p. 143 ) FORTRAN was the first major ( what we now call ) high - level language .
Jean Sammet also notes : " Although FORTRAN is considered quite commonplace now [ 1969 ] , it was not readily or easily accepted at that time .
Customers raised many objections , foremost among them was that the compiler probably could not turn out object code as good as their best programmers . "
( p 144 ) Plus ça change ...
The dialect we learned at Stevens Tech was FORTRAN IV , which by that time had intrinsic support of complex numbers .
Complex numbers are often vital in engineering and science applications , yet still today few languages support complex numbers with as much ease as FORTRAN did then .
Flow control was based on numbers ( not necessarily consecutive ) inserted at the beginning of statements in combination with GOTO , IF , and DO statements , but with some particularly interesting variants : a GOTO statement let you list a variable number of line destinations that control would branch to based on whether the value of a particular integer was 1 , 2 , 3 , or so forth ( not unlike a switch statement ) .
The IF statement had three destinations depending on whether the result of a particular calculation was less than zero , zero , or greater than zero .
FORTRAN 's type statements used the keywords INTEGER , REAL , DOUBLE PRECISION , COMPLEX , and LOGICAL ( i.e. , Boolean ) .
However , FORTRAN also supported implicit typing based on the first letter of the variable name .
In particular , variables beginning with the letters I , J , K , L , M , or N were assumed to be integers ; variables beginning with other letters were reals .
( Sammet , p. 166-7 ) I could be wrong , but I believe that this is the origin of the custom of using variables named i , j , and k in for loops in C - family languages today .
At least it was for me .
At Stevens Tech we programmed in FORTRAN using punched cards .
The card - punching room and the DEC PDP - 10 were in the basement of the library .
You 'd punch your cards and hand them to one of the gurus behind the counter who ran the computer , who would quickly riffle through the deck and say something snotty like " Well , I see a few syntax errors in there but let 's run it through anyway . "
You 'd come back later to pick up the paper output .
A big stack of paper was particularly shameful because it usually indicated some kind of weird error that caused some ungodly loop that had to be manually shut down by one of the gurus .
The basement of the library also had some teletype terminals , but their use was restricted to members of the ACM .
The terminals were in a special room , and their users often wore demented hypnotized grins as they communicated directly with the computer .
It was n't just students who punched cards , though .
Sometimes you 'd see a professor in there doing some kind of research project , usually with a particularly huge deck of cards .
I did n't much like programming in my first encounter with it in my freshman year .
I had two more occasions to use the computer at Stevens Tech : I took a PDP - 10 assembly language course with a horrifying textbook written and self - published by our professor with the title Meet MACRO - 10 , and I remember that course being a complete mystery to me .
A course in numerical analysis also involved some FORTRAN programming , but only as a variation of the traditional approaches .
When I graduated in 1975 with a degree in mathematics , I got a job at New York Life Insurance Company as an Actuarial Student .
New York Life had a big IBM 370 - based system that did all the billing and other processing .
But the actuaries did their statistical analysis jobs either with calculators ( the incredibly beautiful and unbelievably noisy Friden was still in use at the time but was steadily being replaced with small electronic calculators ) or a hand - me - down computer , the IBM 1130 .
The language , of course , was FORTRAN , and I was soon punching up cards and looking at paper output from that machine .
The 1130 had 32 K ( or was it 16 K ? ) of " core " memory , which made large arrays difficult .
If you wanted to use large arrays , you 'd basically create a file for that specific purpose .
I remember being called upon to revamp a FORTRAN program written by another actuarial student a few years earlier .
The program was particularly hard to decipher because she had decided to name all her variables after fruits , such as APPLE , PEAR , BANANA , and so forth .
Not all the actuaries were in favor of moving their calculations to computers .
I remember one actuary telling me how only if you did compound - interest and present - value calculations by hand ( that is , using a calculator ) could you really get an intuitive feel for the ways and patterns in which the numbers grew .
I did n't actually begin to enjoy programming until the later years of the 1970s , when the non-IT programmers at New York Life were allowed to use the company 's IBM 370 via TSO terminals and a glorious programming language named PL / I .
The modern block - structure of PL / I and the interactivity of TSO ( despite its notorious slow speed ) made the whole programming experience much more pleasurable .
At the same time , I was getting into computers at home by designing and building electronic music instruments .
By the late 1970s , I was building a Z - 80 based machine that controlled a digital electronic music synthesizer and programming it in assembly language .
But FORTRAN was my first programming language , and in many senses , the first programming language .
Interestingly , in its early design , the elegance of the FORTRAN language was considered much less important than the efficiency of the compiler :
Before 1954 almost all programming was done in machine language or assembly language .
Programmers rightly regarded their work as a complex , creative art that required human inventiveness to produce an efficient program .
Much of their effort was devoted to overcoming the difficulties created by the computers of that era : the lack of index registers , the lack of built - in floating point operations , restricted instruction sets ... , and primitive input - output arrangements ....
But the advent of the [ IBM ] 704 with built in floating point and indexing radically altered the situation .
The 704 presented a double challenge to those who wanted to simplify programming ; first , it removed the raison d'être of earlier systems by providing in hardware the operations they existed to provide ; second , it increased the problem of generating efficient programs by an order of magnitude by speeding up floating point operations by a factor of ten and thereby leaving inefficiencies nowhere to hide ....
It was our belief that if FORTRAN , during its first months , were to translate any reasonable " scientific " source program into an object program only half as fast as its hand coded counterpart , then acceptance of our system would be in serious danger .
This belief caused us to regard the design of the translator as the real challenge , not the simple task of designing the language ....

Cochlear Implant Electrode
Cybernetic senses have been the subject of science fiction for decades .
The idea of using sophisticated technology to repair damaged bodies , or even to enhance normal ones , has a tremendous appeal – but how far have we progressed towards that goal ?
In some ways , we ’ve gotten amazingly far .
Cochlear implants are now a normal – if controversial – treatment for deafness .
They substitute for damaged or missing portions of the inner ear , gathering and processing sound .
The first generation of cochlear implants provided only a distant approximation of sound , making them of limited usefulness , particularly for understanding speech sounds .
Even the more sophisticated models of today have yet to approach the functionality of a normal ear , though they are far more useful than their predecessors .
While those dealing with cybernetic hearing seem to have decided upon their basic approach , dealing with lost vision is a different ball game .
Several different research groups , using various methods , are attempting to produce cybernetic vision .
Some , like cochlear implants , seek to replace a malfunctioning part .
Others are attempting to produce something entirely new that will nonetheless function as vision .
One of the projects that is furthest along is using exactly that kind of substitution .
Rather than attempting to somehow re-engineer the eye , the vOICe system ( Oh , I see ) is using sound to bypass the eyes altogether and substituting the ears in their stead .
The vOICe system was developed by Dr. Peter Meijer – a senior researcher with Philip Research Laboratories ( a Netherlands based company ) .
It uses a computer program , a pair of video - sunglasses ( sunglasses with a small video camera on the bridge ) , and a pair of stereo earphones to provide an auditory image of the world .
Scanning left - to - right , once a second , the program translates the images seen by the camera into coded sound for the user to interpret .
The format is fairly simple – louder sounds mean brighter , higher pitch means that something is higher up in the visual field , and so forth .
Learning to translate the sounds into visual meaning is another task altogether .
Users of the device liken it to learning a foreign language .
As with a foreign language , the more the vOICe system is used , the more quickly the user gains facility .
Most users appear to start the learning process with a set of images on a computer screen ( available as a free download off the Internet ) , and then progress to using the mobile system .
The amount of information that can be distinguished even by a novice user is fairly impressive .
Within a week of starting use , at least one congenitally blind woman was reporting being able to distinguish walls , stairs , and windows in her house , as well as whether the lights were on or not .
The vOICe website reports that a trained user can distinguish approximately 1000 to 4000 pixels per 1 second scan .
Comparatively speaking , an average sighted person can identify visual objects in an image of 32×32 pixels – or about 1024 pixels .
In what may be the most interesting part of the vOICe system , its constant use seems to cause a sort of induced synesthesia in the user – a cross- wiring of the senses , where input from one sense is perceived in another .
Brain plasticity – the ability of the brain to rearrange itself in response to demand – seems to come into play , as the brain sorts auditory input into visual data .
Some previously sighted vOICe users report consistent visual responses comparable to blurry or foggy vision , while their awareness of the sounds themselves recedes into the background .
Users who have been blind from birth obviously cannot compare their experiences to a previous experience of vision , but they too seem to rapidly stop processing the vOICe input as auditory data .
32 x 32 pixel image
While the results so far are exciting , there are a few downsides to the vOICe system .
Since distinguishing the auditory landscapes requires good hearing , the system is not going to work well , if at all , for someone with any sort of hearing impairment .
Additionally there is some concern that the headphones and the sounds produced by the system could interfere with normal hearing function while the system is in use .
However , the difference in how the brain processes the vOICe data seems to enable less interference between the competing sounds than one might imagine , with some users reporting being able to use the system while sewing , listening to TV , or even listening to music .
Slow scanning speed is likely to be the most difficult problem to improve .
While retinal or brain implants ( neither yet available for general use , but under investigation ) allow scanning the visual field between four and eight times a second , the vOICe scan is only once a second – a fairly slow pace for interacting with the world while moving , but dictated by the need for the user to process the sounds .
The brain seems to be able to compensate , though , and the vOICe users have few complaints about slow updating speed .
The last major limitation is that of current technology .
While the system is portable , the need to carry a laptop , and wear a video camera and earphones does use up some carrying capacity .
The limitations of the laptop battery also make venturing forth for long periods of time problematic .
These problems will ease with time though .
Even in the short time the vOICe has been available , new and smaller devices have become available for each of the system components .
A major plus for the system is the ease of upgrading as newer technology comes on - line .
Since the system is physically separate from the user , upgrading is as simple as buying the new equipment and integrating it .
Upgrading a retinal implant , let alone a chip in the brain , is a much trickier proposition .
As promising as it is , the vOICe system is far from the last word in cybernetically enhanced vision .
Brain implants , retinal implants , and devices that translate visual imagery to touch are all under active investigation .
Thus far vOICe seems to have a clear lead by utility , by its lack of invasiveness , and even by cost , but who ’s to say which of the other contenders may surpass it tomorrow ?
Story Highlights • Biden warns secretary of state against cross - border raids
• Hagel makes comparison to bombing of Cambodia during Vietnam War
• Rice says president will do what 's necessary to protect troops
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush 's warnings to Iran and Syria to not interfere in Iraq and the arrest of six Iranians in Iraq by U.S. troops raised eyebrows Thursday on Capitol Hill , where senators warned Bush against widening the nearly four - year - old war .
Sen . Joseph Biden , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , warned Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that Bush did not have the authority to send U.S. troops on cross - border raids .
" I believe the present authorization granted the president to use force in Iraq does not cover that , and he does need congressional authority to do that , " Biden , D - Delaware , said during a Thursday hearing on Iraq .
" I just want to set that marker . "
( Watch heated exchanges between Rice and several senators )
Rice did not directly reply to Biden 's remark , but she said the country expects Bush " to do what is necessary to protect our forces . "
Biden sent a follow - up letter to the White House after Thursday 's hearing , calling on Bush to explain his position .
In his Wednesday night speech announcing the deployment of more than 20,000 additional troops to Iraq , Bush blamed Iraq 's neighbors for stoking the violence there and accused Iran in particular of " providing material support for attacks on American troops . "
( Watch how the plan will work )
" We will disrupt the attacks on our forces .
We 'll interrupt the flow of support from Iran and Syria .
And we will seek out and destroy the networks providing advanced weaponry and training to our enemies in Iraq , " he said .
Sen . Chuck Hagel , R - Nebraska , said Rice 's responses had echoes of the debate over the Vietnam War , when the Nixon administration denied U.S. troops were conducting raids into neighboring Cambodia to stop the flow of weapons to South Vietnam 's communist insurgency .
Hagel , a veteran of that war , called Bush 's plan " the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam . "

" When our government lied to the American people and said we did n't cross the border going into Cambodia , in fact we did .
I happen to know something about that , as do some on this committee , " he said .
" Madame Secretary , when you set in motion the kind of policy that the president is talking about here , it 's very , very dangerous . "
Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the House Armed Services Committee that U.S. troops are trying to crack down on the spread of Iranian - supplied explosives into Iraq , and the administration is " making it clear that those who are involved in activities that cost the lives of American soldiers are going to be subject to actions on the part of the United States inside Iraq . "
Gen . Peter Pace , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told reporters that " we can take care of the security for our troops by doing the business we need to do inside of Iraq . "
Thursday , U.S. troops in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil detained six Iranians " suspected of being closely tied to activities targeting Iraqi and coalition forces , " a military statement said .
Iran and the Kurdish regional government called for their release .

Recent decisions by the president could suggest that the administration is giving Syria and Iran more attention .
The president announced that he had ordered a second aircraft carrier battle group to the Persian Gulf and would share Patriot air - defense missile systems with U.S. allies in the region .
Furthermore , the choice of a Navy officer , Adm . William Fallon , was Bush 's pick to lead U.S. forces in the Middle East has raised speculation that operations in the Persian Gulf will take on greater importance .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told CNN that Bush 's condemnation of what she called " Iran 's meddlesomeness " was an important signal to the region .
" Surely the United States is not the one being threatening , " she said .
" We are not the ones being meddlesome and troublesome in Iraq . "
Throughout the process , the Bush administration has stuck to its refusal to consider direct talks with Iran and Syria in an effort to resolve the war , as the bipartisan Iraq Study Group recommended in December .
Rice said talks with Tehran and Damascus over Iraq " put us in the role of supplicant " while Washington is trying to pressure Iran to halt uranium enrichment and get Syria to stop leaning on Lebanon 's pro-Western government .
" Do we really believe that the Iranians are going to treat Iraq over here and not demand that we do something to alleviate the pressure that we are now bringing on their nuclear program and their nuclear ambitions ?
I do n't think it 's going to happen , " she said .
Jeralyn at TalkLeft is cautious about the prospects for the Rove investigation .
Before you get too excited , let 's look at who 's in charge of the investigation .
It 's Scott Bloch , a Bush appointee who 's been under investigation himself .
Bloch , a Kansas lawyer who served at the Justice Department 's Task Force for Faith - based and Community Initiatives , was appointed by President Bush three years ago .
Since he took the helm in 2004 , staffers at the OSC , a small agency of about 100 lawyers and investigators , have accused him of a range of offenses , from having an anti-gay bias to criticizing employees for wearing short skirts and tight pants to work .
Not to throw cold water on this potentially interesting development in the political life of Karl Rove , but do n't expect too much from this crowd .
Jeralyn sums it up perfectly with a quote from David Corn :
It is a dizzying situation .
The investigator investigating officials who oversee the agency that is investigating the investigator .
Forget firewalls .
This looks more like a basement flooded with backed - up sewage -- with the water rising .
Update : Justin Rood at ABC's The Blotter has more :
WASHINGTON , Sept. 6 ( UPI ) -- U.S. policymakers and forces in Iraq are now adrift in a complex , many - sided war and the democratic political system that was the centerpiece of U.S. strategy is collapsing before Washington 's eyes .
Mahmoud al - Mashadani , the speaker of the Iraqi parliament , warned deputies Wednesday morning they might only have three or four months to prevent the irreversible collapse of their country and its splintering into mutually hostile religious and ethnic enclaves .
' We have three to four months to reconcile , " he said .
" If the country does n't survive , it goes under . "

Mashadani's warning came the day after the parliament voted to continue the emergency powers of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki for another month and as violence and terror continued to erupt on all sides .
Applying a relatively rational analysis , several overlapping conflicts are currently raging simultaneously in Iraq .
First , the long - running , three - and - a - half - year - old Sunni insurgency against U.S , forces and the new Iraqi government continues unabated in two western provinces and in the capital Baghdad .
As our companion " Iraq Benchmarks " has confirmed , despite other conflicts erupting one very side the Sunni insurgents have been able to keep up their level of attrition attacks and rates of inflicting casualties on U.S , forces through this year .
Second , since the bombing of the al - Askariya , or Golden Mosque , in Samara in Feb , 22 , Shiite militia forces have reacted with much greater force against the general Sunni community , launching campaigns of random killings .
The focus of this conflict has been also in and around Baghdad , and in central provinces with mixed Sunni and Shiite populations .

Third , at the prompting of U.S , leaders and military commanders , the shaky new Iraqi army -- intended to eventually function at a full strength of 10 divisions -- has launched a series of campaigns against some of the Shiite militias , especially Moqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi army , to try and get them under control .
However , the performance of regular Iraqi forces , who are generally Shiite commanded and dominated by Shiites , has so far been very disappointing and in some recent clashes they have had to rely on the Badr Brigades , another Shiite irregular militia force , for support .
Therefore , far from asserting the control and credibility of the regular Iraqi army over the Shiite militias as U.S. commanders intended , the recent campaigns have weakened its standing still further and made it appear a mere cats - paw in a fourth struggle , that between the Mahdi Army , and the Badr Brigade , with other quasi- independent Shiite militias either allied to them or watching closely to see which of them comes out on top .
Nor do these four conflicts -- the Sunni insurgency against U.S. and allied forces , the Sunni -Shiite conflict , the Iraqi army battle with the Shiite militias and the internal struggles between the Shiite militias -- exhaust the number of potential conflicts in Iraq .
The Kurds look likely to try and fully secede from the central government in Baghdad and that could open up a new conflict between them and the Shiite dominated Maliki government .
In addition , anti-American Shiite militias led by the Mahdi Army could erupt in revolt at any time against U.S. forces as well as the Maliki government and threaten to cut the crucial overland supply route from Kuwait to Central Iraq that is essential to provision the 140,000 U.S. troops in the country .
At least , this last threat appears to have receded partially following the halting of Israeli military operations against the Shiite Hezbollah , or Party of God , in southern Lebanon .

The Middle East has seen no conflict as many - sided and complicated as this since the Lebanon civil war from 1975 / 6 through 1991 .
The reasons for that similarity and the implications to be drawn from it are very alarming .
The main parallel is that the complexity , longevity and high cost in human life of the Lebanese civil war were primarily caused by the collapse of the central government and the inability of the warring parties to agree on creating a new one .
That condition already exists in Iraq , where the Mailiki 's government is effectively helplessly outside the heavily defended Green Zone in the heart of Baghdad .
It is not even master of significant enclaves outside the Green Zone in its own capital .
The lesson to be drawn from this ongoing condition is that the many - sided Iraqi conflict , like the Lebanese one before it , is already so intractable that it is almost certain to last for many years at the cost of scores of thousands more lives , most of them innocent civilians , just as the Lebanese one did .
The total death toll of the Lebanon civil war is believed to have run as high as 150,000 people , most of them in the more intense , early years of the conflict .
That level of suffering and deaths no longer appears inconceivable in Iraq , even while U.S. troops remain in the country .
The number of people killed in militia clashes , attacks on regular armed forces and inter-ethnic reprisal killings and massacres is already put at around 100 a day and it has been running at that level for at least two or three months .
Years of killing at that level would produce more than 36,000 dead -- a bloodbath easily on the Lebanese scale .

In the Bible , the prophet Habakkuk warns sinners that if they do not change their ways , " the
Violence of Lebanon " shall engulf them .
That curse seems to have already overtaken the 28 million people of Iraq .
A Sign , a Flipped Structure , and a Scientific Flameout of Epic Proportions
update : fixed some typos , thanks to the comments
One of the most spectacular flameouts in science happened last year .
In a short letter ( barely over 300 words long ) published in Science in the very last issue of 2006 , Geoffrey Chang , a crystallographer , retracted 3 Science articles , a Nature article , a PNAS article and a JMB article .
The sum of 5 years of work was destroyed , apparently , over a single sign error in a data - processing program .
Geoffrey Chang was one of the youngest faculty member at the Scripps Institute , La Jolla .
Winner of a slew of prestigious awards , he had made his name solving the crystal structure of the MsbA protein , a membrane protein , arguably the most difficult type of protein to crystalize , due to the greasy nature of the trans - membrane surface of the protein .
The story reads like a pulp science novel .
A rising star , Geoffrey Chang solves a number of immensely difficult problem .
A former labmate ( from the days when Chang worked in the Rees lab ) Kaspar Locher , now a scientist at the ETH Zurich Institue in Switzerland , solves a similar crystal structure , except that his crystal structure had a helix that was flipped over 180 degrees .
Locher published his own paper in Nature , in 2006 , setting alarm bells ringing .
Just by looking at the flip , Locher realized that his former labmate 's structure contained a phasing error .
An error that was " in the category of monumental blunders , " said Locher in an interview with Science .
From what I 've read , it seems to be a genuinely honest mistake on Chang 's part .
Although some commentators think that the reviewers in Science should have caught the error , I do n't think the reviewers should be held accountable .
Reviewers can catch relatively straightforward calculation mistakes , but the truth of the matter is that when we review articles , we take a lot of things on faith .
What we can do as reviewers , is look for methodological soundness , and apply our hard - earned intuition on the results .
Still it 's instructive to look at the nature of the error , as quoted in the retraction :
An in - house data reduction program introduced a change in sign for anomalous differences .
This program , which was not part of a conventional data processing package , converted the anomalous pairs ( I+ and I - ) to ( F - and F+ ) , thereby introducing a sign change .
A single sign change in the data - processing program .
And an in - house program at that .
This should send chills up the spine of every computational biologist out there .
Do n't get me wrong , I am not questioning the use of in - house software .
After all , in - house software is the bread and butter of all working computational biologists .
Still , Chang explained that the in - house program was legacy software inherited from a neighboring lab .
What this should flag is the necessity to aggressively test all the software that you write .
One method is to apply a unit - testing methodology to your software .
Even on programs that are written by someone else ( a clever grad student in my last lab found many bugs in AMBER , a huge third - party molecular dynamics program ) .
Eeeep !
In a later interview with The Scientist , Chang said , " I deeply apologize to those that used the old structures to come up with results that are incorrect , " Chang said .
" I feel pretty bad about that . "
This is a severe understatement .
Due to the influential nature of Chang 's 2001 paper , major grants have been awarded and denied in the study of the MsbA protein , based on the compatibility with the crystal structure .
From the science news article ,
David Clarke of the University of Toronto in Canada says his team had a hard time persuading journals to accept their biochemical studies that contradicted Chang 's MsbA structure .
Clarke also served on grant panels on which he says Chang 's work was influential .
" Those applications providing preliminary results that were not in agreement with the retracted papers were given a rough time , " he says .
I 've heard on the grapevine that Chang is a somewhat aggressive character , and he had dismissed the work of biochemists working in the field of MsbA .
Maybe he should not have been so dismissive after all .
The moral to be drawn from the story is that crystallographers ought to pay very careful attention to what biochemists say about their proteins .
What comes to mind is the ATP Synthase , the work for which won the 1997 Nobel Prize .
One of the winners was John E. Walker , the crystallographer who solved this massive structure .
What should n't be forgetten is that one of the other winners was Paul E. Boyer , who figured out from biochemical analyses , a full 20 years earlier , much of the mechanism of how ATPase works – the existence of 6 subnits , made up of alternating domains , and how the binding site must be in the interface between the subunits .
This mechanism was subsequently confirmed by Walker 's crystal structure .
Crystallography , like any other scientific discipline , does not operate in a vacuum , and only in the interstices between disciplines , can the truth be found .
When people see violent or erotic images , they fail to process whatever they see next , according to new research .
Scientists are calling the effect " attentional rubbernecking . "
“ We observed that people fail to detect visual images that appeared one - fifth of a second after emotional images , whereas they can detect those images with little problem after viewing neutral images , ” said Vanderbilt University psychologist David Zald .
The effect is akin to rubbernecking on the highway , Zald and his colleagues say .
Your brain might suggest you watch the road ahead , but your emotions force you to look at the accident on the side of the road .
Research subjects were handed a stack of pictures that included pleasant landscapes and architectural photos .
They were told to search for a particular image .
Negative images were placed anywhere from two to eight spots before the search target .
The closer the negative image was to the target picture , the more frequently people failed to spot the target .
In a follow - up study , negative images were replaced by erotic shots .
The effect was the same .
" This suggests that emotionally arousing images impact attention in similar ways whether they are perceived as positive or negative , " said colleague Steven Most of Yale University .
The researchers suspect we can't control the effect .
" We think that there is essentially a bottleneck for information processing and if a certain type of stimulus captures attention , it can basically jam up that bottleneck so subsequent information can't get through , " Zald said .
As for rubbernecking on the road , Zald has a caution :
" If you are simply driving down the road and you see something that is sexually explicit on a billboard , the odds are that it is going to capture your attention and – for a fraction of a second afterwards – you will be less able to pay attention to other information in your environment , " he said .
The initial study is detailed in the August issue of the journal Psychonomic Bulletin and Review .
The follow - up research has not been published .

Space - Shot.com Announces Launch - $ 3 Internet Skill - Game Wins Trip to Space
Press Release From : SpaceShot , Inc .
Posted : Monday , April 3 , 2006
Space - Shot.com announced today the launch of their much anticipated internet skill - game , offering winners a trip to space aboard a Rocketplane .
The game costs three dollars for an entry , and is conducted in a tournament style .
SpaceShot 's new game represents a new era both in private space travel and online gaming .
" I am proud to announce that space travel is now open to all people ! " said SpaceShot founder Sam Dinkin .
" This product will appeal to those who always wanted to go to space , but do n't have the deep pockets to buy their way . "
The space industry is a rapidly evolving business .
The private sector is pushing hard to sell space travel to wealthy adventurers .
For $ 20 million one can embark on a flight to the International Space Station , and for $ 100 million you will soon be able to buy a flight around the Moon .
Virgin Galactic is planning to charge hundreds of thousands of dollars for a ride into sub-orbital space .
However , SpaceShot founder Sam Dinkin wants to open space up to all classes of people , not just the most wealthy .
" When I was a child , we were promised space would be for everyone , " said Dinkin .
" SpaceShot will be the first to deliver on that promise . "
SpaceShot Players compete in a skill game predicting the daily high temperature for Central Park , New York City .
The game is held in a tournament style format ; predict better than your opponent and you advance .
Players enter additional predictions for daily low , precipitation and humidity as tie - breakers .
This continues through a multiple round tournament format until there is only one winner .
These winners will be the next team of civilian astronauts .
The initial grand prizes are suborbital flights from Rocketplane Ltd. Rocketplane is based in Oklahoma and has invested over $ 40 million in designing , building and testing a Learjet - based suborbital spaceplane .
They won approval of $ 13 million in R&D investment tax credits from the State of Oklahoma , and expect an FAA launch license as well as test flights to begin in at Spaceport Oklahoma in 2007 .
Paying passenger flights are expected in summer 2007 .
SpaceShot has contracted for hundreds of seats worth tens of millions of dollars .
Every spaceflight won requires the exact same number of players so the more people who play , the more often a spaceflight will be awarded .
SpaceShot , Inc. is a Texas corporation bringing the hope of space travel to people of all means .
http://www.space-shot.com hosts tournament style games of skill with space travel prizes .

On April 15th CNN's John Roberts falsely implied on " Late Edition " that the proposed Feingold - Reid bill would “ cut off the funds in the middle of a war ” for “ troops in the field . ”
In response , Senator Feingold sent Roberts a letter ( .pdf ) correcting the record and appeared on " American Morning " yesterday to confront him about his misleading characterization .
Download Download
" But I want to repeat , this involves not taking away one thing from the troops in the field , and that 's the reason I wanted to come on this show , to make that absolutely clear . "
It 's really a shame that Feingold decided against a Presidential run .
He 's ahead of the curve on every single issue and truly " gets it . "
When President Bush was caught violating FISA , it was Feingold who took a stand for the Constitution and proposed taking the modest step of censuring the President ( and was shunned by nearly everyone in Congress -- including Democrats ) .
It also would have been nice to see him at last night 's debate .
There 's no doubt in my mind he would have blown everyone out of the water .
Glenn wrote a fantastic post last November explaining why the Beltway class can't comprehend the Russ Feingolds of the world .
You know things are bad when something 's value is predicated by its standing in the Google search rankings , but that 's exactly what 's happening down at the Cornish town of Penryn - apparently consigned to oblivion by Intel 's chip of the same name .
This is Cornwall explains : " A week ago , typing Penryn into the Google search engine ... would have immediately brought up information about the Cornish town in the top position .
But now Penryn is slipping down the ratings as hordes of computer users around the world click on to find out more information about the new range of Intel computer processors . "
Oh dear .
Kevin Pickup , big cheese down at i-webmarketing , " a Cornish company which helps firms optimise their search engine position " , explained the possible apocalyptic implications of the cyber- relegation : " This is going to be a huge problem for Penryn businesses .
Although the chip is n't even on the market yet , there 's already a huge buzz .
Web pages relating to the Intel Penryn are starting to displace local businesses in the search results .
" As people who search the internet rarely look past the first couple of pages of results , the Cornish websites will effectively disappear from search engines . "
Of course , Intel will rename Penryn ( the chip ) in due course , but that could come too late for Penryn ( the town ) .
Pickup continued : " Even if they announce a new name , it will take up to a year for it to come off the placements .
Businesses need to look at their keywords and maybe change a few things . "
Intel has moved quickly to assure Penrynians that they will not be forced to shut up shop and move to a more Google - prominent location .
The UK's Intel marketing manager Chris Hogg offered : " It 's just a codename that we 're using - we have no plans whatsoever to use it as a brand .
Once we start using the official product name , people will quickly stop using the codename .
Cornwall is one of my favourite holiday destinations and I think Penryn is a delightful town . " ®
Next week , Bush is going to visit the State Department and the Pentagon to consult with them on " the way forward " .
He has n't made a final decision yet on the way forward ( more on this later ) , but the three most likely future paths from which he will choose are already known .
The major alternatives include a short - term surge of 15,000 to 30,000 additional U.S. troops to secure Baghdad and accelerate the training of Iraqi forces .
Another strategy would redirect the U.S. military away from the internal strife to focus mainly on hunting terrorists affiliated with al - Qaeda .
And the third would concentrate political attention on supporting the majority Shiites and abandon U.S. efforts to reach out to Sunni insurgents .
So , Bush is going to say our strategy will be one of the following :
(1) More American troops .
Fight insurgents .
Secure Baghdad .
Train Iraqi troops .
(2) Stop fighting the insurgents .
Go after Al Qaeda .
(3) Side with the Shiites .
Notice anything ?
What I notice , first , about these three options is how they seem to have no common theme .
Bush is going to give a major talk in ( checking watch ) nine days about the future of the American troop presence in Iraq , the defining policy of not just his Presidency but of American foriegn policy in the 21st Century . . . and he 's still trying to decide , at a very basic level , what the hell we 're doing there .
Are we siding with the Shiites , or not ?
Are we going after Al Qaeda , or not ?
Should we be fighting the insurgents , or not ?
Bush is trying to figure out which of those reasons is why we 're in Iraq .
And he 'll tell us in time for Christmas .
Well . . . shit ; it 's not a Playstation 3 but I guess it 's better than nothing .
Now . . . back that to that thing I said I 'd get back to :
Bush will devote most of next week to his Iraq review .
He plans to visit the State Department on Monday to consult with his foreign policy team , then he will host independent Iraq experts in the Oval Office .
The next day , he will hold a videoconference with U.S. military commanders and U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad in Iraq .
He will travel to the Pentagon for more consultations on Wednesday .
That 's how Bush is going to get ready for the hoo - daddy Dec. 18th speech .
Do you notice anything the slightest bit odd about that paragraph ?
I do .
Take a minute .
Think about it .
What 's odd is that this must be exactly what Bush 's people told the reporters .
" He 's going to visit the State Department .
He 's going to visit the Pentagon .
He 's going to teleconference with Khalizad . "
Obvious question : why ?
Why is Bush going to " travel to the Pentagon . " ?
Why is he going to " visit the State Department " ?
Is n't that a rather absurd way for the President to be getting advice ?
Obvious answer :
So he can say in his Dec. 18 speech : " I travelled to the Pentagon .
I visited the State Department .
I teleconferenced with Khalizad . "
Bush 's people are going to shuttle him around to these places , where he 'll sit , bored , and say stuff every now then , when Condi nudges him .
And there will be cameras taking pictures .
Pictures pictures pictures .
Which , I take it , is the real point of this charade : to show Bush in action .
All of which will cloud the astonishing fact that Bush 's three options have no common theme .
The Washington Post story where I got these quotes starts like this :
As pressure mounts for a change of course in Iraq , the Bush administration is groping for a viable new strategy for the president to unveil by Christmas , with deliberations now focused on three main options to redefine the U.S. military and political engagement , according to officials familiar with the debate .
" Groping for a viable new strategy . . . "
But that 's not right , he 's not groping for a strategy to achieve a previously established goal .
Look at the options again .
He 's groping for a goal .
He 's going to tell us about Iraq on Dec. 18 , and as of now he 's shopping for a reason why we 're there .
Shinga at Breath Spa for Kids continued her investigation into the Allergy UK 's promotion of food allergies and intolerance in the UK with an excellent post “ On Wanting to Vent My Rage Following Sloppy Journalism : Food Allergy and Intolerance . ”
This is such an important issue that affects every aspect of health and well - being and I would like to expound upon it and add the American perspective .
You may remember that Allergy UK , as part of their Food Allergy and Intolerance Week , released the results of a survey , The Stolen Lives Report .
In it , Muriel Simmons , Chief Executive of Allergy UK wrote :
It is generally accepted that 2 % of the population suffer from IgE - mediated food allergy and anything up to 45 % suffer from some form of food intolerance .
In our survey of 5,200 people it emerged that 59 % of the people responding reported regarding themselves as having a food intolerance and 41 % considered that they had classical food allergy .
So more than half of the population is supposed to be suffering from intolerances to food , with their symptoms even appearing two days after eating the offending food .
The symptoms attributed to food intolerance , according to Allergy UK , include :
Aches and pains 6.1 %
Bloating , indigestion , diarrhea 19.7 %
Rashes 5.7 %
Lethargy and anxiety 11.9 %
Coughing and wheezing 8 %
Headaches 5.6 %
Runny or stuffy nose 6 %
Suffering more than one symptom 37 %
THE GERMAN PUBLIC was recently shocked to learn that 30 % of “ their ” women are childless -- the highest proportion of any country in the world .
And this is not a result of infertility ; it ’s intentional childlessness .
Demographers are intrigued .
German nationalists , aghast .
Religious fundamentalists , distressed at the indication that large numbers of women are using birth control .
And evolutionary biologists ( including me ) are asked , “ How can this be ? ”
If reproduction is perhaps the fundamental imperative of natural selection , of our genetic heritage , is n’t it curious -- indeed , counterintuitive -- that people choose , and in such large numbers , to refrain from participating in life ’s most pressing event ?
The answer is that intentional childlessness is indeed curious -- but in no way surprising .
It is also illuminating , because it sheds light on what is perhaps the most notable hallmark of the human species : the ability to say no -- not just to a bad idea , an illegal order or a wayward pet but to our own genes .

When it comes to human behavior , there are actually very few genetic dictates .
Our hearts insist on beating , our lungs breathing , our kidneys filtering and so forth , but these internal - organ functions are hardly “ behavior ” in a meaningful sense .
As for more complex activities , evolution whispers within us .
It does not shout orders .
People are inclined to eat when hungry , sleep when tired and have sex when aroused .
But in most cases , we remain capable of declining , endowed as we are with that old bugaboo , free will .
Moreover , when people indulge their biologically based inclinations , nearly always it is to satisfy an immediate itch , whose existence is itself an evolved strategy leading to some naturally selected payoff .
A person does n’t typically eat , for example , with the goal of meeting her metabolic needs but to satisfy her hunger , which is a benevolent evolutionary trick that induces the food - deprived to help out their metabolism .
For more than 99.99 % of their evolutionary history , humans have n’t had the luxury of deciding whether to reproduce : simply engaging in sex took care of that , just as eating solved the problem of nutrition .
But then something quite wonderful arrived on the scene : birth control .
Because of it , women ( and men ) can exercise choice and , if they wish , save themselves the pain , risk and inconvenience of childbearing and child - rearing , indulging themselves rather than their genetic posterity .
Add to this another important observation from nature .
Behavioral ecologists distinguish between what are known as “ r ” and “ K ” strategies among living things .
Thus , “ r ” strategists -- such as mice and rabbits -- breed early and often , producing large numbers of offspring that suffer high mortality .
“ K ” types -- such as elephants and whales -- breed later and relatively rarely , producing fewer offspring ( with lower mortality ) and investing more in each .
Neither elephants nor whales send their children to college , although they indulge in the animal equivalent .
Advertisement
Pretechnological human beings are comparatively “ r ” in their reproductive style .
But with improved socioeconomic conditions -- especially , better educational and vocational opportunities for women -- comes the demographic transition , whereby “ r ” gives way to “ K , ” and infant mortality plummets along with birthrate .
There also arises a tendency to take especially good care of the fewer children one produces , as well as a greater inclination to look out for No. 1 , sometimes -- horror of horrors ! -- by producing no children at all .
It happens over and over , from Nigeria to Nicaragua .
Even the already low birthrates in developed countries become lower still when each child is expected to be outfitted with an iPod and yoga lessons , not to mention a personal trainer .
It is notable that child - wariness is not only characteristic of highly developed Germany ( and northern Europe as a whole ) , but that it rises from 30 % to more than 40 % among German women who are college graduates .
When it comes to our behavior , evolution is clearly influential .
Of this there can be no doubt .
But only rarely is it determinative , even when something as deeply biological as reproduction is concerned .
Indeed , the trend toward childlessness is neither particularly German nor strangely “ un-biological ” but profoundly human .
Python String Functions
What use are python function decorators ?
Here is something fun : we can use them for speedy string templates .
What follows is a further development of the templet python string - template idea .
I find these techniques useful when building HTML and XML pages .
Here is a @stringfunction function decorator :
from templet import stringfunction @stringfunction def poem( jumper , jumpee = " moon " ) :
" The $ jumper jumped over the $ jumpee . "
The @stringfunction decorator transforms " poem " into the following function :
def poem( jumper , jumpee = " moon " ) : out = [ ] out .
append ( " The " ) out.append( str( jumper ) ) out.append ( " jumped over the " ) out.append( str( jumpee ) ) out.append ( " . " ) return ''.join ( out )
The decorator saves quite a bit of typing !
In this implementation of @stringfunction , handy $ {...} and $ {{ ... }} syntax allows us to embed arbitrary python code , so we can make our templates as powerful as we need them to be .
If we want to introduce complicated logic , our code can use " out.append ( text ) " to build up the string by hand .
The templates we get this way have all their parameters nicely - declared so they are easy - to - call and so misspellings get caught .
These function templates are also far faster than the most popular template solutions , benchmarking more than four times faster than Django templates , python 's string .
Template templates , or the v1 templet classes .
And we can use them by importing just one small python module , with no hacking of the import path mechanism or other major surgery .
Does Python Need Standard Templates ?
One of the reasons for Ruby 's popularity is that there is a simple , natural - feeling templating sytem that is part of the ruby standard library .
ERB goes beyond simple substitution , and gives you a way to embed ruby in a string .
Python 's built in %- string interpolation and string .
Template do n't go far enough , because they provide no clean solution for composition and control flow .
The first time you find yourself going through the parameters of a long and complicated % , trying to figure out which ones need to be cgi.escaped and which ones do n't , you will know what I mean .
In 2007 , we know that sometimes you really do want some code inside your strings , and that model - view religion should not be an orthodoxy .
In the Python world , we have Django templates , Cheetah , and other solutions that have tried to fill the gap .
But , to my taste , none of these systems feel minimal , simple , or particularly natural for python .
When I am doing weekend hacking and need a quick HTML UI , I do n't really want to introduce a big templating package or a new language with unfamiliar syntax like {{ var|foo : " bar " }} .
I just want to be able to put some python in my strings .
A Longer Example
The base - class based template approach I previously discussed is very natural for building HTML UI , but its use of exec ( and unbound variables ) during template expansion makes it slightly slower than other template solutions .
The decorator approach is much faster .
It is also almost as nice for large templates .
Here is a longer example that shows @stringfunction being used in a slightly less trivial context , with a little bit of code and composition :
from templet import stringfunction import cgi #
An example bit of data to display class Favorites Info : def __init__ ( self , user ) : self.user = user self .
favorites = [ ] def add Favorite ( self , url , description =None ) : self.favorites.append(( url , description ) ) @stringfunction def favoritesPage ( info ) : r " " " < html > < head >< title >${info.user}'s Favorites </ title ></head > < body > < h1>${cgi.escape(info.user ) }'s Favorites </ h1 > < ol > $ {{ for fav in info .
favorites : out.append ( '< li >') out.append( buildLink ( fav [ 0 ] , fav [ 1 ] ) ) }} </ ol > </ body > < /html > " " " @stringfunction def buildLink ( url , description ) : " " " < a href = " ${cgi.escape ( url , quote= ' " ' ) } " >$ description </a > " " " info = FavoritesInfo(' Dave ' ) info.addFavorite ( ' http://popurls.com/', ' PopURLs ' ) info.addFavorite ( ' http://news.google.com/', ' Google News ' ) print favoritesPage ( info )
How it Works
The @stringfunction decorator is a subversion of python 's documentation strings .
The decorator transforms a function 's __doc__ string into executable python code , and then returns a function with the same signature as the original function , but with the code replaced by the generated code .
The templet module code below supports @stringfunction and a similar @unicodefunction decorator .
It clocks in at a brief 64 lines of code .
The full version here also includes unit tests and more docs , as well as including support for the StringTemplate and UnicodeTemplate base classes that I have discussed previously .
import sys , re , inspect class _ TemplateBuilder ( object ) : __pattern = re.compile ( r " " " \$( # Directives begin with a $ \$ | # $ $ is an escape for $ [ ^ \S
] *
| # $
is a line continuation [ _a - z ] [ _a - z0 - 9 ] * | # $ simple Python identifier \{ ( ?!\{ ) [ ^\} ] * \} | # $ {...} expression to eval \{\{ .*?\}\} | # $ {{...}} multiline code to exec < [ _a - z ] [ _a - z0 - 9 ] *> | # $ < sub_template > method call ) (?:(?:(?< =\}\} ) |(?<=> ) ) [ ^\S
] *
) ?
# eat some trailing newlines " " " , re .
IGNORECASE | re.VERBOSE | re.DOTALL ) def __init__( self , constpat , emitpat , callpat=None ) : self.constpat , self.emitpat , self .
callpat = constpat , emitpat , callpat def __realign ( self , str , spaces= ' ' ) : " " " Removes any leading empty columns of spaces and an initial empty line " " " lines = str.splitlines ( ) ; if lines and not lines [ 0 ] . strip ( ) : del lines [ 0 ] lspace = [ le n ( l ) - len( l.lstrip ( ) ) for l in lines if l.lstrip ( ) ] margin = len( lspace ) and min( lspace ) return '
'. join ( ( spaces + l[margin : ] ) for l in lines ) def build ( self , template , filename , s= '' ) : code = [ ] for i , part in enumerate ( self.__pattern.split(self.__realign( template ) ) ) : if i % 2 == 0 : if part : code.append(s + self.constpat % repr( part ) ) else : if not part or ( part.startswith ( ' < ' ) and self.
callpat is None ) : raise SyntaxError ( ' Unescaped $ in ' + filename ) elif part.endswith ( '
' ) : continue elif part == '$ ' : code.append(s + self.emitpat % ' " $ " ' ) elif part.startswith ('{{ ' ) : code.append(self.__realign( part [ 2:-2 ] , s ) ) elif part.startswith ('{ ' ) : code.append(s + self.emitpat % part [ 1:-1 ] ) elif part.startswith ('<' ) : code.append(s + self.callpat % part [ 1:-1 ] ) else : code.append(s + self.emitpat % part ) return '
'.join ( code ) def _templatefunction ( func , listname , stringtype ) : globals , locals = sys.modules[func.__module__].__dict__ , {} if ' __file__ ' not in globals : filename = ' < %s > ' % func.__name__ else : filename = ' %s : < %s > ' % ( globals [ ' __file__ ' ] , func.__name__ ) builder = _ TemplateBuilder ('%s.append ( %%s ) ' % listname , '% s.append ( %s ( % %s ) ) ' % ( listname , stringtype ) ) args = inspect.getargspec( func ) code = [ ' def %s%s : ' % ( func.__name__ , inspect.formatargspec(*args ) ) , ' %s = [ ] ' % listname , builder.build(func.__doc__ , filename , ' ' ) , ' return " " . join ( %s ) ' % listname ] code = compile ( '
'.join ( code ) , filename , ' exec ' ) exec code in globals , locals return locals [ func.__name__ ] def stringfunction ( func ) : " " " Function attribute for string template functions " " " return _templatefunction ( func , listname= ' out ' , stringtype= ' str ' ) def unicodefunction ( func ) : " " " Function attribute for unicode template functions " " " return _templatefunction ( func , listname= ' out ' , stringtype= ' unicode ' )
An explanation of _templatefunction , which drives the code generation :
First it grabs the global namespace within which the original function was defined .
We need that because if you write code that accesses another symbol in that module ( e.g. , an imported module name , or another function in that module ) , we want to resolve it in that namespace .
It also makes a temporary ( empty ) local namespace for the generated code .
Then it generates a pseudo - filename to use when generating error messages and so on .
This includes the original module 's filename , if we can find it .
Then we generate code .
We begin by generating a " def " statement exactly like the original .
The trick is to use inspect.getargspec( func ) and inspect.formatargspec( args ) to grab and reproduce the signature for the function .
The body of the code is generated by the _TemplateBuilder class .
That class just rips apart templates using regular expressions , realigns spaces , and emits appropriate " out.append " code .
In our generated function , we bracket this code with " out = [ ] " and " return ''. join ( out ) " .
Finally , we use " exec " to define the generated function , and then we grab the generated function out of the temporary namespace to return it .
Is this Pretty or Ugly ?
The @stringfunction decorator produces string functions that are somewhat reminiscent of PTL - style templates , allowing templates to be declared with normal python function syntax .
Yet it does it in a much simpler way , without introducing a whole new python compiler , using just a single small module .
Part of the reason @stringfunction is so easy to implement is that it subverts Python 's documentation strings for its own tricky ends .
To me it feels like , for string template functions , a string that appears as the function body makes " more sense " as a template string than as a documentation string , and that the template string is a fine self - documenting description anyway .
But maybe misusing documentation strings like this is distasteful .
For the pythonista's out there : does this strike you as the right way to string templates in python ?
It is certainly fast and simple .
I think it is pretty readable , too .

Computers and music have been linked since the earliest days of the mainframe , when giant machines controlled primitive synthesizers .
Recently , however , a significant advancement has taken place in the field of computer music with the development of software that can not only transcribe polyphonic music in real time , but can also play back complex harmonies alongside human performers .
For instance , at the annual Music Information Retrieval Exchange ( MIREX ) competition , Christopher Raphael of Indiana University demonstrated a system that can understand live music well enough to accompany a musician .
Raphael started playing an oboe quartet written by Mozart , and his electronic accompaniment chimed in playing the other three instruments .
When Raphael slowed down his performance , the computer " musicians " followed right along with him without missing a beat , even when he added a trill for emphasis .
" Technology is changing our sense of what music can be , " Raphael says .
" The effect is profound . "
The new software was not easy to develop , however .
Raphael compares it to the slow progress in effective speech recognition .
" There 's been a veritable army of people who 've worked on speech recognition for several decades , and [ the problem ] still remains open , " he says .
" Any time you deal with real data , there is a huge amount of variation that you have to understand . "
Raphael 's program works by analyzing the waveforms emitted by musical instruments .
It has been relatively straightforward for computers to accurately identify a single note being played , but when harmonies enter the picture , it becomes a far more difficult problem .
A program written by Daniel Ellis of Columbia University uses machine learning techniques to " teach " computers how to understand music by feeding it 92 recordings along with their musical scores .
Gradually , the software begins learning the rules of music ( such as how an E is often played with an A , but rarely with an A sharp ) and over time it becomes more adept at discerning the notes from the music .
Raphael 's program does n't have to go through this complex process because it only has to follow a single performer , but future iterations may be able to follow along with a whole group .
Similar technology has already shown up in the commercial music market , such as the infamous AutoTune software that gives Maroon 5 perfect pitch on CD even though the lead singer could n't hit a note correctly if his life depended on it ; artists like Shania Twain are even rumored to use a real - time version of AutoTune for their concerts .
However , making heavily - filtered pop music is n't the only possible outcome of this research .
Computer performers could handle new types of music with many more notes played at once than humans are capable of handling .
Disc Jockeys could have many more options for creating unique performances .
And software could make learning an instrument faster and more enjoyable , as students could practice with a " real " orchestra again and again without it ever getting tired , or needing to clear its spit valves .
But mixed in with these great ideas are also worries about how copyright holders would react to the explosion of mash - ups and other creative works that would be facilitated by a computer with both perfect pitch and the ability to learn and playback music in real time .
Indeed , what new DRMs and watermarking techniques will be invented once a computer can not only " record " music , but can break it down into its constituent parts and reassemble it again , perhaps in simulated HD audio quality .
That day could be closer than you think .

Sam Harris : The End of Faith : Religion , Terror , and the Future of Reason
One of the most frightening books I 've ever read .
Among numerous other topics , Harris argues that it is almost inevitable that atomic weapons will fall into the hands of religious radicals -- if not terrorist , then perhaps a nation with religious radicals in charge .
(****)
Richard Dawkins : The God Delusion
Highly recommended .
Despite what you might have heard , Richard Dawkins does not spew venom in this book .
Flames do not shoot out when you open it , nor does bile drip from the pages .
Far from being an hysterical , rabid diatribe against religion , it is a quite measured , logical explanation of the evidence against God and why religion should not be treated with such reverence .
(*****)
Daniel C. Dennett : Breaking the Spell : Religion as a Natural Phenomenon
I highly recommend this book for anyone who is about to embark on studying religion and atheism .
Why do people enjoy music ?
Why do we like to socialize ?
Why do we sometimes become violent ?
Science has attempted to answer each of these questions .
Dennett proposes that science attempt to answer another :
Why are people religious ?
Even if one of the religions is true , that still means that billions of people believe religions that are not true .
Why ?
What is it about our evolutionary past that makes us willing to believe ?
(*****)
Jared Diamond : Guns , Germs and Steel : The Fates of Human Societies
Why was n't Europe invaded by ships carrying gun-wielding Native Americans or Africans , rather than the other way around ?
This is an excellent explanation of why some societies became quite advanced , while others remained primitive .
(*****)
Terry Pratchett , Ian Stewart , Jack S. Cohen : The Science of Discworld
You 'll have to visit Amazon UK to locate this one .
This book explains science concepts by comparing them to the decidedly different physical laws of the Discworld series .

If you know your enemies and know yourself , you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles ; ... if you do not know your enemies nor yourself , you will be imperiled in every single battle .
Sun Tzu ( 孫子 Sūn Zǐ ; c. 6th century BC ) was a Chinese general , military strategist , and philosopher who lived in the Eastern Zhou period of ancient China .
Sun
Tzu is traditionally credited as the author of The Art of War , a widely influential work of military strategy that has affected both Western and East Asian philosophy and military thinking .
He is also known as Sun Wu ( 孫武 ; Sūn Wǔ ) , and Chang Qing ( 長卿 ; Cháng Qīng ) .
Chapter titles from Chow - Hou Wee ( 2003 )
Chapter 1 · Detail Assessment and Planning [ edit ]
兵者，詭道也。故能而示之不能，用而示之不用，近而示之遠，遠而示之近，
All warfare is based on deception .
Hence , when we are able to attack , we must seem unable ; when using our forces , we must appear inactive ; when we are near , we must make the enemy believe we are far away ; when far away , we must make him believe we are near .
Variant translations A military operation involves deception .
Even though you are competent , appear to be incompetent .
Though effective , appear to be ineffective .
實而備之，強而避之，怒而撓之，卑而驕之，佚而勞之，親而離之，出其不意，攻其不備。
If your enemy is secure at all points , be prepared for him .
If he is in superior strength , evade him .
If your opponent is temperamental , seek to irritate him .
Pretend to be weak , that he may grow arrogant .
If he is taking his ease , give him no rest .
If his forces are united , separate them .
Attack him where he is unprepared , appear where you are not expected .
Note : " If his forces are united , separate them " is also interpreted : " If sovereign and subject are in accord , put division between them . "
亂而取之 Hold out baits to entice the enemy .
Feign disorder , and crush him .
卑則驕之 Pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance .
孫子曰：國之上下，死生之地，存亡之道，不可不察也 。
The art of war is of vital importance to the State .
It is a matter of life and death , a road either to safety or to ruin .
Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected .
夫未戰而庙算胜者，得算多也；未戰而庙算不勝者，得算少也。
The general who wins the battle makes many calculations in his temple before the battle is fought .
The general who loses makes but few calculations beforehand .
将听吾计，用之必胜，留之；将不听吾计，用之必败，去之；
The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it , will conquer : let such a one be retained in command !
The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it , will suffer defeat : — let such a one be dismissed !
怒而挠 之
If your opponent is of choleric temperament , seek to irritate him .
Chapter II · Waging War [ edit ]
故兵貴勝，不貴久 。
What is essential in war is victory , not prolonged operations .
近于师者贵卖，贵卖则百姓财 竭
Where the army is , prices are high ; when prices rise the wealth of the people is exhausted .
兵久而国利者，未之有也 。
There is no instance of a nation benefiting from prolonged warfare .
Chapter III · Strategic Attack [ edit ]
上兵伐 謀
What is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemy 's strategy .
知彼知己，百戰不殆；不知彼而知己，一勝一負；不知彼，不知己，每戰必殆
It is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself , you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles ; if you do not know your enemies but do know yourself , you will win one and lose one ; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself , you will be imperiled in every single battle .
Variant translations
If you know others and know yourself , you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles ; if you do not know others but know yourself , you win one and lose one ; if you do not know others and do not know yourself , you will be imperiled in every single battle .
Know your enemy and know yourself , find naught in fear for 100 battles .
Know yourself but not your enemy , find level of loss and victory .
Know not thy enemy nor yourself , wallow in defeat every time .
Literal translation : Know [ the ] other , know [ the ] self , hundred battles without danger ; not knowing [ the ] other but know [ the ] self , one win one loss ; not knowing [ the ] other , not knowing [ the ] self , every battle must [ be ] lost .
故用兵之法，十則圍之，五則攻之，倍則分之， 敵則能戰之，少則能守之，不若則能避之。
It is the rule in war , if ten times the enemy 's strength , surround them ; if five times , attack them ; if double , be able to divide them ; if equal , engage them ; if fewer , defend against them ; if weaker , be able to avoid them .
是故百戰百勝，非善之善者也；不戰而屈人之兵，善之善者也。
For to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill .
To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill .
Variant translations
Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence ; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy 's resistance without fighting .
The best victory is when the opponent surrenders of its own accord before there are any actual hostilities ...
It is best to win without fighting .
古之所善戰者，勝於易勝者也。
What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins , but excels in winning with ease .
知可战与不可战者胜 。
He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot will be victorious .
以虞待不虞者胜 。
He who is prudent and lies in wait for an enemy who is not , will be victorious .
凡用兵之法，全國為上；破國次之；全軍為上，破軍次之；全旅為上，破旅次之；全卒為上，破卒次之；全伍為上，破伍次之。
In the practical art of war , the best thing of all is to take the enemy 's country whole and intact ; to shatter and destroy it is not so good .
So , too , it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it , to capture a regiment , a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them .
Variant translations
It is best to keep one ’s own state intact ; to crush the enemy ’s state is only second best .
是故上攻伐 谋
Thus , what is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemy 's strategy .
Chapter IV · Disposition of the Army [ edit ]
是故勝兵先勝而後求戰，敗兵先戰而後求勝。
Victorious warriors win first and then go to war , while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win .
Variant :
Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won , whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory .
见胜不过众人之所识，非善之善者也。
To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence .
守则不足，攻则有 余
One defends when his strength is inadequate ; he attacks when it is abundant .
孫子曰：昔之善戰者，先為不可勝，以待敵之可勝，不可勝在己，可勝在敵。故善戰者，能為不可勝，不能使敵必可勝。故曰：勝可知，而不可為。
Sunzi said :
The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat , and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy .
To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands , but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself .
Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat , but can not make certain of defeating the enemy .

Chapter V · Forces [ edit ]
治众如治寡，分数是也。 Management of many is the same as management of few .
It is a matter of organization .
积水之激，至于漂石者，势也。鸷鸟之疾，至于毁折者，节也。
When torrential water tosses boulders , it is because of its momentum .
When the strike of a hawk breaks the body of its prey , it is because of timing .
鸷鸟之疾，至于毁折者，节也 。
The quality of decision is like the well - timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim .
故善战者，求之于势，不责于人。
A skilled commander seeks victory from the situation and does not demand it of his subordinates .
Variant :
The expert in battle seeks his victory from strategic advantage and does not demand it from his men .
Chapter VI · Weaknesses and Strengths [ edit ]
微乎微乎，至于无形；神乎神乎，至于无声；故能为敌之司命。
Be extremely subtle , even to the point of formlessness .
Be extremely mysterious , even to the point of soundlessness .
Thereby you can be the director of the opponent 's fate .
Alternative translation : Subtle and insubstantial , the expert leaves no trace ; divinely mysterious , he is inaudible .
Thus he is master of his enemy 's fate .
Alternative translation : O divine art of subtlety and secrecy !
Through you we learn to be invisible , through you inaudible and hence we can hold the enemy 's fate in our hands .
人皆知我所以勝之形，而莫知吾所以制勝之形。
All men can see these tactics whereby I conquer , but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved .
故形兵之极，至于无形，无形，则深间不能窥，上智不能谋。
The ultimate in disposing one 's troops is to be without ascertainable shape .
Then the most penetrating spies cannot pry in nor can the wise lay plans against you .
故善战者，至人而不至于人 。
And therefore those skilled in war bring the enemy to the field of battle and are not brought there by him .
故敌逸能劳之，饱能饥之，安能动之。出其所不趋，趋其所不意。
When the enemy is at ease , be able to weary him ; when well fed , to starve him ; when at rest , to make him move .
Appear at places to which he must hasten ; move swiftly where he does not expect you .
Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows ; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing .
Therefore , just as water retains no constant shape , so in warfare there are no constant conditions .
He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning , may be called a heaven - born captain .
Lionel Giles translation
Chapter VII · Military Maneuvers [ edit ]
圍師必 闕
To a surrounded enemy , you must leave a way of escape .
Chapter VIII · Variations and Adaptability [ edit ]
故用兵之法，無恃其不來，恃吾有以待之；無恃其不攻，恃吾有所不可攻也。
The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy 's not coming , but on our own readiness to receive him ; not on the chance of his not attacking , but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable .
Translation by Lionel Giles
Chapter IX · Movement and Development of Troops [ edit ]
数赏者，窘也；数罚者，困也 ；
Too frequent rewards indicate that the general is at the end of his resources ; too frequent punishments that he is in acute distress .
In war , numbers alone confer no advantage .
Do not advance relying on sheer military power .
令素行以教其民，则民服。令不素行以教其民，则民不服。令素行者，与民相得也。
A leader leads by example not by force .
Chapter X · Terrain [ edit ]
将弱不严，教道不明，将之过也。
If words of command are not clear and distinct , if orders are not thoroughly understood , the general is to blame .
But if his orders are clear , and the soldiers nevertheless disobey , then it is the fault of their officers .
故戰道必勝，主曰無戰，必戰可也；戰道不勝，主曰必戰，无戰可也；
If fighting is sure to result in victory , then you must fight , even though the ruler forbid it ; if fighting will not result in victory , then you must not fight even at the ruler 's bidding .
进不邀功，退不避罪，唯人是保，而利合于主，国之宝也。
The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace , whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign , is the jewel of the kingdom .
視卒如愛子，故可與之俱死 。
Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons .
And they will follow you into the deepest valley .
Chapter XI · The Nine Battlegrounds [ edit ]
吾士无余财，非恶货也。无余命，非恶寿也。
If our soldiers are not overburdened with money , it is not because they have a distaste for riches ; if their lives are not unduly long , it is not because they are disinclined to longevity .
兵之情主速，乘敌所不及，由不虞之途，攻其所不备也。
Speed is the essence of war .
Take advantage of the enemy 's unpreparedness ; travel by unexpected routes and strike him where he has taken no precautions .
施无法之赏，悬无政之令。犯三军之众，若使一人。
Bestow rewards without respect to customary practice ; publish orders without respect to precedent .
Thus you may employ the entire army as you would one man .
Chapter XII · Attacking with Fire [ edit ]
非利不動，非得不用，非危不戰。主不可以怒而興師，將不可以慍而致戰；合于利而動，不合于利而止。怒可以復喜，慍可以復悅，亡國不可以復存，死者不可以復生。故明君慎之，良將警之，此安國全軍之道也。
Move not unless you see an advantage ; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained ; fight not unless the position is critical .
No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen ; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique .
If it is to your advantage , make a forward move ; if not , stay where you are .
Anger may in time change to gladness ; vexation may be succeeded by content .
But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being ; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life .
Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful , and the good general full of caution .
This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact .
Translation by Lionel Giles
Chapter XIII · Intelligence and Espionage [ edit ]
敌间之来间我者，因而利之，导而舍之，故反间可得而用也；
It is essential to seek out enemy agents who have come to conduct espionage against you and to bribe them to serve you .
Give them instructions and care for them .
Thus doubled agents are recruited and used .
故明君賢將，所以動而勝人，成功出于眾者，先知也。
Now the reason the enlightened prince and the wise general conquer the enemy whenever they move and their achievements surpass those of ordinary men is foreknowledge .
故三军之事，莫亲于间，赏莫厚于间，事莫密于间，
Of all those in the army close to the commander none is more intimate than the secret agent ; of all rewards none more liberal than those given to secret agents ; of all matters none is more confidential than those relating to secret operations .
此（译注：用间）兵之要，三军之所恃而动也。
Secret operations are essential in war ; upon them the army relies to make its every move .
Disputed [ edit ]
Build your opponent a golden bridge to retreat across .
This has appeared as a variant of Sun Tzu's assertion to " leave a way of escape . "
Tu Mu , commenting on Sun Tzu , advises , " Show him there is a road to safety ... "
Ch. 7 ; it has also recently appeared on the internet attributed to Scipio Africanus , but without citation .
Engage people with what they expect ; it is what they are able to discern and confirms their projections .
It settles them into predictable patterns of response , occupying their minds while you wait for the extraordinary moment — that which they cannot anticipate .
Victory is reserved for those who are willing to pay its price .
Attributed to Sun
Tzu in multiple books and internet sites , but this text does not appear in The Art of War and seems to be a more recent creation .
Misattributed [ edit ]
Keep your friends close , and your enemies closer .
This has often been attributed to Sun Tzu and sometimes to Petrarch .
It comes most directly from a line spoken by Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part II ( 1974 ) , written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola :
My father taught me many things here .
He taught me in this room .
He taught me : keep your friends close but your enemies closer .
Niccolò Machiavelli , who is also sometimes credited , wrote on the subject in The Prince :
It is easier for the prince to make friends of those men who were contented under the former government , and are therefore his enemies , than of those who , being discontented with it , were favourable to him and encouraged him to seize it .
There are some attributions of this comment to Ghengis Khan ( Mongol Warlord ) .
To know your Enemy , you must become your Enemy .
This is sometimes attributed to Sun Tzu in combination with the above quote , as well as alone , but it too has not been sourced to any published translation of The Art of War , though it is similar in concept to his famous statement in Ch. 3 : " It is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself , you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles ... "
Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory .
Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat .
Probably apocryphal .
This quotation does not appear in any print translation of Sun Tzu .
The first citation in Google Books is from 2002 ; no citation in Google Books occurs in a translation of Sun Tzu .
The true objective of war is peace .
This attributed to Sun Tzu and his book The Art of War. Actually James Clavell ’s foreword in The Art of War states , “ ’ the true object of war is peace . ’”
Therefore the quote is stated by James Clavell , but the true origin of Clavell 's quotation is unclear .
Nonetheless the essence of the quote , that a long war exhausts a state and therefore ultimately seeking peace is in the interest of the warring state , is true , as Sun Tzu in Chapter II Waging Wars says that " There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare .
It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on . "
This has been interpreted by Lionel Giles as " Only one who knows the disastrous effects of a long war can realize the supreme importance of rapidity in bringing it to a close . "
Dr. Hiroshi Hatanaka , President of Kobe College , Nishinomiya , Hyōgo , Japan is recorded as saying " the real objective of war is peace " in Pacific Stars and Stripes Ryukyu Edition , Tokyo , Japan ( 10 February 1949 ) , Page 2 , Column 2 .
Opportunities multiply as they are seized .
Sun
Tzu among many other military thinkers and leaders believed in fate and determination from the correct application of theory , the state of the opponent 's and one 's own power , and a code for the general and a code for the soldier to follow , rather than the Machiavellian type of intuition that evokes an evolution of opportunism that brought great historical consequences as it dominated over the classical and medieval ethical doctrines .
Thus this statement is contrary to Sun Tzu principles .
Nevertheless , there is a possible relation to the quote : Quickness is the essence of the war .
In peace , prepare for war .
In war , prepare for peace .
Sometimes erroneously prepended to the opening line " The art of war is of vital importance to the State " , but appears to be a variation of the Roman motto " Si vis pacem , para bellum " .
It 's not clear who first misattributed this phrase to Sun Tzu .
The earliest appearance of the phrase in Google Books is 1920 , when it appeared in a pharmaceutical journal , but no attribution was given then .
Fear is the true enemy , the only enemy .
Attributed implicitly to Sun Tzu by " William Riker " in the episode The Last Outpost of the TV program Star Trek : The Next Generation , but no source for this quote predates the episode 's airing in 1987 .
Quotes about Sun Tzu [ edit ]
吳王曰： 「將軍罷休就舍，寡人不願下觀。」孫子曰：「王徒好其言，不能用其實。」於是闔廬知孫子能用兵，卒以為將。西破彊楚，入郢，北威齊晉，顯名諸侯，孫子與有力焉。
The King of Wu said ，" Enough , general .
Retire to your hostel , We do not wish to come down and observe . "
Sun
Tzu said , " The king only loves the words , he can not make use of the reality . "
After this ,
Ho-lu knew that Sun Tzu could command troops and in the end appointed him commander .
[ Later when Wu ] defeated mighty Ch’u to its west and entered its capital Ying awed Ch'i and Chin to its north and spread its fame among the feudal lords , it was due in part to Sun Tzu. translated by Tsai - fa Cheng , Zongli Lu , William H. Nienhauser , Jr. , and Robert Reynolds , in The Grand Scribe ’s Records , edited by William H. Nienhauser , Jr. Sima Qian , Records of the Grand Historian , 孫子吳起列 傳
諸將效首虜，（休）畢賀，因問信曰：「兵法右倍山陵，前左水澤，今者將軍令臣等反背水陳，曰破趙會食，臣等不服。然竟以勝，此何術也？」信曰：「此在兵法，顧諸君不察耳。兵法不曰『陷之死地而後生，置之亡地而後存』？且信非得素拊循士大夫也，此所謂『驅市人而戰之』，其勢非置之死地，使人人自為戰；今予之生地，皆走，寧尚可得而用之乎！」諸將皆服曰：「善。非臣所及也。」
After the various commanders presented the heads [ of the enemies ] and the captives , they all offered their congratulations .
They took the advantage to ask [ Han ] Hsin and said , “ The Art of War says ‘ keep the hills to your right and your back ; keep the waters to the front or at your left . ’’
Now you , General , on the contrary ordered your subjects to draw up in array with our backs against the river and said , ‘ We will defeat Chao and feast together . ’
Your servants were not convinced .
However , we won with this in the end .
What strategy was this ? ” [ Han ]
Hsin said , “ This is in The Art of War , however , you gentlemen did not notice it .
Does n’t The Art of War say ‘ They will survive after being trapped in a fatal situation and will live on after being placed in a hopeless position ?
Furthermore , I do not have well - trained officers .
This is what is called ‘ Drive the street rabble and have them fight . ’
The circumstances were that I had to put them in a fatal situation and made every person fight for his life .
If I had put them in a safe situation , they would have had already run away .
How could they have been held and employed ? ”

Tzu ’s success teaches us that a successful general is one who fully calculates his approach and plans to fight in a battle .
However , the average reader is not able to identify Sun Tzu ’s teachings on a deeper or philosophical level .
This is my reason for writing and exegeses on the Art of War.

It 's a very nasty book .
How to use your spies — that chapter thirteen on spies — is chilling .

Sūnzi bīngfǎ is : how to use your friends and neighbors in order to get the better of them .
That does n't make me feel good .

You do n't go out of your way like Sun Tzu to manipulate everybody including your friends .

It 's the dark side .

Sex on the Desk - Oral Sex is More Easily Denied
In 1995 , several newspapers began reporting that Newt Gingrich was dating and basically living with Callista Bisek , a " willowy blond Congressional aide 23 years his junior . "
Bisek , then 33 , had been spending nights at Gingrich 's apartment near the Capitol and had her own key , they reported .
In an amazing act of hypocrisy , Gingrich was apparently dating Bisek all during the Clinton - Lewinsky adultery scandal , even as he proclaimed family values and bitterly criticized the President for his adultery .
Reporters and other Washington insiders have known about this relationship since 1994 , even before Gingrich became Speaker of the House , but did not have any solid proof to report .
In 1995 , Vanity Fair magazine described Bisek as Gingrich 's " frequent breakfast companion . "
Gingrich was married to Marianne Gingrich during all of that time , and did n't file for divorce until August 1999 ) . fter Marianne refused to consider an open marriage . )
Newt is apparently trying to create a new hybrid form , Christian adultery .
Bisek sings in the National Shrine Choir , and Newt would often wait for her at the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception , listening to her sing while he read the Bible , during their affair .
This is hardly the first time Newt has cheated , either .
" It was common knowledge that Newt was involved with other women during his [ first ] marriage to Jackie .
Maybe not on the level of John Kennedy .
But he had girlfriends -- some serious , some trivial . " --
Dot Crews , his campaign scheduler throughout the 70s .
One woman , Anne Manning , has come forward and confirmed a relationship with him during the 1976 campaign .
" We had oral sex .
He prefers that modus operandi because then he can say , ' I never slept with her . ' "
Kip Carter , his former campaign treasurer , was walking Newt 's daughters back from a football game one day and cut across a driveway where he saw a car .
" As I got to the car , I saw Newt in the passenger seat and one of the guys ' wives with her head in his lap going up and down .
Newt kind of turned and gave me this little - boy smile .
Fortunately , Jackie Sue and Kathy were a lot younger and shorter then . "
Bizarrely , Newt has tried to justify his adultery as resulting from his patriotism .
When asked on the Christian Broadcasting Network about his cheating , he said “ There ’s no question at times of my life , partially driven by how passionately I felt about this country , that I worked far too hard and things happened in my life that were not appropriate . ”
He did not say whether his patriotism is any weaker now than it was when it forced him to sleep with younger women .
But he 's given at least one hint that the answer is no .
In July 2011 , a conservative Christian group asked the Republican candidates to sign a statement promising marital fidelity .
Rick Santorum and Michele Bachmann quickly signed , but Newt refused , saying he wanted to make some changes in the language first .
" “ We ’re happy to work with you to sharpen it so people understand where we ’re going with it , ” Gingrich said to Family Leader head Bob Vander Plaats .
" It 's not there yet . ” -- Sources

Pressing Wife for Divorce in the Hospital -- Back
" He walked out in the spring of 1980 ....
By September , I went into the hospital for my third surgery .
The two girls came to see me , and said , " Daddy is downstairs .
Could he come up ? "
When he got there , he wanted to discuss the terms of the divorce while I was recovering from my surgery . "
- Jackie , his first wife .
One of Newt 's daughters from that first marriage , who is also a conservative columnist , recently disputed that story ( after Newt co-authored a book with her ) , saying among other things that her mother Jackie had initiated the divorce and that " the tumor [ removed in a surgery the day before ] was benign . "
Of course no one knew the tumor was benign at the time , so I do n't know why that is supposed to matter .
And CNN recently found court documents that show that Newt did in fact initiate that divorce -- which makes him a blatant liar , too .
In any case , I 'm inclined to believe the wife this happened to over the account of her daughter who was a child at that time ( and earns easy money from her dad today . ) --

Spending Spree at Tiffany's -- Back
Newt brazenly attacks Mitt Romney as rich and out of touch -- after it came out that he owed the luxury jeweler Tiffany 's between a quarter million and a half million dollars for pretty things he bought his wife .
We think he bought them for his wife , anyway .
If not Callista , maybe the next one .
-- Sources
Lying Corporate Lobbyist -- Back
There are few things any current candidate has done more hypocritical than Newt 's corporate lobbying work for the mortgage giant Freddie Mac .
You see , Newt has publicly attacked Freddie Mac for years , blaming it for the 2008 housing crash .
Then we found out that they paid him $ 1.6 million , as he went around and tried to convince Republicans to vote for Freddie Mac 's favorite bills ( and against regulations on them ) .
Newt denies he was lobbying -- because his work did n't meet some technical definitions of lobbying -- and claimed , ridiculously that they paid him to be a " historian . "
No historian in history has earned $ 1.6 million .
Newt did n't report to Freddie Mac 's director of history .
( Spoiler alert ; no company has one . )
He reported to Craig Thomas , who was in charge of lobbying for them ( and a registered lobbyist himself ) .
and paid Newt $ 25,000 a month .
On January 24 , 2012 , Newt finally released his contract .
Guess what is not described in his services ?
History .
In fact , Newt admits that he only talked to Freddie Mac staff for about one hour per month .
At $ 25,000 / hour , that 's a lot of history for a mortgage lender .
And Freddie Mac is not the only company Newt lobbied for .
He had dozens of corporate clients who paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for his " services . "
He promoted his health care clients to legislators in Georgia or Florida who were considered changes in health care laws .
He talked up projects that his clients IBM and HealthTrio were working on , to federal officials .
He pushed for changes to Medicare that would enrich other clients of his .
And one client , drug maker Novo Nordisk , described Newt 's work this way in their annual report : " Such activities are often referred to as lobbying . ”
Newt actually was a champion of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae as far back as 1995 , when he blocked ( as Speaker of the House ) two attempts to raise fees on the two companies by hundreds of millions of dollars .
The two flew Newt and his then - wife Marianne to Ireland in 1998 , for a publicity event / vacation , and within months after Newt resigned from Congress in disgrace , Freddie Mac began paying him cash as a consultant .

Dead - Beat Dad --
Back
The hospital visit was n't the end of it , either .
Shortly after the cancer ward visit , Newt stopped paying alimony and child support .
Jackie had to take Newt to court to get money out of him , and her Baptist church needed to take up a collection to get his kids food and prevent the utilities from being cut off .
He has never apologized for this or admitted it was a mistake .
-- Sources
Draft Dodger -- Back
Though he relentlessly pushes military spending and talks like a bigtime hawk , Gingrich avoided the Vietnam War through a combination of student and family deferments .
( He married one of his high school teachers at age 19 , and quickly got her pregnant . )
In the presidential debate on January 7 , 2012 , Gingrich claimed that " I never asked for a deferment , I was married with a child , it was never a question . "
That sounded pretty like a pretty solid defense until Ron Paul pointed out that he had a wife and two children when he was drafted -- and he went anyway .
Problems With Women ? --
Back
When Newt 's first wife Jackie was still in the hospital recovering from her third cancer surgery , Newt came to her bed and -- by his own admission -- " argued " with her over the terms of the divorce that he wanted ( and she did n't ) .
Newt also graciously told one of his aides that " She is n't young enough or pretty enough to be the President 's wife .
And besides , she has cancer . "
Later it emerged that he had been having an affair with a younger woman , Marianne .
But his second marriage -- to Marianne -- was n't much smoother either .
In fact it was very similar .
After Marianne was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis , Newt told her about an affair with a younger woman , Callista , that he had been having for six years .
She says that Newt did n't ask for divorce this time -- he asked her to have an " open marriage " where he could also sleep with Callista .
Marianne refused , and they divorced .
Does
Newt have some kind of problem with women ?
He has said that he read a book called " Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them " , and " found frightening pieces that related to my own life . "
-- Sources
Wannabe Dictator -- Back
Newt has a grandiosity and self - importance that 's hard to believe .
Since he was in college , he has been telling people he needs to lead America so he can change history and save us all from disaster .
No exaggeration -- check out this 1995 New Yorker profile .
Darryl Conner , a Gingrich friend who Newt has hired to train congressmen , remembers first working with him 40 years ago , when Newt was 28 years old .
" It could n't have been more than a few days before he was talking about what he needed to do to save Western civilization . "
Frank Gregorsky , Newt 's former chief of staff , said he once asked Newt to be more philosophically coherent , and Gingrich replied " Saving civilization is hard .
You have to be fluid . "
Newt asked Frank to read Isaac Asimov 's Foundation trilogy ( very cool science fiction , in my humble opinion ) , explaining " I think of things in hundred - year increments , so I wanted you to read Asimov , because that conveys the course of civilization over five hundred years , because that 's how I think . "
And because he 's so important ( in his own mind ) , he is a real risk for authoritarian rule if elected .
Heck , he has promised authoritarian rule .
In between all his scandals , he has vowed to fire all liberal government workers and arrest judges who rule against him .
So if he gets elected , do n't be surprised if he grabs all those powers Dick Cheney carved out after 9/11 -- detaining US citizens without trial , warrantless wiretapping , torture -- and uses them to fight anyone who opposes his power .
After all , he 's saving Western civilization .

House Banking Scandal : Newt Bounced 22 Checks -- Back
Remember the House Banking scandal , where so many congressmen wrote rubber checks on government money ?
Newt hopes you do n't , because he bounced 22 himself , which almost cost him reelection in 1992 .
His vote for the secret House pay raise , and the chauffeur who drove him around Washington in a Lincoln Town Car , did n't help .
Lucrative and Questionable Book Deals : Murdoch's $ 4.5 Million was n't the first -- Back
The 1995 Murdoch Deal --- The 1984 Book Deal
The 1995 Murdoch Deal -- Back
Back in 1995 , Newt 's book scandal was pretty big news .
He was offered first $ 2.5 million , then $ 4.5 million by Harper Collins , a publishing company owned by Rupert Murdoch , who also owns the Fox TV network and newspapers and TV stations around the world .
Murdoch has been having problems with a complaint by NBC that Fox is a foreign owned TV network , which is against US law .
In the past , Harper Collins has offered million dollar book contracts to several conservative politicians in countries where Murdoch was having regulatory trouble , including England ( Margaret Thatcher , Jeffrey Archer ) and China ( Deng Xiaoping 's daughter ) .
A week after the initial offer , Newt met with Rupert Murdoch - and Murdoch 's legislative lobbyist - to discuss politics , including the NBC complaint .
As facts about the deal were made public , and even Republicans criticized him , Gingrich decided to give up the $ 4.5 million advance for a still - lucrative deal based on royalties .
Gingrich 's story kept changing through the controversy .
First , Newt 's spokesman said that Murdoch knew nothing about Gingrich and the book deal .
On Friday January 13 , Newt 's spokesman admitted that Murdoch actually met Newt on a park bench the week before the deal was made , but did n't talk about it .
He also said he knew nothing about Murdoch 's lobbyist being at their meeting .
The next day , he admitted the lobbyist was there , but claimed he did n't say so because no one asked .
Newt also said repeatedly that the book was n't his idea ; that a literary agent named Lynn Chu had sought him out and proposed it .
After Ms. Chu said that Gingrich 's associate Jeff Eisenach called her first on Newt 's behalf , Eisenach and Newt 's spokesman admitted that was true .
The 1984 Book Deal
Murdoch 's book deal was n't the first lucrative and controversial book deal Newt engineered .
In 1983 he established a limited partnership in Atlanta called COS Limited , which pulled together about two dozen of his biggest campaign contributors to finance his book .
The former administrator of his congressional offices in Georgia , Dolores Adamson , resigned over the deal .
" The manuscript was put together in the district office using office equipment , " she said .
" He would just come in and say ' This is what I want to do . '
I would say , ' This is not ethical , " but after a while he did n't listen . "
That office equipment , of course , was paid for by US taxpayers including you .
After these two book deals , Gingrich got smart and started his own book and movie - making operation , mostly focused on fear of Islam , which earned him and Callista ( who works there too ) a cool $ 3 million in 2010 .

GOPAC sleaze : Taxpayer subsidies for his partisan campaign course .
-- Back
Newt in his poltical career was the king of using tax - payer subsidized donations for his personal and political purposes .
He stooped so low as to hijack not one but two charities for poor inner city kids and use their donations for his personal goals .
GOPAC , Newt 's longtime political action committee , was the centerpiece of a complex network of non-profit , and mostly tax exempt organizations that Newt has used to support himself and other conservative candidates .
In an act of incredible hypocrisy , this crusader against taxes obtained taxpayer subsidies for his personal and political goals , by misusuing these tax - exempt groups .
For example , one GOPAC document said that its goal for the 1990s was " to both create and disseminate the doctrine of a majority Republican party . "
In another GOPAC document , titled " Key Factors in a House GOP Majority , " Gingrich wrote " It is more powerful and more effective to develop a reform movement parallel to the official Republican party " , instead of using the party structure , because it would get more attention and be more credible .
Shortly thereafter , GOPAC paid for a television program promoting a " grassroots " movement to reform government ; publicly they claimed it was nonpartisan , but private internal documents made its partisan goals clear .
After it got expensive , Gingrich transferred the program to the " Abraham Lincoln Opportunity Foundation , " a tax - exempt group controlled by a GOPAC official named Bo Callaway .
It had been set up years earlier to help inner city kids , which is why it was tax exempt .
The group spent $ 260,000 on the television program in 1990 .
That same year , Newt started another tax - exempt group that paid poor students for reading books .
He bragged of this in many a political speech .
But after the first two years , most of this foundation 's money went to Mel Steely , a former Gingrich aide who is now Newt 's official biographer .
The best known effort was a college course ( titled " Renewing American Civilization " ) at a small college that Gingrich nakedly used to recruit and organize conservative candidates , and to feed them his carefully constructed ideology and political slogans .
Of course , using tax - exempt educational or charitable donations for partisan purposes is illegal , and several ethics complaints were filed against Gingrich .
He agreed to pay a $ 300,000 fine for misleading the committee during the investigation , and in the process dodged conviction on the actual charges through a combination of finessing some legal definitions , sheer self - confidence and raw political power ( as Speaker of the House at the time of the complaints , he appointed the ethics committee .
Furthermore , GOPAC had one ethics committee member on its roster last session , and gave money to another . )
The Ethics Committee dropped its final charges against Gingrich not long before he resigned as speaker , despite finding that Gingrich had in fact violated one rule by repeatedly using a political consultant paid by GOPAC to develop the Republican political agenda , because there was no evidence he was continuing to do so .
The IRS also started an investigation of one group , the Progress and Freedom Foundation , for violating its tax - exempt status by donating to Gingrich 's college course .
In the investigation , the special counsel found that these activities were " substantially motivated by partisan political goals . "
The IRS eventually overruled him , and found that the course " was educational and never favored or opposed a candidate for public office . ''
It said the foundation ``did not intervene on behalf of candidates of the Republican Party merely by promoting '' themes in the course .
This extremely narrow reading of the law basically said " so what if he used the course to recruit , organize and groom candidates ; as long as they did n't say ' Vote for Jones ' , it was n't partisan . "
Despite what Gingrich fans argue , this hardly proves his innocence .
The IRS has chickened out before in political cases , notably letting the Church of Scientology completely off the hook in its investigation of that group .

Corporate reward : $ 2,500 / month to Newt 's wife -- Back
According to the Wall Street Journal , a company hired Marianne Gingrich ( Newt 's then - wife ) as an international trade consultant for $ 2,500 a month plus commissions in September 1994 -- despite her complete lack of experience -- after Newt announced support for a free trade zone in Israel that they are trying to build .
( Her previous job had been selling BeautiControl cosmetics from her home . )
Marianne 's " job " for Israel Export Development Co. was to find tenants for the trade zone .
Gingrich 's spokesman said that since her job did not involve working with the US government , there was no conflict of interest .

Who Owns Him ? --
Back
- Sherman Adelson , a Las Vegas casino owner , and his wife have EACH given $ 5 million to Newt 's SuperPAC just this spring .
2 checks , $ 10 million .
( And another $ 7 million before that . )
By amazing coincidence , Newt 's resurgence in the presidential campaign began about 10 minutes after Adelson wrote the first check .
Here you have a perfect illustration of what the Citizens United campaign has meant for presidential politics .
Even before the Adelsons dropped their $ 10 million checks , half ( $ 1 million ) of the SuperPAC 's donations came from the daughters of Adelson 's wife , and one daughter 's husband .
That 's pretty impressive , giving $ 500,000 or $ 250,000 , especially since the daughters have no job and the son - in - law is a " freelance new media consultant . "
You should n't ASSUME they got their money from Adelson -- but you'd be crazy to rule it out , at the same time .
Adelson created the COMDEX computer trade show , and owns a bunch of convention centers hotels , and big casinos ( notably the Venetian in Las Vegas , and another in Macao , China , near Hong Kong ) .
He 's worth an estimated $ 22 billion .
Adelson 's main political issue is his hard - right pro-Israel stance , supporting aggresive settlements , and opposing any peace deals that involve ANY concessions to the Palestinians .
( Sherman is on the executive committee of the lobby group AIPAC and started a free , daily right - wing newspaper in Israel .
He reportedly tried to get Condoleeza Rice fired during the Bush Administration because she tried to help negotiate a peace deal with the Palestinians . )
Remember Newt 's puzzling comment in December 2011 that the Palestinians were an " invented people " ?
That 's Adelson 's influence .
Adelson has always wanted to influence political leaders .
Jason Chudnofsky , the former CEO at COMDEX , says Adelson told him decades ago that one day , he would be " talking to ministers " and heads of state .
According to a lawsuit by a Hong Kong businessman , in 2001 Adelson called several congressmen ( including Tom Delay , then House Majority Whip ) after China asked him to use his influence in Congress to stop a human rights resolution .
( This was 3 years before his huge Macao casino opened , and while Beijing was seeking the summer Olympics . )
Adelson admitted calling the congressmen , and the bill was bottled up in committee and died .
Adelson denies undermining it , but an employee of his Sands hotel testified that he " relayed a message to the Chinese taking credit for it " according to the New York Times .
You can also expect big support for the casino industry if Newt is elected .
As far back as 1998 , Newt backed legislation preserving special tax breaks for the industry , and Sherman Adelson threw a big fundraiser at one of his hotels -- hosted by Gingrich -- and donated another $ 300,000 to the Republican Party .
- Rupert Murdoch ( see book deal above )
- Georgia 's Richards family , owners of Southwire Corporate ( $ 1.3 billion / year )
The Richardses lent and donated money and office space to Gingrich from his earliest days in politics .
They have given over $ 100,000 , and Gingrich was the first recipient of donations from Southwire 's PAC .
By coincidence , Gingrich has changed from an environmentalist critic of Southwire to a staunch anti-environmentalist during that time .
People with ties to Southwire were instrumental in two earlier lucrative book deals of Gingrich's in 1977 and 1984 ; the latter was investigated for ethical violations .

Political reporter , BBC News
Tony Blair answers e-mailed questions
Matthew Taylor - who stressed he was speaking as a " citizen " not a government spokesman - said the web could be " fantastic " for democracy .
But it was too often used to encourage the " shrill discourse of demands " that dominated modern politics .
He was speaking on the day Mr Blair carried out an online interview .
Mr Taylor said Mr Blair 's online grilling from voters - and other initiatives such as environment secretary David Miliband 's blog and Downing Street 's new online petition service - showed the government was making good progress in using the internet to become more open and accountable .
But he said more needed to be done by the web community in general to encourage people to use the internet to " solve problems " rather than simply abuse politicians or make " incommensurate " demands on them .
' Teenagers '
Speaking at an e-democracy conference in central London , he said modern politics was all about " quality of life " and that voters had a " very complex set of needs " .
The internet has immense potential but we face a real problem if the main way in which that potential expresses itself is through allowing citizens to participate in a shrill discourse of demands
Matthew Taylor
Send us your comments
The end of deference , the rapid pace of social change and growing diversity were all good things , he argued , but they also meant governments found it increasingly difficult to govern .
" We have a citizenry which can be caricatured as being increasingly unwilling to be governed but not yet capable of self - government , " Mr Taylor told the audience .
Like " teenagers " , people were demanding , but " conflicted " about what they actually wanted , he argued .
They wanted " sustainability " , for example , but not higher fuel prices , affordable homes for their children but not new housing developments in their town or village .
' Impoverished relationship '
But rather than work out these dilemmas in partnership with their elected leaders , they were encouraged to regard all politicians as corrupt or " mendacious " by the media , which he described as " a conspiracy to maintain the population in a perpetual state of self - righteous rage " .
Whether media was left wing or right wing , the message was always that " leaders are out there to shaft you " .
He went on : " At a time at which we need a richer relationship between politicians and citizens than we have ever had , to confront the shared challenges we face , arguably we have a more impoverished relationship between politicians and citizens than we have ever had .
" It seems to me this is something which is worth calling a crisis . "
Blogs
The internet , he told the conference , was part of that " crisis " .
" The internet has immense potential but we face a real problem if the main way in which that potential expresses itself is through allowing citizens to participate in a shrill discourse of demands .
" If you look at the way in which citizens are using technology and the way that is growing up , there are worrying signs that that is the case .
" What is the big breakthrough , in terms of politics , on the web in the last few years ?
It 's basically blogs which are , generally speaking , hostile and , generally speaking , basically see their job as every day exposing how venal , stupid , mendacious politicians are .
" The internet is being used as a tool of mobilisation , which is fantastic , but it only adds to the growing , incommensurate nature of the demands being made on government . "
He challenged the online community to provide more opportunities for " people to try to understand the real trade - offs that politicians face and the real dilemmas that citizens face " .
' Anti-establishment '
" I want people to have more power , but I want them to have more power in the context of a more mature discourse about the responsibilities of government and the responsibilities of citizens , " Mr Taylor told delegates .
Part of the problem , he added , was the " net - head " culture itself , which was rooted in libertarianism and " anti-establishment " attitudes .
He told delegates : " You have to be part of changing that culture .
It 's important for people who understand technology , to move from that frame of mind , which is about attacking the establishment into one which is about problem - solving and social enterprise . "
Technology should be used to encourage elected representatives to communicate better with voters , he told delegates .
Government also needed to " develop new forms of consultation and engagement that are deliberative in their form and trust citizens to get to the heart of the difficult trade - offs involved . "
And there should be more effort to make communities " work together to solve problems , " said Mr Taylor .
Mr Taylor is Tony Blair 's chief adviser on political strategy and the former head of the centre left think tank the Institute of Public Policy Research ( IPPR ) .
He is leaving Downing Street next week , after three years , to become the chief executive of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts ( RSA ) .

About 10 seconds after liftoff from runway 19 R something happens with the left engine .
Alot of smoke and fragments of metal and other material falls down on the runway .
At first the pilots do n't get any indications in the cockpit and plan to go on to Kuala Lumpur .
Then we decide to call Arlanda duty officer to make sure that they have noticed the pieces from the engine on the runway .
Shortly after that the pilots requests fueldump and return to ARN safely .

I had a brief email exchange with the developers of
[ Dialyzer ] ( http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/hipe/dialyzer/), the
static analyzer ( some might call it a type checker ) for
[ Erlang ] ( http://www.erlang.org/) programs .
Currently Dialyzer only
performs analysis on the functional fragment of Erlang and I was
enquiring whether to extend that to handle communication .
That would
allow the detection of basic input / output mismatches , e.g. when a
message is sent to a process that does not match any of the patterns
it is willing to receive .
Going further , one might be able to employ the various techniques
developed for process algebras to reason about the concurrent
behaviour of Erlang programs and , for example , detect deadlocks and
enforce information flow security properties .
A good example of such a
tool is [ TyPiCal ] ( http://www.kb.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/~koba/typical/).
It
would be amazing to have something like that for Erlang .
After all ,
what makes Erlang interesting is not the functional programming aspect
currently checked by Dialyzer , but its support for concurrency ,
distribution and fault - tolerance .
It is incredibly difficult to
correctly implement systems that involve the latter .
If there is any
area of programming in which we want the help of static analysis then
this is it !
Anyway , it turns out that there are no immediate plans to extend
Dialyzer in that direction .
However , I was pointed at some related
research that I had hitherto been unaware of : [ Karol OstrovskÃ ½ ’s PhD
thesis ] ( http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~karol/Papers/PhD.pdf), which in
Part II describes the
* sound instantiation of Kobayashi ’s generic type system for the
pi-calculus to session types ,
* extension of session types to multi-session types ( which , afaict ,
handle sessions that involve * asynchronous * comms , and servers that
handle multiple sessions * without spawning * ) ,
* application of multi-session types to type check communication of
Erlang processes .
Overall this looks like a promising attempt at constructing a
process - algebra - based type system that is decidable and yet expressive
enough to reason about non-trivial real - world protocols ( IMAP4 is used
as an example ) .
The theory behind it seems to be quite involved , but
that could just be due to the presentation format – a thesis rather
than a paper .
It will be interesting to see whether this research is
carried any further and eventually materialises in tools for Erlang .

In Geneva this week , any pretense of utility or fairness that clung to the United Nations Human Rights Council finally evaporated .
By a decisive margin , the Council voted to end its examination of Iran and Uzbekistan despite worsening human rights records in both countries .
Japan , South Korea , and Brazil were surprising votes in favor of the free passes ; they had been supported more predictably by Zimbabwe , Bangladesh , and Azerbaijan .
Successfully condemned one country only , Israel .
Repeat the above seven more times .
Voted on June 30 , 2006 , to review Israeli human rights abuses at every council session .
While investigating the Israeli - Hezbollah war , it announced that , " the Commission is not entitled , even if it had wished , to construe [ its charter ] as equally authorizing the investigation of the actions by Hezbollah in Israel . "
No bias here .
Cuba is mounting a campaign to eliminate the council 's ability to even investigate human rights .
Foreign Policy 's Passport blog has a post up about how the UN Human Rights Council has become a complete joke , a shadow of its supposed ideals .
It writes about latest developments this week in Geneva : Ironic given that Iran and Uzbekistan are perhaps some of the worst human rights violators in the world .
Could Amnesty International possibly have been wrong when it declared " a new beginning for human rights " back in May 2006 ?
No , it 's a new beginning alright .
It 's an era of greater protection for human rights violators and back - patting for the insane leftists who supported its creation !
Everyone wins !
( Except the victims , but who are they , really ? )
In nearly a year , here is a brief list of some of the Human Rights Council 's greatest accomplishemnts :
And that 's just some of them , but you can see the single - mindedness and uselessness of it all .
Even the Human Rights
Watch people are having to admit that their early optimism was clearly misplaced as best .
Human rights is n't an issue that can be politicized and decided upon in the context of regional and despotic politics .
But even when the council 's democratic members do n't stand up for them , all hope is lost .
Human rights are black - and - white .
Only when a system based on objectivity and professionalism is put into place can a human rights council have any purpose other than making things worse .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
British bookmakers have reduced the odds on finding extra-terrestrial intelligence after the discovery of a planet that may be able to sustain life .
William Hill lowered its odds on Wednesday -- from 1000 / 1 to 100/1 -- in the wake of the astronomical discovery , which was announced Tuesday .
The planet , which is 20.5 light years from Earth and orbits the star Gliese 581 , is being described as " Earth - like " by NASA experts .
William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe said the bookmakers could face a payout in the tens of millions of pounds if extra- terrestrial life was found .
" We felt we had to react to the news that an Earth - like planet , which could support intelligent life had been discovered , " Sharpe said .
" After all , we do n't know for sure that intelligent extra- terrestrial life has not already been discovered , but is being hushed up . "
Scientists at the Search for Extra- Terrestrial Life Institute ( SETI ) plan to monitor the planet and its system for signs of intelligent life .
" The older the star is , maybe the greater the chance that it has produced something that 's clever , " SETI spokesman Dr Seth Shostak said .
William
Hill has taken on many seemingly outlandish bets over past 50 years , some of which have resulted in big payouts .
In the early 1960s the bookmaker offered odds of 1000 / 1 that man would walk on the moon before 1970 , and was forced to pay the equivalent of 1 million pounds ( $ 2 million ) to its customers .
Before the alien wager is paid out , the Prime Minister must officially confirm the existence of intelligent extra-terrestrial life within a year of the bet being placed .
With the discovery of the new planet , William Hill may still have to pay at the original 1000 / 1 odds if alien life is found by April 23 , 2008 .
Barbara Simpson , 68 , nicknamed the " birdwoman " , was jailed in 1997 after neighbours complained her garden was six inches deep in nuts and seed .
She is now accused by neighbours of attracting noisy flocks of seagulls and sparrows outside her flat in Weymouth .
Weymouth and Portland Borough Council has threatened legal action .
' Compulsive urge '
Principle environmental health officer Jane Light said : " It is difficult because we are trying to be reasonable .
She could n't bear to see the birds she has grown to love over the years starve
Purvaise Punwar
" If we can't get her to stop this excessive putting food out for birds then we have no choice but to go down the legal route .
" We are prepared to act , " she said .
When Mrs Simpson came before Winchester Crown Court in 1997 , the court heard that she had a compulsive urge to stock her 24 - foot - square bird table with food .
Purvaise Punwar , Mrs Simpson 's legal representative at the time , told the court : " The reason she broke the order was quite simply , try as she might , she could n't bear to see the birds she has grown to love over the years starve . "
We are a family business based on a shared passion for food .
We recognise food has one primary aim : to serve and to satisfy people .
We also understand the power of food to bring friends and families together .
Food is about unity , growth , sharing , friendship , teamwork , imagination , innovation , change , enthusiasm , endurance , exuberance , creation and serving people .
These are the things food represents to us and they are the best way we can represent ourselves and our business .
So these qualities are our core values at kirkfood ; the principles upon which we choose to run our business .
It ’s all about food for people .
To us this means good food and good service .
Simple .
Founded in 1985 , we have been operating for over 25 years .
Traditionally our core enterprise has been as a food wholesaler servicing other foodservice and retail operators in Melbourne and Sydney with fine food ingredients , in particular local and imported cheese .
In most cases in the Melbourne and Sydney markets we are supplying specialty food , luxury food , gourmet food and imported food and we offer daily service .
Our network of distributors covers most areas of New South Wales , Victoria , Queensland and Western Australia .

「 A New Way to look at Networking ( Google Video ) 」 を見ました 。 Van Jacobson氏による1時間21分のプレゼン映像でした。
ビデオでは、コペルニクス的発想が必要だとか、昔は電話システムを前提に皆が議論をしていたからインターネットの仕組みはあり得ないと当初は皆が言っていた、という内容の事を何度か言っています。
確かに、私も聞いていて「 WinnyかBitTorrentをDRMと組み合わせたもの？」という感じの方法論を考えてしまいました。
恐らく、今の仕組みで作ってしまう方法を考えるのではなく、アーキテクチャとしてこの案を考えなくてはならないという物だと思いました。
きっと、ここで言っている話が実現するとIPの上でも動くけど、下にその他の通信形態が来ても動くという新たなアドレッシング手法に近いものを提案しているのだと思いました。
どうしても現状の仕組みでやってしまう方法を考えてしまう私は、今のインターネットという仕組みが成し得た成功に毒されているのだと思いました。
でも、これを語っているの がVan Jacobson氏じゃなかったら「ふーん」で終わってしまいそうな気もしました。
きっと非常に深く色々考えた上で言っている気はしますが、非常に難しい話をしていると感じました。
難しい話でしたが非常に面白かったです。
インターネット設計時の思想などに興味を持たれた方は、
2006年6月6日ごろに本ブログで紹介している「 The Design Philosophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols 」 という論文を読むとインターネットの設計思想がわかって楽しいかもしれません。
以下、ビデオの内容を要約してみました。 聞き間違いや勘違いをしている可能性があるので、詳細はビデオをご覧下さい。
なお、以下で章立てのように表現しているのは、長くなってしまったためです。
プレゼン中でこのように分かれているわけではありません。
後半は私が力尽きているので要約がいい加減になっています。 ご注意下さい。 ( 1時間20分の講演映像を見て要約するのに4時間強かかってしまいました。。。)
Van Jacobson氏紹介
Van Jacobson氏は、インターネットに関する著名な研究者です。 今のTCPの元と成る仕組みを考案したり、traceroute,pathchar,tcpdumpの作者の一人だったりします。 また 、M-Bone( Multicast Backbone ) を作ったメンバーでもあります。 vic , vat , wbなども作っています 。
問題意識
アメリカでのネットワークに関する研究が行き詰っている気がしています。
本当はネットワーキングの研究をするにはすばらしい時期であるはずです。
何でもネットワークにつながっているし、それぞれお互いにつながっています。
でも、日々、ネットワークでやろうとしていることが難しくなっています。
例えば、無線はうまくいかない場合が多くなっています。
ポータブルデバイスでの情報共有もうまくいっていません。
色々、個々の問題を解決するツールはあるが、それぞれAd-hocに特定の問題のみを解決するものばかりです。
もしかしたら、もともとのアーキテクチャが間違っているのかもしれません。
60年代と70年代は今の状況に似ていました。 ネットワークと言えば電話でした。 研究者達はデータを電話上に乗せようとしていて失敗していました。
最近はそのときの状況に似ているかもしれません。
もしかしたら、やりたいことはインターネットにあっていないのかもしれません。
それは、インターネットの問題ではなく、問題自身が変わってしまったのかも知れません。
ネットワークの歴 史
Generation 1 : 電話( 電話線が注目されていた )
Generation 2 : インターネット( Endpointが注目されていた )
Generation 3 : dissemination [普及 ] ( データが注目される )
電話システムとインターネット
電話システムの本質は電話をかけることではありません。 電話システムはwire matrix上でコネクションを作る事が本質です。 wire上でpath(経路)を作るのが電話をかけることです。
電話番号というのは、相手の電話を表すものではなく、途中での回線の経路を表しています。
70年代の課題は、爆弾を落とされてもネットワークが利用できるようにする事でした。
当時は、信頼性が全く無い安物を組み合わせて、どれか一つの箇所が失敗しても問題のない巨大システムを作りあげることが課題でした。
これは、電話システムとは全く逆の発想です。
当時、ネットワークの研究は皆それに注目していました。
当初は電話でどうやってやっていくかを皆が考えていました。
それは、昔は電話しかコミュニケーションしかなかったからです。
「 電話だけが通信手段じゃないんじゃない」と言い出した人がいました。
データを小分けにして出す。 皆で同じ経路を使ってデータを流す。
小分けにしたデータをパケットと呼ぶ。 送る先がわからなければ、次の人に任せてしまおう。 という発想でした。
最初は皆が、これは絶対に動かないと言っていました。
でも、71年にネットワークを知らないがアイディアを気にいったARPAのヘッドがARPAnetを作りました。 当初、ARPAnetは電話線の上に構築されました。
そのため、電話屋さんはそれはネットワークじゃなくて、電話を使っているだけだと言っていました。
IPネットワークが電話上にあろうが、Ethernet上だろうが気にするものではないということに皆が気づくまで10年かかりました。
当時、他の人たちは、電話線用の経路セットアップを早くするにはどうすれば良いかばかりを考えていました。
次に、各自が勝手にネットワークを作って、それらを接続する事と考え出した。 encapsulation方法とアドレッシング方法に基準さえあれば良いということになりました。
これが70年代後半です。 当初はCATENETという名前だったが、軍が3文字を好むようなのでTCP/IPという名前になりました。
TCP /IPは、セットアップを何もせず、電話のように厳密な経路を考える必要は無く、
とりあえずパケットを投げてみて届かなければもう一度投げなおす、という方式でした。
TCP / IPが勝った要因
信頼性はシステムサイズが大きくなるにつれて指数関数的に向上する
呼に対してセットアップが必要ないため、どのような帯域、送信間隔、送信規模でも大丈夫
分散された経路成魚によって、どのようなトポロジでも利用可能になった
動的な経路制御によって、システムが障害から回復できる
電話システムは、自己構築しません。 一方 、IPネットワークはつないだ瞬間に使えるようになります。 IPアドレスさえもらえば、中央の機器を設定しなくても通信できるようになります。
現状の問題 点
TCP /IP があまりにうまく行き過ぎたので、当初電話があったときのように、思考がTCP/IPが最適という方向に行ってしまっています。
今のデータがリッチな環境はTCP/IPが当初作られたときに想定していたものではありません。
そんなに機器が大きかったわけではないし、データの種類も今ほどあったわけでもありません。
今の問題は、インターネットにつながっているかどうかが全てになってしまっていることです。
つながっていると全ての情報にアクセスできるし、つながっていなければ何もできない。 IPアドレスを持っているかどうかが全てになってしまっています。
現在のネットワークは動くものは嫌いです。 現状の技術では、動いているものに対して接続性を維持するのが難しくなっています。
結局、動いているものに対しての一番良いのはブロードキャストする事です。
でも、インターネットはブロードキャストとの相性は良くありません。
IPは1対1が前提です。 例えば、1000人のうちの1人に対してデータを送りたいために、ブロードキャストをしてしまって999人がデータを捨ててしまうのは良くありません。
TCP / IP は世界を変えました。 でもTCP/IPが作り上げた世界が成熟しきってきたら、今度はTCP/IPがスケールしなくなってきました。
TCP/IPが悪いわけではなく、問題が変わってしまったのです。
TCP /IPでは、ネットワークはコネクションにしか注目できません。
ネットワークレベルでのセキュリティというものはできません。 例えば、SSLで各コネクションを守ることはできても、SPAMは来てしまいます。
データにフォーカ ス
重要なのは、どこにデータがあるかではありません。
データはどこか特定の場所にあるわけではありません。
データはサーバに入っているものではなく、概念的てきなものです。

And what happened to these girls ?
According to the International Planned Parenthood Federation ( a term that takes on a whole new meaning when referring to China ) , there are about seven million abortions in China per year , 70 percent of which are estimated to be of females .
That adds up to around five million per year , or 50 million by the end of the decade ; so where are the other 10 million girls ?
If even 10 percent end up in orphanages ... well , you do the math .
A few months ago , in a conversation with my friend Patrick Mason , executive director of the International Adoption Center at INOVA Fairfax Hospital in Virginia , I confessed a growing fear : that China , the country from which my two daughters were adopted , would sooner or later shut down its international adoption program .
Dr. Mason immediately dismissed my concern , saying , “ The number of orphans is just too great . ”
And yet , I continued to wonder whether , as China increasingly asserts itself on the world stage and prepares to host the 2008 Summer Olympics , allowing Westerners to adopt thousands of infants each year would fit the image it wanted to project .
I suspect not , and China ’s new restrictions lead me to believe that national pride is more important than getting these children into loving homes .
The issue of abandoned and institutionalized children remains a taboo subject in China , a problem the government does not even acknowledge exists .
The impulse to hide it seems to stem partly from embarrassment and partly from fear of revealing the grave human rights abuses the one - child policy has produced ; surely , watching a parade of well - off foreigners cart off thousands of babies would make the Chinese authorities understandably uncomfortable .
But the answer is not to stop the foreigners from adopting ; it is to put an end to their reasons for doing so .
My fondest hope , and the hope of thousands of parents who have adopted from China , is for all the orphanages there to close because there are no more abandoned children to put in them .
This will be accomplished only when China decides that there is no economic or political justification for the magnitude of suffering that has resulted from the one - child policy .
The government must openly acknowledge the problem , in part by publishing verifiable information about the status of its orphaned children , and take real steps to correct it .
To do so would go a long way toward building the international trust and respect China seems to want so badly .
" Communism is idiotcy , " he reckoned .
" They want to divide up the property .
Suppose they did it -- it requires brains to keep money as well as make it .
. . .
The division would have to be re-made every three years or it would do the communist no good . "

Example by exami ...
On our most recent trip to Indonesia , Morgen and I were reading Simon Winchester ’s 2003 book Krakatoa , a history of the devastating 1883 eruption of the eponymous volcano ( known locally as Krakatau ) .
A couple of hundred pages into the book , the volcano has n’t yet erupted , but we ’ve learned about Darwin , the spice trade , Dutch colonization , and a long list of other things that , in one way or another , illuminate the circumstances surrounding that cataclysmic blast and how it affected the world at that time .
Just as Winchester gets ready to describe the big bang itself , he mentions the fact that animals sometimes appear to be aware of an imminent seismic event , changing their behavior markedly just before it happens — often by fleeing , but sometimes by making noise or otherwise acting erratically .
Winchester writes : “ There is no firm scientific evidence that there is a connection , nor is there a true basis for a new pseudo - science called ethogeographical prediction , which seeks to forecast earthquakes by observing carefully calibrated animal activity . ”
He says that while some geologists concede that animals might sense changes too subtle to register on modern instruments , no one has been able to prove a connection between animal behavior and impending earthquakes or volcanic activity .
Nevertheless , a good deal of anecdotal evidence supports this notion , including a particularly interesting tale of a circus elephant that seemingly “ predicted ” the Krakatoa eruption .
I was unaware of the existence of anything called “ ethogeographical prediction , ” but I always enjoy learning about wacky pseudoscientific undertakings .
So I consulted the usual search engines and found exactly one page on the entire web that mentioned the phrase “ ethogeographical prediction ” ; it was a review of Winchester ’s book .
( There are now at least two , including this one ! )
I then tried searching on “ ethogeology ” instead and found another , different page — also a review of the book .
Great , but I was no better informed as to who is engaged in this study or with what result .
A quick scan of the book ’s bibliography provided no obvious clues , either , so it could be that Winchester himself coined the term or that it simply has n’t caught on widely yet .
In any case , it ’s clear that ethogeology is a portmanteau of ethology ( the study of animal behavior ) and geology .
Nothing to See Here
Even though no one referred to ethogeology by name , I did find lots of information about how animals behave oddly before various kinds of natural disasters .
The way writers often address the subject matter is by asking , rhetorically , whether this proves that animals are psychic , have E.S.P. , or are in some other way supernaturally gifted .
In most cases , the writers end up debunking such claims , but I find it troubling that the question is even asked in the first place .
I ’m pretty sure it ’s common knowledge that dogs have a superior sense of smell and that bats use echolocation to find their prey , to take two common examples of animal abilities that exceed those of humans .
This , I can assure you , is more of the same — nothing mystical at all is going on .
Unfortunately , no one can yet demonstrate by precisely what mechanism animals apparently become aware of an upcoming earthquake .
One theory is that certain animals can hear ultra - low - frequency sounds generated by seismic activity just before an earthquake .
Another is that they can feel tiny vibrations in the ground when a quake is brewing .
Based on these theories , some researchers are trying to construct measuring devices that mimic the anatomical structures that might be picking up the noises or vibrations .
If they work , they could provide some hard data that might lead to more reliable early warning systems .
But that ’s a big “ if . ”
I Smell a Volcano
As a matter of fact , we do n’t currently know for sure whether animals can be aware of future seismic events at all .
It seems that they can , but even if so , clearly this is true only for certain animals , in certain situations , at certain times — which is a little unsatisfying scientifically .
Supposing that someone could prove this adequately , the next step would be to quantify it .
What does a particular behavior of a particular animal indicate ?
In order to use animals to predict earthquakes , we ’d need a little more to go on than “ if Spot starts growling , there might be an earthquake soon . ”
It could also mean that Spot is hungry , for instance .
Getting any truly reliable data is going to be awfully hard , because you ’ll never reproduce , in a controlled laboratory setting , the exact conditions of an impending volcanic eruption ; nor can you interview your test subjects to find out what they hear , feel , or think .
Seismic events are not the only disasters animals are said to predict .
I ’ve read stories of animals behaving strangely just before hurricanes , typhoons , and thunderstorms , for example .
To study these phenomena , however , we ’re going to need an entirely new field : ethometeorology , a term that was , surprisingly , found on zero other webpages before today .
I predict linguistic storms in the near future .

Although not as well known as other vulnerability types such as buffer overflows , format string vulnerabilities have been known to exist in C and C++ programs since at least 1999 , when a format string vulnerability was found in AnswerBook2 ( cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-1999-1417 ) .
Formatted output became a major focus of the security community in June 2000 , when a format string vulnerability was discovered in the Washington University ftpd ( WU - FTPD ) software package ( www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/29823).
But format string vulnerabilities are not limited to programs written in C and C ++.
Other languages that include format strings include Perl , PHP , Java , Python , and Ruby .
While these languages are relatively immune from buffer overflows because they maintain dynamic arrays and strings for programmers , programs written in them may still contain format string vulnerabilities .
Format string vulnerabilities result from including data from an untrusted source , such as a user , in a format string .
Format strings are used by input and output routines to specify a conversion between a character string and a set of data values .
The following example shows how the C function printf ( ) accepts a format string and a set of values :
printf ( " %s Pop : % 11d
" , country , pop ) ;
and produces a string :
United States Pop : 295734134
In the format string , the % begins a conversion specification .
This is followed by a set of formatting parameters and the data type .
The %s conversion specifier instructs printf ( ) to output a string value ( the value passed as an argument ) .
The % 11d conversion specifier instructs printf ( ) to output a decimal value ( the " d " ) in an 11 - character field .
Format strings can be much more complicated , including flags , precisions , length modifiers , and even variable widths specified in parameters .
Directly including user input in a format string lets an attacker inject format specifications into the format string .
This is particularly problematic in programming languages that support the relatively unknown %n specification .
This unusual specification causes the number of characters successfully written so far to be stored in the integer whose address is given as the argument .
If attackers can write data values to memory , they can often leverage that to gain control of the system .
Even if the language does not support %n , an attacker may cause the format string to include more specifications than parameters .
Depending on what stack protection exists in the language , an attacker may be able to access private data , avoid logging , or crash the program .
( Writing exploits for a format string vulnerability is beyond the scope of this work .
For a more detailed explanation , see Robert Seacord 's Secure Programming in C and C++ ; Addison - Wesley , 2005 . )
Format string vulnerabilities often result from a programmer being unaware that a particular routine takes a format string .
For example , you can write :
snprintf ( str , sizeof ( str ) , " Wrong password for email %s " , email ) ; syslog ( LOG_WARNING , str ) ;
Unfortunately , the syslog ( ) routine uses its second parameter as a format string .
As a result , if an attacker inputs an e-mail of " webmaster %s %s %s % [ email protected ] " , syslog ( ) looks for parameters to interpret the %s conversion specifiers in the format , most likely resulting in the program crashing .
A more advanced attack may use %n to gain control of the system .
Another common source of format string vulnerabilities is when you need to write an error to more than one location .
For simplicity , you may construct the string using snprintf ( ) and then use one routine to print the message to a log and another routine to output the message to the end user in some way , such as in a message box .
If either routine allows for format strings , you must be careful to include the format specification in the call :
fprintf ( log , " %s " , logmessage ) ;
instead of neglecting it as in the following call :
fprintf ( log , logmessage ) ;
The first invocation is the correct one , avoiding a format string vulnerability by specifying that a string ( %s ) should be outputted and then providing that string .
Because the second is shorter and may correspond to how you are thinking about the desired behavior , you may write the statement in this fashion without considering the consequences .
In this article , I explore the potential consequences of format string vulnerabilities in Perl , PHP , Java , Python , and Ruby programs .
Crypto researchers have discovered a new , much faster , attack against the widely - used SHA - 1 hashing algorithm .
Xiaoyun Wang , one of the team of Chinese cryptographers that demonstrated earlier attacks against SHA - 0 and SHA - 1 , along with Andrew Yao and Frances Yao , have discovered a way to produce a collision in SHA - 1 over just 263 hash operations compared to 269 hash operations previously .
A brute force attack should take 280 operations .
One - way hashing is used in many applications such as creating checksums used to validate files , creating digital certificates , authentication schemes and in VPN security hardware .
Collisions occur when two different inputs produce the same output hash .
In theory this might be used to forge digital certificates but it should n't be possible to find collisions except by blind chance .
Wang and her team have discovered an algorithm for finding collisions much faster than brute force .
The researchers released a paper ( PDF ) on their finding at the Crypto 2005 conference in Santa Barbara , California earlier this week .
" The SHA - 1 collision search is squarely in the realm of feasibility , " writes noted cryptographer Bruce Schneier in a posting to his web log .
" Some research group will try to implement it .
Writing working software will both uncover hidden problems with the attack , and illuminate hidden improvements .
And while a paper describing an attack against SHA - 1 is damaging , software that produces actual collisions is even more so . "
The US National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) recently advised the US government to phase out SHA - 1 in favor of SHA - 256 and SHA - 512 .
NIST is holding a workshop on the subject in late October . ®
性懲りも無く組織論をやってみましたが、まだまだ期は熟さずが大勢ですね。今回は必ずもめる日医問題をできるだけ回避してみたのですが、なかなか方向性は一致しませんね。ネット医師の意識分類を昨日書いたのを再掲しますが、
静観派
焼野原になって本当に国民が困るまで放置すれば良い派
焼野原は本音では困るがあきらめ派
行動派
今すぐにでも真剣に崩壊をくい止めたい派
崩壊は必然だろうがそれでもなんとかしたい派
大分類2つに小分類2つで4類型にしているのですが、よく見るとほとんどがあきらめ派になっています。もちろん4類型に等分の比率で属しているわけでは無いでしょうが、行動派の右翼である真剣くい止め派は少なそうな気がします。ちなみに私は行動派の左翼です。強いて言えばダメモト派と言う感じでしょうか。
組織論の論議が盛り上がらないのはやはり静観派がかなり多数を占めているからだと考えます。行動派の思考としては「ここまで来たらなんとか結集して･･･」に発想が向かうのですが、静観派としてはまだまだ崩壊が十分でないの認識になります。この意識の差は組織論への態度に明確に現れます。
ここで誤解はして欲しくなのですが、静観派が悪いと言っているのではないのです。現時点の取るべき戦略が何がベストなのかは誰にも分かりません。組織論にしても後で「あそこで結集していたら･･･」になるか「あれは時期尚早の無駄な動きだった」になるかは結果を見ないと分からないと考えています。ダメモト派としては定期的に提案して議論はして見るぐらいの試みはしなければならないと言うところです。
医療を変えるのは国であり、国の医療を変えれるのは政治家です。そして政治家を動かすのは世論なのですが、静観派としては世論が変わるには医療崩壊から焼野原が一番であり無為こそ上策となります。この結論は医療危機の様々な因子を総合して考えても相当な説得力があります。故武見太郎元会長時代は遥か遠くの神話時代となり、それ以後急速に政治的発言力を低下させている医療界の声は誰も聞かなくなっています。
発言力が小さくなっている医療界の声を聞いてもらうには、医療界の声を聞きにきてもらわなければなりません。医療界の声は相手が聞く気にならない限り聞こえない状況なのです。そのためには聞きに行かざるを得ない状況を作らなければ仕方がないと考えます。その状況が医療崩壊から焼野原であり、誰にも目に見えて、肌身に感じるぐらいの医療の荒廃が出現して初めて聞きに来る状況になると言う事です。
その状況にならない限り医療界の声を真剣に聞いての医療再生はありえず、中途半端な医療危機の段階では現場の医師の現状を全く無視した机上の空案の乱舞しか無いだろうとの観測です。そういう机上の空案の乱舞が医療崩壊を加速させるのですが、それさえも究極目標である医療の声を聞いてもらえる状況に着々と近づいているとも見れると言う事です。
ダメモト派としては歯がゆいですが、現状では「無為こそ上策」の方針をひっくり返すほどの上策は思い浮かびません。そうなればダメモト派の足掻きとしてはWikiJBMでも充実させて、話を聞きに来る日の準備でもしておくのが補完策として有効と言う事になります。WikiJBMはあれでもメンバー制ですから、一つの研究拠点として焼野原後に少しは役に立つような気はしています。
春までは無為こそ上策で静観するのが現時点ではベターとの現状認識としておきたいと思います。
Former FBI contract linguist - turned - whistleblower Sibel Edmonds and investigative reporter James Bamford discuss the Department of Justice ’s abuse of the “ State ’s Secrets Privilege ” to keep Edmonds from telling all she knows about high - level corruption in the Turkish Lobby , the State and Defense Departments and the Congress , a new petition by over 30 organizations demanding hearings into her case and a new FBI whistle - blower , who ’s letter the the Department of Justice ’s Inspector General [ . pdf ] reveals that all those wiretaps Edmonds was transcribing were illegal â€ “ begun on warrants under the much easier to satisfy - Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act in cases of public corruption .
MP3 here .
( 30:44 )
For background , listen to my February 28 , 2007 interview with Sibel Edmonds expert Luke Ryland here .
Sibel Edmonds began working for the FBI shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks .
Until the spring of 2002 she worked in the FBI ’s Washington field office translating top - secret documents pertaining to suspected terrorists .
She first gained wide public attention in October of that year when she appeared on ’ 60 Minutes ’ on CBS and charged that the FBI , State Department , and Pentagon had been infiltrated by agents of a Turkish intelligence officer suspected of ties to terrorism .
She also accused members of the FBI ’s translation services of sabotage , intimidation , corruption and incompetence .
On October 18 , 2002 , at the request of FBI Director Robert Mueller , Attorney General Ashcroft imposed a gag order on Ms. Edmonds , citing possible damage to diplomatic relations or national security .
James Bamford is the author of The Puzzle Palace : A Report on NSA , Americaâ€™s Most Secret Agency .
Published in 1982 , it was the first book ever written about the National Security Agency and it became an immediate bestseller .
He spent nearly a decade as the Washington Investigative Producer for ABCâ€™s World News Tonight with Peter Jennings where he won a number of journalism awards for his coverage national security issues .
In 1997 , as the media profession began turning away from international news coverage and focusing almost exclusively on Monica Lewinsky and other domestic political scandals , Bamford left ABC to work on Body of Secrets : Anatomy of the Ultra - Secret National Security Agency .
Initially published in April 2001 to rave reviews , it also became a national bestseller .
His book A Pretext for War : 9/11 , Iraq and the Abuse of America ’s Intelligence Agencies remains one of the best resources on how the Cheney / Neocon cabal lied this country to war in Iraq .
Bamfordâ€™s articles have appeared in dozens of publications , including cover stories for the New York Times Magazine , the Washington Post Magazine , and the Los Angeles Times Magazine .
I am watching Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer right now and even though Senator Barack Obama drew a crowd of over 15,000 people in Oakland and held a massive fund - raiser at the Mark Hopkins in San Francisco , there was no mention of him in the discussion of presidential candidates on the program .

Economy weakest in three years
GDP grew at a 1.6 percent rate in third quarter , down from 2.6 percent in the second ; inflation gauge retreats .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Economic growth slowed to the weakest pace in more than three years in the third quarter , as the government 's main gauge of the strength of the U.S. economy came in much lower than analysts had forecast .
Gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the broadest measure of the nation 's economy , grew at a 1.6 percent annual rate in the quarter , the Commerce Department said , down from the 2.6 percent rate in the second quarter .
Quick Vote
What was the top business news story of the past week ?
Fed holds rates steady , wary about inflation Home prices in decline Dow extends record rally Economic growth weakest in 3 years Exxon Mobil posts 2nd highest quarterly profit in U.S. history or View results
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast a slowdown to 2.1 percent .
While the slower than expected economic growth is n't a positive , some economists argued the economy appears poised to bounce back in the current quarter , helped by lower energy prices .
Moreover , the slower growth , and a price reading in the report that showed less inflation pressures than expected , raised hopes that the Federal Reserve could start to cut interest rates early next year , as the central bank tries to find the balance between economic growth and price stability .
Weaker growth in the quarter was attributable in part to a rising trade gap , which subtracts from GDP , as well as a slump in the nation 's housing market .
Consumer spending also came in a bit weaker than expected .
The news was not well timed for the Bush administration as Republicans try to hold onto Congress as polls show the Democrats poised to make gains .
While the war in Iraq has held much of the focus of the election debate , and other key parts of the economy , notably the stock market and employment , are still relatively strong , the Democrats were quick to seize on the GDP report as a further sign of problems in administration policy .
" Once again , the Bush economy is going in the wrong direction , " said a statement from Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D - N.Y. , the senior House Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee .
" An economic recovery that never benefited working Americans in the first place now has slowed to a crawl . "
More than two hours after the release of the GDP report , the press offices for the White House , the Commerce Department and the Treasury Department said that they had no statement on the report .
On Wall Street , stocks fell modestly after the report , on the heels of a string of record highs for the Dow Jones industrial average .
Treasury bond prices rose on the news , trimming the yield on the 10 - year note to 4.69 percent , as investors bet that inflation is in check .
The report 's closely watched inflation reading , the so - called core PCE deflator that measures of prices paid by consumers for goods other than food and energy , climbed at a 2.3 percent rate in the quarter , down from 2.7 percent in the second quarter .
Some economists had been looking for a 2.5 percent rate , and the 2.3 percent rate is closer to the 2.0 level that is widely considered to be in the Fed 's comfort zone .
The Fed has cited the slowing economy as it has held rates steady at its past three meetings , following 17 straight rate hikes over the previous two years .
" This is a market - friendly number , " said Anthony Chan , chief economist for JPMorgan Private Client Services .
" It certainly extinguishes much of the chatter going on from some Fed officials about a rate hike or an indefinite pause . "
The housing market in particular has cut into economic growth .
Investment in residential real estate tumbled 17 percent in the quarter after sinking at an 11 percent rate in the prior quarter .
That contrasts to 7 percent growth in housing investment in the third quarter of 2005 and a 20 percent jump in the second quarter as the homebuilding boom shifted into high gear .
But recently homebuilders have cut back on construction because of a glut of homes on the market .
Two of the biggest builders , Pulte Home ( Charts ) and Centex ( Charts ) , both reported sharply lower earnings and cut their forecasts this week , and Pulte announced it would cut 10 percent of its staff .
Automakers have also seen slumping sales and rising inventories , causing Ford Motor ( Charts ) and the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler ( Charts ) to post losses and announce production cuts .
Even with improved results at General Motors ( Charts ) the company cut output at U.S. factories in the quarter .
But there had been expectations of stronger consumer spending , helped by falling energy prices .
The report showed consumer spending rose at a 3.1 percent rate in the quarter .
While that 's up from the 2.6 percent rate in the second quarter , it was less than the 3.5 percent forecast by some economists .
Wal - Mart Stores ( Charts ) , the No. 1 retailer , reported a 7.3 percent rise in total U.S. sales compared to a year earlier , although that was helped by its continued increase in the number of stores .
Major retail chains as a group reported even stronger sales gains over the period .

The blogosphere is varied and growing at a steady rate
In its latest State of the Blogosphere report , it said the number of blogs it was tracking now stood at more than 14.2 m blogs , up from 7.8 m in March .
It suggests , on average , the number of blogs is doubling every five months .
Blogs , the homepages of the 21st Century , are free and easy to set up and use .
They are popular with people who want to share thoughts online .
They allow for the instant publication of ideas and for interactive conversations , through comments , with friends or strangers .
Global voices
Technorati is like a search engine that keeps track of what is happening in the blogosphere , the name given to the universe of weblogs .
It relies on people tagging - giving keywords to - their blogs or blog posts so that its search engine can find them .
Free blogging services such as those provided by MSN Spaces , Blogger , LiveJournal , AOL Journals , WordPress and Movable Type were also growing quickly , said the report .
Blogs are easy to use and can be subscribed to
It also pointed to the growth in moblogs , blogs to which people with camera phones automatically send pictures and text .
Other services , such as the Google toolbar and the Flickr photo sharing website , have implemented " blog this " buttons , which also make it easier for people to post content they like on the web straight to their blogs .
The voices in the blogosphere are also sounding less US - centric , with blog growth spotted in Japan , Korea , China , UK , France , and Brazil .
Varied sphere
What is clear is that the blogosphere is highly varied , with blogs coming in many shapes and forms , whether they be professional or for personal use .
Blogs have been used as campaign sites , as personal diaries , as art projects , online magazines and as places for community networking .
Much of their appeal has been boosted because readers can subscribe to them , for free , to stay updated of any new posts automatically .
Blogs have played a part in highlighting issues that journalists have not covered .
They have also proved to be a valuable communication channel for journalists in repressed countries who have no other publishing means .
They have recently shown how they can also complement and enhance mainstream press in coverage of events , such as the recent London terror attacks .
The Technorati report did not , however , break down the blogosphere in terms of gender use .
Over the weekend , the BlogHer conference took place in the US , which saw a gathering of almost 300 bloggers talk over blogging issues which are pertinent to women , and to men .
The comments were made during a case involving a Chinese man
Sheriff Margaret Gimblett cleared student Hui Yu , 23 , from Beijing , of a motoring offence on Friday .
During the case , she reportedly told Greenock Sheriff Court that at first glance all Chinese people can look the same to a native Scot .
Community groups said the remark was neither derogatory nor offensive and many Chinese feel the same about Scots .
Sheriff Gimblett dismissed evidence from two police officers who identified Mr Yu .
She reportedly said a person would only begin to see the differences in a Chinese person after looking at them for quite some time .
I do n't think she meant to make a derogatory remark at all and many Chinese people feel the same about us
Janice Dickson
Scotland - China Association
Sam Chau , headteacher at the Chinese School at Stow College in Glasgow , said he did not find the sheriff 's comments offensive .
He said : " I would n't say it was an accurate comment but it does sound like a fair comment .
" It does n't sound offensive , because when she said that all Chinese people look the same , she said they looked the same at first glance .
' Quite difficult '
" From my point of view , when I look at local people - the indigenous Scottish people - at first glance all of them look the same to me . "
Janice Dickson , chairwoman of the Scotland - China Association , said she thought that the sheriff 's comments were accurate .
She said : " It can be quite difficult with Chinese people if you do n't know them quite well .
" It would be difficult to differentiate and remember a Chinese face .
" I do n't think she meant to make a derogatory remark at all and many Chinese people feel the same about us . "

A distinctive , repeating sequence of DNA found in people living at the eastern edge of Russia is also widespread among Native Americans , according to a new study .
The finding lends support to the idea that Native Americans descended from a common founding population that lived near the Bering land bridge for some time .
Kari Schroeder at the University of California in Davis , US , and colleagues sampled the genes from various populations around the globe , including two at the eastern edge of Siberia , 53 elsewhere in Asia and 18 Native American populations .
The study examined samples from roughly 1500 people in total , including 445 Native Americans .

The team looked for a series of nine repeating chunks of DNA , known as 9RA , which falls in a non-coding region of chromosome 9 .
They found the 9RA sequence in at least one member of all the Native American populations tested , such as the Cherokee and Apache people .
The two populations in eastern Siberia , where the Bering land bridge once connected Asia to North America , also tested positive for the 9RA sequence .
The 9RA sequence did not appear in any of the other Asian populations examined in the study , including those from other parts of Siberia , from Mongolia or Japan .
Multiple migrations ?
According to Schroeder , the high prevalence of this gene marker among native populations of North and South America – and its absence in most of Asia – lends strong support to the idea that Native Americans can trace their ancestry to a common founding population .
The 9RA mutation probably occurred in an ancestral population located at the eastern edge of Siberia , which subsequently migrated over the Bering land bridge , Schroeder says ( watch how the land bridge was gradually submerged as see levels rose ) .
There may have been multiple migrations from this founding population , occurring thousands of years apart , she adds .
“ How many times did people cross the Bering land bridge ?
That would be a very difficult question to answer , ” says Jeffrey Long at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor , Michigan , US , who contributed to the new study .
Other experts have previously suggested that Native Americans do not share a common ancestry because of the linguistic and dental differences among populations .

How Our Civilization Can Fall
There 's a right way and a wrong way to learn from history .
The wrong way is to make an analogy between some event in the past and our present situation , and then assume that everything will work the same .
For instance : Rome was the hyperpower of the ancient world , and it fell , so we 're going to fall , too !
Analogies might make an interesting point or raise an intriguing possibility , but they prove nothing .
America is like Rome in some ways , and radically different in others .
You can't just ignore the differences and think you 've said anything smart .
What 's the right way ?
It 's to discover general principles and then see if they work out consistently over time .
Let 's take Rome again .
First , a lot of people will point out that the Roman Empire did n't actually fall until the 1400s -- there was continuity between the Roman Republic , the great Mediterranean empire that it became , and at last the decrepit " empire " of Byzantium that consisted primarily of the single city of Constantinople when the Turks took it out in 1453 .
Fair enough -- but when we talk about the " fall of the Roman Empire , " we mean the utter collapse of the western half -- the part that became Britain , France , Spain , Portugal , Austria , Italy , Morocco , Algeria , and Tunisia .
That fall took place in the 400s , a thousand years before Byzantium finally fell .
There are all kinds of theories about why the western part of the empire fell -- and the east , which was under many of the same pressures , did not .
From lead in the Roman drinking water to population - crashing plagues , from barbarian invaders to overtaxation , from Christianity 's " softening " effect to crushing bureaucracy to repeated civil wars to sheer loss of civilizational energy , there are all kinds of theories about the fall of Rome .
There is even a book that claims that Rome did n't " fall " at all .
Europe After Rome : A New Cultural History 500- 1000 , by Julia M.H. Smith , makes much of the fact that the invaders all regarded themselves as successors to the emperors , and the styles of Roman culture continued , changing only gradually and not becoming barbarian .
Fair enough -- the barbarians were n't trying to destroy Rome , they wanted to inherit it , to throw out the emperors and sit at the top of the tax chain themselves .
But in his incisive ( and much shorter ) book , The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization , Bryan Ward - Perkins takes on Smith 's ( and others ' ) claim that there was no " fall " at all and eviscerates it by an appeal to evidence .
The problem with the " it did n't really fall " thesis is that it is inspired far more by contemporary multiculturalism than by any new evidence .
In fact , reading Smith quickly becomes an exercise in public narcissism , as page after page her book seems to be far more about her than about the period of history she 's supposedly writing about .
Smith is working from the old evidence and , in best Deconstructionist fashion , reworking it to fit the new narrative she is committed to finding .
In her view it is only the political rhetoric of Renaissance Europe that labeled the period after the fall of the West " the Dark Ages . "
In our modern sensitive multiculturality , we do n't use pejorative names .
They were n't post - empire , in other words , they were differently - empired .
Not uncivilized , but civilization - challenged .
( Though of course she does not use those terms . )
Ward - Perkins acts like a real historian .
He uses the archaeological evidence to discover what life was like in the late Western Roman Empire .
What he discovers is that the benefits of safe and profitable trading spread throughout the empire .
Quality Goods
Archaeology is limited , of course , to examining the artifacts that survived .
Fortunately , one of the most survivable artifacts is pottery -- and pottery was vastly important to life and to trade .
It was in huge ceramic jars -- amphorae -- that wine and olive oil were transported from one end of the empire to the other .
In addition , pots were to the Roman world what Tupperware , RubberMaid , and Calphalon are to our society -- a vital part of the daily life of those who cooked and stored food and drink .
So there was also a thriving trade in fine - quality pots that were turned on potters ' wheels , fired at the perfect temperature , and painted and glazed with the most beautiful designs .
For instance , in Britannia there was a thriving center of pottery production that spread its wares throughout the island ; other centers thrived elsewhere ; and the remarkable thing , according to Ward - Perkins , is how thoroughly this high - quality pottery penetrated the whole society , even down to the peasant class that worked the land .
In other words , the economy was so robust and prosperous for nearly everyone that even those near the bottom of the economic ladder ( but not at the bottom -- that would be the slaves ! ) had access to goods of high quality .
That meant that the balance between prices and earnings was favorable by the standards of the day .
Specialization
Ward - Perkins also cites the example of a Syrian village that thrived in rocky country whose soil was good only for growing olive trees .
This village sustained a ridiculously high population for many , many years -- a population that was far higher than could be supported from the agricultural yields of that area .
So what were they living on ?
Trade .
They grew their olives and shipped the oil abroad .
Apparently their oil was so highly regarded throughout the Mediterranean that it enabled them to import almost all the food and wine they required to sustain their population .
They had specialized .
It worked very well for them -- until the whole system of trade broke down and there was no way for them to get their goods out to their potential markets .
Either it was no longer safe enough to transport their oil and sell it profitably , or the markets had dried up because of the crash of the economy elsewhere .
Whatever the immediate cause , the result was predictable :
Without the revenues to let them import food , the population crashed back to the very low levels that could be sustained by the miserable local farming .
The Roman Army
What people overlooked was that everything depended on the Roman Army .
The army was n't carrying the goods , it was n't even actively protecting the trade .
The army was mostly stationed at the border , while the economy boomed in an empire so safe that none of the cities had walls .
But the economic system that offered so much prosperity could only last as long as merchants could trust in the safety of the goods they transported , and as long as people could remain in place to do their work instead of having to flee barbarian invaders .
It was a robust system .
Ward - Perkins points out that there were lots of crises over the years , from plague to invasions to civil wars , and none of them brought the system down , except for local crashes from which the economy soon recovered .
But it takes time and space to recover -- years , and the presence of nearby robust economies that can help restore the area that was hard hit .
When you have crash after crash in close succession , and the nearby economic centers are also just as beleaguered as you , there is neither time nor space for recovery .
So when the Roman Army got caught up in civil wars ( " If that legion can make their general emperor , we can make our general emperor ! " ) so that it was distracted and weakened , the emperors began the horribly self - destructive policy of buying off the bad guys on their borders .
It seemed like a good idea at the time , of course .
You give the barbarians a lot of money and they go away .
It saves lives .
Except that they run out of the money and now they know how to get more .
If you crush the barbarian army in battle , they think twice before coming back .
If you pay them for showing up and threatening you , and you do n't kill any of them , then coming back and threatening you again will be very popular with the barbarian footsoldiers .
You 'll see them a lot more .
But money is n't infinite -- the barbarian invaders shrink the tax base as they interfere with trade , both directly ( " Let 's loot this city so they 'll know we 're serious ! " ) and indirectly ( " The barbarians are coming !
Let 's leave our city and run away to someplace safe ! " ) .
So the emperors took to giving them land .
They settled the Alans here , the Ostrogoths there .
Of course , the land they settled them on was already occupied , so the Germans came in as overlords -- essentially , they became the new tax collectors , only they kept the taxes for themselves .
Thus the government was now giving away its tax base .
Meanwhile , the Germans were lousy governors .
They knew about taking taxes -- but their taxation was n't the usual corrupt system of the Romans , it was much more direct and brutal .
In many places it was indistinguishable from looting .
They took so much that the people did n't have enough left to allow them to buy quality goods from abroad .
So they were removed from the empire - wide trading system .
Also , the Germans did not understand or accept the burden that had been borne by the Roman Army in the areas they now occupied .
They did not maintain public safety .
Newly impoverished people and other tribes of invaders harassed merchants so that through large swathes of the empire , it simply was n't profitable to ship things anymore .
Either brigands or barbarians would seize your trade goods along the way , or there 'd be nobody with money to buy your goods when they reached their destination .
The robust Roman economic system could absorb a little of this , but not a lot , and not for long .
In the Crash , You Fall Farther
In Britannia , the crash was sudden and complete .
Within just a couple of decades , the population had crashed -- and peasants were using miserable lumpen homemade pots , badly fired , easily broken , ugly .
This was true even though Britannia had recently had pottery - making centers that did work so good it was exported ; now those pottery works were shut down .
Here 's the shocker : Before the Romans ever invaded , Britannia , despite its battling tribes and kingdoms , had maintained a robust economy .
It was a wealthy land , by Celtic standards , with strong cultural influence across the Channel in Gaul .
But when the Roman system collapsed in Britannia , the level of the culture fell far below what had existed prior to the Roman conquest .
Not only could they not recover to Roman levels , they could n't even restore the old British system .
It was all gone .
This was partly because the Germans that invaded Britain came in greater numbers and tended to enslave or slaughter or drive out the local population -- the Anglo - Saxons were n't coming to take over Roman Britain 's existing system , they were coming to take their land and live on it as Germans .
It was partly due to the fact that while the Anglo - Saxons were attacking in the south and east , the Irish were attacking from the west and the Picts from the north .
There was simply nowhere to hide long enough to recover .
But what the British experienced all at once , the rest of the Western empire experienced only a little more gradually .
Pockets of prosperity remained in Gaul and eastern Spain -- partly because for many years Africa remained safe and prosperous .
It provided the cushion that allowed Italy and southern Gaul and eastern Spain to recover from the economic shocks that had hit them .
Then came a new wave of Germans and wiped out the cushion .
The Vandals swept across the strait of Gibraltar and conquered north Africa .
They may not have been worse than any of the other barbarian invaders -- but they had a worse effect , because without Africa 's peaceful production and trade and tax base , there was simply no way for Roman Italy to sustain the costs of empire .
Then the Franks swept into Gaul and the Lombards into Italy and it was over .
The invaders might pretend that what they ruled over was still " Roman " and " imperial , " but it was n't .
Every region had to live on what it produced itself .
The new kings might occasionally mint some coins to prove they were as good as the emperors they had replaced , but in fact coins did not circulate and a local barter economy prevailed in most areas .
Here and there you'd have a small economic recovery , and of course there were artisans -- for a while at least -- who could still practice the old crafts at a high level .
But who could afford to pay for them ?
It took a powerful economy and the taxes of a huge empire to fund vast public works like aqueducts and irrigation systems and networks of roads .
What remained called itself Roman and showed only gradual decline in the quality of its goods ; and if you 're a determined multiculturalist , you could claim that this was n't a " fall " into " dark ages , " it was merely a " cultural transformation " or " evolution " that was just as " valid " as what went before .
Try telling that to the people living in a village where there had once been a city .
The people now making their own lousy little pots down by the river , where once they had been able to buy excellent ones from traders who came through all the time .
The people who once were free citizens of Rome and now found themselves serfs , bound to the land as if they were slaves , and forced to serve barbarian chiefs masquerading as " kings " but unable even to speak Latin or read .
The record is clear :
It was a dark age by any rational measure , and it took a thousand years to bring the economy back to the level it had been at under the protection of the Roman Army .
Is This a General Principle ?
Ward - Perkins 's analysis of the fall of Rome is piercing and explains the evidence better than any of the competing stories .
But that does n't mean there are any general principles here for us to learn from .
We have no vast hordes of barbarians waiting to invade and take over .
( Quiet , you who think Mexicans are the barbarian invasion .
They 're just another wave of immigrants . )
It happens that there are other examples of this kind of collapse .
In the opening chapter of Michael Grant 's The Rise of the Greeks , Grant , like Ward - Perkins , looks at the archaeological evidence surrounding the fall of the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations .
They did not fall at exactly the same time -- but then , the different parts of the Roman economy did not all fall at once , either .
What Grant finds , though , is that an international economic system that functioned smoothly throughout the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean , despite blips like the Trojan War , staggered to a complete collapse .
Starting in the late 1200s bce , a " prolonged series of destructive movements of peoples " ( i.e. , barbarian invasions ) swept through the area .
It seemed to be closely related to the fall of the Hittite empire in Asia minor , though whether the barbarian invasions toppled the Hittites , or the fall of the Hittites provided a power vacuum into which barbarians swept is hard to determine from our present vantage point .
What is unarguable is that a high level of arts and crafts staggered downward , getting shoddier all the time ; meanwhile , pollen counts showed a drastic drop in crop production , suggesting an equally drastic crash in populations sustained by local farming .
Once again , as with the fall of the Roman West , there were areas that held out a little longer or that recovered more quickly .
But in this case , the collapse came in an international system .
In other words , it was n't a single empire falling , it was a mutually dependent system of neighboring nations and city - states that plunged into chaos .
The whole eastern Mediterranean felt the shock .
Egypt and Syria had the economic wherewithal ( and the robust neighbors ) to absorb the shock and recover -- though the invading Philistines remained a permanent feature of the Palestinian coast ( that 's where the name " Palestine " comes from ) .
So it was n't just Rome .
It has happened before , and the footprints of collapse look remarkably similar .
Trade breaks down as merchants lose confidence and markets are disrupted by barbarian invaders .
When this happens , specialization becomes impossible , local areas must become agriculturally and militarily self - sufficient again , and between disease , famine , war , and emigration , populations crash .
Could It Happen to Us ?
For a century , America has been the great cushion to absorb the shocks that might have brought down western civilization .
In the Great War ( WWI ) , Europe crashed its own population through war and then crashed further through the influenza epidemic .
But the American economy provided the means for France and Britain -- but not Germany -- to recover .
Arguably , it was the failure to include Germany in the recovery that led to repeated economic crises , and when America finally joined Europe with its own Depression in the 1930s , the stage was set for the next barbarian invasion .
It was n't inappropriate for Hitler 's Germans to be called " the Hun . "
They may have claimed to be conquering , but in fact they were destroying .
Yes , they built factories in some of their conquered and allied lands , but they were chewing up the Slavic population by enslaving and slaughtering them , and they were eliminating much of their own intellectual and merchant class by killing the Jews , who had been disproportionately responsible for the German economy and culture .
In the aftermath of WWII , once again America was the economic cushion -- only this time the portion of Germany under western occupation was included in the economic recovery , as was Japan .
The result , over the past sixty years , has been a pax Americana covering much of the world .
And the world has prospered fantastically wherever the American military sustained it .
Let me say that again :
As with Rome , the American military has been the wall behind which a system of safe trade has allowed an extraordinary degree of specialization and therefore mutually sustained prosperity .
America has not been imperial -- we have not been stripping other countries .
On the contrary , those nations that were able to sustain the internal peace necessary for production , and that have joined the economy presided over by America , have all been able to join in the prosperity as equals .
We do n't tax them -- quite the opposite .
We have taxed ourselves to pay for the military protection that maintained the safety and perception of safety that allowed the European community and Japan to flourish .
Their welfare economies are only possible because they did not have to pay for their own defense at anything like the levels we have paid .
People talk about America 's enormous defense budget as if it were a menace to the world .
But our enormous defense budget has allowed Japan and Europe -- and Taiwan and South Korea -- to thrive without having to invest much of their gross domestic product in defense .
For a long time , the Communist nations remained holdouts , remaining outside the wall of American security and struggling to subvert the economic system that was bringing prosperity to the free world .
Russia and China both had the delusion that they could simply choose to join the system , and we 've certainly cooperated .
But Russia failed to maintain the basic internal public safety that would have allowed trade to flourish and the economy to boom -- it was simply too corrupt and too dangerous to do business in Russia .
Putin 's response to this problem has been to restore dictatorship in all but name -- and to recentralize the economy instead of providing the law enforcement to allow a decentralized market to function properly .
The result will be further economic decline -- which will , of course , be blamed on America .
China took a different road , maintaining ironclad control over their population .
But , as Mark Steyn points out in his convincing and entertaining book America Alone : The End of the World As We Know It , China is heading toward a demographic crisis .
Because of their one - child rule and the people 's response of aborting girl babies , they have a generation that has nearly two men for every woman .
This is a recipe for revolution and / or aggressive war -- it is safe to say that China will not have the right conditions for peaceful trade in a few years , for one reason or another .
Naturally , they will blame America too .
Is n't it odd that they all blame us for everything wrong in the world ?
But that 's the price you pay for being the most generous , patient , beneficent empire the world has ever known .
We have not taxed anyone but our home population ; we allow them to be self - governing and thumb their noses at us ; we pay them for the privilege of putting the troops that protect them on their soil .
Only a handful of nations -- most notably Britain -- have shouldered any part of the burden of defense against the barbarians .
For the barbarians are at the gates again .
No , they 're inside the gates .
Throughout Europe , as Steyn demonstrates with his piercing analysis of demographics , Muslim radicals are already holding public policy hostage .
Enslaved as they are by Muslim - controlled oil , European nations cannot afford to resist the increasingly absurd and civilization - destroying demands of their large and growing Muslim minorities .
Meanwhile , the Muslim world is reproducing at an enormous rate , while Europe and Japan are committing demographic suicide , producing less than 1.5 children per family -- a rate that halves the population each generation .
How long before the Muslim minority becomes the majority ?
How long before Europe is either Muslim or fighting a vicious war to expel or destroy the Muslims they have invited among them -- Muslims who are committed to destroying every aspect of Western culture that produces the prosperity they moved there to take part in ?
Welcome to My Nightmare
Here 's how it happens : America stupidly and immorally withdraws from the War on Terror , withdrawing prematurely from Iraq and leaving it in chaos .
Emboldened , either Muslims unite against the West ( unlikely ) or collapse in a huge war between Shiites and Sunnis ( already beginning ) .
It almost does n't matter , because in the process the oil will stop flowing .
And when the oil stops flowing , Europe and Japan and Taiwan and Singapore and South Korea all crash economically ;
Europe then has to face the demands of its West - hating Muslim " minority " without money and without the ruthlessness or will to survive that would allow them to counter the threat .
The result is accommodation or surrender to Islam .
The numbers do n't lie -- it is not just possible , it is likely .
America does n't crash right away , mind you .
But we still have a major depression , because we have nowhere to sell our goods .
And depending on what our desperate enemies do , it 's a matter of time before we crash as well .
Why ?
Because we 're that Syrian village .
Except that what we make is food -- enough to feed half the world .
What we do n't make for ourselves anymore is ... everything else .
We do n't produce steel .
We do n't make most of our own computer equipment .
We have exported our textile industry .
Some of these industries could recover .
But they would be producing only for domestic consumption .
We 'd have nowhere to sell anything except to ourselves .
That 's when we find out just how much of our new " service " economy is smoke and mirrors , dependent entirely on the surpluses generated by the global system of trade .
And our own oil production cannot meet the demands of transportation and production at current levels .
Rationing will cripple us .
We will not be able to maintain our huge fleet of trucks .
Air travel will becoming shockingly expensive and airlines will fail or consolidate .
We wo n't even be allowed to drive our cars on long trips because gasoline will be rationed .
We will go back to the rails .
Only we wo n't have the money to rebuild and refurbish the railroad system -- it will only be able to limp along .
It will look , even inside the United States , amazingly like the shrinkage that happened at the time of the fall of Rome .
Then , and only then , will America look -- and be -- vulnerable to any kind of intervention from the south .
Economies that are still somewhat primitive will recover faster than economies that are absolutely dependent on specialization .
It takes two generations for the dark ages to reach America .
But they will come , if we allow this nightmare to begin .
Because once you reach the tipping point , there 's no turning back , as the Emperor Justinian discovered .
Our global economic system is a brilliant creation , imperfect of course , but powerful and effective in creating more prosperity for more people than ever in the history of the world .
It is a creation of America 's military and America 's benign government of the world -- so benign they pretend we do n't govern it .
Our enemies and most of our " allies " and many of our own citizens are working as hard as possible to bring the whole thing crashing down , though that is not at all what they intend .
They just have n't learned the lessons -- the principles -- of how great economic empires are maintained .
They only look at the political dogmas du jour and spout their platitudes .
People like me are ridiculed for seeing the big picture and learning the lessons of history .
And if we 're lucky , and get out of this intact -- i.e. , if we go ahead and continue this war , break the power of Iran and Syria , and inflict crushing defeat on radical , expansionist Islamicists ( which will require that Europe do the same with their own increasingly revolutionary Muslim populations , either expelling them or crushing their radical , Saudi - funded leadership ) -- then I will still be ridiculed , because there will be no evidence that I would have been right .
Well , I 'll be happy to be ridiculed for being such a doomsayer , if we are able to avoid collapse .
I want to be wrong .
Read these books for yourself :
Bryan Ward - Perkins , The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization .
Many of his pages are devoted to refuting books you have n't read and need n't bother reading , like the Julia M.H. Smith book .
But by the end , his analysis is as clear and as fully proven as anything in Jared Diamond 's pivotal book Guns , Germs , and Steel -- and should serve Americans as just as much of a wake - up call .
Mark Steyn , America Alone : The End of the World As We Know It .
Steyn is a gun- totin ' anti-big - government conservative , and especially toward the end , he tries to tie his whole belief system into the argument .
Ignore that -- it takes about five seconds to tear apart his " individuals do it better than governments " nostrums with actual thought .
( For instance :
Do you really think we 'd protect our borders better through vigilantism ?
Ca n't wait for the lynchings , can you ? )
What counts in his book is his piercing , well - supported argument , based on demographics and evidence about what Muslim populations actually believe and are allowing to be done in their name .
It is impossible to make useful predictions without the information he presents here .
Meanwhile ... merry Christmas .
Remember to eat , drink , and be merry .
OCam'OLE
OCam'OLE OCam'OLE is an OLE binding for OCaml .
OLE is a COM - based technology that enable Automation .
Automation is a way to create and manipulate remote objects or applications that exposes COM interfaces .
To take an easy example , Excel , Word and most of today 's big applications installed on your computer can be controled by an Automation client .
Visual Basic is such a client , and can control an Excel application ( this is called " scripting " ) .
Now with OCam 'OLE , you can do the same , with the additional feature of type - safe operations ( by using OLEGen ) !
How does it works ?
Each OLE application have a Type - Library that contains list of objects .
Each object have a list of methods with type information on arguments and returned values .
OCam'OLE enable the browsing of such Type - Libraries for any application .
What is OLEGen ?
OLEGen is an ocaml program that is using OCam 'OLE to browse Type-Libraries and generate the corresponding ML / MLI code .
The code generated this way is hidding OCam 'OLE usage to call methods and is then providing a type - safe interface to manipulate objects .
Features
OCam'OLE features :
raw support of IDispatch , ITypeInfo , ITypeLib
conservative VARIANT C/ Caml conversions
remote calls via IDispatch .
Invoke
static interface generation with OLEGen
The current distribution include a sample that demonstrate the combined usage of OCam'OLE and OLEGen to enable the creation and the control of an Excel sheet in a few lines of OCaml code .
Installation
To install this program , you need :
ocaml 3.04 or better
MSVC compiler & linker & nmake
Excel installed to try the sample
The following files are included in the sources :
ocamole.cpp : C stubs for OCamole
: C stubs for OCamole ocamole.ml : OCaml OLE interface
: OCaml OLE interface olegen.ml : OLEGen sources
: OLEGen sources excel1.ml : an Excel manipulation sample based on the generation of the Excel module with OLEGen
To install , simply run " NMAKE " is the directory where you have put OCam 'OLE .
This will generate the following files :
ocamole.dll + ocamole.cma : the OCam'OLE binaries
: the OCam'OLE binaries olegen.exe : OLEGen binary , run it to get some help
: OLEGen binary , run it to get some help excel.cma : the Excel ocaml library
: the Excel ocaml library excel1.exe : run it to test Excel control with OCaml
If you 're experiencing some problems , check the following environnement variables on your system :
PATH : must include your Visual Studio / BIN directory
: must include your Visual Studio / BIN directory LIB : must include Visual Studio / LIB directory and your OCaml distribution / LIB directory
: must include Visual Studio / LIB directory and your OCaml distribution / LIB directory INCLUDE : must include Visual Studio / INCLUDE directory and your OCaml distribution / LIB directory
If you do n't have Excel installed , you can run " NMAKE NOSAMPLE " to build only OCam 'OLE & OLEGen binaries .
How do I use it ?
You can now do the following :
use " raw " Automation by directly using OCam'OLE
first generate ML / MLI code for the application you want to use by using OLEGen and then watch the generated MLI to manipulate it .

Lecturers say their role is to question and test received wisdom
Academics for Academic Freedom ( AFAF ) says that in today 's political climate it is " harder than ever " for scholars to defend open debate .
AFAF says they must be allowed to question received wisdom , and managers should not be able to discipline academics for voicing unpopular views .
The group is calling on all university lecturers to sign its online petition .
" Restrictive legislation , and the bureaucratic rules and regulations of government quangos and of universities themselves , have undermined academic freedom , " the groups says .
Too many academics have been sedated by an oppressive environment of political correctness and risk aversion
Simon Davies , London School of Economics
" Many academics are fearful of upsetting managers and politicians by expressing controversial opinions .
" Afraid to challenge mainstream thought , many pursue self - censorship . "
A Leeds University lecturer , Frank Ellis , took early retirement this year before a disciplinary hearing over his comments that there was evidence to suggest white people had higher IQ levels than black people .
Statement of freedom
The statement of academic freedom which lecturers are being asked to sign says two principles are the foundation of academic freedom :
" That academics , both inside and outside the classroom , have unrestricted liberty to question and test received wisdom and to put forward controversial and unpopular opinions , whether or not these are deemed offensive .
" That academic institutions have no right to curb the exercise of this freedom by members of their staff , or to use it as grounds for disciplinary action or dismissal . "
Writing on the AFAF website , Professor Roy Harris from the University of Oxford said : " Getting university authorities to agree to these principles is an essential step towards safeguarding academic freedom for the future . "
Professor Mary Evans from the University of Kent said : " Universities need to be able to maintain , and even extend their ability to think the unthinkable .
" They should not accept a role as mere instruments of state agendas . "
Simon Davies , co-director of the policy engagement research group at the London School of Economics , added : " I 'm deeply worried about the number of academics who flee in terror at the slightest wisp of controversy .
" Rather than engage the world in a spirit of challenge , too many academics have been sedated by an oppressive environment of political correctness and risk aversion . "
The Pentagon noted that the US death rate is lower than in Vietnam
It did not identify the 2,500th casualty , in line with US policy not to release details until 24 hours after the family has been informed .
A Pentagon statement said 1,972 of those who died were killed in action .
The campaign group Iraq Body Count estimates that the number of civilians killed since the outset of the conflict ranges between 38,355 and 42,747 .
It makes its calculation on the basis of media reports , and believes it to be a conservative estimate .
Other reports put the number of civilian casualties much higher .
Thousands of Iraqi security forces , military personnel from other countries , and Iraqi and foreign insurgents have also died .
' Tremendous sacrifice '
Between November 2005 and March 2006 , the number of US military fatalities fell month - by - month , as insurgents seemed to focus attacks on Iraqi security forces and civilians .
However , they jumped back above the average for April and May .
The Pentagon put the blame on a recent surge in rebel violence .
Polls in the US suggest opposition to America 's presence in Iraq has grown - while support for President George Bush 's handling of the war has fallen .
The Pentagon notes that the death rate for US troops is much lower than those in the Vietnam or Korean wars , to which Iraq has sometimes been compared .
In each of those conflicts more than 50,000 US troops died .
" It 's important to remember that there is a mission , and there is a greater good which sometimes necessitates tremendous sacrifice , " said the US army 's Brig Gen Carter Ham .
" Rather than focus on an aggregate number , I think it 's more important for us to remember that there are individuals in that aggregate number ... to whom we should be very , very grateful , and to their families . "
The US Senate on Thursday approved $ 65.8 bn for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , following a similar vote in the House of Representatives on Tuesday .
Since the 9/11 attacks , the US has now spent or allocated $ 438bn on its " war on terror " , with more than 70 % spent in Iraq .
You ’ve seen him running through the hallways countless times , saving the day , working late nights .
After fighting chaos and returning things to order , you must have thanked the poor creature .
If you are enlightened you might even have baked him or her a cake on that very special day .
I bet you never gave a tip though .
But do n’t worry , just read through this how to and you ’ll be fully equipped to make it right .
If this guide is too long to read or you are unsure of what to do , just ask your system administrator .
Tipping can be quite complicated , it works different all around the world .
In some parts the tip is included in the bill , while in other places it is wise to avoid eye contact after the meal if you do n’t leave a tip .
At Harrod ’s in London you will find a guy in the bathrooms who will point you in the direction of the loo , even if there are toilets all around you .
When you ’re done with your business he will raise his palm to you and produce a friendly sound from the back of his throat .
A guidebook to Rome will tell you that it is custom to leave a tip for the hotel cleaners .
The process of tipping can be confusing , at a restaurant you might ask if the tip is included .
But if a system administrator stretched out his hand , would you know what to do ?
Although sysadmins are n’t as obvious as the guy at Harrod ’s , you might have seen a few hints .
Did you ever wonder why your sysadmin had two mouse pads but only one mouse ?
The next time you hear any of these phrases you will know what they mean .
“ Good luck with your printer the next time then ! ”
“ Did you by any chance make any backups of your own ? ”
“ Tip is not a city in China . ”
You wo n’t have to guess anymore after reading this guide , just leave a few coins and others will follow .
You might have realized it for a while now , but now you know it in your heart too ; you should tip system administrators .
While you ’re reaching for your wallet , your next question – a good one I might add – must be : how much ?
Since you are tipping for a service you will first have to put a value to that service .
If the help saved you five hours work , the tip should be 8 % of the value of those five hours .
This is why tipping a sysadmin is also called giving a Byte .
If you ’re system administrator has “ saved your life ” , you must ask yourself how much your life is worth .
Divide the amount with the number of times you think the sysadmin will save you ’re life , the Byte is 8 % of that value .
You ’re insurance company can help you with the first part and your system administrator with the second .
In many situations you wo n’t have all the coins needed to give the Byte .
There ’s no need for despair ; the recommended way of dealing with this dilemma is to use PayPal .
Here ’s a fictional encounter of how the Byte might be given .
Customer : “ Thanks for the help mister sysadmin , here ’s a Byte for the great service . ”
SysAdmin : “ Why thank you !
But next time you can call me sir . ”
Customer : “ Sir ? ”
SysAdmin : “ Yes it ’s shorter , saves you time . ”
Customer : “ Why thanks for the tip sir . ”
SysAdmin : “ You are welcome ! ”
This encounter left both of the participants happy , I ’m sure tipping will do the same for you .
I hope this text has been informative .
Good luck tipping !

EclipseCon Fear is stalking the corridors of corporate power , as executives sweat over the legal exposure caused by developers using open source software .
And the suits are resorting to play - it - safe legal advice and draconian management techniques in a vain attempt to stop open source crossing their frontier .
Tactics include blocking popular sites like SourceForge and banning use of USB drives .
And , such is the hysteria , some business mergers have nearly come undone over the acquirees ' use of open source .
In all , developers attending this week 's EclipseCon must have had their darkest fears - that senior management is out of touch with the development shop floor - confirmed during a lively panel discussion on intellectual property issues and the risks of blending commercial and open source software .
Attending the panel were IBM , BEA Systems , OpenLogic , Black Duck , and Palamida .
Yes , you could call this a case of predictable vendor scaremongering to drum up new business , but do n't forget some well known open source cases are already on record - Tivo , Linksys / Cisco , and Progress Software versus MySQL , anyone ?
What 's behind such shenanigans ?
According to Palamida co-founder Jeff Luszcz a disconnect exists between managers who set corporate open source policies and developers supposed to follow them , but who end up covering their tracks to make it seem like they are not using open source .
Developers , though , end up using open source because of its ubiquity and not using it " puts them at a competitive disadvantage because their competitors are " .
An example of the disconnect ?
OpenLogic director of community and partner programs Stormy Peters , who outlined the measures taken by one company , said : " We had a customer with a policy of no open source .
They ended up blocking SourceForge.net , but people started downloading at home on thumb drives .
The company then started saying ' no thumb drives ' .
You can't keep this up ! "
Another problem : the increasingly distributed nature of development makes bans impossible , as offshore teams and outsourcing partners employ open source .
Companies running open source also often make the mistake of thinking they are running a relatively benign , commercial - friendly license like BSD when they are actually using GPL , which has limitations on modification and distribution of code .
And that 's a problem because 10 per cent of open source code leaks out of development and into final product , meaning companies really are potentially at risk from rightfully aggrieved software authors .
In at least one case , an ISV paid a developer after its product shipped because it contained their GPL 'd code .
With GPL 3.0 coming , things ain't going to get any easier - especially for Software as a Service ( SaaS ) .
Sit up and pay attention Silicon Valley .
SaaS providers should ensure any modified GPL'd software they use is not deliberately or inadvertently downloaded to the user as this could be considered distribution .
" No one can make that call until there has been a court case .
[ Use ] is at your own risk .
I 'd say be very sure you are not distributing that software , " Peters said .
What 's creating the confusion ?
Everyone 's favorite : license proliferation .
Yes , there might be 58 OSI - approved licenses , but there are also thousands of vanity licenses that vary by only tiny degrees - an interesting fact , given Eclipse created its own ( OSI - approved ) license that happens to be incompatible with the GPL .
Black Duck president and CEO Doug Levin blamed proliferation and general lack of knowledge among the very legal teams management relies on for creating extreme lock down policies .
" That stems from attorneys not being fully educated about open source software .
This has to change as more information becomes available . "
Peters agreed : " Open source has a lot of FUD associated with it ... it should be a case of weighing up the risks and the reward . "
Among the panel 's recommendations : educating managers about open source and licenses , regularly reviewing processes , and monitoring donations to the community . ®
It was not immediately clear whether skin samples only or limbs and tissues were taken for laboratory examination from the 1960s until the practice was stopped in the early 90s but there are suggestions that almost 70 bodies may have been affected .
Mindful of Liverpool 's Alder
Hey hospital scandal and other cases involving children 's body parts being retained without consent for research , the government moved quickly to investigate the claims .
Alistair Darling , the trade and industry secretary , will make a Commons statement today promising to appoint a leading QC to establish the facts and issue a report .
" The prime concern is the feelings of the families .
There are clearly a number of matters that need investigating dating back to the 1960s , " said the Department for Trade and Industry .
The GMB union went public with its call for an inquiry yesterday , four days after the area 's two Labour MPs , Tony Cunningham and Jamie Reed , first heard the allegations and demanded an investigation from the chief executive of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority ( NDA ) , Ian Roxborough .
Between them the MPs represent most of the 13,000 staff at Sellafield , Britain 's oldest nuclear facility .
Mr Cunningham said last night : " This is very disturbing and we have already demanded a full and thorough investigation .
The relatives have a right to know exactly what happened even many years ago . "
What is suspected is that when an unusual death occurred at Sellafield , a heart attack in a young man for instance , a specialist doctor would examine the body and take samples of an unspecified character .
It is claimed that other UK nuclear plants , Aldermaston and Harwell among them , were also involved in the procedure .
But the doctor and two coroners said to have been used have died .
The issue came to light when a scientist sought to review the accumulated data to support new studies and asked how it had been obtained .
" Grotesque as it sounds we do not know which body parts or where they ended up , " said one MP involved .
British Nuclear Fuels Ltd ( BNFL ) said the tissue was " stored appropriately " until destroyed during research .
Stressing the issue was " historic not current " , a BNFL spokesman said : " The sampling of autopsy material began in the 1960s and ceased in the early 1990s .
Files exist at Sellafield for 65 cases .
An examination of the data has shown that in 56 of those cases the sampling was done associated with coroners ' post mortems or inquests .
" In five other cases it was done under instruction from other legally correct bases , such as family solicitors .
For the remaining four cases there is no record of instruction or consent on file although this does not mean that appropriate requests were not made .
" The subject of sampling autopsy material came about now because of a request to re-examine the historic research data to support new studies .
" That request was made by the Westlakes Research Institute to the Westlakes / NDA Research Governance Group and this is being considered by that group , the company and the unions .
" Tissue samples waiting to be analysed were stored appropriately , on occasions for several months , however the samples were destroyed by the actual analysis process .
There is no tissue stored on site today and the practice of taking samples for radiological analysis ceased in 1992 . "
The GMB 's national officer , Gary Smith , said : " Our chief concern is for the families of those who died during this period and the anguish they face .
We need information from the company and we expect a quick reply to clarify what has happened . "
This are photos by Alexandre Korolkov from Russian village “ Ustje ” .
This village is remarkable .
It is located on the far north of Russia , it ’s much closer to American Alaska than to any major Russian cities .
Temperatures there do n’t get higher than 30 - 40 Fahrenheit even in the summer !
Four hundred years ago a group of Russian people flew far away to North in order to avoid death from the Tsar Ivan .
They settled there and those people on the photos – direct descendants .
They lived 400 years among Russian Eskimos people but did n’t assimilate and saved their traditions and Russian language .
The Carnival is a national holiday in Brazil , from Friday night to the following Wednesday noon .
Most Brazilians continue the holiday until the following Monday , a total of 10 days .
While many Rio habitants leave the city for quiet places , many tourists ( including Brazilians ) arrive Rio to participate in the Carnival celebrations .
The German author Henryk M. Broder recently told the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant ( 12 October ) that young Europeans who love freedom , better emigrate .
Europe as we know it will no longer exist 20 years from now .
Whilst sitting on a terrace in Berlin , Broder pointed to the other customers and the passers - by and said melancholically : “ We are watching the world of yesterday . ”
Europe is turning Muslim .
As Broder is sixty years old he is not going to emigrate himself .
“ I am too old , ” he said .
However , he urged young people to get out and “ move to Australia or New Zealand .
That is the only option they have if they want to avoid the plagues that will turn the old continent uninhabitable . ”
Many Germans and Dutch , apparently , did not wait for Broder ’s advice .
The number of emigrants leaving the Netherlands and Germany has already surpassed the number of immigrants moving in .
One does not have to be prophetic to predict , like Henryk Broder , that Europe is becoming Islamic .
Just consider the demographics .
The number of Muslims in contemporary Europe is estimated to be 50 million .
It is expected to double in twenty years .
By 2025 , one third of all European children will be born to Muslim families .
Today Mohammed is already the most popular name for new - born boys in Brussels , Amsterdam , Rotterdam , and other major European cities .
Broder is convinced that the Europeans are not willing to oppose islamization .
“ The dominant ethos , ” he told De Volkskrant , “ is perfectly voiced by the stupid blonde woman author with whom I recently debated .
She said that it is sometimes better to let yourself be raped than to risk serious injuries while resisting .
She said it is sometimes better to avoid fighting than run the risk of death . ”
In a recent op - ed piece in the Brussels newspaper De Standaard ( 23 October ) the Dutch ( gay and self - declared “ humanist ” ) author Oscar Van den Boogaard refers to Broder ’s interview .
Van den Boogaard says that to him coping with the islamization of Europe is like “ a process of mourning . ”
He is overwhelmed by a “ feeling of sadness . ”
“ I am not a warrior , ” he says , “ but who is ?
I have never learned to fight for my freedom .
I was only good at enjoying it . ”
As Tom Bethell wrote in this month ’s American Spectator : “ Just at the most basic level of demography the secular - humanist option is not working . ”
But there is more to it than the fact that non-religious people tend not to have as many children as religious people , because many of them prefer to “ enjoy ” freedom rather than renounce it for the sake of children .
Secularists , it seems to me , are also less keen on fighting .
Since they do not believe in an afterlife , this life is the only thing they have to lose .
Hence they will rather accept submission than fight .
Like the German feminist Broder referred to , they prefer to be raped than to resist .
“ If faith collapses , civilization goes with it , ” says Bethell .
That is the real cause of the closing of civilization in Europe .
Islamization is simply the consequence .
The very word Islam means “ submission ” and the secularists have submitted already .
Many Europeans have already become Muslims , though they do not realize it or do not want to admit it .
Some of the people I meet in the U.S. are particularly worried about the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe .
They are correct when they fear that anti-Semitism is also on the rise among non-immigrant Europeans .
The latter hate people with a fighting spirit .
Contemporary anti-Semitism in Europe ( at least when coming from native Europeans ) is related to anti-Americanism .
People who are not prepared to resist and are eager to submit , hate others who do not want to submit and are prepared to fight .
They hate them because they are afraid that the latter will endanger their lives as well .
In their view everyone must submit .
This is why they have come to hate Israel and America so much , and the small band of European “ islamophobes ” who dare to talk about what they see happening around them .
West Europeans have to choose between submission ( islam ) or death .
I fear , like Broder , that they have chosen submission – just like in former days when they preferred to be red rather than dead .
" None of them , except perhaps Miss Adams and Mrs. Belmont , had any deep religious convictions .
All of them were children of this world , and some of them disagreed with everything which that symbol [ the cross ] upon the earth represented . "
Yet in the end , even as men with no religious convictions , they cannot bring themselves to submit to Islam , for they understand it to be not just a denial of Christ but in some sense a denial of themselves , too .
So they stall and delay and bog down the imam in a lot of technical questions until eventually he wises up and they 're condemned to death .
One hundred ten years later , for the Fox journalists and the Western media who reported their release , what 's the big deal ?
Wear robes , change your name to Khaled , go on camera and drop Allah 's name hither and yon :
If that 's your ticket out , seize it .
Everyone 'll know it 's just a sham .
But that 's not how the al - Jazeera audience sees it .
If you 're a Muslim , the video is anything but meaningless .
Not even the dumbest jihadist believes these infidels are suddenly true believers .
Rather , it confirms the central truth Osama and the mullahs have been peddling -- that the West is weak , that there 's nothing -- no core , no bedrock -- nothing it 's not willing to trade .
UPDATE
In his new column today , admired warrior Mark Steyn follows in the footsteps of David Warren by mocking ( from a safe distance , as always ) the willingness of Steve Centanni and Olaf Wiig to participate in a conversion ceremony in order to save their own lives .
Just as Warren did , Steyn devotes an entire column to arguing that the weak , girlish cowardice displayed by the two Fox journalists in Gaza is what is plaguing " the West , " and -- as always -- it is only unrestrained , chest - beating war ( fought by others ) which can bring us the masculine , warrior power that we need to be saved from Islamic aggression .
Steyn builds his " argument " by glorifying several extremely courageous individuals -- fictional characters in a short story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle -- who were " Anglo - American - French tourists taken hostage by the Mahdists , the jihadi of the day . "
Steyn says they were " in the same predicament as Centanni and Wiig :
The kidnappers are offering them a choice between Islam or death . "
But unlike the Fox journalist cowards in Gaza , Steyn lauds these fictional individuals as brave men and women of character :
Steyn then contrasts the bravery of the Doyle characters with the conduct of Centanni and Wiig and -- just like Warren did -- claims that in their cowardly , life - saving behavior lies the real lesson of our Epic War of Civilizations with the Islamofacists : Earlier in the column , Steyn complains of a newspaper story reporting on the assault of a 16 - year - old girl by three men in Australia because the article failed to mention that the attackers were " of Middle Eastern / Mediterranean appearance . "
Steyn then ties that story to the Centanni / Wiig cowardice .
Their wilingness to convert in order to save their own lives shows " that these men arein Sydney was .
" Steyn also points to the new book by " gay Tory Andrew Sullivan " in which , Steyn says , Sullivan is " attempting to reconcile his sexual temperament and his alleged political one . "
Steyn claims that the " live - for - the - present " philosophy promoted by Sullivan 's book is " almost a literal restatement of Faust 's bargain with the devil , " and is the same weakness of character found in the Fox journalists ( and in the war - avoiding appeasers of the West ) .
" In the Muslim world , they watch the Centanni / Wiig video and see men so in love with the present , the now , that they will do or say anything to live in the moment .
" So , to recap : The West is like a 16 - year old girl assaulted by aggressive Middle Eastern men - weak , vulnerable , humiliated , and in submission .
Gay hedonist Andrew Sullivan , along with the bound and submissive Fox journalists , are the symbols of the weak , decadent West which Steyn so despises -- devoid of any manly values and courage .
Each week , Steyn screeches that we must wage war -- aggressive , unrestrained , manly glorious war against our Enemies -- because the alternative , which he fears so deeply , is to be a 16 - year - old submissive girl or a gay Andrew Sullivan -- the men without chests , as Warren put it .
You can find this transparent dynamic in most warmongering screeds these days .
The ironies of this disturbed war dance are virtually infinite , the most obvious one being that the Steyn Warriors can never point to any sacrifices they make or risks they incur .
But the most striking irony is this .
So much of the neoconservative warrior cries are built on an ethos of deep fear , of exactly the desperate desire to be protected and saved which Steyn and company claim is the hallmark of the girlish , soul - less West .
As they strike the warrior pose , they are desperately willing , even eager , to fundamentally change the character and principles of our republic and to sacrifice the core liberties which define it because they are scared and want , more than anything else , to be protected .
Do you want to hear what a person sounds like when they really are -- to use Steyn 's words -- " weak , that there 's nothing -- no core , no bedrock -- nothing it 's not willing to trade " ?
Here is Bush loyalist Sen. John Cornyn , explaining why we should allow the President to break the law and eavesdrop on our conversations without any oversight : " None of your civil liberties matter much after you ’re dead . "
And here is Pat Roberts , showing how willing he is to trade all American values in the hope of being protected from the things he fears : " I am a strong supporter of the First Amendment , the Fourth Amendment and civil liberties .
But you have no civil liberties if you are dead . "
That " rationale " means we do anything -- give up all freedoms , relinquish all values -- because desperately trying to stay alive is the only thing that matters .
So someone -- like Centanni or Wiig -- who recites a few words that they do n't mean in order to avoid death is a wretched , feminine coward who has no core values and nothing they are willing to die for .
But if that 's the standard , then people like Steyn and his fellow neoconservative warriors -- who want to place blind faith in the Government in exchange for promises of " protection , " vest in the President the most unlimited powers , and fundamentally change how our country functions and the values which define it , all because they think that doing so is necessary to increase their chances of living -- are drowning in a self - protective cowardice that dwarfs by many magnitudes that which they mock in others .
The creepy spectacle of watching one warrior after the next insist that we must risk other people 's lives and bomb more people so that we do n't feel girlish and scared and submissive is repugnant enough , in itself , to have to witness on a daily basis .
But the fact that these same people are the ones whose deep , irrational fears of The Terrorist override virtually all other considerations , and who demand that we change our nation and relinquish all of the values and liberties which have always defined it and which make it worth fighting for , all because they believe that doing so is necessary to allow them some marginally greater chance of avoiding death , renders their accusations and warrior dances -- on top of everything else -- an exercise in the grossest and most absurd hypocrisy .
Mark Steyn and his comrades think they are so courageous ( as they make clear virtually every day ) .
But a courageous act entails risk , and they never risk anything .
Quite the contrary , they are desperate to eliminate all perceived risks to their " safety , " regardless of the costs .
Their entire world - view is based upon and driven by their deeply irrational fears , which lead to a never - ending desire to sacrifice liberty ( theirs and ours ) and a hysterical , risk - free insistence that the Bad Scary People ( along with hundreds of thousands or even millions of others near them ) be bombed , incinerated and killed -- all so that they are n't so scared any more , so that they can feel safe .
On a daily basis , they re-enact writ large the ritual in which Centanni and Wiig engaged -- submitting to unlimited Government power , relinquishing all of our national values , and assenting to the most crazed wars fought by others , without limits , all to assuage their own fears , in order to obtain illusory feelings of " safety . "
As Steyn put it in purportedly describing Centanni and Wigg , " that there 's nothing -- no core , no bedrock -- nothing [ they 're ] not willing to trade . " :
Whenever I write about the fear which drives large swaths of Bush supporters , people write -- both in comments and by e-mail -- to argue that they are driven less by fear ( which is merely their tool ) and more by authoritarian desires .
I do n't disagree , but they 're not mutually exclusive .
As John Dean points out in his book , fear is often the driving reason why people seek protection from government power and become part of a movement which worship authority .
Coincidentally , Dean is appearing live today at the FDL Book Salon at 5:00 p.m. EST for a discussion of his book , which I am hosting , so anyone interested can raise that topic ( or any others ) directly with him later today .
We must be willing to let go of the life we have planned , so as to have the life that is waiting for us .

Steve Jobs , chief executive of Apple Computer , was handed 7.5 m stock options in 2001 without the required authorisation from the company ’s board of directors , according to people familiar with the matter .
Records that purported to show a full board meeting had taken place to approve Mr Jobs ’ remuneration , as required by Apple ’s procedures , were later falsified .
These are now among the pieces of evidence being weighed by the Securities and Exchange Commission as it decides whether to pursue a case against the company or any individuals over the affair , according to these people .
News of the irregularities , which is expected to be revealed in a regulatory filing by Apple before the end of this week , will add to pressure that has been growing on one of Silicon Valley ’s most highly - regarded companies since the middle of 2005 .
In early trade in New York on Thursday , Apple shares were down 2 per cent to $ 79.83 , but regained lost ground to stand at $ 80.45 , a fall of 1.3 per cent .
Apple is among more than 160 companies that have owned up to stock option backdating – handing options to executives and other employees at exercise prices that were set in hindsight at favourable levels – a scandal which has led to the departure of a number of chief executives .
The latest revelation is likely to add to questions about Apple ’s disclosures about its internal investigation into the backdating issue .
In October , the company largely exonerated Mr Jobs over the matter , saying that while he had been “ aware ” of the backdating “ in a few instances ” , he “ did not receive or otherwise benefit from these grants and was unaware of the accounting implications ” .
According to an Apple filing in 2002 , the options under review were handed to Mr Jobs in October 2001 , at an exercise price of $ 18.30 a share .
However , the purported board authorisation was dated near the end of the year , suggesting that the benefits were both not properly authorised and were backdated .
Mr Jobs later surrendered his options before they were exercised , implying that he did not gain any direct benefit from them .
He was later given a grant of restricted stock by the company instead .
Apple ’s lawyers have briefed people involved in the case on the findings of the company ’s internal review of the matter , though it remains unclear how much detail will be included in the filing .
Under Apple ’s rules , the chief executive ’s remuneration must be set by a compensation committee of independent directors and later authorised by the full board .
An Apple spokesman refused to comment on the matter on Wednesday , but said the company had handed the findings of its internal enquiry to the SEC .
The company said in October that it had found “ no misconduct by any member of Apple ’s current management team ” but that its investigation “ raised serious concerns regarding the actions of two former officers ” .
At the same time , it also announced the resignation from its board of Fred Andersen , a former chief financial officer .
Mr Andersen had not been a director at the time of the 2001 options grant .

What is your take on it ?
I am leaving the cross posting to soc.singles and free.christians because you , Uncle Davey , included them .
I do n't want anyone to even get a hint that you know what you are talking about or that your proposition can't be answered .
However I can't imagine why anyone in either of those groups would have the slightest interest in the subject .
Probably the best written and the earliest popular exposition of the evolution of the body fluids in the vertebrate animals is " From Fish to Philosopher " ( John Wilkins , take note -- you have lots of finny competition ! ) by Homer Smith .
I believe it was originally published in 1953 by Little , Brown .
My copy is a special paper edition put out by Ciba Pharmaceuticals in 1959 .
The subtitle is " The Story of Our Internal Environment " and it describes exactly the problem you raise as well as the evolution of the vertebrate and the mammalian kidney .
Dr. Smith was a noted renal physiologist who spent some 30 + years studying that particular subject .
For more current discussions , see " Animal Physiology : Adaptation and Environment " by K. Schmidt - Nielsen , 5th Edition , 1997 , Cambridge U Press although I must confess that I only have the 4th edition , 1990 .
The subject has not been modified drastically in the last 15 years .
Another excellent source is " Eckert Animal Physiology : Mechanisms and Adaptations " , by Randall , Burggren , and French , 5th Edition , 2002 , Freeman .
That one I do have and have taught from for many years going back several editions .
These two are probably the most widely used textbooks in Animal Physiology .
Many good introductory biology textbooks , the encyclopedic ones specifically written for biology majors , also treat the subject .
In order to explain the situation to you , I am afraid I have to go into quite a bit of background to prepare you for the argument .
Fortunately for me , I am a college professor and lecturing at you comes quite naturally .
Unfortunately for you , if you want to understand what I am saying , you will have to read all this .
Normally it would take at least a full hour lecture with explanations and examples and so on .
You would also get my atrocious jokes .
I will try to be as brief as I can , but still try to be at least a bit understandable and to leave out my attempts at humor .
The most important basic fact of physiology to understand is that osmotic regulation is a really major problem for animals .
Animal cells have no cell wall and cannot withstand an osmotic difference between the intracellular and extracellular fluid .
The intracellular fluid must necessarily be rather concentrated to maintain its biochemical and biophysical activity .
Hence the extracellular fluid must be exactly equally concentrated .
The specific salts inside the cell are quite different from those outside , but the osmotic pressure is the same so that the cells are in osmotic balance .
The importance of the " regulation of the internal environment " , which refers to a major degree to just this osmotic regulation , was proposed by C. Bernard in the mid 19th Century and is considered one of the major landmarks in the beginning of the subject of physiology .
The interface between the inside of the cell and the outside across the cell membrane is only part of the problem .
The other part is the interface between the extracellular fluids outside the cell , but inside the organism , ( that is , the body fluids ) and the external fluids ; fresh or salt water ( terrestrial animals are a special case and are treated separately ) .
There is no special reason why the body fluids ( including the blood plasma ) should be the same osmotic concentration as the external environment except for the very big fact that it is an enormous metabolic expense to regulate the body fluids if they are different .
Even if you make the external surface relatively impermeable , the gills are necessarily directly exposed to the external environment , they have very large surface area and are extremely permeable to oxygen and carbon dioxide .
One of the examples of " incredibly poor design " in animals is our inability to produce a membrane permeable to gases but not to salts and to water .
As a result , any difference between the body fluids and the environment means a very large osmotic exchange of water and a diffusion exchange of salts that must be compensated somehow .
There are basically three ways of living in water .
If your body fluids match the environment , you have no problem -- life is easy .
This is the way virtually all marine invertebrates live .
They do have body fluids virtually the same as sea water .
They may have somewhat different Ca ++ and Mg++ concentrations than sea water , but that the NaCl concentration is pretty close as is the osmotic pressure .
Hence they have an easy life .
You might expect all marine creatures to live this way , but no -- see below .
The second way is to have body fluids significantly more concentrated than the environment .
That is the situation for all fresh - water animals .
Fresh water is so dilute there is no way to allow the body fluids to match it because that would require the intracellular fluids also to match it which appears to be incompatible with life .
So to keep the cells happy , the body fluids must be salty , hence must be more concentrated than the environment .
Therefore these animals are constantly taking in water by osmosis and losing salt .
As a result , these animals never drink and seek a source of salt in their food .
They also have evolved excretory organs ( kidneys , in the case of the vertebrates ) specialized in producing a very large volume of urine with special mechanisms to reabsorb as much salt as possible from the urine .
They also have special mechanisms in their gills and their gut to actively transport salts from the very dilute water they live in to the more concentrated body fluids .
These pumps use a substantial fraction of their metabolic energy , a severe evolutionary load .
However they have no choice and , besides , all their competitors in fresh water have exactly same problem .
Fresh water fish and amphibians live this way , as do fresh water worms , annelids , crustacea , and insects .
Note in particular two things .
First , these vertebrates have kidneys specialized to produce large volumes of very dilute urine and INwardly directly active transport systems ( towards the body fluids ) in kidney and other organs .
( Invertebrates are similar , but their excretory organs are not kidneys and work a bit differently ) .
Second , these vertebrates have body fluids significantly less concentrated than sea water , in fact roughly 1/3 the concentration of sea water .
That fact means the problem is not as severe as it might be if their body fluids were , indeed , as concentrated as sea water .
The third way to live is to have body fluids significantly more dilute than the environment .
This is the situation for virtually all salt - water fish , as well as reptiles , birds , and mammals that live oceanic lives and never encounter fresh - water .
Because of this imbalance , they constantly lose water to the environment by osmosis and take on salts by diffusion .
To compensate , they must constantly drink ( only salt water fish actually " drink like a fish " , fresh - water fish never drink ! ) and must excrete a very tiny volume of extremely concentrated urine .
Also they must have OUTward directed active transport systems to eliminate the salt .
Not only is it a surprise to find out that these animals do exist -- their lives would be much simpler if they just had body fluids the same as sea water .
But it turns out that their kidneys are totally unable to produce concentrated urine or to transport salts in the OUTward direction at all !
They have extremely reduced kidneys that produce tiny volumes of urine , but that urine is the same concentration as their body fluids .
They do have specialized outwardly directly salt transport systems in their gills and gut ,
So the existence of these animals seems to be a problem .
Then there is the problem of terrestrial animals .
For simplicity , I will only consider the terrestrial vertebrates -- amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals ( OK , I know there is no such thing as " reptile " , but no matter , the argument still holds ) .
All these animals have body fluids roughly the same osmotic concentration as fresh - water fish , roughly 1/3 the concentration of sea water .
In other words , this completely explains the original question -- why humans have body fluids significantly less salty than sea water even though life first evolved in sea water .
The answer is most definitely NOT that oceans were 1/3 as salty back then .
It most definitely IS that the earliest vertebrates did evolve in salt water and then moved into fresh water .
As an adaptation to avoid the osmotic effect of living the " type - two " way described above , they dropped the salinity of their body fluids about as low as they could consistent with keeping their cells happy .
From then on , all vertebrate evolution ( including the lungfish and lobe - fin fish , the amphibians , the reptiles , the birds , and the mammals ) all retained the ancestral body fluid concentration roughly 1/3 sea water .
( Again , a technical detail .
I am grossly oversimplifying vertebrate and tetrapod evolution and using incorrect terms for modern animals to describe the ancient and extinct transition forms .
But that is simply the gross oversimplification ordinarily used in introductory expositions .
If you wish , replace " lungfish , lobe - fin fish , amphibian , reptile " with the proper cladistic term , throw in the dinosaurs ( although we do n't know what their body fluids were like ) and do it up right .
You still get the same result . )
Okay , the original question is now answered .
However , the full story is so beautiful and illustrates so well just how evolution is totally married to physiology , that I must continue .
Terrestrial vertebrates , the tetrapods ( amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals ) with good access to fresh water do n't have the same problems as fish because ( except for larval amphibians ) these animals do n't breath with gills .
If you make the skin impermeable , which all except the amphibians have done , you really do n't have the water and salt exchange problem .
However , all these animals still retain the same physiological pattern as fresh - water fish : a tendency to seek sources of salt in our food and kidneys specialized to produce large volumes of very dilute urine using salt transport mechanisms to reabsorb salt INTO the body from the urine .
Since we do n't constantly take in water osmotically through our gills , we do have a change in that we constantly seek to drink water .
Except for drinking water , we have kidneys and physiology " designed " for living in fresh water .
Now what about tetrapods that live either in deserts or in sea water and do not have access to fresh water ?
They constantly lose water by evaporation and take in salt with their food .
As a result , they share the same problem with salt - water fish : how to obtain enough water and how to get rid of excess salt .
Unfortunately , these animals are stuck with fresh - water kidneys -- kidneys that produce dilute urine and salt transport systems that are INward directed .
This is a REALLY BIG example of INCREDIBLY STUPID design in animals .
Amphibians can't cope -- they do n't live in marine environments .
( Yes , Rana cancrivora lives in salty mangrove swamps .
It is a special case , see below .
There are always special cases ! )
Reptiles and almost all birds , but especially including the truly marine birds like penguins , albatrosses , gulls , auks and puffins , ducks , etc cannot produce concentrated urine at all .
They have evolved specialized glands in the eyes , nose , and mouth that excrete salt .
( Of course these are not totally new inventions , they are derived from other glands like lachrymal and salivary glands ) .
Songbirds ( Passeriformes ) and mammals have taken a different tack .
They have devised an extremely clever trick in kidney structure to allow salt transport pumps which really take salt back INTO the body from the urine but still manage to use them to produce urine much more concentrated that their body fluids and so excrete salt FROM the body .
I can't go into that at all here -- it is a counter - current concentrating mechanism which , for mammals , involves the Loops of Henle in the kidney .
Birds and mammals use a similar type of trick but in very different ways , indicating separate evolution in these two groups .
The story is made even more tantalizing by some other special exceptions in the vertebrates .
The hagfish has body fluids the same as sea water , just like invertebrates .
The lamprey has body fluids more like fresh - water fish .
The explanation is that the earliest craniates evolved in sea water but virtually all the rest of vertebrate evolution past the hagfish stage occurred in fresh .
This was proposed very early in the 20th century from the physiological data .
I believe this was even before other paleontological evidence demonstrated that it was correct .
( Although I am sure the vertebrate paleontologists in this group -- if they got to read this far -- will promptly correct me ) .
And , more interesting , it demonstrated that hagfish and lampreys were not all that closely related even though they were lumped together as " cyclostomes " until relatively recently .
In other words , the body fluids of hagfish and lampreys very beautifully illustrate vertebrate evolution .
Then most of the rest of the vertebrates , having evolved in fresh water , developed body fluids much more dilute than sea water .
That is , human blood plasma salinity is another beautiful illustration of evolution , exactly contrary to Uncle Davey 's claim that it can not be explained !
But wait , it gets even better !
The sharks are virtually all salt - water fish , but they have body fluids whose concentration is even slightly MORE concentrated than sea water !
How could that be if vertebrates after lampreys evolved in fresh water ?
It turns out that the SALT concentration of their body fluids is quite consistent with that of fresh water fish , much more DILUTE than salt water .
But they make up the difference by all lowing urea to accumulate in their body fluids to make up the osmotic difference .
As a result they have the same WATER problem as fresh - water animals ( body fluids more concentrated than their environment ) so their kidneys work OK .
However they do have a SALT problem just the opposite .
Their kidneys can't do the job -- remember , they inherited a fresh - water kidney .
So they evolved special rectal glands to excrete salt .
Even more interesting , the Coelecanth , that " fossil relic " of a lobe - fin fish discovered in deep oceanic water , does the same trick with urea .
So does that weird frog , Rana cancrivora , the only amphibian that can tolerate concentrated salt .
These illustrate convergent evolution -- a similar mechanism evolving quite independently in different groups to solve the same problem .
Of course , there is no " irreducible complexity " involved -- vertebrate kidneys are very good at producing urea and vertebrate kidneys are ordinarily very good at excreting it .
It does n't take that much change to retain the urea and urea is not all that toxic or dangerous so having the cells develop a tolerance to it is not all that difficult .
The salt - water fish have a better solution ( see below ) but they evolved separately from these others .
Evolution does n't always pick the best solution , just one that works well enough to keep you in the game .
Another nice illustration of evolutionary principles .
So what about salt - water fish ?
Since they derived from fresh - water fish that then migrated back out to the ocean , they inherited kidneys and body fluids totally unsuited for the job .
So many of them simply let their kidneys shrink into insignificance -- they are not that useful .
They drink to take in water and have gill and gut OUTward transport systems to eliminate the salt .
This seems much more effective than the urea trick .
The only way you can easily understand this situation is to realize that they did in fact originate in fresh - water .
Again , the evolutionary pattern exactly matches the physiology .
Even more -- there are fresh water fish that have extremely reduced kidneys and have even weirder mechanisms to regulate body fluids .
It turns out that these guys evolved from sea water fish that migrated back to fresh water !
In other words , the pattern of evolution went from seawater ( earliest craniates ) to fresh ( later craniates and teleosts ) to seawater ( saltwater teleosts ) to fresh ( this weirdos ) .
I have already covered the extremely strange situation of desert and salt water mammals .
Even humans live in rather arid climates and often have little fresh water available .
We can produce concentrated urine ( though not nearly as concentrated as desert and marine mammals ) but , remember , we too inherited kidneys totally unsuited for the task .
Remember , the basic freshwater pattern is to produce lots of dilute urine but desert dwellers must produce a small amount of concentrated urine .
So evolution to the rescue once again : build a Loop of Henle and use the INward directed salt pumps to simulate an OUTward directed transport system , hence get concentrated urine .
Evolution wins , again !
Yes , I am getting just a little punchy , but this is a subject I truly love .
Everything about biology , including human physiology , is a beautiful product of the evolutionary process .
Read Homer Smith to get a more temperate and literate discussion of all this .
So , Uncle Davey , your claim that " the sea must have been a lot less salty than it is now " is completely wrong .
You point that " in saltwater cells need additional resources to those needed in freshwater in order to osmoregulate " is entirely wrong for salt water invertebrates , for hagfish , and for any other animal that evolved in saltwater and remained their .
It is true for salt water fish because they evolved from fresh water varieties .
The pattern of blood plasma salinity in humans and in all vertebrate animals and , indeed , in all animals is a beautiful exposition of evolutionary principles , not a contradiction of evolutionary predictions .
Incidentally , if you ever do get stranded in the middle of the ocean on a life raft with no water , I suggest that you do NOT drink the sea water .
Not only is it very salty , the high Mg concentration tends to produce diarrhea which makes your situation even worse .
Instead , catch fish and drink their body fluid !
It is significantly less salty than seawater .
Do NOT catch marine invertebrates and drink their body fluids -- they are just as salty as the ocean .

Faith and Truth Post of the Month Runner - Up : May 2005 by Louann Miller Our apologies , but you must have JavaScript enabled to view author contact information .
Subject : Science , religion , truth , and lies : a comparison of standards .
Date : 4 May 2005 Message -ID : 1115232311.411650.243850@g14g2000cwa.googlegroups.com
As we know , a lot of the heat in the evolution v. creationism debate comes from the fact that the two sides often talk past each other from radically different frames of reference .
There are real differences in the moral weight that the cultures of science and religion attach to certain ideas .
I think " truth " is one of those ideas .
I also think -- and I think I can support this -- that science has far , far stricter moral standards in the ' truth ' department than religion does .
To start with , creationist groups like AiG and ICR use a definition of " true " which I would n't call either scientific or religious , but political .
( If you think that I 'm implying a lower moral standard with that word , well spotted . )
By that standard , reality is what you can get away with .
That 's why you see things like quotes taken out of context http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/project.html repeated again and again as if they were n't total misrepresentations of what the original speaker actually said .
That 's why AiG 's list of arguments creationists should n't use http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/dont_use.asp speaks in terms of " you could be caught out , and lose the argument , if you use these " rather than " it is morally wrong to use arguments that we know to be inaccurate . "
Read it for yourself , on their own site .
But deliberate dishonesty aside , there 's still a difference in mindset between science and more genuine kinds of religion .
Differing definitions of ' faith ' and ' truth ' are big parts of it .
In a religious context , ' faith ' and ' truth ' are almost synonyms .
And faith is automatically good .
If an idea is considered truth in your religion , and you do n't have faith in it , that 's a reflection on your failure as a faith - holder rather than the idea 's failure to be true .
If you do n't have enough faith on a given subject , you should work harder at it .
In the sciences , that kind of faith is not a virtue ; it 's a personal failing .
Imagine a bridge engineer being invited to " have more faith " that a design has enough steel in it to keep his bridge from collapsing .
His faith has nothing to do with it ; either the bridge stays up , or it falls down .
Faith in the sense of ' letting yourself be persuaded without adequate evidence ' is morally wrong in that context .
If the bridge engineer does so , and people die in the collapse , he 's murdered them .
Scientists , or the good ones , feel the same way about their theories that good engineers feel about their bridges .
It 's their job to make them right , not to convince themselves for their own emotional comfort that they 're already right , pretty much , close enough .
If a scientist says " I have faith this theory is true , " he does n't or should n't mean it in the religious sense of " I commit myself to this no matter what the evidence may say , forever .
Do n't try to change my mind , here I stand . "
Instead , he means or ought to mean " I 've tested this theory , and I 've seen the results of other people 's tests , and I 'm as sure as I can possibly get on the available evidence that this theory is as close to right as we can get .
Unless something else really radical turns up .
Keep me posted . "
Which , incidentally , is one reason why scientists in their professional personas are very sparing with words like ' faith ' and ' truth ' .
Just as the bridge engineer is supposed to know exact breaking strains rather than " probably close enough , " scientists are expected to be able to state exactly how confident they are in a given proposition and why they feel that confidence .
Faith and truth imply absolutes , which in a scientific context implies glossing over small details that might contradict those absolutes .

Firefighters Union Letter On Rudy Giuliani – March 8 , 2007
“ Regrettably , the situation with former Mayor Giuliani is very different .
His actions post 9/11 rise to such an offensive and personal attack on our brother and sisterhood — and directly on our union — that the IAFF does not feel Rudy Giuliani deserves an audience of IAFF leaders and members at our own Presidential Forum . ”
** This article is of interest to our readers and is posted on our site not because any candidate received or did n’t receive an endorsement for their candidacy but rather because the actions of Mayor Giuliani during and after the tragedies of 9/11 are of great national importance and are worth examining .
A large portion of the evidence at the scene of the most horrific crime ever committed on American soil were scooped up , put on barges and shipped to China to be melted down long before any thorough investigation could have been completed .
This was done on orders from the Federal level with the acquiesence of Mayor Giuliani .
At the time of this writing more than 52 separate investigations of the Bush Administration have been initiated by Congress .
So many critical questions remain in the wake of the woefully inadequate 9/11 Commission Report , which was based upon a highly partisan , hand - picked Presidential Commission .
The Bush Administration grudgingly allowed this after 441 days and then only in with the caveats that they have absolute final editing rights to the final report .
President Bush and Vice President Cheney also only agreed to testify together , behind closed doors , not under oath and before only a small portion of the commission panel of their coosing .
The investigation must be re-opened by a truly independent Commission so that the families of the victims , the American people and the rest of the world can know the entire truth about the “ New Pearl Harbor ” that has been used as the basis upon which the last five and a half years of the Bush Administration ’s coordinated assault upon the our Constitutional liberties and freedoms has been justified .**

O'Neill and Holt subjected their victim ( centre ) to a " wicked " ordeal
Tammy McGregor , 19 , had hot salted water poured over her wounds and cigarettes stubbed out on her at a flat in Aberdeen .
Lee Holt , 27 , and Donna O'Neill , 21 , admitted assault , causing severe injury and permanent disfigurement .
At the High Court in Edinburgh , Holt received nine years and O'Neill eight .
The judge , Lord Bracadale , said that they had subjected their victim to a long and sustained experience of torture over several hours .
To subject a vulnerable woman to the kind of physical and mental torture that day beggars belief
Grampian Police statement
The judge added that such examples of calculated wickedness were rare .
Relatives of Ms McGregor told BBC Scotland they were " delighted " with the sentence after what she had endured .
Ms McGregor 's ordeal began when she was lured to a tenement flat in the city 's Park Road in September last year .
There the accused tied her up , beat her , slashed her with a knife , stubbed out cigarettes on her head and body and threatened to kill her .
Alerted police
Ms McGregor was described as having a mental age of 12 and was terrified .
Holt was Ms McGregor 's former lover and the attack happened after it was claimed she had spread rumours that he was a rapist .
Her face was so badly swollen doctors could not operate on her immediately and she had to use a wheelchair for three months .
She also suffered a broken nose and jaw and needed treatment to cuts all over her body .
My friend phoned the police while I kept Donna O'Neill occupied talking until the police arrived
James Murray
Torturer ' not the brightest boy '
James Murray was visiting a friend at the flats in Park Road on the day the torture took place .
They managed to alert police after Holt came to tell them what was going on .
Mr Murray told BBC Scotland : " We did n't know whether to believe him or not as it was a little bit surreal .
" It was only later when Donna O'Neill came to the flat and Lee Holt went back downstairs and Donna actually confirmed what was going on that we clicked .
" My friend phoned the police while I kept Donna O'Neill occupied talking until the police arrived . "
Grampian Police said in a statement : " This was an appalling attack on a vulnerable and defenceless young woman .
No -one deserves to be subjected to the kind of terrifying ordeal Lee Holt and Donna O'Neill put her through .
" To subject a vulnerable woman to the kind of physical and mental torture that day beggars belief .
" Only time will tell how she will recover physically and emotionally .
It is to be hoped today 's sentence will help her get over the events of last September and get on with her life . "
The way we live and think everything is dedicated to material pleasure .
We consider sense objects to be of utmost importance and materialistically devote ourselves to whatever makes us happy , famous and popular .
Even though all this comes from our mind , we are so totally preoccupied by the external objects themselves that we never look within , we never question what makes them so interesting .
However , this mind is an inseparable part of us ; as long as we exist our mind is there within us .
Thus we are always up and down .
It is not our body that goes up and down , it is our mind — the mind whose way of functioning we do not understand .
Therefore , sometimes you have to examine yourself ; not just your body but your mind , which is the thing that is telling you what to do .
You have to know your own psychology , or , in religious terminology , perhaps , your inner nature .
But no matter what you call it , you have to know your own mind .
Do n't think that examining and knowing the nature of your mind is only an Eastern trip .
That 's a wrong conception ; it 's not an Eastern trip , it 's your trip .
How can you separate your body , or the picture you have of your self , from your mind ?
You can't say , " I have the material power to separate my body from my mind . "
That 's impossible .
You think you are a free person in the world , enjoying everything .
That 's what you think , but you are not free .
I 'm not saying that you are under the control of someone else ; it 's your own attachment , your own uncontrolled mind that you are oppressed by .
If you can discover how it oppresses you , the uncontrolled mind will disappear automatically .
Thus knowing your own mind is the solution for your mental problems .
One day the world is so beautiful ; the next day it is so bad .
How can you say that !
Scientifically it 's impossible for the world to change radically like that .
It 's simply your mind that makes this happen .
Do n't think that this is religious dogma ; our going up and down is not religious dogma .
I 'm not talking about religion ; I 'm talking about the way you lead your life , which is what sends you up down .
The people and the environment do n't change radically ; the changes are in your own mind .
Surely you can understand that — it 's so simple .
Similarly , one person thinks that the world is beautiful and people are wonderful and kind , but another thinks that everything and everyone are horrible .
Who is right ?
How do you explain that scientifically ?
It 's just their individual mind 's projection of the sense world .
Hence you feel , " Today is like this , tomorrow is like that ; this man is like this ; that woman is like that . "
But where is the absolutely fixed , forever - beautiful woman ?
Who is the absolutely forever - handsome man ?
They are non-existent ; they are simply creations of your mind .
Also , you should not expect material objects to satisfy you and make your life perfect ; that too is impossible .
How can you be satisfied by even vast amounts of material objects ?
How can you be satisfied by sleeping with hundreds of different people ?
It 's impossible .
Satisfaction comes from the mind .
Your dissatisfied mind wanting to keep changing from one person to another , from one trip to another , can never satisfy you .
This is just your mind .
So you see , if you do n't know your own psychology , you might ignore what 's going on in your mind until it breaks down and you go completely crazy .
People go mad through lack of inner wisdom , the ability to examine their own mind .
They cannot explain themselves to themselves ; they do n't know how to talk to themselves .
Thus they are constantly preoccupied with all these external objects while their mind within is running down until it finally cracks .
They are ignorant of their internal world ; their minds are totally unified with ignorance instead of being awake and engaged in self - analysis .
It is so necessary to examine your own mental attitudes ; it is essential that you become your own therapist .
You people are intelligent : you know that material objects alone cannot bring you satisfaction .
However , you do n't need to embark on some emotional , religious trip to examine your own mind .
Some people think they do ; they think that this kind of self - analysis is something spiritual or religious .
To do this it's not necessary to classify yourself as a follower of this or that philosophy or religion .
But if you want to be happy you do have to check the way you lead your life .
For this you do n't need to put yourself into some religious category ; your own mind is your religion .
When you check your mind , you should not rationalize or push .
Relax .
Do not be upset when problems come .
Just be conscious of them and their origin , knowing their root .
Introduce the problem to yourself :
Here is this kind of problem .
How has it become a problem ?
What kind of mind has made it a problem ?
What kind of mind feels that it 's a problem ?
This is so simple , and when you check thoroughly , the problem automatically disappears .
That is simple , is n't it ?
For that to happen , you do n't have to believe in something .
Do n't believe anything !
All the same , you can't say , I do n't believe I have a mind .
You can't reject your mind .
You can say , I reject Eastern things — I agree .
But can you reject yourself ?
Can you reject your head , your nose ?
You can not reject your mind .
Therefore , treat yourself wisely and try to discover the true source of satisfaction .
When you were a child you loved and craved chocolate and cake , and you thought , “ When I 'm old like my parents , I 'll have all the chocolate and cake I want , and then I 'll be happy . ”
You made that kind of mental decision .
Now you have so much chocolate and cake , but you 're bored .
So you decide that since this does n't make you happy you 'll get a car , a house , television , a husband or wife — then , you 'll be happy .
So now you have everything , but there are more problems .
The car is a problem ; the house is a problem ; the husband or wife is a problem ; the children are a problem .
You realize , Oh , this is not satisfaction .
Then , what is satisfaction ?
Go through all this mentally and check ; it 's very important .
Examine your life from childhood to the present — meditate .
This is meditation , analytical meditation .
At that time my mind was like that ; now my mind is like this .
It has changed this way , that way .
You see , your mind has changed so many times but still you have not reached any conclusion as to what really makes you happy .
My interpretation of this is that you are lost .
I do n't care that you know your way around the city , that you know how to get home , that you know where to buy chocolate ; as far as I 'm concerned , you 're lost ; you ca n’t find your goal .
Check honestly , you 'll find that this is so .
Therefore , Lord Buddha is saying that you only have to know what you are , how you exist ; that 's all .
You do n't have to anything .
Just understand your mind : how it works ; how attachment and desire arise ; how ignorance arises ; where the emotions come from .
It is sufficient to know the nature of all that ; just that gives so much happiness and peace .
Your life changes completely ; everything gets turned upside down ; what you interpreted as horrible becomes beautiful .
It 's truly possible .
I 'm sure that if I told you that all you were living for was chocolate and ice cream you 'd think I was crazy .
No , no , no , your arrogant mind would say .
But look deeper into your life ’s purpose .
What are you here for ?
Gaining a good reputation ?
Collecting possessions ?
Trying to be beautiful ?
I 'm not exaggerating — check for yourselves , then you 'll see .
Through thorough examination you can realize that if your entire life is dedicated to seeking happiness through things like chocolate and ice cream , there is no significance in your being born human .
Birds and dogs have the same kind of attitude to life .
If you think you 're intelligent you should dedicate your life to goals higher than those of chickens !
I 'm not deciding your life for you , but you check up .
It 's much better to have an integrated life than to live in mental disorder .
Otherwise your life is not worthwhile , not beneficial to yourself or others .
Ask yourself what you are living for — for chocolate ?
For steak ?
Perhaps for education .
But that also comes from the mind .
Without the mind , what is education , what is philosophy ?
A philosophy is somebody 's way of thinking , thoughts put together in a certain way .
Without the mind there 's no philosophy no doctrine , no university subjects .
These things are mind - made .
How to check the mind ?
Just watch how your mind perceives or interprets any object that it contacts ; what feeling — comfortable or uncomfortable — arises .
Then you check :
When I perceive this kind of view , this feeling arises ; that emotion comes ; I discriminate in such a way .
Why ,
This is how to check the mind ; that 's all ; it 's very simple .
When you have checked your own mind properly you stop blaming others ; you recognize that actions come from your own defiled , deluded mind .
When you are preoccupied with material , external objects , you always blame them and others for your problems .
Then you become miserable because you project that view onto external phenomena instead of seeing their reality .
So you can realize your fade - conception view — the attitude , or nature , of your own mind .
You might think that this is all very new for you , but it 's not .
Whenever you are going to do anything , first you check whether to do it or not and then make your decision .
Since you do this already , I 'm not giving you something new ; the difference is that you are not doing it enough .
You have to do more checking .
To do this you do n't have to sit in some corner on your own — you can be checking your mind all the time , even while talking or working with other people .
Also , you should n't think that examining the mind is something only for those who are on an Eastern trip .
Do n't think that way .
You should also realize that the nature of the mind is different from that of the mesh and bone of this physical body .
The mind is like a mirror , reflecting everything without discrimination .
If you have understanding - wisdom you will control the sort of reflections you allow in your mind - mirror .
If you totally ignore what is happening in your mind , it will reflect all kinds of garbage — things that make you psychologically ill .
Your checking - wisdom should distinguish between reflections that are beneficial and those that bring psychological problems .
Eventually , when you realize the nature of subject and object , all your problems will dissolve .
Some people think they are religious , but what is religious ?
If you are not examining your own nature , not gaining knowledge - wisdom , in what way are you religious ?
Just the idea that you are religious — I am Buddhist , Jewish — does not help at all .
It does not help you ; it does not help others .
If you have knowledge - wisdom , you can really help others .
The greatest problems of humanity are psychological , not material .
From birth to death , people are continuously under the control of their mental sufferings .
Some people never keep watch on their minds when things are going well , but when something goes wrong — an accident or some other terrible experience — they immediately say , God , please help me .
They call themselves religious but they 're just joking .
In happiness or sorrow , a serious practitioner maintains constant awareness of God and their own nature .
You 're not being realistic or even remotely religious if you forget yourself when you are having a good time , surrounded by chocolate and preoccupied by worldly sense pleasures , and turn to God only when something awful happens .
That does n't help .
No matter which of the many world religions we consider , their interpretation of God or Buddha or whatever is simply words and mind ; only these two .
Therefore words do n't matter so much .
What you have to realize is that everything — good and bad ; all kinds of philosophies and doctrines — comes from mind .
The mind is very powerful ; therefore it requires strong direction .
A powerful jet plane needs a good pilot ; your mind - pilot should be wisdom understanding the nature of the mind .
Then powerful energy can directed to benefit your life instead of being allowed to run uncontrollably like a mad elephant , destroying yourself and others .

Mr Ahmadinejad again insisted Iran 's programme was peaceful
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad accused the US and UK of abusing their " special privileges " and said a debate would let both sides air their views uncensored .
The White House called his suggestion a " diversion " from global concerns over Iran 's nuclear programme .
Mr Ahmadinejad was speaking two days before a UN deadline for Iran to halt work on its nuclear programme .
He said Tehran had proposed a framework for further talks but said no - one could stop Iran having a peaceful programme .
" Peaceful nuclear energy is the right of the Iranian nation , " he told a news conference .
The debate should be uncensored in order for the American people to be able to listen to what we say
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
" The Iranian nation has chosen that [ course ] based upon international regulations , it wants to use it and no - one can stop it . "
He said Iran 's response to an incentives package , offered by six nations in exchange for a halt to its nuclear programme , was an " exceptional opportunity " to resolve the dispute .
When asked if Iran would halt enrichment , he said any kind of dialogue " should be based upon the certain rights of the Iranian nation " .
UN veto
" I suggest holding a live TV debate with Mr George W Bush to talk about world affairs and the ways to solve those issues , " Mr Ahmadinejad told reporters .
" The debate should be uncensored in order for the American people to be able to listen to what we say and they should not restrict the American people from hearing the truth . "
Iran shows no sign of halting its nuclear work
Iran and many other nations " are against America 's practices in managing the world " , he said , calling such practices unjust .
He accused both the US and UK of taking advantage of their " special privileges " , saying he thought they were the " the origin of all disturbances in the world " .
And he also questioned their right to a veto in the UN Security Council .
" Is n't it time that international relations are founded on democracy and equal rights of the nations ? " he went on .
But he did not rule out talks with the US in future , if certain conditions were met .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's challenge to President Bush was dismissed by the White House .
" Talk of a debate is just a diversion from the legitimate concerns that the international community , not just the US , has about Iran 's behaviour , " White House spokeswoman Dana Perino was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying .
Sanctions
Iran has been given until 31 August to halt uranium enrichment - a possible route to nuclear weapons .
Earlier this week , Tehran had offered " serious talks " in response to a package of incentives put forward by the five permanent UN Security Council members and Germany .
Washington has proposed implementing sanctions if Iran fails to meet the deadline , while Russia has said such a move would be premature .
Mr Ahmadinejad said it was " unlikely " the Security Council would take action against Iran , and said " sanctions are not an issue " .
" We have said everything in our response .
I think the time to use the instrument of the Security Council has expired , " he said .
Lenovo debuted its first Linux - based laptops at LinuxWorld in San Francisco on Tuesday , running SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 provided through a partnership with Novell .
The systems are the result of a two - year research effort by the two companies as well as Intel , whose Centrino Duo processors power the portable .
The Thinkpad T60 p is an inch thin and weighs 4.7 pounds .
Several features of Lenovo's Windows - based notebooks , including Help Center support , the ThinkPad Configuration Utility , Power Manager and Access Connections have been ported to Linux , the company said .
" The ThinkPad T60 p is a milestone for our collaboration and shared commitment with Novell to develop innovative and powerful workstation solutions , " Notebook Business Unit vice president Marc Godin said .
" Engineers running intensive based applications can now leverage these enhanced features while working remotely in the Linux environment . "

Lenovo expects the laptop to quickly become popular among IT administrators , engineers and others who require Linux for their everyday tasks .
Its partners also said the laptops would help to enhance productivity in Linux - heavy environments .
While the laptops are intended for business users , they are available to anyone to order through the Lenovo Web site .
Various features that have proven problematic in previous attempts to merge Linux with a laptop such as hibernation , warm and cold docking , and other notebook - specific technologies have all been corrected , making the unit run very similar to a Windows or Mac portable , Lenovo said .
Along with the release of the Linux laptop , the company recommitted itself to Linux support , saying all of its portables could handle at least basic Linux functionality .
Lenovo will also extend support for SUSE Linux to select models outside of the T60 p , and will offer drivers and utilities on the support site .
Two models of the T60 p will be made available immediately .
A 14 - inch version will start at $ 3,099 USD , and a 15 - inch version starts at $ 3,199 USD .
Humour Title This Article !

( This post is n't about revitalization , but what 's the point of a blog if you can't riff occasionally on quirks that do n't fit anywhere else ?
I promise it wo n't become a habit . )
I was recently reading an article in Slate on falling birthrates .
When it mentioned Philip Longman 's new book Empty Cradle : How Falling Birthrates Threaten World Prosperity and What To Do About
It , I had an epiphany of sorts concerning the book 's title , which followed what I suddenly realized is a painfully predictable non-fiction template .
The pattern is simple but almost infinitely variable .
Start with a memetic catch - phrase that identifies a problem , and follow it up with a colon .
Then finish it off with a phrase promising to explain how the problem happened and " what to do about it . "
A quick search on Amazon turned up the following punctilious titles :

I also found the following books , which deviate slightly from the mold while still hewing it its principles :

Twelve years after the establishment of that First Congress , on March 4 , 1801 , Thomas Jefferson was sworn in as the third President of the United States .
On that day , he said :
About to enter , fellow - citizens , on the exercise of duties which comprehend everything dear and valuable to you , it is proper you should understand what I deem the essential principles of our Government , and consequently those which ought to shape its Administration ...
Equal and exact justice to all men , of whatever state or persuasion , religious or political ; peace , commerce , and honest friendship with all nations , entangling alliances with none ; the support of the State governments in all their rights , as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwarks against antirepublican tendencies ; the preservation of the General Government in its whole constitutional vigor , as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad ; a jealous care of the right of election by the people -- a mild and safe corrective of abuses which are lopped by the sword of revolution where peaceable remedies are unprovided ; absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority , the vital principle of republics , from which is no appeal but to force , the vital principle and immediate parent of despotism ; a well - disciplined militia , our best reliance in peace and for the first moments of war till regulars may relieve them ; the supremacy of the civil over the military authority ; economy in the public expense , that labor may be lightly burdened ; the honest payment of our debts and sacred preservation of the public faith ; encouragement of agriculture , and of commerce as its handmaid ; the diffusion of information and arraignment of all abuses at the bar of the public reason ; freedom of religion ; freedom of the press , and freedom of person under the protection of the habeas corpus , and trial by juries impartially selected .
These principles form the bright constellation which has gone before us and guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation .
The wisdom of our sages and blood of our heroes have been devoted to their attainment .
They should be the creed of our political faith , the text of civic instruction , the touchstone by which to try the services of those we trust ; and should we wander from them in moments of error or of alarm , let us hasten to retrace our steps and to regain the road which alone leads to peace , liberty , and safety .
It is no small irony that the Judiciary Act which established those Federal Courts long ago so near where I am now , was the engine for the decision last week that deemed that the Military Commissions Act , which stripped the Federal Courts of the right to hear habeas corpus cases in regards to those prisoners held by our government at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , was not in violation of Article 1 , Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution .
I am neither a lawyer nor a legal expert .
As such , I am not fit to speak to you expertly on the legal issues of that decision .
But that decision did make one thing clear which I can speak expertly on , as an American citizen of equal franchise with every judge , Representative , and President in the land : in a moment of terror and alarm , we have wandered away from the creed of our political faith , as Jefferson warned us we might .
Indeed , we have wandered so far that we cannot hold out hope that our institutions , our systemic checks and balances crafted specifically so that we do not wander from our core tenets of self - governance , cannot bring us back to our chosen path alone .
They demand that we the people hasten the way .
We began that process last year , when through our efforts and contributions and execution of our franchise , we changed the nature of the membership of our Federal Representatives in the Congress .
That has made the restoration of these fundamental values of our nation possible .
But it has not been enough .
In our Senate , two bills have been introduced to committee : S 185 , sponsored by Sen. Specter and Sen. Leahy , is the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007 , introduced on Jan. 4 , 2007 , and remaining in the Senate Committee on the Judiciary ; and S 576 , sponsored by Sen. Dodd , Sen. Feingold , Sen. Menendez , and Sen. Leahy , the Restoring the Constitution Act of 2007 , introduced on Feb. 13 , 2007 , and which remains in the Senate Committee on Armed Services .
Although S 576 is in my opinion the better bill , S 185 would seem to have the best chance of immediate passage by the full Senate .
On March 4 , 1861 , nearly one hundred forty six years ago , Abraham Lincoln , swore for the first time to preserve , protect and defend the union of the United States under the Constitution .
On that day , he said :
We are not enemies , but friends .
We must not be enemies .
Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection .
The mystic chords of memory , stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land , will yet swell the chorus of the Union , when again touched , as surely they will be , by the better angels of our nature .
In that spirit , I wish to say to all Americans that it is with friendship and equal affection that I observe that while much about our nation ’s government divides us , it is and always has been in union that we have followed this path lit by the shared beliefs of which Jefferson spoke .
It is in union as well that we will need to lead our representatives back to the path which leads to peace , liberty and safety .
Therefore , several other members of this community and I have decided to use the week leading up to the 218th anniversary of the Constitution of these United States coming into force as the law of our nation to speak to you about the importance of the restoration of the freedom of persons under the protection of the habeas corpus to the law of our shared political creed , and to ask you to join us in calling upon the members of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and of the Senate Committee on the Armed Services to refer S 185 and S 576 to the full Senate for immediate deliberation and vote .
We do so in the hope and belief that the union of many American people can lead our representatives through our reasoned argument and entreaty to hear the better angels of our nature , and restore this tenet to its rightful place among the essential principles of our government .
I hope you will join us .

WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
A BBC pollster at work in Iraq
It will come as no surprise that gathering reliable data in Iraq is an extremely tough and dangerous exercise .
Carrying out an opinion poll - like the one commissioned by the BBC ( in alliance with other media organisations ) - poses many safety issues , with researchers facing personal risk because of escalating violence .
There are also concerns about people being too frightened to give a stranger an honest answer about sensitive subjects , including politics .
The method of collecting data also comes under close scrutiny .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular feature in the BBC News Magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
Leading medical journal the Lancet was criticised after publishing research by a US university last October claiming the invasion of Iraq had led to the deaths of an estimated 655,000 Iraqis .
At the time it was 10 times higher than any other estimate , even by human rights organisations .
The research was done by a team of Iraqi doctors who visited 1,849 households asking residents about recent deaths in the household .
Answering its critics , the journal said its method was more reliable than counting dead bodies , given the obstacles preventing more comprehensive fieldwork in the country .
With all these limitations , how do you carry out an opinion poll in Iraq ?
Ethnic match
The BBC poll was conducted by the US - based market research company D3 Systems .
More than 2,000 people were questioned in more than 450 neighbourhoods and villages across all 18 provinces of Iraq .
The interviews were done between 25 February and 5 March 2007 and the number conducted in each area depended on population size .
All the researchers were Iraqi and organisers tried , as much as possible , to match the ethnic and religious background of the interviewers with the neighbourhoods they were visiting .
The questioning was done in Arabic or Kurdish .
IRAQ POLL RESULTS
Read the findings
The interviewers were given a specific location to start from and then visited every third house on the left until they had finished the interviews assigned to them .
This method was used to ensure they did n't just visit nice or safe - looking houses .
Supervisors were also sent back to check the route they followed .
Once at the house , the interviewer made a list of the people aged 18 and over .
The person interviewed was the one with the birthday closest to the date of the interviewer had come to the house .
This was to ensure the interviewer did n't just select the nicest or most willing person from the household .
The system also helped to make sure there was a random distribution of ages , genders and other demographic characteristics .
Harassed
The work could be dangerous and frustrating .
Some pollsters reported witnessing bomb attacks and clashes between rival groups as they went door to door .
Others said they were harassed by police or local militia groups who wanted to know why they were asking questions .
They also had to deal with the daily problems of moving around the country .
" Roads are closed and obstacles come up after bombs go off , there are curfews put in place - these are frustrations they have to face in doing their work , " says D3's Matt Warshaw .
" They are no different than what any other Iraqi has to face in their day to day life . "
Pollsters would use birth date to determine who to interview
They agreed to be interviewed on a broad range of topics , from the supply of electricity to their homes to their views on Iraqi politics .
The refusal rate was on average between 20 % and 30 % , the organisers say - that 's lower than in the US and the UK .
There is debate about whether people who might be fearful would really give honest answers .
Mr Warshaw says his impression was that most Iraqi people wanted their opinions known .
" I do n't see an overwhelming reason why Iraqis should be dishonest in polling and I do n't see any evidence that they were .
I think the majority of people want others to hear what 's happening in their lives . "
The document being drawn up by the British government and the US will be presented to the Iraqi parliament in October and will spark fresh controversy over how long British troops will stay in the country .
Tony Blair hopes that , despite continuing and widespread violence in Iraq , the move will show that there is progress following the conflict of 2003 .
Britain has already privately informed Japan - which also has troops in Iraq - of its plans to begin withdrawing from southern Iraq in May , a move that officials in Tokyo say would make it impossible for their own 550 soldiers to remain .
The increasingly rapid pace of planning for British military disengagement has been revealed on the eve of the Labour Party conference , which will see renewed demands for a deadline for withdrawal .
It is hoped that a clearer strategy on Iraq will quieten critics who say that the government will not be able to ' move on ' until Blair quits .
Yesterday , about 10,000 people demonstrated against the army 's continued presence in the country .
Speaking to The Observer this weekend , the Defence Secretary , John Reid , insisted that the agreement being drawn up with Iraqi officials was contingent on the continuing political process , although he said he was still optimistic British troops would begin returning home by early summer .
' The two things I want to insist about the timetable is that it is not an event but a process , and that it will be a process that takes place at different speeds in different parts of the country .
I have said before that I believe that it could begin in some parts of the country as early as next July .
It is not a deadline , but it is where we might be and I honestly still believe we could have the conditions to begin handover .
I do n't see any reason to change my view .
' But if circumstances change I have no shame in revising my estimates . '
The disclosures follow rising demands for the government to establish a clearer strategy for bringing troops home following the kidnapping of two British SAS troopers in Basra and the scenes of violence that surrounded their rescue .
Last week Blair 's own envoy to Iraq , Sir Jeremy Greenstock , warned that Britain could be forced out if Iraq descends so far into chaos that ' we do n't have any reasonable prospect of holding it together ' .
Continued tension between the Iraqi police force , the Iraqi administration and British troops was revealed again yesterday when an Iraqi magistrate called for the arrest of the two British special forces soldiers .
who were on a surveillance mission when they were taken into custody by Iraqi police and allegedly handed on to a militia .
For Blair , the question of withdrawal is one of the most difficult he is facing .
The Prime Minister has abandoned plans , announced last February , to publish his own exit strategy setting out the milestones which would have to be met before quitting : instead , the plans are now being negotiated between a commission representing the Shia - dominated Iraqi government , and senior US and UK diplomats and military commanders in Baghdad .
Senior military sources have told The Observer that the document will lay out a point - by - point ' road map ' for military disengagement by multinational forces , the first steps of which could be put in place soon after December 's nationwide elections .
Each stage of the withdrawal would be locally judged on regional improvements in stability , with units being withdrawn as Iraqi units are deemed capable of taking over .
Officials familiar with the negotiations said that conditions for withdrawal would not demand a complete cessation of insurgent violence , or the end of al - Qaeda atrocities .
According to the agreement under negotiation , each phase would be triggered when key security , stability and political targets have been reached .
The phased withdrawal strategy - the British side of which is expected to take at least 12 months to complete - would see UK troops hand over command responsibility for security to senior Iraqi officers , while remaining in support as a reserve force .
In the second phase British Warriors and other armoured vehicles would be removed from daily patrols , before a complete withdrawal of British forces to barracks .
The final phase - departure of units - would follow a period of months where Iraqi units had demonstrated their ability to deal with violence in their areas of operation .
Blair will tackle his critics over Iraq in his conference speech , aides said this weekend , but would decline to give a public deadline for withdrawing troops .
He is expected to make several major interventions on the war in the coming weeks , before a vote on the new constitution in mid-October , explaining how Iraq could be steered towards a sufficiently stable situation to allow troops to come home .
' What we are not going to set out is a timetable : what we are going to set out is a process of developing that security capability , ' said a Downing Street source .
' We do n't want to be there any longer than we have to be , the Iraqis do n't want us to be there any longer than we have to be , but the Iraqi Prime Minister has made it very clear that our presence there is one that is necessary . '
It was revealed yesterday that an Iraqi judge issued the warrants for the arrest of the two rescued soldiers , accusing them of killing one policeman and wounding another , carrying unlicensed weapons and holding false identification .
The continuing preparations for a military withdrawal come , however , as officials are bracing themselves for a new political crisis in Iraq next month , with what many regard as the inevitable rejection of a new constitution by a two - thirds majority in three provinces , sufficient to kill the document and trigger new elections .
The same officials believe that a failure of the controversial constitution - which Sunnis say favours the Shia majority - would require at least another year of political negotiations , threatening any plans to disengage .
First there 's shock tinged with disbelief .
A moment of wonder follows .
Then , a desperate scramble to rack your brains and work out just how you 've been had .
There 's no denying the effects of a good magic trick .
From the great escapes of Houdini and the surreal mental trickery of Derren Brown to the conjurors at children 's parties , the appeal is universal .
" Magic 's been around for a very long time and it improves over time , " says Richard Wiseman , a professor of psychology at Hertfordshire University .
" What you 're looking at when you see a finished piece of magic is a great deal of expertise , and I think psychologists have a lot to learn from that . "
But , not content with just enjoying the tricks , psychologists are now using their effects on the mind to work out how we handle the floods of sensory information coming into our brains and process it into a mental picture of the world around us .
Magic is a deception , a disruption of that orderly mental picture where things seem to float in mid-air or coins and cards vanish in front of our eyes .
Scientists now believe that , by mapping out how our brains are deceived , they could even help to unlock some of the mysteries of consciousness itself .
" Over the last five years , there 's been a reawakening as we look at things like change blindness [ a failure to see large changes in a visual scene ] and at the fact that consciousness is a construction and may even be an illusion , " says Wiseman , himself an accomplished magician and member of the Magic Circle .
" Now there 's a recognition that magicians are doing something very special . "
Some of the founders of modern psychology were fascinated by magicians : throughout the 1890s , Alfred Binet , inventor of the modern IQ test , and Max Dessoir wrote about the ways in which magicians used suggestion and misdirected attention to get their illusions to work .
In 1896 , Joseph Jastrow published articles in Science on the mechanics of some tricks by contemporary master magicians .
But , aside from describing what the magicians were doing , they were at a loss to explain why magic tricks had the effects they did on the audience .
As a result , interest in studying the psychology of magic faded for nearly a century .
But , as Wiseman says , a renaissance is now in full swing .
Magic is all about convincing others that the impossible has just happened .
And that deception is achieved with a high degree of skill and showmanship .
" We 're starting to realise that magicians have a lot of implicit knowledge about how we perceive the world around us because they have to deceive us in terms of controlling attention , exploiting the assumptions we make when we do and do n't notice a change in our environment , " says Wiseman .
" There is an enormous amount of really detailed instruction on how to perform magic .
People are always blown away by how detailed a description you 'll have . "
A card trick that lasts four or five minutes , for example , might have 20 pages of detailed text to describe exactly where to look , what to say , what to do and so on .
And a lot of the understanding of a trick has to be from the perspective of the audience .
While the magician 's dexterity is important , the audience is also a vital participant in the deception .
After all , it is in their minds that the illusion is created .
" Magicians seem to be able to carry out secret actions in front of their audience without being spotted .
I 'm interested in why people do n't perceive those actions , " says Gustav Kuhn , a psychologist at Durham University .
A simple example of misdirection is used in the coin drop trick .
" What you 're doing there is pretending to take the coin from one hand to the other but , in fact , leaving it in the original hand , " says Wiseman .
" What 's important is that you 're looking where you want the audience to look .
You 're not looking at the coin , you 're looking at the empty hand .
In terms of movement , you 're moving the hand that does n't contain the coin to attract people 's attention over to that hand . "
Another trick , where a magician pretends to throw a ball up in the air , takes the misdirection a step further .
" People often experience the ball moving up in the air even though there is no ball present , " says Kuhn .
They claim to see a ball moving but obviously it's not there so it must be in their mind . "
Psychologists can use these tricks to catch a glimpse into how our minds interpret the world around us .
" Magicians are manipulating your consciousness .
They are showing you something impossible , " says Wiseman .
" They 're getting you to construct a narrative , which simply is n't true .
So that means they know how to make you aware of certain things and blind to other things .
What I 'm hoping is that magic , this entertainment vehicle that has been around for a long time , will give us a real insight into the deep mysteries of consciousness . "
Our brains filter out a huge amount of the mass of sensory input flooding in from our environment .
Kuhn explains that we see what we expect to see and what our brains are interested in .
" Our visual representation of the world is much more impoverished than we would assume .
People can be looking at something without being aware of it .
Perception does n't just involve looking at an object but attending to it . "
In Kuhn 's recent work , he performed a trick where a cigarette seems to disappear .
It involved no sleight of hand or secret .
It was a simple case of dropping the cigarette into his lap .
" It happens right in front of the spectator 's eyes but I misdirect their attention away from the cigarette , " says Kuhn .
While his spectators watched , they wore eye trackers ( essentially a couple of cameras that monitor eye movement and provide an exact location of where a person is looking in a scene ) .
It is known that we only receive high - quality information from the area we are fixated on , right in the centre of our field of view .
If you stretch out your arm , it is about two thumbs ' width at the centre of your vision - everything else is pretty much blurred .
The way we compensate for this is to move our eyes around to fill in the gaps and create a better picture of the world around us .
Kuhn 's results , to be published in the journal Perception in the next few months , showed that simply staring at the location of the deception was not enough for people to discover how the trick happened .
" People could be looking very close to where the cigarette was being dropped without even seeing it , " he says .
" Other people were looking quite far away but they did actually did spot the cigarette . "
" What it shows is just how much of the picture in our head of our surroundings is a massive construction , based on expectations , what we think is important , what we normally encounter and so on , " says Wiseman .
" And that 's what magicians are very good at exploiting . "
Misdirection of an audience , therefore , depends on more than just making people look the wrong way - the truly successful magician misdirects attention .
Often , attention is focused on where a person is looking , but this can be manipulated .
" You might be looking at a scene and then you hear a voice from the back so your attention is moved towards the back and your processing of visual information will be impaired at the front , " says Kuhn .
Verbal suggestion can also play a big role in misdirection .
In a recent study , Wiseman looked at how the classic metal - bending tricks , employed by magicians the world over and perhaps made most famous by Uri Geller , used verbal cues .
In his experiment , he showed a group of students a video of a trick where a magician bends a key , apparently using his psychokinetic ability ( in fact , the bending was done by sleight of hand ) .
The magician then placed the key on a table and the video ended with a static shot of the bent key , which did not bend any further .
But a voiceover from the magician at this stage suggested that the key was indeed continuing to bend .
The results , published this year in the British Journal of Psychology , showed that 40 % of people claimed to see the key continuing to bend during the static shot at the end of the video .
In the control group , where there was no voiceover from the magician , only 5 % reported that they saw the key continuing to bend .
Of course , suggestion can take other forms .
" With the ball experiment , we discovered that people are n't just looking up at the ball , they 're looking at facial clues to judge where the ball is going to end up , " says Kuhn .
" If the magician does n't look up in the air , the trick does n't work .
People feel that they 're watching the ball but what they are doing is monitoring the magician 's face and cues and using that information to guide their eye movements . "
This leads to an interesting idea - could some people be immune to some of the effects of magic ?
People who suffer from autism , for example , tend to have difficulties gauging facial cues , so their attention is less influenced by where somebody is looking .
" You 'd expect that somebody who suffered from autism would be more likely to spot the cigarette trick , " agrees Kuhn .
The next step is to look at the brain directly .
Working with psychologists Tim Hodson and Ben Parris at Exeter University 's Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience , Kuhn plans to put people in functional magnetic resonance imaging machines to study which parts of the brain activate when they watch magic tricks .
" We 're very interested in the part of the brain that detects cause and effect relations , " says Parris .
In particular , the experiments will monitor the dorsal lateral pre-frontal cortex , which is known to be the bit of the brain that registers surprise , and the anterior cingulate , which is activated whenever something incongruous happens in our immediate environment .
Of course , magic is more than just surprise , so the researchers will be looking for something more .
" When you 're watching magic , there is just a split second when you 're in disbelief and that 's what we 're looking for , that exact moment , " he says .
" The magic spot . "
" No one 's done this and it 's unclear whether it 'll be a single part of the brain or a network , " says Parris .
But while psychologists slowly get to grips with the way magicians manage to trick our brains , is there not a risk that the magic will lose its power ?
That it will cease to be amazing ?
Wiseman thinks not .
" What we get is a more informed audience , " he says .
" It 's a little bit like juggling - you appreciate the juggler more once you 've tried to juggle three balls and then you suddenly realise how hard it is to juggle seven . "
The research will have benefits for the practitioners of magic , too .
" What they will realise is that the human mind is a lot more fallible than we magicians expect , " says Kuhn .
" Maybe magicians are too careful in the way they conceal their secrets in front of an audience .
They can probably get away with quite a bit more . "

INTRODUCTION
WELCOME to [ wu : riddles ] !
This is an archive of problems I 've been collecting since the Spring of 2002 .
They come from many places , including word of mouth , college courses , books , and job interviews for hi-tech positions .
Many are even written by members of our own forum community .
These carefully chosen puzzles will demand you to think in creative ways you perhaps normally would not .
In fact , some will seem outright impossible at first ... but once you crack them , the epiphany can be truly rapturous !
If you are a first - timer , here are some problems I recommend you start out with :
The riddles are organized by difficulty as judged by myself : easy , medium , and hard .
Then there is the microsoft section , consisting of weird , open - ended consulting - style questions .
The cs and putnam sections contain problems which may require a particularly specialized background in computer science and mathematics , respectively .
Later , I will add sections for " What Am I " and " What Happened " riddles .
Hints are available for some riddles .
To see a hint , highlight the area near the word " Hint : " with your mouse .
This mouse - highlighting convention is used in both the forums and this cover site .
If you need solutions or more hints , please post to the FORUM !
Almost all puzzles are solved in great detail there .
Also , if you want to contribute a new puzzle , please post to the FORUM as well .
We have a daily healthy discussion of new problems , and every once in a while I will export some of those problems to the cover site .
The forum is a little slow , and I apologize for this , but please be patient .
Alternatively , you can send me an e-mail directly .
( Remove the " NO_SPAM_ " prefix . )
However , my response time may be very slow , as I 'm often busy these days ; the forum is definitely preferred .
My favorite kind of puzzle satisfies the following criteria : 1 ) It seems impossible , 2 ) Most people can understand it , and 3 ) It does not require specialized knowledge to solve .
When I started collecting , I tried hard to find problems that satisfied these things .
However , as the site has grown over the years , it has become apparent that for many of the harder problems , you wo n't have a chance without knowing some post - high - school mathematics .
Basic probability and combinatorics are particularly common .
If you lack this background , please do not be discouraged .
Our friendly and active forum community can help you get up to speed .
My sincere hope is that you will leave with a greater appreciation of the power of math .
Many thanks to all the cool people who have sent me new material .
Also , I express much gratitude to towr and Icarus for their extensive work in generously maintaining the forums .
I also thank David Lau , Eric Yeh , and James Fingas for contributing an exceptional number of problems when the site was getting started .
Let 's make this the definitive riddle archive .
Finally , I would like to again plug the forum , which i invite you to browse and perhaps even join .
You will be very hard - pressed to find another problem - solving community of comparable quality .
It is the neatest thing on this site , a giant board of discussions for thousands of puzzles .
A LaTeXish syntax is also provided to support writing of mathematical notation .
New problems arise almost every hour , and we have members all over the globe , at all ages , from professions ranging from graphic designers to engineering professors .
Having the privilege of building such a community is one of the nicest things I 've ever taken part of .
Whatever your reasons for being here -- whether you are a life - long mathemagician , or a desperate kid googling for tricky homework solutions -- I hope you will stick with this site regularly , and come to appreciate the joys of problem solving .

Of course , part of the reason Americans think everyone should go to college is for its noneducational uses .
Anyone can benefit from them .
Colleges are the country ’s most effective marriage brokers .
They are also — assuming you do n’t study too hard — a means of redistributing four years ’ worth of leisure time from the sad stub - end of life to the prime of it .
( Just as youth should n’t be wasted on the young , retirement should n’t be wasted on the old . )

But the price of college long ago outstripped the value of these goods .
The most trustworthy indicator that an American college education is something worthwhile is that parents nationwide — and even worldwide — are eager to pay up to $ 180,000 to get one for their children .
This is a new development .
A quarter - century ago , even the top Ivy League schools were a bargain at $ 10,000 a year , but they received fewer applications than they do now .
Presumably , college is steadily more expensive because its benefits are steadily more visible .
In 1979 , according to the economists Frank Levy and Richard Murnane , a 30 - year - old college graduate earned 17 percent more than a 30 - year - old high - school grad .
Now the gap is over 50 percent .
These numbers do n’t tell us much about how people get educated at a typical American college offers .
You can go to college to get civilized ( in the sense that your thoughts about your triumphs and losses at the age of 55 will be colored and deepened by an encounter with Horace or Yeats at the age of 19 ) .
Or you can go there to get qualified ( in the sense that Salomon Brothers will snap you up , once it sees your B.A. in economics from M.I.T. ) .
Most often , parents must think they are paying for the latter product .
Great though Yeats may be , 40 - some - odd thousand seems a steep price to pay for his acquaintance .
The timeless questions that college provokes — like “ What the hell are you going to do with a degree in English ? ” — must get shouted across dinner tables with increasing vehemence as college costs rise inexorably .
But the education kids are rewarded for may not be the same education their parents think they are paying for .
Economists would say that a college degree is partly a “ signaling ” device — it shows not that its holder has learned something but rather that he is the kind of person who could learn something .
Colleges sort as much as they teach .
Even when they do n’t increase a worker ’s productivity , they help employers find the most productive workers , and a generic kind of productivity can be demonstrated as effectively in medieval - history as in accounting classes .
Moreover , if you ’re not planning on becoming , say , a doctor , the benefits of diligent study can be overstated .
In recent decades , the biggest rewards have gone to those whose intelligence is deployable in new directions on short notice , not to those who are locked into a single marketable skill , however thoroughly learned and accredited .
Most of the employees who built up , say , Google in its early stages could never have been trained to do so , because neither the company nor the idea of it existed when they were getting their educations .
Under such circumstances , it ’s best not to specialize too much .
Something like the old ideal of a “ liberal education ” has had a funny kind of resurgence , minus the steeping in Western culture .
It is hard to tell whether this success vindicates liberal education ’s defenders ( who say it “ teaches you how to think ” ) or its detractors ( who say it camouflages a social elite as a meritocratic one ) .

" Every war is a failure .
It does n't matter if you win or lose - you 've still lost your best soldiers and innocent people have died on both sides .
" It 's too soon to tell if Israel achieved its war aims .
However I 'm very happy UN soldiers are going to get involved - now there 's going to be someone neutral to do the job and keep both sides apart . "
Wired 's coverage of the DC area Schmoo Con security / hacker convention includes an article on a project that attempts to use a LiveCD to provide convenient and secure anonymous Internet access for everyday users .
The Anonym.OS v1.0 release , put together by kaos .
theory security research , is a bootable CD - ROM ( a LiveCD ) that runs OpenBSD 3.8 and contains a number of tools and configuration options that are aimed at preventing anyone on the other end of a network connection from identifying the anonymized user and / or tracking his or her activities .
The idea behind Anonym .OS is that the stereotypical " grandma " can pop in the Anonym .
OS LiveCD , find an open access point , and do whatever she likes with her Internet connection — visit online shrines to St. Juarez , download pirated knitting patterns and free recipes , meet single grandpas , etc. — in the comfort of complete and untraceable anonymity .
In addition to the grandmothers of the world , who for whatever reason have become emblematic of all that is naive and techno - clueless , the target audience for Anonym .
OS also includes the stereotypical Chinese political dissident who wants to bypass the Great Firewall and post things that the government does n't like .
Anonym .OS does a number of tricks , like spoofing and altering TCP / IP traffic , so that it appears to an outsider like a Windows XP SP1 machine .
The OpenBSD build on the LiveCD is also totally locked down and patched , making it secure from active intrusion .
The available software is individually tweaked for maximum anonymity , so that Mozilla , for instance , does n't give you away with some automatic feature like auto update .
( For more on how the build is locked down , see this PDF presentation .
I 'm personally interested in LiveCD projects like this because of my own experience with using them for disaster relief work , which is why I was motivated to write up this project .
This being the case , some of the constructive criticisms of the project reported in the Wired article resonated with me quite a bit .
Specifically , there was some skepticism about the project 's " one size fits all " approach , where there 's a single build that 's supposed to be used by the entire target audience .
I myself am a big advocate of giving people multiple types of tools and letting them decide what best fits their particular needs .
So I 'd encourage the project to consider offering a variety of builds for different types of users .
There should be a spectrum of options that represent different tradeoffs between functionality and usability / idiot - proofness .
Ultimately , I think it 's best to start with full functionality and then lock down the build in response to actual user feedback , rather than work in the other direction .
The other thing I 'd note is that performance matters .
Given the choice between something insecure / unstable / complex and something that 's rock - solid and simple but runs like a dog , almost everyone — especially the stereotypical grandmother — is going to pick the product that they can actually use without pulling their hair out .
Finally , on a more general note , custom technological solutions to social problems rarely , if ever , have the intended impact .
This is true of Freenet , and I think it 's going to be true of things like the MIT US $ 100 laptop and Anonym.OS .
After all , the old saying about giving someone a fish vs. teaching them to fish is really a saying about technology transfer .
The best thing that hackers and security researchers can do for Chinese dissidents is to empower them to produce their own secure and anonymous software and OS builds .
In this respect , the part of a project like Anonym .
OS with the most potential for good is the documentation .
Thorough , multilingual documentation of the hows and whys of putting together a secure , anonymizing LiveCD build are likely to have a much bigger impact than any one ISO could ever hope to have .
Having recently come across a method for automatic differentiation on sigfpe ’s cornucopia of amazingly cool stuff masquerading as a blog , I decided to start playing around with it a little to see what might come out .
So , let ’s say we take the standard definition of the derivative ,
,
look at it for a bit , and decide that we do n’t like the limit symbol , and that , in fact , we ’re going to drop it entirely .
After rearranging , we would then obtain the weird - looking f( x ) + d f'( x ) = f( x+d ) , and , presumably , set out to find what d could possibly look like .
To this end , we might expand f( x+d ) about x , which yields
and , after subtracting f( x ) + d f'(x ) from both sides , degenerates into
It appears that d^n should be zero for all n> 1 .
To see this , we can plug in f( x ) = e^x .
The coefficients of d^n become constants , and , dividing both sides by e^x , we obtain d^2/2 ! + d^3/3 ! + … = 0 , which is the MacLaurin series for e^d with the first two terms missing , so e^d=d +1 .
Ignoring , momentarily , the troublesome fact that this gives d=0 in the reals , we certainly at least have d^2=0 ( pardon the handwaving ) .
But in order for f( x ) + d f'( x ) = f( x+d ) to be a remotely interesting statement , we must also have d != 0 , and we want d to be unique .
Given some structure whose objects we ’d care to differentiate , we ’re going to cheat a little , and extend it with the element d such that d != 0 , but d^2 = 0 .
Having allowed such a number , all the weirdness disappears , the equality f( x+d ) = f( x ) + d f'( x ) holds , and we ’re left with a sort of infinitesimal constant which we ’re free to plug into random things .
To test whether this makes any sense , we might start by taking the quadratic Q( x ) = c_2 x ^2 + c_1 x + c_0 , and computing Q( x+d ) :
The derivative of Q( x ) “ fell out ” into the coefficient of d .
How about e^{x+d} ?
Anything else ?
Let ’s see .
By the binomial theorem ,
.
The d^{n - k} factor vanishes whenever n >= k+2 , so
and we ’ve just obtained the power law .
Trigonometric functions :
Using the power law experiment from earlier , we get
Plotting coefficients of d along the vertical axis , and the reals along the horizontal , we get the unit circle , while exponential maps are lines through the origin , which is kind of cool in and out of itself .
Ratios :
One useful thing here is that d is small enough to be in any radius of convergence , so we get logarithms “ for free ” :
So , what ’s the point ?
The point is that we automatically obtain the derivative as a side effect of any computation , since f( x+d ) = f( x ) + d f'(x ) .
In other words , by switching to dual numbers ( numbers of the form x+y d ) for things that need to be differentiated ( and making it transparent through operator overloading ) , we can ask for the derivative of any differentiable function we ’ve ever defined , and it ’ll be evaluated symbolically .
To that end , here ’s the first approximation in Haskell .
module Diff where
data Diffable a = !a :+ a
funcPart :: Diffable a -> a
funcPart ( x :+ x ’ ) = x
diffPart :: Diffable a -> a
diffPart ( x :+ x ’ ) = x ’
instance ( RealFloat a ) => Eq ( Diffable a ) where
( x :+ x ’ ) == ( y :+ y’) = ( x == y ) && ( x ’ == y ’ )
instance ( RealFloat a ) =>
Show ( Diffable a ) where
show ( x :+ x ’ ) = show ( x , x ’ )
instance ( RealFloat a ) => Num ( Diffable a ) where

( x :+ x ’ ) * ( y :+ y’) = ( x * y ) :+ ( x ’ * y + y ’ * x )
abs ( x :+ x ’ ) = if x < 0 then ( ( - x ) :+ ( - x ’ ) ) else ( x :+ x ’ )
signum ( x :+ x ’ ) = ( signum x ) :+ 0

instance ( RealFloat a ) => Floating ( Diffable a ) where
pi = pi :+ 0
exp ( x :+ x ’ ) = ( exp x ) :+ ( x ’ * exp x )
log ( x :+ x ’ ) = ( log x ) :+ ( x ’ * recip x )
sin ( x :+ x ’ ) = ( sin x ) :+ ( x ’ * cos x )
cos ( x :+ x ’ ) = ( cos x ) :+ ( x ’ * ( negate $ sin x ) )
sinh ( x :+ x ’ ) = ( sinh x ) :+ ( x ’ * cosh x )
cosh ( x :+ x ’ ) = ( cosh x ) :+ ( x ’ * sinh x )
asin ( x :+ x ’ ) = ( asin x ) :+ ( x ’ / ( sqrt $ 1 - x ^ 2 ) )
acos ( x :+ x ’ ) = ( acos x ) :+ ( x ’ / ( negate ( sqrt $ 1 - x ^ 2 ) ) )
atan ( x :+ x ’ ) = ( atan x ) :+ ( x ’ / ( x ^ 2+1 ) )
asinh ( x :+ x ’ ) = ( asinh x ) :+ ( x ’ / ( sqrt $ x ^2+1 ) )
acosh ( x :+ x ’ ) = ( acosh x ) :+ ( x ’ / ( negate ( sqrt $ x ^ 2 - 1 ) ) )
atanh ( x :+ x ’ ) = ( atanh x ) :+ ( x ’ / ( 1 – x ^ 2 ) )
And now let ’s try a sample GHCI session :
Derivatives of x^2 for x in {0 , 0.5 , … , 5} :
* Diff > map ( diffPart . ( ^2 ) . fromRational ) [ 0,0.5..5 ]
[ 0.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,10.0 ]
Derivatives of cos^2 x + sin^2 x ( should be identically zero ) :
* Diff > map ( diffPart . ( \x -> ( cos x ) ^2 + ( sin x ) ^ 2 ) . fromRational ) [ 0..10 ]
[ 0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0 ]
So there we go , AD in half a page of code .

Mr Scalia reportedly finds reaction in Europe to the camp " hypocritical "
Newsweek magazine said it had heard a tape of a recent talk given by Antonin Scalia in which he made these comments .
The report comes as the court prepares to hear a challenge by a Guantanamo detainee against US military tribunals .
The case is considered an important test of the Bush administration 's handling of its war on terror .
Lawyers for Salim Ahmed Hamdan - Osama Bin Laden 's former driver - will argue that President George W Bush does not have the constitutional right to order these military trials .
The US government has urged the Supreme Court to dismiss the case .
' Hypocritical '
In a speech to Swiss law students at the University of Freiburg on 8 March , Justice Scalia dismissed the idea that detainees had rights under the US constitution or international conventions , Newsweek reported .
" Give me a break . "
Asked whether Guantanamo detainees have any rights under international conventions , Justice Scalia reportedly answered :
" If he was captured by my army on a battlefield , that is where he belongs .
" I had a son ( Matthew Scalia ) on that battlefield and they were shooting at my son and I 'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial .
I mean it 's crazy . "
Mr Scalia is also quoted as saying he was " astounded " at the " hypocritical " reaction in Europe to Guantanamo .
Legal experts quoted by Newsweek said Mr Scalia 's comments could compromise his position in the Hamdan case , even though he did not refer directly to it .
Eight judges are expected to start hearings in the Hamdan case on Tuesday .
Chief Justice John Roberts has decided not to take part in the hearings because he ruled on the case while he was an appeals court judge .
About 14 out of the estimated 490 Guantanamo detainees have been deemed eligible for hearings under the commissions .
WASHINGTON , Feb. 8 — A Pentagon investigation into the handling of prewar intelligence has criticized civilian Pentagon officials for conducting their own intelligence analysis to find links between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda , but said the officials did not violate any laws or mislead Congress , according to Congressional officials who have read the report .
The long - awaited report by the Pentagon ’s acting inspector general , Thomas F. Gimble , was sent to Congress on Thursday .
It is the first major review to rebuke senior officials working for Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld for the way intelligence was used before the invasion of Iraq early in 2003 .
Working under Douglas J. Feith , who at the time was under secretary of defense for policy , the group “ developed , produced and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and Al Qaeda relationship , which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community , to senior decision - makers , ” the report concluded .
Excerpts were quoted by Senator Carl Levin , a Michigan Democrat who has long been critical of Mr. Feith and other Pentagon officials .
The report , and the dueling over its conclusions , shows that bitter divisions over the handling of prewar intelligence remain even after many of the substantive questions have been laid to rest and the principal actors have left the government .
The first Mac I saw may have been one of the first in Britain , for it was at the house of my colleague WD Hamilton , shortly after he arrived from Michigan in 1984 , and he may well have shipped it over .
Bill showed it to his dinner guests one evening , and it stunned us .
I immediately echoed Huxley 's remark on closing The Origin of Species : " How extremely stupid not to have thought of that . "
Nothing in my 20 years ' intensive experience of programming and using computers had prepared me for the Mac .
It was n't an evolutionary advance on its predecessors ; it was a macromutational leap into the future .
It is that future we are now living in , whether we use a Mac or a virus - compatible PC .
I later learned that the ingredients had been the subject of massive research and development at Xerox PARC .
But Xerox never developed it commercially , and it did n't become widely known before the Mac .
The whole dinner party wanted one .
Frustratingly for me , I had just acquired an earnestly competent but ploddingly conventional IBM - compatible , and this made it hard for me to justify buying a Mac .
My colleagues had no such difficulty , and I found myself forsaking my IBM - compatible and borrowing a Mac whenever the owner was n't looking .
Suddenly , I realised this was ridiculous .
With a feeling of joyous release , I donated the IBM - compatible to some good cause and bought a Mac .
I 've never looked back .
The key to the early Mac , and the thing that gave it its unique " look and feel " ( later the subject of law suits ) was its ROM Toolbox .
A large toolbox of software routines was burned into the hardware of every Mac , to handle mouse movements and clicks , pulling down menus , resizing windows , scrolling up and down , setting up check boxes , " radio " buttons and action buttons , indeed everything that made Mac programs so unique in the early days and which we now take for granted .
Theoretically , third party developers could have ignored the Toolbox .
After all , there was nothing like it in the other computers to which they were accustomed , which is why software for other computers was so variable and so hard to learn .
But since the Toolbox was sitting in the Mac , and since it was so elegantly conceived and worked so well , it would have been insanely wasteful not to use it .
So Apple , by burning in this library of user - friendly routines , managed to make all Mac software , whether written by themselves or by others , look and feel the same .
It was this , together with Apple 's well - written guidelines for how to design user - friendly programs , that spawned the legendary belief - which was very nearly true - that Mac users never needed to open a manual .
A ll they had to do was ask themselves , what would be the neat , the elegant , the intuitively obvious Mac way of doing this ?
( In modern computers the Toolbox is no longer mostly in ROM , but the principle , once established , remains ) .
Before the Mac revolution , if you wanted to read a particular data file , you normally could n't scroll your way through a list of candidates until you spotted it .
You had to remember its name and type it in .
Similarly , instead of scooting your mouse along the menu bar seeking a likely command , you 'd most probably have to look the command up in the manual and literally type it in .
Or , at best , you had to burrow your way deep into a complicated system of nested menus within menus within menus , getting hopelessly lost when you tried to back out again .
Nesting of this kind was one of the cardinal sins discouraged by Apple 's guidelines for programmers .
Above all , the Mac allowed its human users to do that most intuitively human of actions : point with the hand at a target , and physically move it where you want it .
Today , the Windows imitation has finally caught up , and you no longer have to be bonkers to prefer it .
Ubiquity itself is a virtue , promising a richer supply of software , especially games and frivolous programs ( ironic given that originally it was the Mac that had the hip Californian image , compared with IBM 's crew cut and business suit ) .
Unfortunately , for exactly the same reason ( and arguably other reasons too ) ubiquity also appeals to the spiteful or deranged authors of viruses .
In 2003 , it was estimated that viruses are more than 600 times more likely to attack a Windows PC than a Mac .
But the virus menace is not the only reason for continuing to prefer the Mac .
They are notoriously easier to set up .
Having gone over to the Unix - based System X , today 's Macs almost never crash .
Even if one application does , you can always escape from it and find everything else running on , serenely unperturbed .
The Unix base , too , gives Macs its own potential ubiquity .
Finally , and more elusively , there is the matter of style .
Hard to define but , as Louis Armstrong said : " Man , if you gotta ask , you 'll never know . "

In this interview , Pete Lacey , who recently became well - known in the SOA community because of a series of blog posts starting with a very funny one entitled S stands for Simple ( which was covered at InfoQ as well ) , talks to InfoQ's Stefan Tilkov about the problems he sees with Web services , including basic technologies such as SOAP , WSDL and UDDI , as well as advanced standards from the WS -* family .
InfoQ : Your blog post " S stands for Simple " has been linked to by literally every blogger in the SOA / WS community .
Can you give us a little background on yourself ?
How much of what one can read in that post is based on personal opinion , in other words : have you been " SOAP guy " in the past ?
Pete Lacey ( PL ) : Yes , I have been SOAP Guy in the past , and am in fact SOA ( note , no ‘ P ’ )
Guy now .
I was introduced to web services late , when I started working for Systinet back in August 2002 .
I started there as an SE , but given its startup nature , the job was really all things technical and outward facing ; that is , sales , marketing , and consulting .
In the beginning the work was pretty low - level , down in the dirt with SOAP , WSDL , and UDDI .
In that sense , I was SOAP Guy .
Interestingly , my customers never played the role of the disenchanted developer , they never pushed back on the complexity of SOAP / WSDL or the abuse of HTTP or anything that tends to rile certain people ’s feathers .
Though they did gnash their teeth at the interop issues .

Today I work as a consultant for Burton Group in the Application Platform Strategies service .
Though SOA is not all we do , it is one of the things we ’re famous for , so I spend a lot of my time explaining to people what SOA is and how they might go about managing a SOA initiative .
It may sound hypocritical , since I ’m not a SOA proponent , to turn around and tell my customers how to go about it .
But by the time I ’m involved the SOA decision has often been made , and Burton Group does have a more sober perspective on the technology than most vendors do .
InfoQ : Can you briefly explain your position about SOAP and the WS -* specifications ?
PL : Taking the SOAP 1.1 specification in isolation , my position on it is that it went too far .
Had SOAP simply defined an envelope for XML message passing it would have been a small but interesting step forward .
But the SOAP spec also defines an — admittedly optional — serialization mechanism ; goes out of its way to be transport neutral , but then defines an HTTP binding that ignores the basic tenets of HTTP ; and goes on to define a practice for using SOAP as an RPC mechanism .
However , if one ignores the optional bits , SOAP itself is n’t that bad .
The envelope design pattern can be useful — HTML uses it after all .
In contrast , I have nothing good to say about the WSDL 1.1 specification ( I ’m sticking with the 1.1 specs as those are still the WS - I recommended versions ) .
It is overly complex , often ambiguous , and occasionally inconsistent .
In practice , tool - generated WSDL documents are nightmarish to read and the source of half of all interoperability issues ( and I ’m not referring to any XML Schema components ) .
It ’s also my position that WSDL is being used as a crutch by web service vendors and developers , even though the functionality it provides should be wholly unnecessary .
InfoQ : Can you elaborate ?
Is n’t the “ contract ” described in WSDL the most important aspect of a service ?
Why do you deem this unnecessary ?
PL : Well , I would say that the most important aspect of a service is the service itself .
Also , today ’s tools encourage — and some mandate — developing the service first and then generating the WSDL , and thus the WSDL is n’t a contract at all .
But I understand the question , so here goes .
SOAP enthusiasts are aghast at the claim that WSDL is unnecessary , but it ’s true .
They claim that the server is n’t returning HTML for humans to read and interpret , it ’s returning XML for machine to machine processing , and how can this work if the client machine does n’t know what the server is sending .
But I claim the client does n’t “ know ” anything .
It does n’t know that the message is an invoice , only people know what an invoice is .
It does n’t know that the FirstName element is n’t likely to have the value “ Tea Kettle ” ( barring very strange parents ) .
All we can say it “ knows ” is the structure of the document and what datatypes the elements and attributes can hold .
But , WSDL proponents go on to say , what about code generation and data serialization ?
A crutch , I say , and not a very beneficial one .
I ’ve never cared for wizard driven development and code generators .
They tend to demo well , but ultimately do n’t produce maintainable code .
Furthermore , this style of SOAP development reinforces the SOAP as RPC / distributed - component / serialized - object perspective and relegates XML to just another serialization framework .
The generated code tends to be especially brittle , and breaks when the message returned changes in any way .
For instance , if your client was happily consuming a message that looks like this :
< Movie >
< Title > Star Wars </ Title >
< ReleaseDate > 1977</ReleaseDate >
</ Movie >
Why should it choke if the message changes to this :
< Movie >
< Title > Star Wars </ Title >
< ReleaseDate > 1977</ReleaseDate >
< Runtime > 121</Runtime >
</ Movie >
For similar reasons , the fact that SOAP messages are strongly typed also introduces a great deal of tight coupling between endpoints and inhibits the independent evolution of services and clients .
Serialization also exposes the impedance mismatch between XSD and your programming language of choice ( and what about dynamically typed languages ? ) and is the source of the other half of all interoperability problems .
Finally , serialization techniques preclude the use of powerful , XML - centric tools like XPath and XSLT .
You would be much better off processing a message manually and ignoring any notion of typed data .
Proponents also say that WSDL and XML Schema are useful for message validation , but if an XSD validator is even in the message path , no one turns it on , because it ’s too computationally expensive , not completely implemented , and unable to perform all the validation required ( e.g. , date X should be no more than 30 days divergent from date Y ) .
All of this is not to say that a rigorous , machine - readable description of an XML message is n’t useful at development time and even runtime , it is .
But the notion of assigning type to elements and attributes is unnecessary .
After all , how many HTML forms have been processed successfully , and those are submitted as just name / value pairs .
And even when a message description is available , using it to generate code that treats remote resources as local objects and messages as their serialization is counterproductive .
XML is for representing structured information not serializing objects .
Ultimately , WSDL proponents will say , we simply need it ; CORBA has IDL , RMI has Java interfaces , surely we need something .
Well , no you do n’t .
Think about coding to a local API in a language like C/C++ that does n’t allow for introspection .
How do you make that work ?
You read the documentation !
And this is true for ordinary Java development and web service development too .
Real live human programmers are involved ; reading the documentation , crafting messages as specified , and interpreting them as needed .
It ’s not like a programmer uses the first method that her IDE suggests , and simply drops properly typed nonsense into the argument list .
There ’s no doubt that having a machine readable description of a service can make your IDE do interesting tricks , but that ’s a far cry from absolutely essential .
A final argument for not needing WSDL requires that we abandon the SOAP model of development in favor of REST styled development .
We ’ve already dispensed with the desire for message description , with REST we can also dispense with the portType , because all of the operations are well known .
Similarly we do n’t need the binding section anymore ; the transport is always HTTP and messages are described by the Content - Type header .
The service element is unneeded too , because the URL of a resource should be relatively static and well known , and if it changes you ’ll get a redirect .
To dwell a bit more on XML Schema , I have to say that it is a deeply flawed specification .
Not only is it notoriously complex and inconsistently implemented , it is fundamentally incapable of representing textual XML documents , as opposed to XML documents representing typed data .
And even for representing data it leaves much to be desired .
Burton Group is soon to publish a best practices document I wrote for creating interoperable , data - oriented schemas , but I can summarize it here : do n’t use anonymous types , do n’t use element groups , do n’t use attribute groups , do n’t use redefine , do n’t use “ any ” elements , do n’t use anyAttribute , do n’t use anyType , do n’t use lists , do n’t use unions , do n’t use substitution groups , and so on .
So , not only is the ability to create typed instance documents of dubious value , XML Schema is n’t particularly good at doing it .
If you want to use a schema language , use RelaxNG or Schematron instead .
InfoQ : What do you think of the XML Schema Patterns for Databinding spec ?
Does this address the same concerns as your report ?
PL : Not really .
I think the Patterns for Databinding is a noble effort and it takes an interesting approach .
And down the road it may even help vendors converge on a usable subset of XML Schema .
My document , though , is aimed at the user of today ’s XSD - aware tooling .
It goes much further than warning you away from the poorly supported aspects of XSD , but talks about namespace usage , versioning , RDDL , and much more .
But even if the Patterns for Databinding effort ultimately results in XSD documents being 100 % interoperable , you must remember that the problem — for web services , anyway — is n’t the inconsistent implementations of XML Schema , but the use of XML Schema at all .
InfoQ :
What ’s your opinion on UDDI , the third of the core web service specs ?
PL : I find it grossly over - engineered , what with tModels and bindingTemplates and categoryBags .
Succinctly , anything that requires a design pattern to achieve the predominate use case for which it ’s deployed has failed .
By that I ’m referring to the best practice surrounding mapping a WSDL into UDDI .
It ’s the single most obvious task to which UDDI can be put , but UDDI ca n’t do it natively or easily .
Even the relative success that Systinet ( now HP ) is enjoying with its registry is largely due to hiding as much of UDDI as possible .
InfoQ :
And the rest of the WS stack : WS - Addressing , WS - Security , etc . ?
PL : I wo n’t address all of the WS -* specs individually , and individually they are not all that bad .
Collectively , though , wow !
I mean , WOW !
The complexity of the web service framework ( WSF ) is mind numbing .
The odds that even a small portion of it can be made to work in an interoperable fashion across multiple vendors is very slim .
( Two very large software vendors recently told me that while they will eventually interoperate with the forthcoming Microsoft implementation of a number of the WSF specs , it will not be by coding to the standard , but to the Microsoft - specific implementation . )
And the claim that your tooling will shield you from the underlying complexity is laughable ; the complexity will leak through .
This is not to mention the ( now dwindling ) vendor wars , the ungodly amount of time its taking to move these specifications forward , the dearth of implementations , and the “ SOA fatigue ” experienced by enterprises as they try and make a go of it .
To try and put a positive spin on the WSF , one can look on it as the XML - ification of a number of existing technologies .
For instance :
Standard / Spec maps to WS - Security SSL ( partly ) WS - SecureConversation SSL ( the rest ) WS - Trust Kerberos WS - Addressing URLs WS - ReliableMessaging MOM WS - Addressing URLs WS - Eventing / Notification More MOM WS - Policy Configuration files WS - Transaction XA WS - Transfer HTTP WSRP Portlets WS - Management / WSDM SNMP
Now , of course , that mapping is not exact , but it ’s interesting .
If , in the past , someone had said , “ I ’m tired of having proprietary implementations of message - oriented middleware . ”
Or if they had said , “ you know , using XML instead of opaque , binary protocols opens up some interesting possibilities , ” then we would , quite possibly , have been on to something .
I do n’t think it would look like WS - Anything , since the WSF composes different messaging styles in the SOAP Header , rather than in a layer underneath the message .
Nor would a single system try to be all things to all people .
In this model , XML - based protocols would be as distinct as their current binary counterparts .
Mind you , I ’m not advocating such systems , only that I find the idea interesting .
But , as Mark Pilgrim said , “ Lots of luck with that . ”
It 's important to understand that my imaginary infrastructure and the current web service framework , suffer from the same problem : they ca n’t scale .
And by that I do n’t mean transactional scaling , e.g. , how many messages can it process , but rather , to use Dan Pritchett ’s terms , I mean operational scalability , deployability , developer productivity , and time to market .
So , while web services and the components of the WSF can and have been made to work , these successes ( in my experience ) are narrowly scoped deployments with tightly bound endpoints that took an inordinate amount of time to develop while promising little in the way of interoperability and raising the barrier to entry way too high .
InfoQ : If I understand you correctly , you ’re referring to scaling to Internet dimensions .
But not everybody needs that , do they ?
PL : It ’s true that the WSF prohibits scaling to this level , but , no , that ’s not what I ’m talking about .
Again , when I say “ scaling ” I ’m referring to things like developer productivity ; system management , maintenance , and evolvability ; access to data and resources , etc .
As I see it the WSF is so large and complex , and the participants so tightly coupled , that scaling to even enterprise levels is out of the question .
I firmly believe that one can be every bit as successful today with web services as they have been in the past with CORBA .
That is , you will be able to build working systems with some distributed components ( although not without undue hardship ) .
But you will not be able to use this technology to build a fully distributed enterprise architecture .
InfoQ :
Do you think the philosophies of the different " camps " - SOAP / WS -* folks on one side , REST folks on the other - can be aligned somehow ?
PL : No , but that ’s okay .
From a technology point of view SOAP and REST could n’t be farther away from each other .
In fact , the only relationship I can see between the two is that REST is embodied in HTTP and SOAP frequently tunnels over it .
I might add that SOAP supports XML message passing ( in principle ) and REST can pass XML messages too , but as someone said recently ( I ca n’t remember who ) , message passing is intrinsically uninteresting .
But if the question was “ can the SOA and — what I guess we ’re now calling — ROA camps be aligned ? ” that would be a more interesting question .
The answer is still no , but it ’s a more nuanced no .
The SOA camp claims that one can achieve enterprise ( and some claim global ) scalability using the WSF .
I think this fails for two reasons : one is simply the complexity of the framework as already discussed .
It has proven hard enough to get SOAP and WSDL based services to work and interoperate .
It ’s only going to get harder as the other pieces of the WSF come into play .
Introduce any number of intermediaries into this mix , and you ’re building on a house of cards .
Also , no one gets to play unless they are a proficient , web service aware developer .
InfoQ : Tool vendors would disagree and point to their IDEs , which are claimed to make Web service development ridiculously easy .
PL : I think we ’ve already covered how effective this development tooling actually is , but even accepting it for what it is , you ’re still limited to just developers .
Given that the value of web services is in the consumption , why are n’t they consumable by anyone ?
Why are n’t services made available to the sales guy with Excel , or the proto - geek in finance with a report writer , or the manager with a news aggregator , or the simply curious with a browser ?
Because SOAP , WSDL , and the WSF are way beyond any but the technically elite ; the barrier to entry is too high .
In contrast , anyone can retrieve the contents of a URL .
InfoQ : Let ’s get back to the second reason for the alignment problem .
PL : The second reason is that web services are too tightly coupled .
Each participant needs to know a great deal about each of the others : the service and operation names , the messages they exchange , the datatypes of the message elements , the security context , the messaging semantics , etc .
Thusly are non-scalable ( and again I do n’t mean transactional scalability ) systems designed .
One could argue that WSDL and the WS - Policy family of specifications addresses all this , but that ’s not what I mean .
Whether the tool knows or the programmer knows , the point is that one side of the conversation possesses intimate knowledge of the other , and should either side change , everything breaks .
This is not to dismiss SOA altogether , just to take it down a peg .
I do n’t believe it can scale and it ’s not a silver bullet , but , as I ’ve said , it can be made to work if you introduce enough constraints .
And such a system is likely to offer functionality that exceeds what can be had using traditional technologies .
For instance , if reliable messaging is an absolute requirement of your design , and there are multiple actors , and you ’re only exchanging XML messages , then using SOAP + WSA +WSRM , instead of , say , TIBCO Rendezvous , makes sense ( once WSRM is finalized and enough interoperable implementations exist — see what I mean ) , as it allows for the introduction of generic intermediaries that can process and manipulate the messages in transit .
Also , much of what is SOA is not technology focused .
SOA proponents have a lot to say about process and governance , and much of that is transferable to any team building distributed architectures .
Furthermore , REST / ROA is not all encompassing ( and to the best of my knowledge , no one claims it is ) .
There are a number of legitimate enterprise use cases where REST styled systems do n’t play , but these are fewer than one would imagine .
It all boils down to choosing the best tool for the job .
InfoQ :
What would be your advice to someone looking to implement an SOA today ?

New Scientist has an article about how making complex decisions by relying on the unconscious mind results in more satisfaction …
This is interesting because it relates to some research regarding the effects of emotion on decision - making .
People tend to rely more on their affective / emotional responses to make decisions when the amount of information they possess is low .
People who are more knowledgeable on a topic tend to rely more on the information they possess to make decisions .
However , this description of behaviour does not specify how satisfied people are with the decisions they make .
The article in New Scientist specifically addresses the satisfaction people receive from their choices .
According to the article , when it comes to purchase decisions , simpler decisions are best made with more conscious deliberation while large , complex decisions are better made unconsciously .
This relates to the Paradox of Choice , by Barry Schwartz .
In Schwartz ’s view , “ unlimited choice ” can “ produce genuine suffering . ” , as we are never quite sure if we ’ve made the best decision .
A quote :
“ We assume that more choice means better options and greater satisfaction .
But beware of excessive choice : choice overload can make you question the decisions you make before you even make them , it can set you up for unrealistically high expectations , and it can make you blame yourself for any and all failures .
In the long run , this can lead to decision - making paralysis .
And in a culture that tells us that there is no excuse for falling short of perfection when your options are limitless , too much choice can lead to clinical depression . ”
Such a plethora of choices leads to demands on our attention that we can’t possibly meet .
You could literally spend weeks deciding which shampoo is the best , and still not be genuinely satisfied with your choice .
I ’ll take satisficing anyday .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The biggest problem with job growth right now is n't too few new jobs .
It 's too few skilled workers .
The Labor Department 's December employment report Friday showed stronger than expected job and wage growth , with a net gain of 167,000 jobs in the month , and average hourly wages up 4.2 percent from a year ago .
But even in this report , the pace of job gains was showing signs of slowing down .
Special Report full coverage QUIZ
Will you be promoted soon ?
1 . Is your company doing well ?
Is it posting good financial results , drumming up new business , hiring and promoting others ?
Yes
No
This 7 - question quiz will help you read the signs .
YesNo
The fourth quarter gain was below the third quarter and 2006 saw 143,000 fewer jobs added to payrolls than in 2005 , or almost a month 's worth of hiring .
And that 's a comparison to a year in which hurricanes Katrina and Rita took a bite out of jobs .
In addition , one survey earlier in the week from employment service ADP released Wednesday showed U.S. private sector employment shrank in December , the first decline in 3 - 1/ 2 years .
But many economists and labor market experts say that job growth and the economy overall would be significantly stronger if employers could find the skilled workers they really need .
" I 'm hearing across the board , across industries , companies indicating they can't exploit market opportunity because they can't find people with the right skills , " said Jeff Summer , an executive at Deloitte Consulting who leads the firm 's management practice .
He said that there 's virtually no long - term unemployment for skilled workers .
" It 's down to the nub already , " he said .
" Supply and demand is completely out of whack . "
Some experts say part of the blame for the slowdown in the economy in last year 's second half can be laid on labor constraints - companies could n't expand as fast as they wanted due to a lack of workers with the right skills .
Anthony Chan , chief economist for JPMorgan Private Client Services , said employers are constantly citing the inability to find the workers they need as one of their top problems , if not their biggest worry .
Businesses " feel there 's real [ unmet ] demand out there , " he said , adding that " economic growth would be faster " if there was n't this tight supply of workers .
The unemployment rate in December stayed at 4.5 percent .
But the rate for college - educated workers was just 1.9 percent in December , near the rate for that group in 1998 and 1999 , when the economy was white - hot .
The lowest rate for college grads on record was 1.5 percent in three months during 2000 .
Mark Vitner , chief economist for Wachovia , said another sign of the tight labor market is the growing number of job openings being reported by the Labor Department in a separate report , even as hiring posts modest gains .
The most recent report shows 4.2 million job openings in October , up 8.8 percent from a year earlier , while hirings rose just 1.5 percent .
Meanwhile , the number of workers quitting , retiring , getting fired or laid - off grew only 0.6 percent .
" With this level of unemployment , the only way they can find the workers they need is to hire them away from someone else , hire them from someplace else , or hire someone without the necessary skills , " said Vitner .
" All these things cut into productivity growth . "
The latest tally of announced job cuts by outplacement firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas showed a 22 percent drop from 2005 to the lowest in six years , even as the auto industry slashed thousands of hourly workers , mostly due to the problems at General Motors ( Charts ) and Ford Motor ( Charts ) .
Outside the auto industry , most employers are reluctant to cut staff due to the tight supply of workers , said John Challenger , the firm 's CEO .
" Companies are holding onto their people .
They 're focusing on retention programs .
Even if they 're in a little slower period , they worry about being able to find the people they need if they see the business pickup . "
Still , even with the employment numbers showing a tight supply , some of those college - educated job seekers say they 're not seeing the supply - demand equation tip in their favor yet .
Steven Koch said he spent 25 years at IBM ( Charts ) , the last five as a procurement engineer , in charge of buying parts to go into computers .
But after Chinese computer company Lenovo bought the IBM personal computer division , his job was relocated to North Carolina from New York and he decided not to follow .
He 's been without a job since May , despite his masters in computer science .
" I 've applied to about 150 companies within 70 miles of where we live .
The opportunities are not there , " said Koch .
" There were about six of us from Lenovo who decided not to go to North Carolina .
Not one of us has found a job in the field with a comparable salary .
One decided to sell cars . "
Challenger said despite the tight market , his figures show job search times are about the same as they were a couple of years ago , when the number of unemployed college - educated job seekers was almost 50 percent higher than it is today .
Part of that may be because of increased competition from job applicants who already have a job .
A recent survey by the Society for Human Resource Management found three - quarters of those with jobs said they were looking for a job .
But Challenger said employers are being very cautious about adding staff in the current tight market , much more cautious than in the late 1990s .
" Companies are more measured .
They 're looking closely at who they hire , " he said .
Koch said that was his experience as well .
He said several times he 's gone on job interviews and been told he was a strong candidate , only to later be told the company decided not to fill the position .
" One company said , ' Even though you 're the top candidate , you 're not exactly what they were looking for ' , " he said .
He suspects that what many companies are looking for is younger skilled workers with lower salary demands .
But Challenger said the inability to hire , either due to reluctance or a tight labor market , is one factor constraining economic growth .
" When the economy hits some natural barriers , it slows it down , and one of those barriers is when the pool of workers begins to dry up , " he said .
" The lifeblood of the economy today is skilled workers . "
And most experts agreed the shortage of skilled workers is likely to persist longer than it did in the late 1990s .
That earlier tightness was fed by dot.com companies burning through investors ' cash to hire people .
The latest round of hiring is being driven by stronger corporate balance sheets , and as more retiring Baby Boomers start leaving the work force .
Deloitte 's Summer said that the current tightness will be a problem for business at least into the next decade , when demographic trends should start to help .
" We start to see some relief in 2012 , but we 'll probably be dealing with this through 2015 , even 2020 , " he said .
" Companies that are looking at this are saying , ' We have to re-invent what we 're doing here . '
Just paying people more wo n't be the answer .
They really need to be treating the talent market as a customer market more than they ever have before . "

In “ God Bless You , Mr. Rosewater ” ( 1965 ) , Prospero and the boob have merged ; the very prosperous Eliot Rosewater , after exercising the powers of the rich rather inchoately in the isolation of Rosewater County , Indiana , stands to full stature when threatened by a usurper , whom he smites down with a surprising disposition , both regal and cunning , of his fortune .
In “ Slaughterhouse - Five ” ( 1969 ) , Billy Pilgrim , like Winston Rumfoord , communicates with the Tralfamadorians and sees future and past as parts of a single panorama —
” All moments , past , present , and future , always have existed , always will exist . ”
But his prescience is impotent to change the sad course of Earthly events ; planes crash , bombs fall , though he knows they will .
His access to Tralfamadore merely gives him the wonderful accessory bubble of the second life he lives there , more Ferdinand than Prospero , mated with the gorgeous Montana Whitlock in a transparent dome in a Tralfamadorian zoo .
“ Breakfast of Champions ” reveals the author himself as Prospero , “ on a par with the Creator of the Universe , ” sitting in the cocktail lounge of a Holiday Inn wearing mirroring sunglasses , surrounded by characters of his own creation , whom he frees in the end : “ I am going to set at liberty all the literary characters who have served me so loyally , during my writing career . ”
( Nevertheless , “ Slapstick ” revives the obnoxious lawyer Norman Mushari from “ God Bless You , Mr. Rosewater ; ” Vonnegut ’s ongoing puppet show is irrepressibly self - cherishing . )
**{ : .break one} **
Now my charms are all o’erthrown ,
And what strength I have ’s mine own , Which is most faint .
. . **
“ Slapstick ” gives us the Prospero of Shakespeare ’s epilogue , his powers surrendered , his island Manhattan , his Miranda his granddaughter Melody .
Vonnegut dreamed the book , he tells us , while flying to a funeral .
“ It is about desolated cities and spiritual cannibalism and incest and loneliness and lovelessness and death , and so on .
It depicts myself and my beautiful sister as monsters , and so on . ”
It is about what happens after the end of the world .
The end of the world is not an idea to Vonnegut , it is a reality he experienced , in Dresden , as a prisoner of war , during the holocaustal air raid of February 13 , 1945 .
He has described this repeatedly , most directly in the introduction to “ Mother Night ” added in 1966 :
**{ : .break one} **
We did n’t get to see the fire storm .
We were in a cool meat - locker under a slaughterhouse with our six guards and ranks and ranks of dressed cadavers of cattle , pigs , horses , and sheep .
We heard the bombs walking around up there .
Now and then there would be a gentle shower of calcimine .
If we had gone above to take a look , we would have been turned into artifacts characteristic of fire storms : seeming pieces of charred firewood two or three feet long — ridiculously small human beings , or jumbo fried grasshoppers , if you will .
**
Vonnegut ’s come - as - you - are prose always dons a terrible beauty when he pictures vast destruction .
**{ : .break one} ** Eliot , rising from his seat in the bus , beheld the fire storm of Indianapolis .
He was awed by the majesty of the column of fire , which was at least eight miles in diameter and fifty miles high .
The boundaries of the column seemed absolutely sharp and unwavering , as though made of glass .
Within the boundaries , helixes of dull red embers turned in stately harmony about an inner core of white .
The white seemed holy .
**
The end of the world can come by fire , as in the quotation above , from “ God Bless You , Mr. Rosewater , ” or by ice , as in “ Cat ’s Cradle ” :
**{ : .break one} **
There was a sound like that of the gentle closing of a portal as big as the sky , the great door of heaven being closed softly .
It was a grand AH - WHOOM .
I opened my eyes — and all the sea was ice - nine .
The moist green earth was a blue - white pearl . **
The New York of “ Slapstick ” has been destroyed several times over .
Gravity has pulled down its elevators and its bridges , plague has devoured its population .
An ailanthus forest has grown up , and a rooster crowing in Turtle Bay can be heard on West Thirty - fourth Street .
Amid collapse , the fabulous is reborn .
Wilbur Swain ’s nearest neighbor , Vera Chipmunk - 5 Zappa , arrives at his hundred - and - first birthday party encrusted with diamonds , in a sedan chair .
“ She had a collection of precious stones which would have been worth millions of dollars in olden times .
People gave her all the jewels they found , just as they gave me all the candlesticks . ”
Swain has become the King of Candlesticks , the possessor of a thousand .
For a birthday present Vera Zappa gives him a thousand candles she and her slaves have made from a Colonial mold .
They set them about on the floor of the Empire State Building lobby and light them .
Swain ’s last written words are “ Standing among all those tiny , wavering lights , I felt as though I were God , up to my knees in the Milky Way . ”
He dies , happy , but the narrative carries on , relating how Melody arrived in New York , fleeing the seraglio of the King of Michigan , helped along the way by her fellow - Orioles .
**{ : .break one} **
One would give her a raincoat .
. . .
Another would give her a needle and thread , and a gold thimble , too .
Another would row her across the Harlem River to the Island of Death , at the risk of his own life .

The novel ends “ Das Ende , ” reminding us of German fairy tales and of Vonnegut ’s pride in his German ancestry ; in “ Mother Night ” he even dared to be a poet in the German language .
In “ Slapstick ” he transmutes science fiction into something like medieval myth , and suggests the halo of process , of metamorphosis and recycling , that to an extent redeems the destructiveness in human history to which he is so sensitive .
The end of the world is just a Dark Age .
Through a succession of diminishingly potent Properos , the malevolent complexities of “ The Sirens of Titan ” have yielded to a more amiable confusion .
“ Slapstick ” enjoys a first printing of a cool one hundred thousand copies , and Vonnegut ’s popularity , which has grown even as his literary manner becomes more truculent and whimsical , has attracted comment from many reviewers , who usually find it discreditable to author and audience alike .
But there need be no scandal in Vonnegut ’s wide appeal , based , as I believe it is , on the generosity of his imagination and the honesty of his pain .
Who of his writing contemporaries strikes us as an imaginer , as distinguished from a reporter or a self - dramatizer ?
There is a fine disdain in Vonnegut of the merely personal .
His prologue to “ Slapstick ” says , “ I find it natural to discuss life without ever mentioning love , ” and his fiction , stoic in an epicurean time , does have a pre-sexual , pre-social freshness ; he worries about the sort of things — the future , injustice , science , destiny — that twelve - year - old boys worry about , and if most boys move on , it is not necessarily into more significant worries .
Vonnegut began as a published writer with the so - called slick magazines — the credits for the stories in “ Welcome to the Monkey House ” feature Collier ’s , The Saturday Evening Post , and the Ladies ’ Home Journal .
Rereading such exercises as “ D.P. , ” “ Deer in the Works , ” and “ The Kid Nobody Could Handle ” is a lesson in what slickness , fifties vintage , was : it was a verbal mechanism that raised the spectre of pain and then too easily delivered us from it .
Yet the pain in Vonnegut was always real .
Through the transpositions of science fiction , he found a way , instead of turning pain aside , to vaporize it , to scatter it on the plane of the cosmic and the comic .
His terse flat sentences , jumpy chapters , interleaved placards , collages of stray texts and messages , and nervous grim refrains like “ So it goes ” and ( in “ Slapstick ” )
“ Hi ho ” are a new way of stacking pain , as his fictional ice - nine is a new way of stacking the molecules of water .
Such an invention looks easy only in retrospect . ♦

" Nanotechnology : The Future is Coming Sooner Than You Think " is the title of a report [ PDF ] published this month by Representative Jim Saxton ( R - NJ ) , Ranking Member of the Joint Economic Committee , United States Congress .
The paper , authored by Dr. Joseph Kennedy , Adjunct Professor at Georgetown University , says :
Enhanced abilities to understand and manipulate matter at the molecular and atomic levels promise a wave of significant new technologies over the next five decades .
Dramatic breakthroughs will occur in diverse areas such as medicine , communications , computing , energy , and robotics .
These changes will generate large amounts of wealth and force wrenching changes in existing markets and institutions .
And that 's just the beginning of a surprisingly stark assessment of nanotechnology 's transformative potential .
The first section opens with this paragraph :
In 1970 Alvin Toffler , noted technologist and futurist , argued that the acceleration of technological and social change was likely to challenge the capacity of both individuals and institutions to understand and to adapt to it .
Although the world has changed a great deal since then , few would argue that the pace of change has had the discontinuous effects that Toffler predicted .
However , rapid advances in a number of fields , collectively known as nanotechnology , make it possible that Mr. Toffler ’s future has merely been delayed .
In fact , some futurists now talk about an unspecified date sometime around the middle of this century when , because of the accelerating pace of technology , life will be radically different than at any prior time .
Yes , it is " The Singularity " that 's being alluded to there .
In a later section , the report describes it this way :
Every exponential curve eventually reaches a point where the growth rate becomes almost infinite .
This point is often called the Singularity .
If technology continues to advance at exponential rates , what happens after 2020 ?
Technology is likely to continue , but at this stage some observers forecast a period at which scientific advances aggressively assume their own momentum and accelerate at unprecedented levels , enabling products that today seem like science fiction .
Beyond the Singularity , human society is incomparably different from what it is today .
Several assumptions seem to drive predictions of a Singularity .
The first is that continued material demands and competitive pressures will continue to drive technology forward .
Second , at some point artificial intelligence advances to a point where computers enhance and accelerate scientific discovery and technological change .
In other words , intelligent machines start to produce discoveries that are too complex for humans .
Finally , there is an assumption that solutions to most of today ’s problems including material scarcity , human health , and environmental degradation can be solved by technology , if not by us , then by the computers we eventually develop .
It is remarkable to find officials at this level of the U.S. government , or any large government , openly discussing dramatic possibilities that most often are dismissed as science fiction .
However , the report does caution about making an uncritical assumption that suddenly " everything will change " :
Looking forward , science is likely to continue outrunning expectations , at least in the medium - term .
Although science may advance rapidly , technology and daily life are likely to change at a much slower pace for several reasons .
First , it takes time for scientific discoveries to become embedded into new products , especially when the market for those products is uncertain .
Second , both individuals and institutions can exhibit a great deal of resistance to change .
Because new technology often requires significant organizational change and cost in order to have its full effect , this can delay the social impact of new discoveries .
For example , computer technology did not have a noticeable effect on economic productivity until it became widely integrated into business offices and , ultimately , business processes .
It took firms over a decade to go from replacing the typewriters in their office pools to rearranging their entire supply chains to take advantage of the Internet .
That sounds similar to the points we made last week about the uncertainty of " overnight " changes .
Nevertheless , the Congressional report does say :
Whether or not one believes in the Singularity , it is difficult to overestimate nanotechnology ’s likely implications for society .
For one thing , advances in just the last five years have proceeded much faster than even the best experts had predicted .
CRN 's concern is that this accelerated pace of development is likely to make molecular manufacturing technology achievable faster than almost anyone foresees .
And if we are not prepared for the consequences -- if the advent of desktop nanofactories catches us by surprise -- then we will not have time to debate , design , and implement sensible and responsible policy for its use .
We should not , however , count on the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative ( NNI ) to do this for us .
As the report says on page 12 :
The NNI is clearly geared toward developing the technology on a broad front , correctly seeing it as the source of tremendous benefits to society .
Its mission is not to see whether we should go forward with research and development .
It is to go forth boldly , while trying to discover and deal with possible risks .
Much of the rest of the 21 - page paper focuses on adequately dealing with health and safety risks of materials containing nanoparticles .
Although that is a serious concern , other issues that could and should be addressed in this report -- such as economic disruption from a rapid replacement of manufacturing infrastructure , or the potential for an unstable arms race driven by nano - weapons proliferation -- are either marginalized or not even addressed .
That 's a disappointment .
However , the fact that some of the issues we care about are beginning to be discussed in high places is encouraging .

Sept. 13 , 2005  --
Amid the chaos and confusion that engulfed New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina struck , a congressman used National Guard troops to check on his property and rescue his personal belongings -- even while New Orleans residents were trying to get rescued from rooftops , ABC News has learned .
On Sept. 2 -- five days after Katrina hit the Gulf Coast -- Rep. William Jefferson , D - La. , who represents New Orleans and is a senior member of the powerful Ways and Means Committee , was allowed through the military blockades set up around the city to reach the Superdome , where thousands of evacuees had been taken .
Military sources tells ABC News that Jefferson , an eight - term Democratic congressman , asked the National Guard that night to take him on a tour of the flooded portions of his congressional district .
A five - ton military truck and a half dozen military police were dispatched .
Lt. Col. Pete Schneider of the Louisiana National Guard tells ABC
News that during the tour , Jefferson asked that the truck take him to his home on Marengo Street , in the affluent uptown neighborhood in his congressional district .
According to Schneider , this was not part of Jefferson 's initial request .
Jefferson defended the expedition , saying he set out to see how residents were coping at the Superdome and in his neighborhood .
He also insisted that he did not ask the National Guard to transport him .
" I did not seek the use of military assets to help me get around my city , " Jefferson told ABC News .
" There was shooting going on .
There was sniping going on .
They thought I should be escorted by some military guards , both to the convention center , the Superdome and uptown . "
The water reached to the third step of Jefferson 's house , a military source familiar with the incident told ABC News , and the vehicle pulled up onto Jefferson 's front lawn so he would n't have to walk in the water .
Jefferson went into the house alone , the source says , while the soldiers waited on the porch for about an hour .
Finally , according to the source , Jefferson emerged with a laptop computer , three suitcases , and a box about the size of a small refrigerator , which the enlisted men loaded up into the truck .
" I do n't think there is any explanation for an elected official using resources for their own personal use , when those resources should be doing search and rescue , or they should be helping with law enforcement in the city , " said Jerry Hauer , a homeland security expert and ABC News consultant .
Jefferson said the trip was entirely appropriate .
It took only a few minutes to retrieve his belongings , he said , and the truck stayed at his house for an hour in part to assist neighbors .
" This was n't about me going to my house .
It was about me going to my district , " he said .
Two Heavy Trucks and Helicopter Involved
The Louisiana National Guard tells ABC
News the truck became stuck as it waited for Jefferson to retrieve his belongings .
Two weeks later , the vehicle 's tire tracks were still visible on the lawn .
The soldiers signaled to helicopters in the air for aid .
Military sources say a Coast Guard helicopter pilot saw the signal and flew to Jefferson 's home .
The chopper was already carrying four rescued New Orleans residents at the time .
A rescue diver descended from the helicopter , but the congressman decided against going up in the helicopter , sources say .
The pilot sent the diver down again , but Jefferson again declined to go up the helicopter .
After spending approximately 45 minutes with Jefferson , the helicopter went on to rescue three additional New Orleans residents before it ran low on fuel and was forced to end its mission .
" Forty - five minutes can be an eternity to somebody that is drowning , to somebody that is sitting in a roof , and it needs to be used its primary purpose during an emergency , " said Hauer .
Coast Guard Cmdr. Brendan McPherson told ABC
News , " We did have an aircraft that responded to a signal of distress where the congressman was located .
The congressman did decline rescue at the time so the helicopter picked up three other people .
" I can't comment on why the congressman decided not to go in the aircraft , " McPherson said .
" Did it take a little more time to send the rescue swimmer back a second time ?
Yes …
You 'd have to ask the congressman if it was a waste of time or not . "
The Louisiana National Guard then sent a second five - ton truck to rescue the first truck , and Jefferson and his personal items were returned to the Superdome .
Schneider said he could not comment on whether the excursion was appropriate .
" We 're in no position to comment on an order given to a soldier .
You 're not going to get a statement from the Louisiana National Guard saying whether it was right or wrong .
That was the mission we were assigned . "
Jefferson insisted the expedition did not distract from rescue efforts .
" They actually picked up a lot of people while we were there , " he said .
" The young soldier said , ' It 's a good thing we came up here because a lot of people would not have been rescued had we not been in the neighborhood . ' "
Jefferson 's Homes Searched in Unrelated Investigation
In an unrelated matter , authorities recently searched Jefferson 's property as part of a federal investigation into the finances of a high - tech firm .
Last month FBI officials raided Jefferson 's house as well as his home in Washington , D.C. , his car and his accountant 's house .
Jefferson has not commented on that matter , except to say he is cooperating with the investigation .
But he has emerged as a major voice in the post - Katrina political debate .
" The levee system that had protected New Orleans for hundreds of years had failed , " he said on the House floor on Sept .
7 . " Our city was inundated , 80 percent of it , with deadly water .
Thousands of lives were lost , many drowned , trapped in their homes .
Others were lost trying to escape the fury . "
Last week , Jefferson set up a special trust fund for contributions to his legal defense in light of the FBI investigation .
A senior federal law enforcement source tells ABC News that investigators are interested in learning if Jefferson moved any materials relevant to the investigation .
Jefferson says he did not .
ABC News ' Sarah H. Rosenberg , Chris Isham and Ted Gerstein contributed to this report .
Ars has extensively covered the attempts to legislate restrictions on violent video games and the ambiguous science that supports those efforts .
An aspect of this that frequently escapes analysis is why these legislative efforts gain so much traction despite their lack of a solid scientific foundation .
Writing in the journal Contexts , USC sociology lecturer Karen Sternheimer analyzes these efforts in terms of ongoing societal fears regarding the influence of media on children .
Sternheimer notes an obvious but underemphasized figure : despite the proliferation of violent , first - person shooters in the wake of Doom , juvenile homicide rates have fallen in the decade since its release .
Random school shootings remain incredibly rare ; for all forms of homicide , students face a seven in 10 million chance of being a victim .
Random school shootings remain so rare , in fact , that Sternheimer reports that the FBI found it impossible to generate a profile of a " typical " shooter .
This leads to a number of difficulties .
Linking violence to the perpetrators ' background might wind up revealing aspects of the shooter 's predominantly white , middle - class origin that helped foster their violence .
Nobody seems interested in doing this sort of analysis , perhaps in part because much of the media belongs to that same group .
This leaves people searching for specific influences , much as they tend to do in the far more common case of workplace shootings .
Here , the author suggests we run into the biggest problem : society does n't really understand its youth .
As a result , adults fear their loss of control over the factors that influence childhood development in an increasingly connected world .
Far from being a new danger , the Sternheimer report suggests that gaming is simply the latest in a long series of media influences to take the blame .
" Over the past century , politicians have complained that cars , radio , movies , rock music , and even comic books caused youth immorality and crime , calling for control and sometimes censorship . "
She terms the targets of such efforts " folk devils , " items branded dangerous and immoral that serve to focus blame and fear .
These folk devils can be used for political advancement or financial gain via lawsuits such as those that have targeted game makers .
But , based on Sternheimer 's description , their primary function appears to be to distract people from identifying the real causes underlying our discomfort with youth culture .
It also may distract people from getting to know their kids .
Sunday Discussion Group
Despite the latest revelations that Alberto Gonzales lied about his involvement in the prosecutor purge , the President is standing by his Attorney General .
I ’m wondering if he ’s the only one .
I was reading several conservative blogs yesterday to gauge their support for the embattled AG .
I was surprised to see so many who have decided that Gonzales is no longer deserving of support .
Ed Morrissey :
Have we had enough yet ?
I understand the argument that if we allow the Democrats to bounce Gonzales , they ’ll just aim for more , but Gonzales made himself the target here with what looks like blatant deception .
I do n’t think we do ourselves any good by defending the serially changing stories coming out of Gonzales ’ inept administration at Justice .
One cannot support an Attorney General who misleads Congress , allows his staffers to mislead Congress , and deceives the American people , regardless of whether an R or a D follows his name or the majority control of Congress .
Right Wing Nut House :
I will brook no excuses by commenters that Gonzalez “ misspoke , ” or “ forgot , ” or “ got a note from his mother ” that gave him permission to lie , or other excuses from the ever dwindling number of Bush diehards who visit this site .
He is the frickin’ Attorney General of the United States fer crissakes !
If there is anybody in government who needs to tell the truth , it is the guy responsible for enforcing the laws of land .
Jonah Goldberg :
Some readers are cross with me for using the word “ lied ” in reference to Gonzales .
Okay , he may simply have been deeply , deeply , confused , out of touch and unprepared to give a press conference which was supposed to put an end to the “ scandal ” and instead poured gasoline on it at a time when his boss , the President of the United States and Commander - in - Chief , had vastly more important things to deal with .
There are , of course , many more .
Considering that many of the same conservatives who now have little use for Gonzales were defending him up until fairly recently , are we starting to see the bow break ?
As is usually the case , the White House has decided that the key to enduring a serious scandal is maintaining the support of far - right allies .
Indeed , the more Rove & Co. can characterize the controversy as a Dems vs. GOP , left vs. right , affair , the easier it will be to persevere .
But are we finally looking at a scandal that even Bush loyalists can’t defend ?
Gonzales having been caught in a new mess may be a turning point , as evidenced by the blogs ’ reaction noted above , but the writing has been on the wall all week .
* A half - dozen congressional Republicans , including one ( ostensive ) presidential candidate , have joined Dems in calling for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ’ ouster .
* Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) sided with Dems on White House subpoenas , and Arlen Specter kinda - sorta agreed .
* A Republican leadership staffer told Roll Call this week , “ We are not throwing ourselves on the grenade for them anymore .
There ’s now an attitude of ‘ you created this mess , you ’ve got to get yourself out of it . ' ”
After watching conservatives back Bush on everything from Iraq to Plame to illegal NSA wiretaps to Katrina , have we finally found the one thing the right is n’t willing to defend ?
And if so , is n’t it safe to assume the political pressure on the White House will be even more intense ?
And if that ’s so , exactly how bad is this going to get for the Bush gang ?
Discuss .

Ninety - one percent of companies on the Chinese mainland have women holding senior management positions , ranking second in the world , after the Philippines , according to the results of a survey released yesterday .
The poll , conducted by Grant Thornton , an accounting firm based in Hong Kong , covered 32 economies .
Hong Kong and Taiwan also rank high on the list , with 83 percent and 80 percent of their firms having women in senior positions .
In the Philippines , 97 percent companies have women holding senior positions .
" The findings suggest that China businesses focus on capability and performance when appointing senior management , and not on gender , " said Alison Wong , partner of specialist advisory services at Grant Thornton .
On average 65 percent of the companies in the world have women in senior management positions , the survey shows .
China is ahead of many Western countries , including the US , Canada and Britain .
" Despite some people 's perception about traditional gender bias in Chinese society , it is positive to note that today three places across two shores achieve such a high proportion of business with senior females , " Wong said .
Almost all Asian countries have more businesses with women at senior levels than the global average , except Japan , whose rate is only 25 percent .
" Obviously Japan is unique in the cultural perception about women in business and women 's role in the family as compared with other parts of Asia , " Wong said .
The survey reflects an upward trend in the percentage of women in management roles in most economies , but only the Philippines has achieved true parity in male / female management .
" Hopefully we will see similar equality in other places in the coming years as more women play increasingly prominent roles in public life , " Wong said , citing names such as Vice - Premier Wu Yi , and Zhang Yin , chairman of Nine Dragons Paper Holdings and the first woman to top the list of China 's richest people with a fortune of $ 3.4 billion .

Posada Carriles : terrorist who killed 73 in plane bombing walks free
By Bill Van Auken
20 April 2007
“ I vowed that if you harbor a terrorist you ’re equally as guilty as the terrorist .
That ’s a doctrine .
In order for this country to be credible , when the President says something , he must mean it . ”
President George W. Bush , April 10 , 2007 , American Legion Post 177 , Fairfax , Virginia .
“ Part of our doctrine is if you harbor a terrorist , you ’re equally as guilty as the terrorists . ”
President Bush , April 5 , 2007 , Fort Irwin , California .
A cell door in New Mexico swung open Thursday and Luis Posada Carriles — a man wanted for an act of terrorist mass murder — went free , making his way to Miami escorted by US Marshals and his lawyer .
So much for the Bush doctrine .
Washington is now openly harboring a terrorist who murdered 73 people by organizing the planting of a bomb on a civilian airliner in 1976 .
The Cuban passenger plane , which had originated in Venezuela , blew up over the Caribbean waters of Barbados .
At that time , it constituted the most deadly act of terrorism ever carried out in the Western Hemisphere .
Among the dead were all 24 members of the Cuban fencing team , many of them teenagers , who had just won the 1975 Central American - Caribbean championship .
Also killed were several Guyanese medical students , aged 18 and 19 .
It is worth remembering these young victims as shock and sorrow is felt throughout the United States over the slaughter of a similar number of students of roughly the same age at Virginia Tech .
The release of Posada Carriles followed a ruling by the US Court of Appeals in New Orleans on Tuesday rejecting a government prosecutor ’s motion that the confessed terrorist be kept in prison .
He has been in custody since May of 2005 .
The court refused to hold him , however , because he is not charged with the crimes of mass murder , terrorism and assassination , but rather with run -of - the - mill immigration offenses : entering the country illegally and lying to US immigration officials .
He is now free on bail , awaiting a May 11 trial on charges of lying to immigration agents .
The only penalty for such an offense is deportation .
No country in the world , however , will agree to take Posada Carriles off Washington ’s hands , save two .
The first is his native Cuba , whose citizens constitute the majority of his victims , and the second is Venezuela , where he became a naturalized citizen and secret policeman , and from which he plotted the 1976 airline bombing .
Venezuela formally demanded that the US extradite the terrorist to face trial for this crime in June of 2005 under existing treaties between the two countries .
Since then , the Bush administration has simply ignored the extradition request .
As he awaited the completion of his trial and sentencing in the airline bombing case , Posada Carriles escaped from a Venezuelan prison in 1985 , and had remained under US protection ever since , working with CIA operatives in Central America in the illegal “ contra ” war against Nicaragua .
Venezuela clearly has every legal right to demand that he be sent back to confront the verdict that he evaded more than 20 years ago .
However , a US immigration judge , acting on behalf of the Bush administration , ruled that he could not be sent to Venezuela because he might face torture there .
This claim is both spurious and outrageous .
There is no evidence of systemic torture in Venezuela .
If this rule were applied consistently , no undocumented immigrant caught by border agents could be sent back to Mexico , Brazil or a number of other countries in Latin America where abuse in prisons is equally if not more common .
Moreover , coming from the US government , which has both tortured and organized the “ extraordinary rendition ” of its detainees to countries specifically chosen because they will be tortured there , the invocation of international treaties against torture to shield Posada Carriles is breathtaking in its hypocrisy .
Finally , it is worth noting that Posada Carriles himself was employed as a senior official in the Venezuelan secret police , the DISP , in the early 1970s , when torture was endemic , and has been charged with both the torture and extra-judicial murder of leftist activists in that country .
Responding to the freeing of Posada Carriles , Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez compared the fugitive to Osama bin Laden and described him as “ the father of all terrorists on the American continent . ”
“ We demand that they extradite this terrorist and murderer to Venezuela rather than keep protecting him , ” Chávez said .
He continued by condemning Washington ’s cynicism : “ They say they fight terrorism , ( but ) there it is !
Their mask keeps falling off . ”
The Cuban government also reiterated its call for the extradition request to be honored .
“ For two years they have protected Posada Carriles with judicial subterfuges to evade their duty to extradite him to Venezuela or try him for terrorism , ” Ricardo Alarcón , president of the Cuban parliament , said Thursday .
The Bush administration refuses to extradite Posada Carriles , because he was Washington ’s own terrorist , trained and paid by the CIA to carry out acts of terrorism .
To place him on trial would threaten the exposure of a long history of international aggression and criminality organized by US imperialism , ranging from terrorist attacks on Cuba and assassination attempts against its President Fidel Castro to the airline bombing — which took place when Bush ’s father was the director of the CIA — to the dirty wars in Central America in the 1980s .
So the Bush administration harbors the terrorist and , under the “ Bush doctrine ” is “ equally as guilty ” as this confessed and convicted mass murderer .
Cited as a reason for invading both Afghanistan and Iraq , and now again invoked in preparation for yet another war against Iran , this supposed principle — held up to the mirror of Posada Carriles — is revealed as nothing more than cynical pretext for pursuing the aims and interests of America ’s ruling elite by means of military force and massive state terror .
OTTAWA - Bank customers would have more money in their wallets if Parliament acts on an NDP proposal and legislates automated teller fees out of existence .
Bank customers are getting “ nickeled and dimed ” by the fees they pay to use bank machines to get access to “ their money , ” NDP Leader Jack Layton said today .
“ Canadians should not be charged by banks when they deposit , withdraw or transfer their own money using an ATM , ” Layton said .
At a Toronto event this morning , Layton proposed amendments to the federal Bank Act that would eliminate the charges that customers face for using automated tellers .
According to the NDP , Canadians used bank - owned ATMs to make over 700 million withdrawals in 2005 , plus 400 million other transactions - paying an estimated $ 420 million in fees to do it .
“ It 's working families that are hurt most by these outrageous fees , ” Layton said in a news release .

My friend Mike asked me if there was a quick way to get around the firewall that keeps him from being able to access his Gmail at work .
I was surprised at how easy it is .
I do n’t understand why Gmail gets blocked at work .
I think it is much better that people are having their personal conversations using iluvkfed69@gmail.com instead of representing the company with every list of jokes , funny images , or comical videos they forward .
But enough of my diatribe against poor policies in the workplace .
You can access Gmail using a different URL !
They usually only block some of the web addresses .
#1 : Use different web addresses
Instead of using http://mail.google.com use https://mail.google.com
You can also try
# 2 : Configure your mail program to access Gmail ( through POP )
If none of those sites are available the simplest solution might be to configure your mail program ( Microsoft Outlook , etc ) to connect to Gmail .
Instructions can be found on Google ’s Help Center .
# 3 : Access Gmail through Google Desktop
Another alternative is to download Google Desktop on to your PC .
It will bypass proxies to access Gmail .
Unfortunately , Google Desktop may also be banned at some workplaces .
# 4 : Use a web server with Gmail Lite installed
If you ’re dead set on accessing your mail from the web you can try searching an application called “ Gmail Lite ” .
This is an application you can install on your own web site .
Of course , most people do n’t have their own web site .
But if you keep searching through the results you ’ll find websites that have Gmail Lite installed for anyone to use .
Make sure to bookmark the site for later .
# 5 : Bribe the IT guys at your work
Always be on the good side of the IT guys .
It makes life so much easier .
They accept bribes .
Food Booze Movies ( preferably pirated copies — although IT guy probably has a better movie collection than you ) Anime Flirting Sex
On the subject of generic proxies
If you ’re looking for a proxy that will let you access any blocked web page then the comments of this Digg post have a lot of suggestions .
( Credit where credit is due , that thread is where I found out about almost all of the information in this post )
One tip I really like is let Google be the proxy for you .
These sites will always be accessible .
Surfing through Google Translate ( from English to English ) will let you navigate through any web site .
http://www.google.com/translate?langpair=en|en&u=engtech.wordpress.com
Bookmark that one in case work ever blocks my web site .
I wonder if it will correct my spelling mistakes ?

Apparently the next " crisis " is that America is running out of water .
This is mostly an issue in the west , where growth is high and fresh water is rarer than in the east .
Here is one example of the brewing panic :
The growing human population is creating cities where desert or scrub
land used to be .
Rainfall always has been and always will be in short
supply .
Only so much water can be diverted from rivers to satisfy the
water needs of these desert dwellers .
The aquifers are being drained .
Soon there will be demands to divert water from large inland lakes like the Great Lakes which would put those bodies of water in peril .
Oh my god , I can see it now - fish flopping on the muddy exposed bottom of Lake Michigan .
Look , the problem is not lack of water .
The problem is lack of market sanity .
Water in the west is regulated and sold in a hodge - podge of complex arrangements and negotiations .
The whole system is too complex to describe here , but at least one general conclusion can be safely drawn about the whole system :
Water is under - priced .
For reference , lets look at my home city .
If building cities in the desert is the new evil , then I live in that great Satan called Phoenix .
And while my electricity charges are enough to get my attention ( higher efficiency AC : check ; compact fluorescent bulbs : check ; solar : still too expensive ) , my water bill seldom grabs my focus .
And now I know why .
Check out this analysis , conducted apparently by the city of Austin but which I found on the Portland Water Bureau 's web site :
City Monthly cost for water service of 8,500 gallons Memphis , Tennessee $ 14.16 Phoenix , Arizona $ 16.27 Charlotte , North Carolina $ 17.52 Dallas , Texas $ 20.04 Austin , Texas $ 23.15 Portland , Oregon $ 23.44 Louisville , Kentucky $ 23.47 Houston , Texas $ 26.49 Milwaukee , Wisconsin $ 27.86 East Bay MUD , Oakland , California $ 31.13 Atlanta , Georgia $ 33.60 San Diego , California $ 37.52 Seattle , Washington $ 39.75
Can you believe it ?
We here in Phoenix , out in the middle of the largest desert on the continent , during a multi- year drought ( yes you can still have a drought in the desert ) , while everyone laments that Lake Powell and other reservoirs are getting sucked dry , Phoenix has one of the lowest water prices of any city in the country .
Can you get over the irony of Seattle having some of the highest priced water in the country and Phoenix the lowest ?
And you know what - I have not seen a single article in any of our local media that has once mentioned this fact .
Look here -- the articles blame global warming and lack of conservation and development and too many lawns and not enough low - flow faucets and talk about the need for government rationing , but never once mention PRICE .
We have the scarcest water in the country and one of the lowest prices for water .
Talk about ignoring the elephant in the room .
I should have just labeled this post " Duh ! "
And these are the consumer water prices .
The situation actually gets worse when you look at agriculture .
In most of the southwest , farmers get water prices subsidized below the rates paid by ordinary consumers .
When you combine these water subsidies with massive subsidies already rich groups get for growing crops in the desert from farm programs , you get an enormous distorted incentive to grow water - hungry crops that are totally inappropriate for the desert .
So here is my five minute plan :
We may be a ways away from creating an actual market in water , but in the mean time , the quasi - governmental agencies providing it need to raise the prices ( to everyone ) up to a level that demand matches supply .
More conservation will occur , and marginal commercial , residential , and agricultural development will disappear .
If the price goes high enough , someone may even go out and find a new , innovative source of water for the area .
Unfortunately , this is just too dang easy , and , from reading recent articles in the media , not even in the menu of options being considered .
Government bureaucrats are much more comfortable with rationing and limitations on development , because it gives them more power and creates a new set of winners and losers who will donate more to future political campaigns .
Update : Daniel Mitchell at Cato has similar thoughts , based on water shortages in Florida of all places :
So here we are , in the spring of 2007 , with rain below
average , with a low lake level , little else in the way of reservoirs ,
and a water shortage .
What is the response ?
Well , a rational response
might be to price a scarce commodity such that people will use it only
as they need it , and not frivolously .
" ¦ Instead , we get the response of
the local commissars .
So , not allowing the market to work , and not
allowing prices to provide signals to the participants , they have
decided to run our lives for us .
" ¦I live at an odd numbered address .
That means that if I want to
water my lawn , I can only do it on Monday , Wednesday and Saturday
mornings , from four to eight AM .
I can water my plants with a hose on
the same days , but only between five and seven PM .
My neighbors across
the street , and behind my house on the next block , get Sunday , Tuesday
and Thursday .
" ¦ Over thirty years ago , in the first OPEC oil embargo , the
government , rather than allowing prices to rise to account for the
reduced supply , told people when they could purchase gas based on the
parity of their license plate " ” even one day , odd the next .
My
recollection was that this did nothing to alleviate the shortage " ” the
lines remained .
The problem was only solved when Nixon - era price
controls on oil were lifted , the market was allowed to work , and oil
prices eventually ( and it did n't take all that long ) fell to historical
lows .
" ¦[ H ] ere 's a radical concept .
How about pricing the commodity to the
market ?
Maybe , if people had to pay more for water to water their lawn ,
they 'd use less of it ?
Yes , I know that it 's hard to believe , but there
really are some people out there who buy less of something if the price
is higher .
Update # 2 : The more I think of it , the more this situation really ticks me off .
In their general pandering and populism , politicians are afraid to raise water prices , fearing the decision would be criticized .
So , they keep prices artificially low , knowing that this low price is causing reservoirs and aquifers to be pumped faster than their replacement rate .
Then , as the reservoirs go dry , the politicians blame us , the consumers , for being too profligate with water and call for ... wait for it ... more power for themselves , the ones whose spinelessness is the root cause of the problem , to allocate and ration water and development .
On the day it comes to you that living a longer , healthier life is something you 'd like to do , that an extra year or ten of good health ( or hell , why not more ? ) would be just peachy keen , think of the transhumanists - because you just became one .
You saw a limit in the human condition , thought about what life would be like with that limit removed , and liked it .
Welcome to the party !
Transhumanism , make no mistake , is just a fancy name for common sense .
Change for the better is good , right ?
Common sense .
It 's what we humans do in our scattered finer moments - we work to change things for the better .
It 's common sense to fetch in the harvest on wheels rather than on foot , and it 's common sense to repair the biomolecular damage of Alzheimer 's before the mind begins to rot .
It 's common sense to build perfect immune systems from nanomedical robots , and it 's common sense to develop the technologies of regenerative medicine to their logical end .
It takes work , but what is work compared to a world of suffering ?
Choosing not to attain these goals makes about as much sense as standing out in the rain to spite yourself .
New technology cannot set slaves free , remove poverty brought of corruption , make the willfully blind see , or the unhappy bring themselves to good cheer of their own free will ... but it can remove the limits placed upon us by evolution , and it will one day give us all much , much more time in health and life to work on our other , very human issues .
You can't rid the world of poverty when you 're sick , decrepit and aged to death .
The limits to our lives that we cannot negotiate away by talk and travel are the most confining , do n't you agree ?
Transhumanism , common sense with a slick name , is really simple humanism - which is also really no more than a name for common sense .
It is only humanist to work to give people the choice to live without suffering , and without death .
To live , for without life , there is nothing .

The Base Case production model shows Ghawar on the edge of irreversible production decline that may start around 2010 or it may already have started .
The High Case production model is more robust and shows plateau production maintained until around 2013 .
Two volumetric simulations ( 2D ) of the initial and remaining reserves in Ghawar , the world ’s largest producing oil field , have been determined .
The High Case scenario uses somewhat more optimistic assumptions than the Base Case scenario .
Background and methodology are described in detail here .
Reserves estimates
The areas of unswept oil observed on the Linux simulation ( Figure 5 , Part 1 ) transferred onto Croft ’s map are shown in Figure 16 .
The measured map areas shown in Figure 16 are the same for Base Case and High Case .
Base Case reserves estimates are also shown .
The reserves estimates for Base and High Cases are summarised in Tables 1 and 2 .
All details of input variables to these estimates are on the XL spread sheet that can be downloaded here .
All these estimates are to be viewed as provisional and subject to change as new information may come to light or as assumptions are refined .
All readers are also reminded that these estimates are a back of the envelope style calculation and are subject to large uncertainties .
Jeremy Gilbert rightly pointed out that the only organisation with the data to perform this task properly is Saudi Aramco .
Note that the producing region boundary between Hawiyah and Uthmaniyah used here has been changed form those used by Croft and others .
The traditional boundary chops off the north end of the Haradh – Hawiyah ridge that makes little geological sense so I have adjusted this boundary as shown in Figure 16 to follow more closely the geological structure .
Should anyone wish to propose modifications to the input to this model then I will be pleased to make adjustments so long as a good argument for doing so is presented .
Figure 16 .
Contoured base map of Ghawar from Greg Croft with areas of presumed dry oil and swept zones inferred from Figure 5 ( Part 1 ) superimposed .
The areas were measured by careful counting of 1 mile squares laid out in a grid as shown .
Base Case reserves estimates are indicated .
See Table 2 for High Case estimates .
The boundary between Hawiyah and Uthmaniyah has been modified from Croft to follow the geological structure .

Table 2 High Case reserves estimates for Ghawar oil field , Saudi Arabia .
All figures in billions of barrels .
There is no difference between the high case and base case initial STOIP ( stock tank oil in place ) – 162 billion barrels .
The High Case initial reserves estimate – 106 billion barrels , is significantly higher than the Base Case – 90 billion barrels , owing to higher oil column thickness and recovery factors used in the former .
The base case suggests 34 billion barrels reserves remaining in 2004 with 55 billion barrels already produced .
The high case suggests 43 billion barrels reserves remaining in 2004 with 63 billion barrels produced .
The reserves depletion levels are 62 % for the Base Case and 60 % for the High Case – both significantly higher than the 48 % depleted value given by Saleri .
Areas of over – and under – estimation
The following summarises my views on where the reserves estimates reported here either under or over estimate .
Overestimation
Ignoring edge wedge effects will have lead to overestimation of initial STOIP .
And overestimation of remaining reserves in Haradh and Hawiyah .
Underestimation
In transferring swept area data onto Croft ’s map , the swept area in Haradh may have been overestimated leading to underestimation of remaining reserves ( the estimated 37 % depletion seems too high ) .
All reserves estimates reported here are based on the unswept dry areas in Figure 5 and the wet area production immediately adjacent to the dry areas .
No allowance is made for wet area only production .
This may proceed for decades with high water cut .
It is possible that the net reservoir thickness data provided by Croft does not take into account recovery from lower permeability rock made possible by horizontal drilling .
Using thicker net pay ( albeit with lower porosity and permeability ) may add further to reserves .
It is possible that the area on Croft 's map leads to underestimation across Ain Dar - Shedgum
On balance , over - and underestimation will tend to cancel each other out , however , the balance sheet seems biased towards underestimation .
It needs to be noted , however , that the reserves that are potentially underestimated are not easily produced being contained in either poor quality rock or in wet areas .
These reserves will not significantly impact the decline of Northern Ghawar but may add significantly to tail end production .
Comparison with official Saudi statements
Ain Dar – Shedgum area
Dr Saleri provided us with a snapshot of Ain Dar Shedgum in his 2004 CSIS presentation ( large pdf ) ( all data believed to be 2004 status ) .
The key figures :
Saleri High Case Base Case Produced 26.9 27 25 Remaining proved reserves 13.9 12 8 Initial reserves 40.8 39 33 Initial oil in place
68 58 58 Recovery ( produced + proved ) / initial 60 % 67 % 58 %
The correspondence between Saleri ’s produced , remaining and initial reserves with my High Case scenario is striking .
Sufficiently so to give me a fair degree of confidence that the methodology I have employed is generally valid .
However , the agreement with initial oil in place is not so good , Saleri quoting a significantly higher figure of 68 billion compared to my high case estimate of 58 billion .
And this then highlights a conflict in the way all the numbers are derived .
My high case already assumes a high recovery factor of 67 % while Saleri ’s numbers assume 60 % recovery leading to the expectation of more probable and possible barrels to be produced as indicted in Figure 17 .

Heading
Out brought the paper by Jaffe and Elass ( pdf ) to our attention in his post Simple mathematics - The Saudi reserves , GOSPs and water injection .
Jaffe and Elass ( 2007 ) provide an indication of the current Saudi view of Ghawar ’s production history where they say that Ghawar still contains 70 billion barrels of reserves and is 48 % depleted .
In this case my figures have been adjusted for 3 years production ( 5 million barrels per day for 3 years is 5.5 billion barrels ) to bring them into line with Jaffe and Elass ’ 2007 data .
The Jaffe and Elass data have been reduced as follows :
70 billion = 52 % of reserves , therefore initial reserves = ( 70/52 ) * 100 = 135 billion .
With 70 billion remaining we get the 65 billion produced figure ( 135-70 ) .
Jaffe and Elass High Case Base Case Produced 65 68 61 Remaining proved reserves 70 37 29 Initial reserves 135 106 89 Depletion % 48 65 68
As was the case with Ain Dar – Shedgum , there is actually remarkable correspondence between the production figures – the High Case being a bit higher and the Low Case being a bit lower than Jaffe and Elass .
However , the similarity ends there .
The much higher Saudi initial reserves estimate gives rise to a remaining reserves estimate that is double mine , and this in my opinion masks the precarious state of depletion of Ghawar .
The Saudis say 48 % depleted while my High Case suggests 65 % depletion .
The initial STOIP figure I have for the field is 162 billion barrels and this assumes generally high oil saturations throughout .
The Jaffe and Elass initial reserves figure of 135 billion implies 83 % recovery against my initial STOIP value .
My initial STOIP calculation does of course hinge on the map scale and Croft ’s average reservoir parameters being correct .
If there are major errors there then perhaps someone could let us know ?
Comments by Simmons
In his 2004 presentation , Matthew Simmons ( large pdf ) points to a 170 billion initial STOIP figure for Ghawar and he says that this matches Aramco ’s 1975 estimate ( pre full nationalisation ) .
My figure of 162 billion is a bit lower and I wonder if map scaling issues across S Ain Dar – Shedgum may account for this difference ?
Nevertheless , the agreement is pretty good ( 5 % difference ) – considering my figures are produced on the back of an envelope , these areas of agreement underpin my confidence in my general approach .
This emphasises the significance of differences between my estimates of remaining reserves and those reported by Saudi Arabia .
Figure 18 .
A view on Ghawar ’s reserves provided by Matt Simmons in his 2004 presentation ( pdf ) .
Production models
The production models for base case and high case scenarios rely on certain assumptions being made .
Some details exist about production in the different areas of Ghawar .
Overall production is assumed to be 5 million barrels per day .
Published data point to 500,000 bpd in N ‘ Ain Dar and 2,000,000 bpd for Ain Dar and Shedgum combined .
Haradh is reported to be producing 900,000 bpd leaving 2,100,000 million barrels per day in Uthmaniyah and Hawiyah .
The following distribution of production between the various areas has been assumed :
N Ain Dar 500,000 S Ain Dar 500,000 Shedgum 1,000,000 Uthmaniyah 1,500,000 Haradh 900,000 Hawiyah 600,000 Total 5,000,000
The production models have been run until all the estimated recoverable reserves have been consumed in the respective areas .
Rapid decline over 5 year periods has been built into the models to take account of the growing use of horizontal wells in the development programs .
The reserves models suggest that Hawiyah contains the largest remaining reserves volumes and in each model a program of horizontal well drilling associated with new GOSPs are assumed to compensate for declining production in N Ghawar .
It is envisaged that these projects would be similar to Haradh III , comprising smart MRC wells and each GOSP handling 300,000 bpd .
In the base case , the reserves will only support a 2 GOSP development in addition to the assumed existing production .
In the high case model , reserves would support a 3 GOSP extension to the field , each producing 300,000 bpd .
The base case production model presents a sobering picture of the state of N Ghawar ( Figure 19 ) .
N Ain Dar is forecast to come off plateau production in 2010 , followed by S Ain Dar , Uthmaniyah and Shedgum .
The anticipated rapid decline of these areas points to most of the primary production in N Ghawar coming to an end around 2018 ( Figure 19 ) .
Figure 19 .
Base Case production model for Ghawar .
The model is run until all remaining reserves in sub-structures are consumed .
Not shown is potential wet area only production that may prolong the tail if sufficient investment is made in water handling facilities .
To compensate for falling production in the North , it is assumed that there will be further development of the South with Hawiyah GOSPS I and II partly offsetting the decline of the North .
Around 2018 , Ghawar production would settle on around 2,000,000 bpd but by 2030 most primary dry oil reserves will be exhausted .
It has to be noted that the timing of these events are based on the assumption that the Linux map is dated 2004 .
Should it reflect the situation in 2003 or earlier then the events described above will all happen correspondingly earlier – and 2010 is only three years away .
The High Case model presents a much more robust picture with plateau production close to 5,000,000 bpd sustainable until around 2013 ( Figure 20 ) .
Following that , Northern Ghawar declines as described for the Base Case with N Ain Dar first , followed by S Ain Dar , Uthmaniyah and Shedgum .
The higher reserves in the High Case also allows for a 3 GOSP redevelopment of Hawiyah with ample reserves to sustain a new plateau of 2,500,000 bpd until 2030 ( whether reservoir performance will permit this or not is another issue ) .
Figure 20 .
High case production model for Ghawar .
This model produces only 7 billon barrels more oil in the forecast period than the Base Case but this has a profound effect on delaying and reducing near term and longer term decline illustrating the sensitivity of these models to reserves uncertainties .
The High Case provides a very different outcome to the Base Case .
Throughout the forecast period , the High Case produces 7 billion barrels more oil than the Base Case ( 23 % more ) .
This does not seem a lot but it has a profound effect on the near term and longer term outcomes .
All readers of this article need to bare in mind the large uncertainty of these forecasts .
The additional oil in the High Case model comes from assumed , thicker oil columns in 2004 and higher recovery factors , especially in Haradh and Hawiyah .
In the absence of reliable data ( in the hands of Saudi Aramco ) it would be unwise to discount the High Case model all together .
Consequences and conclusions
The ravages of 50 + years production on reserves in Northern Ghawar are there for all to see on the Linux oil saturation model ( Figure 5 , Part 1 ) .
Northern Ghawar is in a heavily depleted state and will shortly enter a period of irreversible decline .
However , despite being around 88 % depleted , regions like N ‘ Ain Dar , still contain a significant amount of recoverable dry oil – about 1.5 billion barrels in the case of N ‘ Ain Dar .
This is sufficient to support 500,000 bpd production for a few years yet ( 183 million barrels per year ) .
One thing I feel is important for OECD based observers to understand is that Ghawar has not been developed like commercial oil fields in the west .
The field has never been produced at anything close to its production potential and this means that existing lower rates of careful production can be maintained , even though the field may be 65 % depleted .
The real trouble for Ghawar and Saudi Arabia will start when N and S ‘ Ain Dar and Uthmaniyah all begin to decline at about the same time , somewhere in the time frame 2010 to 2013 in my opinion .
It is possible that this process has already begun and I eagerly await Stuart ’s interpretation of these vital , highly depleted areas .
In preparing these reserves and production forecasts I became acutely aware of their sensitivity to varying certain assumptions and I have swayed between seeing an immediate production crisis and my established view that Saudi production will be maintained for a number of years to come .
The data have led me to settle on the latter point of view .
New field developments such as Khursaniyah ( gas ) , Shaybah extension and Khurais will in my opinion enable Saudi Arabia to grow production slowly between now and 2013 .
As I see things , the main consequence of the pending decline in Ghawar for world energy supplies is that Saudi Arabia , and other OPEC countries , will not be able to meet rising demand in full , giving rise to repeated cycles of rising prices and demand destruction .
Saudi Arabian oil production will of course decline one day , but that day still seems to be a few years off .
Falling oil and gas production throughout the OECD is the major energy security problem confronting the World Economy today .
The main conclusion to draw from the reserves data presented here is that the produced oil volumes tally in a general sense with figures released by Aramco .
There are significant discrepancies however , with the remaining reserves figures .
The data presented here show significantly lower remaining reserves than reported by Saudi Arabia and this reduces the outlook for future production growth .

Saudi Aramco
One thing to emerge from the vigorous debate about Saudi Arabian reserves on TOD in recent weeks is the fact that Saudi Aramco are a highly competent organization doing a superb job of handling these assets that are so important to the global economy .
Clear distinction needs to be made between the technical expertise of Aramco and the political statements about reserves and future production .
This article has been prepared in good faith , aimed at providing an independent view of the production history and remaining reserves in Ghawar .
If here are major errors in the input data to my model then I will be pleased to revise this model should more accurate and reliable input data become available .

Super - Kamiokande is back from the dead .
Five years ago , the University of Tokyo’s $ 100 million subatomic particle observatory suffered a catastrophe .
As the 12.5 million - gallon cylinder was being filled with water , one of its glass photomultiplier tubes shattered .
The resulting shock wave , amplified by the high atmospheric pressure , destroyed 6,000 adjacent tubes ( used to detect light emitted when particles called neutrinos collide with water molecules ) .
“ It was a complete disaster , ” says UC Irvine physicist Hank Sobel , who called the facility a “ giant crystal cathedral ” eight years ago in Wired ( “ The Odyssey , ” issue 6.11 ) .
Before the breakdown , Super - K made head - lines by proving that neutrinos have actual mass .
After the accident , many thought it was washed up .
But repairs were completed in April , and the tank should be refilled by June .
To prevent another disaster , the tubes are now protected by shrouds of fiberglass and Plexiglas .
When research resumes , scientists hope to observe the decay of protons and examine how and why neutrinos morph among three " flavors . "

What 's Wrong With Showing ID ?
" There are good people with bad papers ; and bad people with good papers . "
- Bertold Brecht
What does an ID , any ID , do for security ?
The honest answer is ' not much ' .
If anything , relying on ID for security purposes actually makes things worse .
Showing ID only affects honest people .
If you 're dishonest , you can obtain false documents or steal the identity of an honest person .
If a 19 year - old college student can get a fake ID to drink , why could n't a bad person get one , too ?
And no matter how sophisticated the security embedded into the ID , would n't a well - financed terrorist be able to falsify that , too ?
The answer to both questions is obviously ' yes ' .
Honest people , on the other hand , go to Pro -Life rallies .
Honest people attend gun shows .
Honest people protest the President of the United States .
Honest people fly to political conventions .
What if those with the power to put people on a ' no fly ' list decided that they did n't like the reason for which you wanted to travel ?
The honest people would n't be going anywhere .
Bad people , besides using fake IDs and stolen identities , can also make the system of checking IDs work in their favor .
The Carnival Booth effect , as described by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , means that terrorists can probe an ID security system by sending a number of people on innocent trips through the system and noting who is flagged for extra searches and who is n't .
They then send only those who the system does n't flag on terrorist missions .
Still , some Americans think that ' if you have nothing to hide , you have nothing to fear ' .
Were the Founding Fathers criminals trying to protect themselves when they inserted the 4th and 5th amendments into the Bill of Rights ?
After all , nobody who has n't done anything wrong needs to worry about being searched or being forced to testify against himself .
Over the years , Americans have become accustomed to showing ID in any number of circumstances .
Few have asked the question , ' Why ? ' .
The custom of showing ID at airports came about in July of 1996 , in the wake of the TWA flight 800 disaster .
Faulty fuel tank insulation caused TWA 800 to explode over Long Island Sound .
Before we knew that , there was concern that terrorists had blown up the plane .
According to former terrorism czar Richard Clarke 's book , the ID requirement was instituted as a temporary measure so that then - President Clinton had something to announce to the families of the victims when he met with them .
After the 2001 World Trade Center bombings , the ID requirement became mandatory , as anyone who has flown since can testify .
The Department of Homeland Security has attempted to institute programs predicated on the use of ID to improve air security .
One such program , the Computer Assisted Passenger Profiling System II ( CAPPS II ) would have required every citizen to undergo a background check as a precondition to travel by commercial airline .
CAPPS II depended on the presentation of government - issued photo ID in order to function .
The information contained on the ID would have been cross-checked against a variety of public and private databases , and an individual threat assessment would be generated based on this information .
The CAPPS II program was pronounced ' dead ' in July of 2004 , but the Department of Homeland Security is continuing to work under wraps to produce a replacement system that works similarly .
Another program which depends on showing ID is the Watch List and No - Fly List .
Airlines are issued these lists by the federal government and are required to request ID from their passengers in order to check them against the lists .
This has resulted in countless citizens with names similar to bad people being harrassed , arrested , or prevented from travelling by air — including every person named ' David Nelson ' .
Much has been done to make travel by air safer .
Cockpit doors have been secured , pilots are armed , and Air Marshals patrol airplane cabins .
Increased physical security at airports has dramatically increased the safety of our nation 's skies .
Above all , the mindset of the flying public has also changed : no longer will passengers remain passive in the event of a skyjacking .
The demand for ID does nothing for security while making honest Americans less free .
How can such systems be dangerous ?

A microscopic version of Rodin 's famed sculpture " The Thinker " is just about twice the size of a red blood cell at 20 millionths of a meter high .
Using lasers , Korean researchers have crafted a microscopic version of Rodin 's famed sculpture " The Thinker " just about twice the size of a red blood cell at 20 millionths of a meter high [ image ] .
Muscles and even toes are visible in the tiny model .
The new technique could help develop novel biosensors and other complicated microscopic devices , the scientists said .
For more than a decade , researchers worldwide have experimented with lasers to fabricate elaborate 3 - D creations .
They start with a resin that hardens when exposed to certain frequencies of light .
Using overlapping beams of lasers , researchers can then solidify a sculpture with details measuring less than a wavelength of visible light in size .
While the skins of these sculptures are hard , their innards remain soft .
This leaves them vulnerable to surface tension , the same force that causes water to bead up into droplets .
The surface tension of the fluid in which the sculptures are immersed can cause them to deform .
These sculptures can by made stronger by increasing the power of the laser beams or leaving the beams on longer .
This makes each spot on the surface of these sculptures extend deeper , yielding a thicker skin .
Unfortunately , each spot now also takes up more surface area , sacrificing detail .
To solve this problem mechanical engineer Dong - Yol Yang at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon , South Korea , and his colleagues use multiple laser beams focused at and below each spot on the surface of thea sculpture [ graphic ] .
The result is a thicker skin without each spot taking up more surface area .
With this new approach , the scientists scanned a replica of Rodin 's popular masterpiece " The Thinker , " originally sculpted in 1880 , and created a version 93,000 times smaller than the roughly 6 - foot - high original .
Yang and his colleagues reported their findings online Jan. 4 via the journal Applied Physics Letters .

The Nintendo Revolution controller will be substantially different than those found on other consoles .

Click Mario Morris NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) �
Interesting factoid about the Nintendo Revolution controller :
It 's smaller and lighter than you might think .
I recently had the chance to get some hands - on time with the company 's next generation console to see whether the Revolution was , in fact , revolutionary .
While the controller I used was still a prototype ( the final one will be a bit larger and will include a button to power the machine on and off ) , it gave me a good chance to see what to expect when the system launches next year .
Shaped like a television remote control , the Revolution controller uses internal sensors to translate your wrist , arm and hand movements on screen .
It 's easy to use , but takes a few minutes to adjust your playing style .
( I initially found myself waving my arms wildly , resulting in the onscreen pointer whizzing back and forth at blinding speeds . )
Nintendo was n't kidding when it said it wanted to change the way people play , though .
Once I figured out that subtle movements made for simple gameplay , I went through eight demos demonstrating a variety of features and possible uses .
A simple point and shoot demo ( like any of the thousands of Web - based Flash games ) was more fun than I expected .
I effortlessly pulled off loops and flight stunts I 've never been able to manage with today 's standard controller in a flying demo , simply by holding the controller as I might a paper airplane .
( " Star Fox " fans should start getting excited . )
Other demos allowed me to telescopically zoom in and out on the screen , simply by moving the controller forward and backward and try some fishing by ' feeling ' fish nibble on the line ( via a rumble effect ) , then yanking the controller up in the air to hook them .
( " Animal Crossing " fans , you might want to get excited , too . )
By adding an auxiliary thumbstick controller , I was able to play through a level of a retrofitted " Metroid Prime 2 " ( a GameCube game ) .
Confession time :
When it comes to console shooters , I 'm terrible .
I can finish them , but I 'm nowhere near as competent as I am with my mouse / keyboard setup for the PC .
In the early stages of the " Metroid " demo , it looked like this trend would continue , as I was all over the screen .
By mid-way , though , I was better able to move and aim � and enjoyed the game far more than I did with the GameCube controller .
( " Metroid " fans ... well , you 're probably already pretty excited . )
It turns out I 'm not the only one who has this problem with standard controllers .
" I was a developer for many years before my current role , but I 've never been a very good gamer , " Nintendo president Satoru Iwata told me .
" I 've never been able to control a first - person shooter , but as soon as I used the Revolution controller , I found it very easy to control the game .
So , I think that 's a genre that 's particularly well suited for the controller . "
Reggie Fils - Aime , executive vice president of sales and marketing for Nintendo of America , said he hopes to see another type of game really take off with the Revolution .
" I hope [ massively multiplayer online games ] are really explored on this system , " he said .
" That 's a genre , from the home console standpoint , that really has n't been explored very well . "
One of the problems the Revolution faces is dislodging the idea of the standard controller from people 's minds .
Mention home video games to most people and they 'll conjure a mental image of someone sitting on a couch , both hands gripping one of today 's standard controllers and not moving much .
So the idea of moving your arm in a virtual sword fight or taking virtual aim at onscreen monsters might be hard to get across .
" When we first watched it , we thought , frankly , ' what the hell is this ? ' , " said Jack Sorensen , executive vice president of worldwide studios for THQ .
" The main thing is getting it in your hands .
Once you do that , it 's pretty intuitive .
It 's not about more buttons .
It 's about ease of use for consumers .
... I 'm surprised and happy with the direction Nintendo is going . "
Nintendo was in a similar situation a year ago when it launched the Nintendo DS .
Explaining to people that a touch screen would be used to play games was n't easy .
The DS was something that had to be experienced to fully understand .
Iwata said the company is better prepared this time around .
" It 's going to be a challenge to take something that 's a new concept and new idea and convey to the public ... how to understand it , but honestly I think the Revolution controller is going to be a lot easier to convey to the public than the DS was as a system , " he said .
" We 've learned a lot in terms of how to communicate to people these new and different ideas and because of the experience we had with the DS , we 're much more prepared . "
The company has high hopes for its next console ( Revolution , it should be noted , is just a code name � the system 's official name will be announced next year ) .
Iwata has previously said if sales do not surpass the GameCube 's , it will be considered a failure .
It goes beyond that , though .
" Until now , within a single household , we 've had family members who play video games and family members who do n't play video games - and they 've been very separate , " said Iwata .
" Gradually , the barriers between those two have gotten stronger .
...
Today , if you do n't understand the controller , you 're not able to enjoy video games .
...
We expect [ the Revolution controller ] to become the standard in video game controls . "
That 's a tall order , especially amongst an audience that tends to be resistant to change .
( The DS was often scorned by core gamers when it was initially announced .
Some of those same gamers now regularly sing its praises .
Others continue to argue it's a gimmick . )
The Revolution is scheduled to launch next year , most likely in the same time frame as Sony 's ( Research ) PlayStation 3 .
Nintendo , which has already hinted it might offer the console at a lower price , has already promised to reveal all the details at a May press conference preceding the E3 trade show ( the annual gathering of the video game industry ) .
That does n't mean it will retreat behind a veil of silence until that point , however .
" It 's fair to say that we have a number of things that we will begin unveiling all next year , leading up to E3 , " said Fils - Aime .

It really is hard to stay current with High Definition , and technology in general .
No matter how long you wait to buy the newer , more advanced models ; something better comes out a few months later .
Always !
Guaranteed !
I think this next piece of news is going to be somewhat frustrating for a lot of people .
Just when you thought you were " current " with 1080 p and HDMI , we learn that over the next couple years DVI and VGA ( the two types of cables you use to connector to your computer monitor ) will be phased out and replaced by a new standard connector called Displayport version 1.1 ( no doubt will change in version as time goes on ) .
The standard comes from the Video Electronics Standards Association ( VESA ) , who every major manufacturer and many small ones are a member of .
What 's the relevance ?
Well VESA 's approval of this new standard means that every company from A - Z will likely be adopting this standard in the near future .
Two years ago , dvi was the primary HD connector of choice .
One of my early hdtvs , the Sony KF - 42WE610 had a DVI port , and it was " future proof . "
At the time , that is !
No more than two years later , just after PC's and hdtv 's standardized dvi , HDMI has replaced it in the home theatre environment .
High Definition has come a long way in defining itself , but its not done yet .
The good news is that unlike two years ago , it is now safe to buy .
Purchasing an hdvt that does n't have a Displayport 1.1 wo n't really be an issue for a while and quite honestly , unless hooking your PC up to your tv is an absolute must , it may not be that necessary in the future .
I would speculate this will be more of a deal for PC users in the future than it will be for home theatre enthusiasts , as HDMI is now solidly grounded and vested in HD components .
It will also take the next two years to phase this standard into products and to slowly phase DVI and VGA out .
The 2007 Q3 models of hdtv's will introduce new features such as HDMI 1.3 , deep color , and higher response times / refresh rates .
By 2009 , who knows where we 'll be ?
If manufacturers dare replace HDMI with Displayport 1.1 , then all your home theatre components will need an overhaul .
However , I highly doubt this will be the case .
If anything , I would see Displayport being the connector of choice for PC's , and perhaps being an additional connector at the back of your hdtv as an option to interface with the PC / laptop .
But without further ado , I 'll finish with the rundown on Displayport 1.1 :
放送と著作権は、切っても切れない関係にある。これまでテレビ局は、この著作権法を上手く使って現状を維持してきた。だが今度はその著作権によって、テレビ局がやりこめられるという事件が起こった。それが「まねきTV裁判」である。
まねきTVとは永野商店が行なっているハウジングサービスで、ソニーのロケーションフリーを使って、インターネット経由で加入者がテレビ視聴するというものである。客観的に見れば、できることは以前にコラムでとりあげた「録画ネット」（「録画ネット裁判」で明らかになったタブー）と変わらない。
この事業にテレビ局がかみついた。放送事業者が持つ著作隣接権の1つである、「送信可能可権」を侵害しているというのである。
だがこの裁判では、昨年8月に東京地裁がテレビ局側の申し立てを却下。テレビ局側は抗告したが、12月の知財高裁でも抗告は棄却され、まねきTV側の勝訴となった。テレビ局側は再び抗告し、残る舞台は最高裁のみとなったが、今年1月には知財高裁から抗告を許可しない決定が出た。これによりこの一連の裁判は、まねきTV側の全面勝訴ということで決着した。
先にも述べたように、録画ネットとまねきTVのサービスは客観的に見れば似たようなもののように見えるが、裁判において明暗を分けた相違点もまた多い。今回は録画ネットとまねきTVの裁判を比較しながら、いくつかポイントを絞って争点を整理してみたい。
相違点1：市販品か否か
録画ネットの場合、使用するマシンはLinux搭載PCである。一方まねきTVでは、ソニーが一般に市販するロケーションフリー(以下ロケフリ)を使用する。
このことは、送信している主体は誰か、という論点につながっていく。録画ネットのLinuxPCは、録画ネットが用意した物をユーザーに一旦販売、それを録画ネットに送付してもらったという形にしてマシンを設置した。裁判所では、これは販売の偽装であると判断されることになる。
ここにいくつか考えるべきポイントがある。パソコン自体はどこでも買えるものだが、テレビ録画機能付きのLinuxPCというのは、一般に市販されているとは考えにくい。そういうものを売っているショップもあるかもしれないが、WindowsPCのように量販店に置かれるようなものではない。
録画ネットとしてはサービス全体のコストを下げるために、標準的なスペックの録画機能付きPCと、導入コストのかからないOSとしてLinuxを選択したと思われる。だが事実上このようなマシンは録画ネットから買うしかないわけで、形式上販売ということにしても、結局はまた同じところに送り返すことになる。
一方でまね きTVが使用するロケフリは、広く市販されている商品で、誰でも購入できる。また、まねきTVがロケフリ購入代行を行なったという事実もなく、本当にユーザーが買った物をまねきTVに送付している。まねきTV側は、この送り状も証拠としてきちんと保管している。
この相違は、サービスの主体がユーザー自身であるという判断材料のひとつになったとなったと思われる。「市販される」ということが、これほど重要な意味を持った事件も珍しいだろう。
もうひとつのポイントは 「システム」である。双方のサービスとも、沢山のマシンに電源を供給し、アンテナ線を分配して接続し、ネットワークアクセスのためにハブやルータを設置している。裁判ではこれら全体のシステムが、総体として1つであるのか、ということが問題となった。
録画ネットの場合は、それぞれのマシンに対して自社製のユーザーインタフェースを導入し、ユーザーの便宜を図った。またユーザーとマシンを一対一で結びつける必要もあることから、自社Webサイトでユーザー認証の手続きを取っていた。さらには動作状況を監視するために監視サーバーを設置し、保守管理をしっかり行なっていた。これが逆に、全体で1つと見なされることになった。

This story will discuss the emergence of a globalized LNG market and the ability of that market to supply the high volumes of LNG that the United State will need to avoid future shortfalls .
Will such a globalized market really come to pass ?
What form will it take ?
What does the current LNG market look like ?
How will the United States become integrated into the expanding LNG trade ?
These are the questions we shall examine here .
As even a casual reading of the story The North American Red Queen : Our Natural Gas Treadmill indicates , the importance of future Liquified Natural Gas ( LNG ) imports to North America can hardly be overstated .
1. The LNG Market  This Moment in History
In the grand scheme of things , the idea is that the globalized LNG market of the future will make natural gas aworldwide .
Newbuild LNG requires huge capital expenditures for liquefaction trains , tankers and regasification terminals .
Heretofore , transporting natural gas has beenconstrained by the existence of pipelines , excepting the robust LNG trade in Eastern Asia .
LNG is now at at inflection point , as shown in
An Inflection Point for the global LNG Market
A 13 % compound annual growth rate ( 2005 to 2010 )
From a presentation by the BG Group ( pdf )
Figure 2  Click to Enlarge
As you can see , the global LNG trade is projected to expand about 150 % by 2015 with a large share of new exports going to the United States .
2. The LNG Market  Past and Present
LNG trading is regional because it takes place in two large separate markets , the west of Suez and the east of Suez .
Asfrom the EIA 's World LNG Market Structure shows , prices & volumes have been historically higher in the Pacific Basin .
Sample prices in the Atlantic and Pacific Basins
LNG prices are usually expressed in U.S. dollars per million
Btu ( MMBtu ) ≅ 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas ( Mcf )
Figure 3  Click to Enlarge
Because the Asian countries have little access to natural gas pipelines and have little or no domestic production , LNG imports have provided the bulk of their natural gas supply .
Three countries in the Pacific Basin - Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan - accounted for 68 percent of global LNG imports in 2002 .
Seven European countries received 28 percent of global imports , while the United States imported the remaining 4 percent .
Japan has long been the world 's largest LNG consumer , importing 2.6 Tcf ( 54.6 million tons ) of LNG in 2002 .
However , the Japanese share of the global LNG trade fell from 66 percent in 1990 to 48 percent in 2002 .
In the United States , the competing fuel is pipeline natural gas , and the benchmark price is either a specified market in long - term contracts or the Henry Hub price for short - term sales .
Importers and exporters involved in U.S. LNG transactions are exposed to a significant level of risk given the high degree of price volatility in U.S. natural gas markets .
Shipments of liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) to Europe are running close to record levels as the continent prepares to meet peak demand in the cold winter months .
Import terminals in Spain , Belgium , Britain and elsewhere are operating at full capacity to take in cargoes attracted by European prices that remain higher than those offered in the US market , though not above levels in Asia .
" All the terminals are full , " an LNG trading manager at a major energy company said .
" European prices have been high since the summer , they are still very high .
I think imports this year will probably be higher than last year . "
" There are some spot cargos coming in , but it 's getting very difficult to find a place to put them ( because of the squeeze on import capacity ) , " he said .
Another industry source said cargos had recently been diverted away from Spain , Europe 's largest importer of LNG , because of a lack of available storage space .
Demand for LNG and prices fluctuate seasonally , particularly in the Atlantic Basin ( Spain , the U.K. , the U.S. ) but also in some Pacific nations like Korea .
As the EIA notes , past EU prices have been linked to competing fuel prices , such as low - sulfur residual fuel oil .
In Asia , prices have been traditionally linked to the price of crude oil .
In the United States , the EIA states that :
Here 's an example of many of these factors at work , published on October 23rd of this year .
Obviously , there are price disparities in the LNG Atlantic Basin market and no global benchmark price exists .
LNG trading has always been dominated by long term contracts and low liquidity .
Despite the rare story about an LNG tanker bound for the U.S. which is diverted to Spain , the spot market is miniscule .
However , there is great flux in both contracts and pricing .
Despite many new players both importers such as India ( Dahej regasification terminal ) and exporters such as Egypt ( Idku liquefaction plant ) entering the market , new contracts , while more flexible than in the past , are still mostly long term deals , though there are now some shorter term ( 1 year ) contracts .
BG Group 's LNG Top to Bottom - The Pure Play Perspective presentation indicates that approximately 12 % of the 2005 LNG trade consisted of short term & spot contracts predominantly the former .
Although one would think that many new players in the LNG market would put downward pressure on price , demand is high and supply is tight it is a sellers market .
For example , China just inked a 25 year , $ 25 billion deal with Petronas ( Malaysia ) for LNG delivery to start in 2009 .
The Australian recently reported on the situation .
Malaysia 's government - owned Petronas has signed a contract to supply Shanghai with liquefied natural gas for 25 years , at the rate of $ US 6.34 ( $ 8.25 ) per million British thermal units [ mmbtu ] .
This is below today 's market price but still more than double the $ US 3.10 the Australia LNG consortium is receiving through its 25 - year contract to supply Dapeng terminal in Guangdong , which started in June .
The only other LNG contract signed by China - all are through the state - owned China National Offshore Oil Corp - is with BP 's Tangguh project in Indonesia 's Papua province , to supply the southern province of Fujian from early 2009 .
The price originally agreed for Tangguh 's LNG was even lower than that from Australia 's North West Shelf : $ US 2.49 / million btu .
It is noteworthy that , unlike in the past , these Asian contract prices areto the crude oil price .
BG Group ( Egyptian LNG ) expects the market tightness to hold until at least 2012 , as shown in
LNG Supply & Demand
Figure 4 -- Click to Enlarge
Supply tightness in the Pacific Basin has been aggravated by declining production in Indonesia the world 's largest LNG supplier and , in the Atlantic Basin , delays in bringing Norway 's Snohvit LNG liquefaction capability onstream .
According to the Simmons & Company report Liquified Natural Gas published in April of 2005 , spot sales will continue to be negligible , but there will be a growing equity trade as shown in Figure 5 .
The LNG Trade Mix  Projected Long-term
Contracts , Equity Positions and Spot Market
Figure 5  Click to Enlarge
Growth in worldwide LNG portfolios and deregulation in European and U.S. LNG import markets have enabled the recent emergence of a revised , " integrated " LNG strategy .
Whereas Japanese LNG markets continue to operate under take - or - pay contracts with regulated utilities as buyers , the U.S. and European markets appear to be evolving on the basis of tolling - style arrangements whereby suppliers of LNG can obtain access to the deregulated natural gas end market by paying an operating fee to the regasification terminal owners and still maintain rights to the gas at the other side of the terminal ...
As an alternative to the tolling arrangement structure , some large integrated players are taking equity ownership interests in new [ regasification ] terminals .
This has became a more viable option in the U.S. following the FERC's Hackberry decision , which set a precedent for closed - access terminal structures , which , unlike rules for pipelines , allow terminal operators to restrict access to imports through their facilities .
Prior to the FERC's Hackberry decision , open access to U.S. LNG regasification terminals was required .
As the Simmons report notes , " ... rather than being forced to operate on a spot basis in the delivery of LNG volumes to the U.S. , and therefore subject to competition - driven price risk , LNG traders can lock - in contractual rights to deliver to a specific terminal or build their own dedicated facility . "
Integrated players like Shell increasingly seek and establish equity trade arrangements .
Royal Dutch
Shell plc has announced two major additions to its global Liquefied Natural Gas ( LNG ) portfolio .
In Qatar , the company has joined forces with Qatar Petroleum ( QP ) in the development of the large scale Qatargas 4 LNG project , while in the United States Shell has agreed to acquire additional capacity at the Elba Island LNG import terminal in Georgia .
Because of the huge capital expenditures for newbuild LNG , long term contracts ( like the China Petronas / Malaysia deal ) or integrated equity arrangements will continue to dominate the LNG market .
As Dave Hughes ( Canadian Geological Survey ) said to the author in personal communication , " Simmons is right on the issue of a spot market for LNG for the near future - nobody spends $ 12 billion on a liquefaction , transport and regasification chain without long term contracts . "
Platts summarizes the current LNG market in an article with the misleading title LNG trade helps foster a global gas market .
Liquefied natural gas is one way of removing price differentials between gas markets but , there are still big regional differences .
A lack of liquidity makes trading the preserve of the asset owners .
This was one of the conclusions drawn at the CWC World LNG Summit in Rome mid October .
So far , the companies making the most noise about LNG trade have been those with the upstream reserves and access to cargoes .
Pure trading outfits on the other hand are kept out by the lack of commodity and capacity at different stages of the supply chain .
This suggests a degree of immaturity where the incumbents control enough to keep out new entrants .
One trader told delegates that what he was primarily concerned with was not prices but volume and churn , and he did not see either of those in the LNG cargo market .
" Traders wo n't touch LNG , it 's a waste of time . "
Another agreed that the world was still a long way away from a fungible LNG market .
" The bid-ask spread in the Atlantic is too wide to guarantee any return unless you have a unique advantage , " he said .
The prices agreed in these cases would not be likely repeatable , and so they would be of little value in establishing a benchmark .
3 . The LNG Market  The Future
The Platts conference report , which is worth reading , reveals just what an unstructured , chaotic mess the LNG markets are at this time .
Right now , integrated equity players with access to large , dependable upstream natural gas supplies and midstream ( liquefaction , tankers ) or downstream ( regasification ) assets have the advantage .
Independent " pure " traders looking for arbitrage opportunities , as they exist in the oil markets , are at a disadvantage .
So , as the anonymous trader said , .
Let us now turn to the future .
The standard story about the future LNG trade is that it will evolve toward the kind of markets that exist for crude oil and other commodities today , with global benchmark prices similar to those set at the Nymex and Brent indices .
Furthermore , this global price smoothingas theory dictates because of the large number of new players coming into the LNG market , especially from the ( Middle East & North Africa ) nations , as shown in
The Evolving LNG Trade  the Atlantic & Pacific
Basins with the Middle East in the Middle
Figure 6  Click to Enlarge
The Petroleum Economist gives us the standard view ( flash website ) .
The world 's dependence on MENA natural gas is set to increase " because that 's where the gas is " [ quoting Willie Sutton ] .
But the MENA nations also benefit from their location midway between the large gas markets of Asia - Pacific to the east , and North America and Europe to the west .
Once consequence of this is that distances to markets are generally large , making liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) an increasingly competitive option when compared with pipeline supply .
In some cases  such as Qatari exports to the US  it is the only feasible option ...
A second consequence is that the increasing contractual flexibility of LNG  not just in the still - small spot market , but also in long - term contracts  means MENA LNG will play an increasing role in the globalization of what are presently regional gas markets .
LNG tankers leaving Qatar , for example , could choose at short notice to go west rather than east , or vice versa .
As the International Energy Agency ( IE ) stresses in a recent review of the world 's natural gas markets : " Middle East LNG , in particular , will link Atlantic and Pacific markets , transmitting price signals between them ...
Increasingly , LNG will end up in places that provide the highest netback . "
The result will be that gas prices in Tokyo and Seoul will increasingly be influenced by what is happening at [ the ] Henry Hub in the US .
It seems impossible to reconcile this view with that of Simmons and the nature of the LNG trade as described just above .
Consider Simmons ' three large barriers to access in the LNG market  quoted from page 4 of their report .
Barrier 1 : Access to reserves .
We estimate that , in order for an LNG facility to return its full capital investment under target conditions , a source gas field , or fields , holding at least 10 Tcf of reserves is typically required .
Barrier 2 : A big balance sheet .
A typical 7.5 mmtpa [ million tons per annum ] LNG project requires approximately $ 6 billion of capital investments , including $ 1.6 billion in upstream capex , $ 2 billion for a liquefaction facility , $ 1.6 billion worth of ships and a $ 0.8 billion regasification facility ( unless another option for a secure long - term market can be found ) .
Barrier 3 : Destination for the gas .
The high degree of capital investment required for the LNG business makes a secure market for the product a strategic imperative .
Historically , this has occurred through direct take - or - pay contracts with end - market consumers ( the prime example being the Japanese utilities ) .
Going forward , we expect that the end market will increasingly come in the form of equity sales into deregulated markets in North America and Europe , whether through tolling arrangements or in some cases through outright ownership of regasification terminals .
In light of these barriers , the strong trend toward long - term or equity LNG contracts ( as shown in Figure 5 above ) now makes sense .
An integrated equity arrangement is not flexible ie .
tending toward spot sales  the whole idea is to control as much of the entire supply chain ( upstream gas field to downstream regasification terminal ) as possible in order to create a secure , long - term source and sales destination for the natural gas .
Without a substantial spot or short - term sales market , it is hard to see how a truly fungible market can ever be achieved .
The standard view  expressed by LNG tankers leaving Qatar , for example , could choose at short notice to go west rather than east , or vice versa  flys in the face of reality .
Furthermore , in a tight LNG market , importers will also want to lock - in the best price they can get by guaranteeing a long - term buyer commitment , as demonstrated by the deal between China and Petronas ( Malaysia ) .
There are two markets for LNG  the Atlantic and Pacific basins  and , most likely , there always will be .
Moreover , Qatari LNG is a long way from almost anywhere .
We can refer to this as the LNG price distance premium , which will be discussed in the section below regarding the United States .
It is 6,480 nautical miles from Qatar to Japan .
To Portugal , it is 3,307 miles .
To the US Gulf Coast , it is 9,687 miles .
India is the clear winner  it is only 1,290 miles away .
( Average distances from Simmons . )
How can there be a benchmark LNG price , even in the Atlantic Basin , if the U.S. Gulf Coast is 6,380 miles farther away from Qatar than Portugal is ?
In conclusion , the LNG market would seem to be sui generis , unlike any other  the standard view is a simplistic analogy .
Newbuild capital expenditures are huge since they involve three separate , expensive components  liquefaction , shipping and regasification as shown in Figure 7 below .
LNG Newbuild Economics  from Simmons
Figure 7  Click to Enlarge
MENA LNG will be sold under long - term contracts or equity arrangements in both the Atlantic & Pacific markets .
The spot market for this new gas will remain small .
The LNG trade will never be fungible in the same way crude oil is .
Let us now turn to the prospects for the United States in the world we have just described .
Integrating LNG Exports into the U.S. Market
If we build it , will they come ?
 paraphrase of a famous quote from a baseball movie .
Let 's review the problem facing the United States as North American natural gas production declines continue going forward .
Figure 8 is from Dave Hughes ' presentation from ASPO - USA .
The LNG Logistics Problem  from Hughes
Figure 8  Click to Enlarge
Hughes estimates that the North America faces natural gas shortfalls of between 4 and 11 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) per year in the future .
As argued in the preceding sections , that new supply will not come from a large LNG spot market .
Rather , the both the U.S. must have long - term contracts or equity deals in place with foreign suppliers like Qatar .
April , 2006
Marking the beginning of the execution phase for two of the world 's largest liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) developments , Qatar Petroleum ( QP ) , ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell plc ( Shell ) bore witness today as H.H. Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al - Thani , Heir Apparent of the State of Qatar laid the foundation stone for the Qatargas 3 and Qatargas 4 projects .
Combined , the projects are expected to generate approximately 2.8 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas , the majority of which is targeted for delivery to the United States ....
Qatargas 4 volumes are intended to flow into natural gas markets in the eastern U.S.
For this purpose , Shell , as a sponsor of Qatargas 4 , has entered into agreements with Southern LNG Inc. and Elba Express Pipeline Company LLC to acquire additional capacity at the Elba Island LNG import terminal as well as in a new natural gas pipeline .
Both projects will be filed with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) for approval in the third quarter of 2006 .
In December , Qatargas 3 executed a sales and purchase agreement with ConocoPhillips for the full train output which will be marketed primarily in the U.S. ConocoPhillips is one of the leading marketers of natural gas in the U.S. and following its acquisition of Burlington Resources , it will become the largest natural gas producer in North America .
ConocoPhillips has taken a 30 % interest in Cheniere Energy 's proposed Freeport LNG project on the Texas Gulf Coast .
Freeport , with a lbn cf/d receiving terminal , is scheduled to start operations in 2007 .
ConocoPhillips will pay plant construcbon costs of up to $ 450 m and plans to use LNG shipments from Qatar , Nigeria and Venezuela , where it has stakes in LNG projects or gas fields .
Some of the Qatargas 3 LNG will be shipped to the new regasification terminal at Freeport , Texas , as we learn here Other agreements are in place .
ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum Progress LNG
Project indicates that LNG from Qatar 's RasGas liquefaction trains 6 & 7 will be " delivered to the target markets , principally the United States " to the Golden Pass receiving terminal in Sabine , Texas .
The terminal is " expected to be 70 percent owned by an affiliate of Qatar Petroleum , with affiliates of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips each owning a share in the balance of the interest in the terminal " .
Thus , some equity arrangements are already in place for LNG exports to the United States .
Read thepart of the Simmons report for more details .
As implied by Figure 7 , the problem is simply this :
Is sufficient LNG going to be imported soon enough to meet U.S. demand in the face of continuing domestic natural gas production declines ?
The Simmons LNG report ( cited link repeated ) predicts that the U.S. will be importing 11 bcfd ( billion cubic feet / day ) by 2015 from the sources shown in Figure 9 .
U.S. LNG Imports by Source ( Bcfd )
Figure 9  Click to Enlarge
If all goes well this is a big if  the U.S. will manage to import 4.015 trillion cubic feet of additional gas supply from LNG by 2015  right at the low end of Hughes ' range .
As Figure 9 indicates , all the supply comes from the Atlantic Basin or the Middle East with the exception of Australia .
It is unclear if the Russian exports will come from Sakhalin II ( Pacific Basin ) or whether the Simmons report is dated , written before the Russian decision to send Shtokman gas from the Barents Sea by pipeline to the EU rather make it available for LNG exports to Europe and the United States .
By far , the largest export shares are from Qatar and Nigeria excluding on - going exports from Trinidad & Tobago .
For all this to work , all the requisite liquefaction trains must be operating in the exporting countries in the envisioned time frame and long - term or equity contracts must be in place .
The Hughes slide ( Figure 8 ) points out the huge build - out necessary to support exports of 11 Tcf to the North America , as well as the NIMBY problem with location of new regasification terminals .
A look at Hughes ' slide # 21 ( link above ) reveals that there is ample new capacity coming on - stream to support imports of 15 bcf into the U.S. by 2015 .
However , almost all of the new receiving terminals are on the Gulf of Mexico coastline .
The NIMBY issues have prevented approval of new terminals on both the East & West coasts .
The Northeast will be partly served by new Canadian receiving terminals such as Bear Head in Nova Scotia .
The great concentration of regasification facilities in the Gulf coast area will require a large build - out of new gas storage in this region as well as alter the U.S. gas distribution network .
A number of other issues ( eg. natural gas energy content and processing ) are covered in the Developing U.S. Market section of the Simmons report .
One final issue to look at is the distance premium as we have termed it in the previous section .
Obviously , North America is a long way from where the gas is , while Europe is closer .
Consider Figure 10 below from Simmons , where you can see that LNG transport is a significant factor in deliveries to the United States .
Figure 10
The Simmons report calculates that the total LNG shipping cost per nautical mile / mmbtu ( cents ) is 0.0133 for tankers holding 138,000 cubic metres of gas and 0.0111 for larger tankers holding 216,000 cubic metres .
Recently , there was an inaugural voyage of Qatari gas to Mexico .
Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Company ( RasGas ) made its first delivery of liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) from the shores of Qatar to Mexico on October 8 , a press release issued by RasGas said .
This historical event followed a spot sale to Shell Western LNG B V by Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Company ( II ) ...
The voyage of 22 days over a distance of 9,915 nautical miles was routed through the Suez Canal and the Straits of Gibraltar to the Terminal de LNG de Altamira , Mexico .
Terminal de LNG de Altamira is the first LNG receiving terminal in Mexico and came into operation only in August of this year ...
The vessel was built in the Samsung Heavy Industries , Korea , and has a cargo capacity of 138,000 [ cubic metres ]
Conclusion
A simple , rough calculation shows that the journey added approximately $ 1.32 / mmbtu to the cost of the gas .
As previously noted , distance is yet another factor that will discourage a world gas price or perhaps even an Atlantic Basin benchmark price .
The more one delves into the future LNG trade , the more complicated the situation looks .
A lot of factors must come together to make much larger globalized markets a reality .
Pertinent LNG issues will be addressed at the 7th Annual LNG Summit : Trials and Tribulations of Integrating LNG in the U.S. Market to be held January 18th & 19th in Houston .
Reading the presentation abstracts gives you a sense of what the LNG industry is worried about .
This report is meant to give some insights into what will happen and needs to happen for the LNG trade to meet expectations , not only in the United States , where domestic production is in exponential decline , but all over the world .

The left image was taken before the explosion .
In the right image , afterward , the pinpoint of light is clearly visible .
Astronomers have detected a new type of cosmic outburst that they can't yet explain .
The event was very close to our galaxy , they said .
The eruption might portend an even brighter event to come , a supernova .
It was spotted by NASA 's Swift telescope and is being monitored by other telescopes around the world as scientists wait to see what will happen .
Neil Gehrels , principal investigator for the Swift mission at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , called the event " totally new , totally unexpected . "
If the eruption indeed precedes a supernova , then it would reach peak brightness in about a week , scientists said .
Experienced backyard astronomers can see the explosion with a telescope by using these coordinates : RA : 03:21:39.71 Dec : +16:52:02.6
The event , detected Feb. 18 , looks something like a gamma-ray burst ( GRB ) , scientists said .
But it is much closer - about 440 million light - years away - than others .
And it lasted about 33 minutes .
Most GRBs are billions of light - years away and last less than a second or just a few seconds .
Other aspects of the newfound eruption were inexplicable , astronomers said .
It was dimmer than most .
Even so , the newly spotted point of light in the sky outshines the entire galaxy in which the event occurred .
" This could be a new kind of burst , or we might be seeing a gamma- ray burst from an entirely different angle , " said Swift scientist John Nousek at Penn State University .
Astronomers do n't fully understand gamma-ray bursts ( GRBs ) .
But they theorize that when one is pointed our way , it appears brighter than when the beams it produces shoot off in other directions .
The explosion has been catalogued as GRB 060218 .
It is the second - closest GRB ever detected .
But it 's not clear if it will ultimately be called one .
Italian researchers using the European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope in Chile found signs in the event 's optical afterglow that it may become a supernova .
The scenario outlined by some researchers is that a very massive star has collapsed into a black hole and then exploded .
If the event is indeed a supernova in the making , scientists may get the first look at one unfolding from start to finish .
The eruption occurred in the constellation Aries .

Jessica Rose , an orthopedic surgery professor at Stanford , could not believe her eyes .
Tai chi master Chen Xiang , sensor balls taped to key body joints , was demonstrating palm , elbow and fist strikes so fast – and with such force – that the sensors kept flying off his body .
And then she glanced at her computer screen , where Chen ’s movements were mirrored by an animated stick figure .
Like a light - footed dancing skeleton , the figure ’s grace was undeniable .
And frightening .
The explosive power of the strikes was stunning – 400 pounds of force generated by Chen ’s body accelerating from 0 mph to 60 mph in 0.28 seconds – faster than any Lamborghini out on the street .
This level of power was a first for her lab .
It ’s also just plain unusual .
In its mainstream form , practiced by millions looking to boost their health , tai chi moves typically are performed in slow motion .
What Rose recorded in her lab this week , for the first time ever , she believes , was a biomechanical document of optimal force generation .
( Some might call it pure chi – a .k.a. energy .
Think “ Star Wars ” : “ May the force be with you . ” )
Chen ’s demonstration , conducted at the Motion and Gait Analysis Laboratory at Lucile Salter Packard Children ’s Hospital , will serve as another example of a human performing at its peak and it will be used by Rose and her colleagues to paint a more detailed picture about how the body moves , and why .
Chen , one of China ’s best martial artists and a revered master in the tai chi style he practices , was in Rose ’s lab purely by happenstance .
A friend of Rose ’s also happens to know the man organizing Chen ’s weeklong Bay Area visit , and he knew immediately that Rose would be eager to bring Chen in .
Not only did Chen oblige , but he also showed charming modesty and humor about the experiment , laughing when those sensor balls went flying and gamely dressing in non-traditional tai chi garb : red lycra leggings and a red cotton T - shirt lettered with the name of the tai chi academy in Beijing where he teaches .
In - depth view
Although Chen ’s performance awed his impromptu audience at Stanford , Rose said , what the recording devices divine will be far more important .
Chen ’s lightning - fast movements will be compared to a computer ’s projections of a human ’s ideal biomechanical movement , as well as those of a tai chi novice , potentially revealing detailed and nuanced information about the heights that the very controlled thought behind tai chi can propel the body to achieve .
Tai chi is a martial art that begins with cultivation of the mind , learning to discard everything except the thought of moving energy within the body , to nourish it and bring it to full health and , if necessary , to defend it .
Various schools of tai chi have developed their own ways of training the body , but the aim is always to keep the joints relaxed to allow a free flow of chi .
What Chen offers , Rose said , is “ an example of a highly refined movement which may be as close as we can get to biomechanically optimal movement patterns . ”
He is also , she added , demonstrating a basic law of motion : force equals mass times acceleration .
“ No one turns mass into force as well as tai chi masters , ” she said .
Chen has perfected the art of putting the entire mass of his body into the impact , accelerating at a rate that makes that force even more extreme .
Golf , dance , tai chi
With Chen as their latest performance model – Stanford researchers have made motion - capture records of a professional golfer and a dancer – researchers can continue to identify which movements are controlled by which parts of the brain – and what role an individual ’s particular set of muscles and bones plays in those movements .
And that , Rose said , will mean improving treatment strategies for people suffering from a wide range of physical limitations , from cerebral palsy to arthritis .
The Motion and Gait Analysis Laboratory is the oldest of several Stanford biomechanical measurement programs working to deconstruct the architecture and chemistry of human movement .
Rose and Stanford pediatric surgeon James Gamble are the authors of “ Human Walking , ” a guidebook to the highly complex mechanisms and influences behind this most basic of human skills .
Some labs are even focused on how to translate the best of human motion into something inhuman .
When Chen ’s visit was confirmed , Rose invited another Stanford professor , Oussama Khatib , the director of the university ’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory .
One of his primary interests is robots .
While many robots look nothing like humans , using the body as a starting point for the construction of humanoid robots takes advantage of our millions of years of evolution - honed design .
And in Chen , Khatib said , “ We have a lot of great data . ”
Of course , motion - capture technology is not new .
Since the 1980s , when cumbersome eyewear was used to create a virtual reality for wearers , the methodology and applications have grown in sophistication and popularity .
Now , motion capture is a basic tool for big - screen special effects , allowing increasingly perfect depictions of human movement , right down to the subtlest of facial expressions .
In its medical application , data gathered through motion capture will soon enable medical students to practice surgery before they ever come near a real patient .
Eventually , researchers hope to build a database that includes every element of human movement , down to the molecules that drive our muscles .
Since Chen ’s lab performance , Rose has added another inquiring mind : Packard pediatric neurologist Terrence Sanger .
He looks not only at movement , but also at how movement is learned .
The result of Chen ’s years of training indicates something special – mysterious , even – about how his particular skills were acquired .
And , Sanger said , “ You want to understand everything . ”
The unrest has been spreading
See the aftermath
Youths burned buildings and more than 500 vehicles in the eighth consecutive night of rioting .
Nearly 80 arrests were made in Paris .
Cars were torched in the eastern city of Dijon , and sporadic unrest broke out in southern and western France .
The unrest was sparked by the deaths of two teenagers of African origin .
Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin has pledged to restore order following criticism of the government 's failure to end violence .
Thursday night 's incidents occurred in several towns to the north - east and west of the capital , including Aulnay - sous - Bois .
Most of the attacks took place in the largely immigrant area of Seine - Saint - Denis , where about 1,300 police had been deployed .
Gangs of attackers
As on previous nights , gangs of youths armed with bricks and sticks roamed the streets of housing estates .
The situation had calmed down at dawn .
In the reported overnight incidents :
A 56 - year - old disabled bus passenger suffers severe burns when a Molotov cocktail is thrown on board in the northern Sevran suburb
Shots are fired at riot police in various parts of Paris , slightly wounding five officers , police say A carpet warehouse in Paris is set alight during the riots
Enlarge Image
A group of officers is targeted near a synagogue in the Seine - Saint - Denis area of Stains , where a primary school is partially burned
Police say 519 vehicles were burned and 78 people held in the Paris region , in the worst night of riots so far
More than 100 firefighters fight a blaze at a carpet warehouse in Aulnay - sous - Bois ; another warehouse is also set alight in Le Blanc Mesnil area
Twenty - seven buses are burned at Trappes depot in Yvelines , west of Paris
Outside Paris , as well as the cars set alight in Dijon , unrest flared in the Rouen area of Normandy and in the Bouches - du - Rhone region near Marseilles in the south .
The unrest began after teenagers Bouna Traore , aged 15 , and Zyed Benna , 17 , were accidentally electrocuted at an electricity sub-station in Clichy - sous - Bois .
Local people say they were fleeing police - a claim the authorities deny .
Inquiries are under way .
' Troublemakers '
Amid reports of a cabinet split on the handling of the riots , Mr de Villepin has held talks with Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy and other ministers , as well as MPs and mayors from affected towns .
Mr Sarkozy had earlier sparked some criticism with hardline comments saying the government would not allow " troublemakers , a bunch of hoodlums , think they can do whatever they want " .
The areas affected are poor , largely immigrant communities with high levels of unemployment .
Muslim leaders have urged politicians to show respect for immigrant communities .
Minister for Social Cohesion Jean - Louis Borloo said France had to acknowledge its failure to deal with anger simmering in poor suburbs for decades .
While there 's already at least one relatively - inexpensive device out there to let you partake in some aerial photography , those not satisfied with ready - made solutions may want to give the OpenSourceQuadroCopter project a look , which ( as its name suggests ) takes a decidedly more hands - on route .
Apparently the result of some 75 developers from around the world , the system is supposedly easy to assemble and , from the looks of it , can be attached to a variety of remote - controlled helicopters .
What 's more , the system can also be outfitted with a range of add - ons , including a GPS module and a parachute that can be automatically - triggered when the copter runs into danger .
While you 'll obviously have to supply some of the components yourself , you can order a kit with some of the key parts for just 25 € , or about $ 34 . [ Via MAKE : blog
A new study from AirMagnet has demonstrated that Wi -Fi signal strength can drop by up to 25 per cent when seasonal decorations are in place .
Shiny baubles can reflect wireless networking signals , while flashing lights generate all sorts of interference .
Sticking to the traditional holly and ivy wo n't do you any good either , as plants are notorious for blocking the 2.4GHz signal Wi-Fi relies upon .
Carrying out a full wireless survey or network analysis might be overkill , but AirMagnet recommends that signal degradation can often be mitigated just by moving decorations away from access points , and remembering that every barrier between access point and user will lead to a weaker signal .
Here at Vulture Central we 're taking no risks .
If it 's a choice between network comms or seasonal cheer , we know were our priorities lie , and bar humbug to anyone who says different .
See you at the pub . ®
I was " very unusual , " according to the customer adviser at the building society ... the fact that my husband and I have no debts , apart from the mortgage .
So unusual , apparently , that she seemed almost unwilling to believe us .
She had asked about store cards and overdrafts , to be met with shaking of heads .
We do n't even have credit cards .
" I could n't manage without mine , " she nodded incredulously .
This attitude seems widespread - especially at Christmas .
For weeks we have been urged to buy , buy , buy - even if it means spending money we do n't have .
After all , does n't everyone overspend a little at Christmas ?
I , however , do n't want to be part of it .
I 'm no Scrooge , but I want a Christmas that is within my means .
I only buy presents for close family - an agreement everyone is happy with .
Our daughter , Niamh , is still too young to demand expensive gifts .
In fact , she 's too young to really grasp that Christmas is coming .
Naturally we want her to enjoy the festive season as much as any other child , but simple presents keep her happiest .
And while , of course , we will buy extra Yuletide treats , we do n't feel it necessary to eat and drink far more than usual .
No credit cards mean it 's easier to stick to our good intentions .
No doubt my husband and I are a little unusual - debt is a way of life for most people , and many accept that a significant part of their income will go towards servicing it .
They also accept that when they want something , they can have it ... and pay later .
The fact that we prefer to save up , or go without , marks us out as slightly different .
We own everything outright , and our belongings do n't become broken or worn out before they 're even paid for .
It is surprising how often we end up feeling as if we have to explain or justify our position , just because it is not the norm .
After my daughter was born I would be asked " When are you going back to work ? "
When I said I was not , the reply came back " Well , of course , if you can afford not to ... you 're lucky , though . "
But this would be said with a puzzled look at my old clothes and older car : presumably if I 'm so well off that I do n't need to work , surely I can afford better ?
I realise that we are lucky compared to some desperately badly - off families , but I must stress that we 're by no means rich - no trust funds , private income or wealthy parents - or even what most would consider well - off .
There is more discreet probing .
Do n't I find that babies are terribly expensive ?
The answer is " no " - what do babies really need that is expensive ?
There are nappies , of course , but they 're not that dear - child benefit more than covers them ( though I do feel a little guilty that I never got round to buying re-usables ) .
Cots and prams cost a bit , true , but they 're one - off expenses .
Babies and toddlers do n't need to wear designer clothes , and we do n't need to buy many toys : friends and relatives are more than happy to offload their older children 's outgrown toys to a good home .
I have bought books for my daughter , but there 's always the library as well .
Other things we happily do without include annual holidays : the occasional holiday is okay , but generally I find them over - rated .
Even before Niamh was born , I worked part - time , so we were used to having a relatively low income .
I have started to work from home , parental duties allowing , but I expect it to take a long time before I am established and therefore making any money worth mentioning , so the frugal lifestyle will carry on for a while .
Another part of this is our allotment - a great money - saver .
The fresh organic fruit and vegetables cost nothing but time and the seeds or seedlings .
We also use some of our produce to make our own wine .
Some assume I will go back to a " proper " job when Niamh starts school , but I plan to home - educate , partly because I 'm unhappy exposing her to the materialistic attitudes that prevail , even among very young children .
Although it is occasionally a little isolating to be so out of kilter with our contemporaries , I accept it : I 've made my choices , and I do n't want to judge the choices of others .
I do believe , however , that some people are prevented from recognising all the choices open to them .
Some of the parents I meet would , in theory , like to make a few material sacrifices for more time with their children , but have become too firmly enmeshed in the consumer culture : magazines , television , even their own friends and relatives can entice them , in so many ways , into believing they really need that new handbag , or sofa , or car .
Our lifestyle is often more reminiscent of the 1950s than the 2000s , but that 's not to say that we do n't have a decent standard of living .
We 're warm , well - housed and well - fed .
And when Christmas is over , we wo n't be facing a pile of credit card bills on the doormat .

Prosecutors say the national anthem should not be ridiculed
The offending loo was the creation of two artists and was on display at the Bolzano Museum of Modern Art .
Prosecutors say the Fratelli d'Italia anthem is a national emblem which should be protected and should never be open to ridicule .
A judgement is expected to be made later this week .
Who owns the national anthem ?
And is it unpatriotic to play it in a context in which it could be ridiculed ?
Those are the questions for the court in Bolzano .
Flash in the pan ?
Defence barristers for the museum argue that while the anthem does have patriotic and sentimental value , it is not a national symbol .
The prosecution on the other hand argue the symbolism of playing the anthem while flushing a toilet is an offence to the nation and they have put forward a robust case .
They point to a decree issued this year by the former government of Silvio Berlusconi which defined the national anthem as an emblem and the property of the state .
A judgement will be made later this week .
Arguments may then begin over whether this marks a precedent or whether it is just a flash in the pan .
I have previously admired the Ruby language , albeit from a distance , and been impressed by the vigor of the Rails community .
In the last week I have written a few hundred lines of Ruby code that actually do something useful and I ’ll probably release ( come see it at OSCON ) ; so now I ’m somewhat better educated .
What happened was , I got a paper accepted at OSCON , and since that “ S ” stands for “ Source ” I thought it would be lame to get up on stage without some , and decided that an inflexible deadline would be the right way to overcome my laziness and adult - ADD and actually learn something .
So if you come to my talk , you ’re going to see some ( I hope ) entertaining Ruby hackery , with an unusual twist , in a good cause .
What ’s Good · I ’ll jump to the conclusion first .
For people like me , who are proficient in Perl and Java , Ruby is remarkably , perhaps irresistibly , attractive .
Over the last week I ’ve got an unreasonable amount of work done in a ridiculously short period of time , with lots of interruptions , in a language I previously did n’t know .
It ’s intuitive enough that I ’ve often found myself guessing at a syntax or a method or a usage and getting it right first time .
Maybe the single biggest advantage is readability .
Once you ’ve got over the hump of the block / yield idiom , I find that a chunk of Ruby code shouts its meaning out louder and clearer than any other language .
Anything that increases maintainability is a pearl beyond price .
In theory , Python ought to do better , lacking all those silly end statements cluttering up the screen .
But in practice , when I look at Python code I find my eyes distracted by a barrage of underscores and double - quote marks .
Typography is an important component of human communication , and Ruby ’s , on balance , is cleaner .
As for Java ; I ’ve always found it readable , and while there is too much boilerplate , at least the superfluous delimiters are just a character apiece .
But because Ruby does so much more with each statement , you can get more pieces of the puzzle in the little bit of the screen that you can look at and think about comfortably .
This is just one of the many reasons why fewer - lines - of - code is a Really Important Virtue .
Anyhow , I ’ve been programming in C and Java for a quarter - century and I find Ruby easier to read , only a week in .
( Well , except for some of _why ’s code . )
Also , it does n’t take a lot of study before you ’re saving lines of code ; I ’ve already written about Ruby ’s low barrier to entry .
Here ’s another virtue that I ’ve observed but ca n’t explain .
Something about Ruby results in me writing little teeny methods ; and when I write a loop that threatens to spill out of a screen I just know that the language probably provides a better way to do it .
( It ’s not just a virtue of dynamic languages ; the Perl code that deals with an image reference in ongoing spills across more screenfuls than I want to admit . )
Of course , a language ’s culture is often more important than all that technical crap .
I ’ve found the ruby - talk mailing list to be a fount of wisdom and friendly to ignorant newbies too .
IRB is seriously wonderful .
I have to wonder heretically why IRB and Ruby are different programs , but that seems to be Just The Way It Is .
If you ’re new to IRB , learn to use the -r option to load up a class or two and then poke away at methods .
What ’s Mixed · Some things about Ruby are troubling me , they could be a lot better but they could be a lot worse too .
I guess the leading candidate is documentation .
I ’ve previously written that I think the Pickaxe book is way better than average .
It ’s approximately as good as the Camel book as a reference , and quite a bit better as a tutorial ; I ca n’t compare it to Learning Perl because I already knew perl before I discovered that book .
A few days and a few hundred lines of production - plausible code in , my Pickaxe is looking shopworn .
And , by the way , I repeat my assertion that several of the examples used to illustrate language features also illustrate horrible programming practice .
Online , Ruby has ri , which is nowhere near as good as either perldoc or the practice of right - clicking on anything in a NetBeans window and saying “ Show Javadocs ” ( I assume Eclipse has the equivalent ) .
On the other hand , there ’s the Ruby - Doc.org Web site , which is incomplete but useful .
Here ’s why : for every method in every class , there ’s a View source button , and as I ’ve already remarked , Ruby source is unusually readable , and at the end of the day the source is the Ultimate Truth about what the software really does .
So , on balance , it ’s pretty good .
Here ’s an example of an important method that ’s completely undocumented but the source tells you what you need to know .
What ’s Lame · Damn , I miss my IDE .
I am proficient in two IDEs , Emacs and NetBeans , and neither of them does auto - complete on my Ruby code .
It is deeply wrong when characters that could in principle be supplied by a computer must be typed by a human , and deeply wrong when there ’s an obvious syntax error in your code and your editor does n’t let you know .
I gather that both Eclipse and TextMate can be made to be smart about Ruby .
I ’d really like to avoid having to learn a new editor .
Sigh .
Anyone in Prague listening ?
Ruby has a kind of stand - offish attitude towards two of my favorite pieces of infrastructure , XML and Unicode .
REXML provides a nice API , but , as Sam Ruby discovered , has big - enough holes that you ca n’t point it at Arbitrary Internet XML and hope for good results .
I ’m still learning about the Ruby / Unicode issues , but for the moment , suffice it to say that the most advanced Ruby regex technology does n’t do Unicode properties .
Blecch .
Finally , a minor , almost a footnote , issue .
I miss polymorphism .
In particular , I miss polymorphic constructors .
Sometimes you make pancakes by taking them out of the freezer and thawing them .
Sometimes you use baking power , flour , and eggs .
Sometimes you use a mix ( and there are some excellent pancake mixes available at your local organic - food retailer ) .
Software ’s like that , too .
I find Ruby ’s argument lists ( required args , optional args , an array , &block ) kind of ad - hoc and kludgey .
But if you embrace the virtues of duck typing ( and I do ) , I guess you pay a price in polymorphism and that ’s How Life Is .
Conclusions ·
See above .
But , now that I ’m getting comfy with Ruby , I ’m wondering why I need to use any frameworks at all for my comment system .
Templates , ORM , MVC ; bah , who needs ’em ?

Washington
AFTER the attacks of Sept. 11 , President Bush forcefully argued that it was every country ’s duty to fight international terrorism .
He made the case that sponsoring terrorism or simply looking the other way when it happened were equivalent acts , and the United States would stand for neither .
But holes have started appearing in that principle , courtesy of a single Venezuelan terrorist , released this week from a New Mexico prison on bail .
In early 2005 , Luis Posada Carriles , a Venezuelan with a long history of violent attacks in Latin America , sneaked into the United States and was soon arrested .
Mr. Posada had escaped from a Venezuelan prison while awaiting trial in the bombing of a Cuban airliner in 1976 that killed 73 people , including all 24 members of Cuba ’s youth fencing team and several Guyanese medical students .
This was the deadliest attack on a civilian airliner in the Western Hemisphere in history — until 9/11 .
Upon Mr. Posada ’s capture , the government of President Hugo Chávez demanded his extradition .
But the Bush administration has refused to extradite Mr. Posada to Venezuela or Cuba , claiming that it fears he will be tortured in those countries .
In fact , Washington ’s reluctance is more likely linked to Mr. Posada ’s history as a Central Intelligence Agency operative and a darling of extremist sectors of the powerful Cuban - American community in Florida ( he tried to assassinate Fidel Castro with C - 4 explosives placed in an auditorium packed with students in Panama in 2000 ) .
Twenty - two months have passed since Venezuela formally asked for his extradition , offering 2,000 pages of documentary evidence to substantiate its claim , yet the State Department has not even acknowledged receiving the request .
Nor has Mr. Posada been charged with the 1976 attack , even though declassified Central Intelligence Agency documents indicate that his role has long been accepted as fact .
Instead , he faces charges of immigration fraud , a travesty that could be equaled only by charging Osama bin Laden with entering and leaving Pakistan without a visa .
Finally , Mr. Posada was released on bail on Thursday , even though he is an obvious flight risk and a violent terrorist .

Dumbledore ' definitely ' dead , says Rowling

harry potter book 7 , dumbledore dead , harry potter 7 , jk rowling
Author JK
Rowling explicitly clarified tonight on her final appearance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City that Dumbledore is " definitely " dead .
» UPDATE : Transcripts of both evenings are now available .
She , along with Stephen King and John Irving , hosted another 6,000 people as they read from their books to raise money for charity .
Rowling surprised fans with several tantalizing tidbits about the finale of her popular Harry Potter series .
While the authors all read from the same passages of their books as last night , their introductions were handled by different surprise celebrities .
Actor - director Tim Robbins ( who starred in The Shawshank Redemption ) introduced King and Stanley Tucci welcomed Irving .
Rowling was brought on stage ( again to standing ovation ) by Kathy Bates , who proclaimed that the author took kids to places " Google does not go , " describing the effect Rowling 's books have had in shaping an entire generation of digital - age kids .
At first fearful of the prospect of seeing the Potter books be made into the very digital creations they were meant to draw children away from ( at the same time ruining imagination with special effects ) , Bates said fans " faithfully returned to the books " after seeing their incarnations light up the silver screen , and that Rowling had created " readers for life . "
One audience member greeted Jo by yelling " Do n't kill Harry , " to which Jo responded : " Oh , no pressure then . "
Tonight 's audience was treated with much more informative and revealing answers than yesterday .
Here are a few highlights ( again , paraphrased ) :
If you could bring one of your characters to life -- other than Harry -- who would it be ?
Hagrid .
We all want a Hagrid in our lives .
Hagrid .
We all want a Hagrid in our lives .
( Question about Aunt Petunia 's potential to love Harry ) : I will say this ...
There 's a little more to Aunt Petunia than meets the eye .
I will say this ...
There 's a little more to Aunt Petunia than meets the eye .
( Question about upcoming deaths ) :
You should n't expect Dumbledore to pull a Gandalf .
I need to be more explicit : Dumbledore is definitely dead .
I know there 's an entire site out there called DumbledoreIsNotDead.com , and I 'm sorry they 're not going to like this answer .
You should n't expect Dumbledore to pull a Gandalf .
I need to be more explicit : Dumbledore is definitely dead .
I know there 's an entire site out there called DumbledoreIsNotDead.com , and I 'm sorry they 're not going to like this answer .
If you could host five of your own characters for dinner , who would they be ?
Harry , Ron , and Hermione ...
[ Rowling pauses ; thinks about a different character who 's dead but does not say his / her name .
King interjects : " they could be dead " ] .
Dumbledore .... [ another pause ] .
Hagrid .
Rowling later revealed that while she thought she had settled on a title for book 7 , a new one occurred to her in the shower this afternoon .
She declined to elaborate .
She also suggested there were to be plot twists in book 7 that she did n't think anyone has already or could possibly guess about .
Stephen King , reponding to a question about what he is afraid of , said : " When I picked up the Harry Potter books , I was surprised at the depth of the deatheaters . "
To which Rowling replied tauntingly : " I scared Stephen King . "

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday April 20 2007
In the article below , we should have written Mary , not Marie , Celeste .
This has been corrected .
When John Chapple , one of London 's largest keepers of honeybees , opened his 40 hives after the winter , he was shocked : 23 were empty , seven contained dead bees , and only 10 were unaffected by what seemed to be a mystery plague .
Beekeepers are used to diseases sweeping through their colonies , and , nationally , nearly one in seven colonies dies naturally each winter .
But this seemed very different to Mr Chapple , who is head of the London Beekeepers Association and has 20 years ' experience with the insects and their diseases .
" The problem was that most of the bees had just disappeared .
It was like the Mary Celeste .
There was no chance they had been stolen , " he said yesterday .
" The ones that were left did not seem to have been attacked by varroa [ the tiny parasitical mite that beekeepers have learned to live with since it arrived from Asia 15 years ago ] .
I really do not know what happened " .
Mr Chapple 's experience has chimed with other beekeepers .
" Many colleagues and bee clubs tell me that they are experiencing something similar .
The Pinner and Ruislip beekeepers ' group told me only this morning that they have lost 50 % to 75 % of their bees .
I do n't know what is happening , but the bees are just going , " he said .
Many British beekeepers fear they are witnessing the start of an alarming phenomenon which is sweeping the US and Europe .
Colony collapse disorder ( CCD ) is possibly the most serious disease yet faced by bees .
According to the national bee unit , a branch of the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs , its " symptoms appear to be the total collapse of bee colonies , with a complete absence of bees or only a few remaining in the hive " .
The unit says no one has any idea what is causing CCD .
Theories in the US , where 24 states are affected and losses of 50 % to 90 % of colonies are being reported , include environmental stresses , malnutrition , unknown pathogens , the use of antibiotics , mites , pesticides and genetically modified crops .
Because bees pollinate millions of hectares of fruit trees and crops , the implications for agriculture are enormous .
" Approximately 40 % of my 2,000 colonies are currently dead and this is the greatest winter mortality I have ever experienced , " Gene Brandi , a member of the California State Beekeepers Association , told the US Congress recently .
In Spain , thousands of colonies are said to have been lost , and up to 40 % of Swiss bees are reported to have disappeared or died in the past year .
Heavy losses have also been reported in Portugal , Italy and Greece .
Government bee inspectors met yesterday , but Mike Brown , head of the national bee unit based in York , reported no signs of CCD in Britain .
" There is no evidence in the UK right now of colony collapse disorder , " he said in a statement .
" The majority of inspectors said that they can put the current mortalities in honeybee populations around the UK down to varroa or varroasis . "
" I just do n't know where they get their information , " said Mr Chapple .
" They took away some of my bees but I have heard nothing .
All I know that something is very wrong with our bees . "
Updated Netizens have reacted with a mixture of horror and disbelief to a story which recently appeared on Galway First entitled " Lonely man brought donkey to hotel room , court told " .
We say recently , because the stampede of surfers rushing down to check the outrage for themselves appears to have brought down galwayfirst.ie .
No matter .
Here 's a handy grab of the orginal story , and the full text below :
A man who was found dressed in latex and handcuffs brought a donkey to his room in a Galway city centre hotel , because he was advised " to get out and meet people , " the local court heard last week .
Thomas Aloysius McCarney , with an address in south Galway , was charged with cruelty to animals , lewd and obscene behaviour , and with being a danger to himself when he appeared before the court on Friday .
He was also charged with damage to a mini-bar in the room , but this charge was later dropped when the defendant said that it was the donkey who caused that damage .
Solicitor for the accused Ms Sharon Fitzhenry said that her client had been through a difficult time lately and that his wife had left him and that his life had become increasingly lonely .
" Mr McCarney has been attending counselling at which he was told that he would be advised to get out and meet people and do interesting things .
It was this advice that saw him book into the city centre hotel with a donkey , " she said .
She added that Mr McCarney also suffered from a fixation with the Shrek movies and could constantly be heard at work talking to himself saying things like " Is n't that right , Donkey ? "
Supt John McBrearty told the court that Mr McCarney who had signed in as " Mr Shrek " had told hotel staff that the donkey was a family pet and that this was believed by the hotel receptionist who the supt said was " young and had n't great English . "
Receptionist Irina Legova said that Mr McCarney had told her that the donkey was a breed of " super rabbit " which he was bringing to a pet fair in the city .
The court was told that the donkey went berserk in the middle of the night and ran amok in the hotel corridor , forcing hotel staff to call the gardai .
McCarney was found in the room wearing a latex suit and handcuffs , the key to which the donkey is believed to have swallowed .
He was removed to Mill St station after which it is said he was the subject of much mirth among the lads next door in The Galway Arms .
He was fined € 2,000 for bringing the donkey to the room under the Unlawful Accommodation of Donkeys Act 1837 .
Other charges were dropped due to lack of evidence .
Astounding .
We emailed Galway First to request confirmation of McCarney 's fine and to ask for Ms Legova 's phone number .
The editorial team has not yet replied . ®
Update
We 're obliged to Galway First 's Keith Lynch for getting back to us this afternoon .
Here 's his response :
Sadly Ms Legova has now gone into hiding following the incident .
The man at the centre of the case , Mr McCarney was heavily fined and is rumoured to now be bankrupt .
But , most importantly , we have highlighted a serious issues .
Donkey crimes like this are all too common in Ireland 's west .
The gardaí have intensified their efforts to stop this horrible abuse .
We were just glad we could bring it to the people .
March 4 , 2007  --
This week , the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case brought by a group of atheists who claim the Bush administration 's Office of Faith - Based and Community Initiatives violates the separation of church and state .
It 's just one example of how atheists are becoming increasingly assertive -- arguing not only that religion is false , but also a threat to civilization .
Outside the court , atheists and people of faith squared off .
Inside , the Freedom From Religion Foundation made its case against the president 's pet program .
The foundation 's co-president , Dan Barker , was a fundamentalist preacher for 19 years .
Now , he 's preaching from a different text -- specifically , " separation of church and state , and reason and kindness in place of superstition and ideologies . "
But Barker and his wife , Annie Laurie Gaylor , who is also the foundation 's co-president , said the problem is bigger than the Bush administration and its faith - based initiatives .
They see a world being torn apart by religious fundamentalists of all stripes .
" [ Religion is ] the source of the greatest violence in the world , " Gaylor said .
" More people have been killed in the world for religion over any other reason . "
That atheist argument seems to resonating .
There 's an atheist Internet recruiting campaign , atheist summer camps and several bestselling books -- including " Letter to a Christian Nation " by Sam Harris .
Harris claims religion is nothing less than a global threat .
" We have a world that has been shattered , quite unnecessarily , by competing religious beliefs , " Harris said .
" We have Christians against Muslims against Jews .
They 're making incompatible claims on real estate in the Middle East as though God were some kind of omniscient real estate broker parsing out parcels of land to his chosen flock .
People are literally dying over ancient literature . "
Perhaps not surprisingly , people of faith do n't agree with the argument that faith is wrong or dangerous .
" I understand that people who claim certain religious beliefs have done terrible things throughout history , " said Randall Baumer , professor of American religious history at Columbia University .
" I think the challenge is for people of faith to be true to the principles of the faith .
I think the challenge is coming back and reclaiming the real principles of the faith , so that we act decently toward one another . "
While Ballmer agrees atheists have every right to their own beliefs -- or lack thereof -- he feels these new atheists have something in common with the fundamentalists they oppose .
" We talk about Islamic fundamentalists ; we talk about Christian fundamentalists , " Ballmer said .
" I happen to think there are also secular fundamentalists out there , people who have no tolerance whatsoever for religion or faith , and in some ways their tactics and their arguments are just , to me , just as offensive as religious fundamentalists . "
Atheists who envision a world without religion may have a while to wait .
While polls show that the percentage of Americans who say they 're not part of an organized religion has grown from 8 to 14 percent , only two percent of Americans identify themselves as atheist or agnostic .
One Evangelical minister called the atheist movement , " a firecracker going off in the forest . "
Barker clearly thinks that firecracker has potential .
" If it 's a dry forest , it can cause quite a conflagration there , ca n't it ?
There can be a tipping point in any society where people say enough is enough , " he said .
" And if enough atheists and agnostics speak out and that firecracker goes off , it can cause quite a sensation . "

Phil Patton 's April 1 , 2007 New York
Times story absolutely delighted me , offering my first encounters ever with words like " jounce , " " strake " and " turn - under , " among many others .
Here 's the article .
Never say dashboard , not if you want people at the auto show to think you know what you are talking about .
Say I.P. , for instrument panel , as designers do .
Dropping in a mention of the greenhouse or the beltline is pretty easy , but you will really get points with casual references to A- , B- , and C - pillars , the order of the roof supports arranged from the windshield , whose base is called the cowl , to the rear window , or backlight .
You might say , “ That fat C - pillar would make it impossible to parallel park . ”
Every profession has its lingo .
A list of common terms — and a few of the most colorful ones — can come in handy .
With cars , words and metal share territory : each brand ’s vocabulary of shapes is collectively known as its design language .
The beltline divides the greenhouse , or glassed - in upper body , from the portion that extends down from the window sills .
Equally important is the A - line , said Michael Castiglione , principal exterior designer at DaimlerChrysler ’s Pacifica studio in Carlsbad , Calif .
The A - line runs the length of the body from headlight to taillight , tracing the car ’s silhouette .
The car may also have a character line , a crease formed in the sheet metal of the sides .
Vehicles are said to have styling cues that prompt viewers to recognize models by their resemblance to other family members — a brand ’s characteristic shapes and flourishes , the form of its grille or the arc of the roofline .
Cumulatively , they make up the D.R.G. , or down - the - road graphic of a car , the visual signature of a quickly glimpsed vehicle that should make it recognizable as a Cadillac or a Ford .
At the extreme , think Volkswagen New Beetle .
D.R.G. is not to be confused with D.L.O. , for daylight opening , the total area of the window glass .
The angle of the windshield is known as its rake — an extreme tilt is said to be fast — while the inward angle of the side greenhouse windows is called the tumblehome .
The body section below the base of the door , or rocker panel , is treated with a varying degree of turn - under , which Chris Chapman of BMW ’s Designworks studio in Newbury Park , Calif. , defines as the shape of the panel as it curves inward at the lower edge .
The front face of a car is visually grounded in the lower fascia or valance , typically made of plastic these days .
Stance is critical to the character a car projects , and its aggressiveness is frequently noted by designers in their presentations at new - model unveilings .
The term refers to the way the body sits on the wheels , with energy — or not .
Robert Boniface , director of advanced design for General Motors , recently worked on the Chevrolet Volt and Camaro show cars .
He said that “ stance has to do with the relative visual stability or instability of a particular design . ”
Cars with good stance are often referred to as being planted ; small wheels and a wide upper body give a car a poor stance .
Being planted lends a sense of sure - footedness to the design .
Too high a stance can suggest standing on tiptoe , a tentative look .
One critical element , designers said , is the axle - to - dash ratio , the proportion between the front wheel and the cowl ( which is the base of the windshield ) .
It helps to define the visual personality of the car .
Another important relationship , according to Bryan Thompson , a car designer at the Nissan Design America studio in La Jolla , Calif. , is that between glass and body .
“ A vehicle whose body is relatively thick compared to the amount of glass is called chunky , ” he said .
The proportion between wheel and body sizes is important in lending a vehicle its visual personality .
“ Wheel - to - body is the relationship of the wheel - tire plane to the sheet metal wheel opening , ” Mr. Thompson said .
“ Wheels that are flush to the body are desirable .
Wheels that are well inboard of the sheet metal plane are buried .
Vehicles with buried wheels are called overbodied . ”
At its extreme , an overbodied car has the look of a parade float , with the body visually overpowering the wheels , Mr. Thompson said .
The distinctive “ bathtub ” Nashes of the early 1950s suffered this trait .
There is also what is called the roller skate effect , where the wheels and tires are too small for the body .
( Volkswagens of the 1980s seemed to have especially small wheels proportionally , and fell prey to this phenomenon . )
Huge wheels of 20 , 22 or 23 inches , by contrast , make a vehicle look tough .
The space between wheel and surrounding fender or wheel well suggests the jounce of the car .
The intervening space between tire and wheel well is sometimes called the dead cat hole , according to Peter Davis , director of interior design for global compact utility vehicles at G.M .
More colorful and less formal terms come in handy in the studio .
Mr Davis supplied rat holes , which , he said , were the “ small unwanted , usually triangular holes that result from parts coming together . ”
Now that designers often move around the globe , their language has become more eclectic .
Earlier in his career , Mr. Davis worked in Europe for Fiat and G.M.
In Germany , he learned gummidingers , a name for rubber thingamajigs that have no name .
Mr. Davis defined the British - sounding mucketts as “ complicated rubber moldings that hide nasty window - door frame areas or direct water drips to appropriate places . ”
“ In Italy , ” he said , “ what we call the plenum , the area at the base of the windshield where the wipers sit and run off is directed is called the vasca di pesce , or fish bowl . ”
Companies have their own phrase books .
At BMW , a crease or body line on the side of a car is a zicke , Mr. Chapman said .
For New Yorkers , Mr. Chapman noted that the often - used Hofmeister Knick , referring to the traditional dogleg shape at the base of the C - pillar of BMWs , “ is pronounced ka -nic , not like the basketball team . ”
The shape is named for Wilhelm Hofmeister , a BMW designer in the 1960s ; knick is German for fold or crease .
A line can be dead or sweet .
To sweeten a line , Mr. Thompson of Nissan said , a designer might give a crease or chamfer a lead - in to enliven a line that is otherwise static or dead .
“ To lead - in means to construct lines or surfaces in a less geometric manner , with a little more grace , ” he said .
William Chergosky , project chief designer at Toyota ’s Calty design studio in Newport Beach , Calif. , once worked at Chrysler with Bryan Nesbitt , who designed the PT Cruiser and is now head of G.M. ’s European studio .
“ We had a term we used together , ” Mr. Chergosky said .
“ M.B.G. — more better good , which would be scrawled on a drawing or a clay model . ”
It meant , Mr. Chergosky added : “ This pleases me .
Do more of it . ”
The investigation into the kidnapping of Natascha Kampusch has been complicated by the discovery of an obsolete computer in the house where she was held , Austrian police said today .
Officers have been surprised to find that the kidnapper , Wolfgang Priklopil , a communications technician , appeared to have relied exclusively on a Commodore 64 .
The beige - coloured machine was popular in the 1980s but is now considered an antique , though some electronic dance acts still use it and it has a cult following among some fans of retro computers .
It was hoped that the computer might contain information which might shed more light on the decision of Priklopil , 44 , to snatch Ms Kampusch , when she was aged 10 , in March 1998 .
However , Major General Gerhard Lang of the Federal Criminal Investigations Bureau , told reporters the computer would complicate investigators ' efforts to transfer files for closer examination .
There are emulators available which can make a modern PC capable of running Commodore 64 programmes but Maj Gen Lang said it would be difficult to transmit the data from Priklopil 's machine to a modern computer " without loss " .
Priklopil killed himself by jumping in front of a train within hours of the escape of Ms Kampusch , now aged 18 , on August 23 this year .
He had mostly kept her in a tiny , secret , windowless room under his garage at his house , in suburban Strasshof , just north - east of Vienna .
Police have been digging pits and using long probes to poke around the property , to ensure the house and garden do not conceal any other secret underground cells .
So far , none have been found , Maj Gen Lang said , adding that there were no plans to question Ms Kampusch about her ordeal any further .
Austrians have been captivated by the story , not least because Ms Kampusch has said she mourned the man who captured her , and some experts believe she is displaying signs of Stockholm syndrome , in which captives identify with captors .
A huge audience is expected to watch Ms Kampusch 's first television interview , which was being recorded today and will be broadcast tomorrow evening by public broadcaster ORF .
So far , the Austrian public , hungry for details , has been shown only photos taken before her kidnapping in 1998 , or computer - generated likenesses of what she might look like now .
However , people hoping for a glimpse of Ms Kampusch might be disappointed : organisers said she would appear behind a screen in silhouette or , at most , in camera angles taken from behind or over her shoulder to respect her privacy .
ORF also said it would not ask Ms Kampusch anything " intimate , " steering clear of questions about whether her captor sexually abused her .
Ms Kampusch has been besieged by hundreds of requests for interviews since she escaped two weeks ago , but so far she has agreed to grant only three : the one to ORF , another to the mass - circulation daily Kronen Zeitung , and a third to the weekly magazine News .
Ms Kampusch has a media adviser , Dieter Ecker , who said : " For Natascha Kampusch , it was natural that the Austrian people - who have feared for her life for eight years and have celebrated her escape - should get the details first . "
Christoph Feurstein , the ORF journalist conducting the interview , said : " It 's entirely up to her to decide whether to show her face . "
The station said it did not pay for the interview but announced today that it had set up a telephone hotline for Austrians to pledge cash donations to Ms Kampusch .
Building Marble Machine 2
I had n't actually planned on building a second marble machine , but in March 2000 I had an idea for building a better marble elevating device , plus I had enough time on my hand to actually build a machine using this principle .
And this is the machine I built ...
What inspired me to play with building a marble machine again was the idea for a marble elevating wheel , which would be very unlikely to jam .
Experimenting with wheels I started experimenting by cutting a circular piece of plywood , and drilling 4 holes into it at a slight angle .
This I temporarily jigged up with some blocks of wood , and started turning it to see how well it would pick up marbles .
The whole thing turned out to work very well .
The wheel I had cut only had a 25 cm diameter , which would not provide enough head ( elevation change ) to allow the marbles to do much on the way back down .
Rather than make a much bigger wheel , I figured I should use a second wheel to elevate the marbles even further .
This would be more visually appealing than one big wheel .
The challenge with two wheels was how to drive both wheels .
At first I wanted to just cut a groove in the circumference of the wheels and use an O - ring style belt to drive them both , but I could n't figure out where to find that kind of belt .
The next idea was to just cut gear teeth into the wheels .
This is a lot of work , but more visually appealing than a belt .
Visual appeal is very important , as the marble machine , after all , has no real use other than entertainment .
Making the gears I drilled more holes into my initial experiment wheel , and then made a second wheel of exactly the same diameter .
I did n't have another piece of plywood of the right thickness around , so I used thinner plywood , and then glued some pieces of wood onto it to bring it to the right thickness .
I made both wheels to have exactly 31 inches circumference , then wrapped a non rigid tape measure around the edge and put pencil marks every 1 / 4 inch to divide up the circle ( nowadays , I 'd use my gear template generator ) .
Next I cut out the space between every other set of 1/4 " pencil marks with a bandsaw .
Once I had the two large gears cut and more holes drilled into them , I jigged up everything with some roughly cut pieces of wood to guide the marbles between the wheels .
Everything worked nicely .
The next thing I needed was an actual drive gear .
The drive gear had to be much smaller , and on account of that would be stressed a bit more , so I inset the teeth into the plywood , rather than just using the randomly grained rough plywood edges .
I cut a plywood circle to the minor diameter of the gear .
Next I jigged something up to cut the slots on my table saw .
The whole jig was mounted on my crosscut gadget , which slides in the T - slot .
I used two cheap 7 1/2 " skillsaw blades stacked as a poor man 's dado blade for this purpose .
Then I cut some hardwood to the exact thickness of the slots , cut it into small squares , and pressed the individual pieces into the slots of the gar .
Then I rounded the edges of the teeth a bit with a knife , and my drive gear was complete .
Because the teeth all have the grain pointing outwards along them , I was able to make them thinner without making them too weak .
This increases slack in how the drive gear meshes with the main gears but makes it easier to get it to turn without jamming .
The inset teeth make for some very cool looking gears .
I subsequently built a Gear cutting jig to help index the angles by precise amounts for cutting wood gears .
Nowadays , I cut most of my gears out of Baltic birch plywood on a bandsaw , with templates from my gear template generator
Marble tracks for the elevating system Shaping the marble guides to allow the marbles to roll into the holes in the wheels took some optimization .
I made the marble guides curved to follow the path of the circle that the holes follow at the bottom .
This gives the marbles more opportunities to just roll into a hole .
To get the marbles to roll into the holes at the bottom , and out of the holes at the top , I slanted all the holes towards the center .
This means once the marbles are more than halfway up , the holes slant slightly down .
So it 's necessary to block the marbles from rolling out past the halfway point .
With the bottom wheel turning counterclockwise , and the top wheel turning clockwise , the marbles coming out of the bottom wheel are already moving towards the top wheel and neatly slide into the holes in that wheel .
With the marbles already moving when they leave the bottom wheel , I did n't need much of a slope in the marble track between the wheels .
The ' spout ' at the top of the assembly is to guide the marbles onto descent paths that I had not built yet when the photo was taken .
Randomized descent path distributors
My first marble machine was based on logic .
My thinking as I built it had been to invent lots of deterministic marble logic elements , and perhaps to show that it would theoretically be possible to build a marble operated computer .
The approach to this marble machine was more of one of complete chaos .
I had done logic , now I wanted to try something else .
The wheel based elevating system could deliver marbles at such a high ' clock rate ' that it would overwhelm most marble logic elements .
I still used a flipflop to divide the marbles into two streams ( see image at left ) .
This flipflop turns out to be a little overwhelmed in that it can't switch as fast as the marbles arrive .
Nevertheless , it diverts roughly equal numbers of marbles in either direction , which is all that I really cared about for on this machine .
To the left is a round - ish bowl that the marbles roll round and round in , until they gradually work their way towards the center and randomly enter one of the three holes .
The bowl does n't make much noise , but it does look quite interesting visually especially when there are ten marbles going around it at the same time .
When the machine is running at capacity , and one stops cranking , it takes nearly 10 seconds for all the marbles to clear the bowl .
The board of nails on the right allows marbles to bounce randomly against the nails .
I was n't sure if this would create much of a random distribution , but driving some nails into a board and trying it showed that this approach yielded a lot of randomness .
The board is mounted at a 45 - degree angle , so that gravity pulls the marbles to wards the board , as well as down it , and visibility is optimized .
The percussion section
The bowl on the left distributes the marbles into three paths originating from the three holes .
For each of these paths , I created a separate and noisy thing for the marbles to fall on .
The left most contraption is the bottom of an empty soup can for marbles to bounce off of .
A channel mounted on the bottom of the bowl lets the marbles roll to directly over this can , and drops vertically .
This gadget is the loudest and most distinct noise of the marble machine .
Another fun gadget is the gadget towards the back ( top of image ) .
Marbles are dropped onto the left of this gadget , and roll towards the right , then stop against the lip of it , staying on the darker piece of wood .
The next marble to fall onto the left of the darker piece of wood , causing it to rock and bump the previous marbles several centimeters into the air and off the gadget .
The just fallen marble now rolls to the right , ready for the process to repeat .
It 's not entirely reliable , but even if three marbles end up stuck against the lip , the next marble will dislodge at least two of them , so marbles never bunch up .
The larger block on the right is for percussion .
The top of it is a 4 mm thick piece of maple , with the rest of the block hollow underneath .
Marbles drop from one of the holes in the bowl directly on this , producing a very distinct clack .
Also , most of the marbles dropped onto the soup bowl drum will also bounce onto this block , producing a very satisfying ping - tock sequence .
Because the ping - tock sequence of marbles bouncing from the soup bowl drum to the percussion block was so satisfying , I slightly rounded the corners of the hole in the bowl that feeds the soup bowl drum .
That way , the sop bowl gets a larger share of the marbles .
Dump - O-Matic and clanking metal I wanted another mechanism that dumps groups of marbles .
The divide by 6 in my last marble machine was a neat idea , but would not be able to deal with the asynchronous clock nature of this marble machine .
I wanted something that would not jam .
To that effect , I built the dump - o- matic mechanism shown here .
The image shows the mechanism as it has just dumped the marbles .
You can see the last marble leaving the cup ( note that the motion trails go backwards because the flash is at the start of the exposure , not at the end ) .
The mechanism works by having a wooden cup on a pivot with a counter weight .
This is arranged in such a way that once the cup is full , the cup tips over , and dumps its marbles .
The tricky part is balancing it in such a way that the cup , when it dumps , dumps completely , and subsequently rights itself again .
The cup is made of a solid piece of wood .
I took a thick hunk of wood , and drilled a big hole to form the inside of the cup .
Then I cut away a lot of wood around it , giving it the shape of the cup .
It 's important to drill the big hole first , because a small piece of wood would not be able to withstand the force of a big 1.5 " drill .
The mechanism had the problem that often marbles would just roll along the edge of the cup and then overshoot the edge of the machine , causing unacceptable rates of marble loss .
The coat hanger bow ( the white U - shaped wire ) cured that problem .
The mechanism still has the problem that when marbles fall onto it while sometimes cause marbles to fall out of the machine if they fall on it while its in the process of dumping .
Higher fences around the edges of the machine would solve this , but that would also reduce visual appeal .
I also had a piece of angle - iron that I noticed made a nice noise when the marbles were dropped onto it .
So I used that piece of angle iron as an L - channel to take the rest of the marbles from the nail board .
This piece is loosely mounted , allowing it to make more noise .
I had to put a screw in the front end of it , as some marbles would roll off the front end instead of rolling towards the back .
Hard drive gong and bicycle bell
The dump - o-matic and clanking metal channel did n't use up all the vertical drop I had available , so I added some more stuff to convert the remaining height ( energy ) into noises of various kinds .
One of the things I really wanted to integrate was a hard disk platter .
Unfortunately , modern hard drives do n't make as good a gong as the old 5.25 " hard drives did , and I did n't have any of the old platters around .
Still , the newer platters are much shinier and prettier than the old ferrite coated 5 - meg jobs .
This hard drive gong in the machine is strategically placed to catch the marbles from the dump - o- matic , and deflect them inwards to the marble machine .
This cuts down on marble loss .
The platter is mounted in such a way that it 's only in contact with felt , and with minimal pressure , as not to dampen the vibrations .
It makes a nice ' ting ' when the marbles hit it , but I wish it was louder .
People keep thinking it 's a CD - ROM disk .
This first surprised me , because I just assumed everyone had taken apart a hard drive before , but I guess most people just throw out computers when they stop working .
Pity .
At any rate , CD - ROMs have lousy acoustic properties .
They look neat when put in a microwave though .
I built a long ramp to deflect marbles from the clanking iron forward again .
At the end of the ramp is a small bicycle bell .
I wish I 'd had a bigger bicycle bell - the one I use is n't loud enough .
Still , adds a nice ' ping ' when a marble hits it .
The bell is placed to bounce the marbles off towards the left so each marble hits it just once and then lets it ring .
Power source Originally I was planning on motorizing this machine , just like Marble Machine 1 .
Experimenting with just the big wheels , I realized that with a smaller gear on the drive shaft , it would be just the right speed for hand cranking .
This marble machine is very efficient , so it 's fun to crank and surprisingly easy given how loud the machine is .
Also , a hand crank adds a neat interactive element to the machine .
Whenever I show it to people , they very much enjoy cranking it , and keep on cranking it .
Its just so much fun and so fascinating to watch the chaos of marbles tumbling and falling .
It holds kids attention for a long time , even though it 's not that interactive a toy .

As the Ars team convenes for two days of meetings in Chicago , we 're reaching back into the past to bring you some of our favorite articles from years gone by .
Ah , sweet , sweet caffeine .
Whether your chosen delivery device is a Triple Red Eye from Starbucks or a liter of Mountain Dew , nothing beats the gentle jolt into full wakefulness provided by the humble C 8 H 10 N 4 O 2 molecule .
Oral delivery by means of caffeinated liquids has long been the preferred method of getting one 's caffeine buzz on .
In a cruel twist of fate , some people are unable to brew a pot of coffee , order a latte , or figure out how to open a can of Mountain Dew right after waking up , due to that very same lack of caffeine .
What 's a caffeine - loving geek to do ?
Enter Shower Shock .
In the search for ever - more - efficient ways to ingest caffeine , someone came up with the bright idea of adding caffeine to soap .
That way , all you need to do is to stumble out of bed and into the shower , wash with a bar of caffeine - infused soap , and you 're well on your way to full wakefulness .
I 'm a long - time caffeine addict , or as we used to say in the 1980s , a Coffee Achiever .
I 've tried with varying degrees of success to kick the habit , and I am even married to someone who avoids the blessed molecule completely .
I 've managed to stay off of it for a couple of years on more than one occasion .
But in the end , I always come stumbling back to the precious bean .
My current intake comes primarily in the form of coffee .
On the weekends , that means approximately a quart of Starbucks Sumatran , French Roast , or Komodo Dragon coffee freshly ground and brewed using a paper cone filter .
I can accomplish nothing meaningful on a Saturday or Sunday morning until I 've sat down on the couch with the newspaper and made my way through at least half of the morning 's brew .
During the week , I generally hold off on the coffee until I get into the office .
I either grab a large coffee at the cafeteria in my building on my way in , or brew some right after arriving .
Either way , I 'm here , but not here until I 've got some coffee in my system .
After acknowledging the depths of my addiction and subsequently resigning myself to it , I was intrigued by Shower Shock 's promise of a cup of coffee in every wash .
Depending on a number of factors , a regular cup of coffee contains anywhere from 120 to 200 mg of caffeine .
Shower Shock says each bar delivers 12 washes of 200 mg each .
So if nothing else , I was hoping the soap would give me a nice little jump start on my daily fix .
Oh , and I was hoping it would get me clean , too .

Test environment
The shower .
Where else ?
After my Shower Shock arrived , I deviated from my usual Dove +
Neutrogena facial bar combo .
I use the Dove to keep my skin from drying out during the winter and the Neutrogena because my face thinks I 'm stuck in adolescence .
Instead , I jumped into the shower and lathered up with the Shower Shock .
Now , in addition to containing roughly 2400mg of caffeine , each bar is also heavily loaded with peppermint oil .
Not long after lathering up , I got the feeling that not only had I just gone for a brisk stroll in the peppermint rain through the peppermint forest of the children 's board game " Candyland , " but while walking through the forest I had tripped over a peppermint tree root , fell into a peppermint mud puddle , slid down the slopes of peppermint hill through the peppermint grass , and landed in the peppermint pond .
Wanting to give my skin the maximum possible exposure to the beneficial effects of the soap , I soaped myself up and let the lather sit for a few minutes on a few areas of my body , including my big , bald head .
I performed the rest of my daily ablutions , dried off , got dressed , and prepared to leave for work .
In addition to feeling the effects of the peppermint oil in the soap , I also fancied I felt a bit more alert .
Upon arriving in the office at 8:30 , I felt perky enough to avoid the coffee maker for about a half - hour , a notable change from my usual habit of making a beeline to the kitchen upon arrival .
I still downed most of my usual ration of coffee , but it seemed to me the soap had made a difference , giving me a small — yet significant — start on my daily fix .
Curious as to whether I was really feeling the effects of the soap or the mere suggestion of an effect , I asked my wife to take one for the team and try the soap .
She has been off caffeine since just after we started dating .
My love for her was ( and is ) so strong that I was willing to weather the stormy seas of caffeine withdrawal early on in our relationship .
She has been off the stuff for over a decade , and drinking a cup of regular joe will give her nausea , the shakes , and a jittery feeling that will last for several hours .
The most recent occurrence was a couple of weeks ago when a barista at Starbucks failed to hear the " decaf " part of her latte order , which was evidenced by the usual symptoms along with her staying up until nearly 2 am after drinking it at around noon .
So with much trepidation , she showered using the soap .
The result ?
Not long after exiting the shower , the familiar and unwelcome symptoms of caffeine ingestion appeared .
They lasted for a few hours .
They were n't as severe those that follow a tall , accidentally - not - decaf latte , but she definitely felt ... something .
But what was that something ?
We all know the power of persuasion and the reality of the placebo effect ( the infamous " informed consent placebo risk " ) .
Were our minds playing tricks on us ?
Were we confusing the tingling of the peppermint bomb in every wash with the bodily absorption of caffeine ?
In conversations with the crack Ars scientific staff , Dr. Gitlin and Dr. Timmer both expressed doubt as to how well caffeine could be absorbed through the skin .
They informed me that while the molecule is very water - soluble , which allows it to be easily absorbed by the body when it is consumed , it would have a much more difficult time making it through the skin .
In addition , the bond between caffeine and soap might be so strong that the caffeine molecules would follow the soap bubbles down the drain instead of being absorbed through the skin .
Was the tingling and alertness ( or in the case of my wife , the shakiness and jitteriness ) all in our mind ?
It could very well be .
I 've continued using the soap almost daily , and will do so until our three - bar supply is exhausted .
( The manufacturer says each bar is good for 12 washes , but I 'm approaching 10 uses and the bar is roughly half gone . )
I 'm still drinking about the same amount of coffee as before .
Of course , the alert feeling could also be from the peppermint .
Peppermint oils and soaps can be tingly by themselves , and we all know what happens when you bite into a York Peppermint Patty .
I will say that I feel more alert after showering with Shower Shock than if I stick with the Dove .
I arrive in the office fairly alert every morning , as opposed my the usual mostly awake state .
I suppose that someone , somewhere will do a clinically controlled , double - blind study on transdermal caffeine application .
Until that time , I 'll cautiously recommend caffeinated soap to caffeine addicts looking for that first hit of the day — provided they do n't mind spending nearly $ 7.00 on a bar of soap .
“ That is extremely unusual , ” Dr. Cox -Foster said .
Meanwhile , samples were sent to an Agriculture Department laboratory in North Carolina this month to screen for 117 chemicals .
Particular suspicion falls on a pesticide that France banned out of concern that it may have been decimating bee colonies .
Concern has also mounted among public officials .
“ There are so many of our crops that require pollinators , ” said Representative Dennis Cardoza , a California Democrat whose district includes that state ’s central agricultural valley , and who presided last month at a Congressional hearing on the bee issue .
“ We need an urgent call to arms to try to ascertain what is really going on here with the bees , and bring as much science as we possibly can to bear on the problem . ”
So far , colony collapse disorder has been found in 27 states , according to Bee Alert Technology Inc. , a company monitoring the problem .
A recent survey of 13 states by the Apiary Inspectors of America showed that 26 percent of beekeepers had lost half of their bee colonies between September and March .
Honeybees are arguably the insects that are most important to the human food chain .
They are the principal pollinators of hundreds of fruits , vegetables , flowers and nuts .
The number of bee colonies has been declining since the 1940s , even as the crops that rely on them , such as California almonds , have grown .
In October , at about the time that beekeepers were experiencing huge bee losses , a study by the National Academy of Sciences questioned whether American agriculture was relying too heavily on one type of pollinator , the honeybee .
Bee colonies have been under stress in recent years as more beekeepers have resorted to crisscrossing the country with 18 - wheel trucks full of bees in search of pollination work .
These bees may suffer from a diet that includes artificial supplements , concoctions akin to energy drinks and power bars .
In several states , suburban sprawl has limited the bees ’ natural forage areas .
So far , the researchers have discounted the possibility that poor diet alone could be responsible for the widespread losses .
They have also set aside for now the possibility that the cause could be bees feeding from a commonly used genetically modified crop ,
Bt corn , because the symptoms typically associated with toxins , such as blood poisoning , are not showing up in the affected bees .
But researchers emphasized today that feeding supplements produced from genetically modified crops , such as high - fructose corn syrup , need to be studied .

The practice of " extraordinary rendition " was today again in the spotlight with claims that the detainee who supplied the Bush administration 's pre-war claims linking al - Qaida to Iraq did so in Egyptian custody .
Unnamed US government officials , quoted in the New York Times , said Ibn al - Shaykh al - Libi , a Libyan , made his most specific claims after the US handed him over to interrogators from a third country .
Claims from the officials that Al - Libi later admitted to inventing the allegations in order to avoid harsh treatment backed up earlier suggestions from Colin Powell 's chief of staff at the time of the war that al - Libi was possibly tortured .
Lawrence Wilkerson , Mr Powell 's senior aide , last month told the BBC that new information had suggested al - Libi 's statements " were obtained through interrogation techniques other than those authorised by the Geneva [ conventions ] . "
The Bush administration has been on defensive in recent weeks over the " enhanced interrogation techniques " authorised for CIA agents off US soil and " extraordinary rendition " of detainees .
The controversial practice involves the clandestine transfer of terrorist suspects to third country facilities where it is possible that torture or other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment banned by international treaties take place .
Al - Libi , the New York Times claims , had been subjected to such rendition when he told his interrogators that Iraq had trained al - Qaida in the use of chemical and biological weapons .
An assessment from the US Defence Intelligence Agency cast doubt on the claims because of the conditions of his captivity , according to both Mr Wilkerson and the New York Times 's sources .
Mr Wilkerson told the BBC the assessment was made before Mr Powell made his now discredited claims to the UN security council on contacts between Saddam Hussein and al - Qaida , but neither the then secretary of state or his office were told of it .
Before the Iraq war , George Bush , Dick Cheney and Mr Powell frequently cited Mr Libi 's statement as " credible evidence " that Iraq was training al - Qaida .
If correct , the claims would suggest that rendition and the reliance on third country interrogations had played a role in the unreliability of intelligence before the March 2003 invasion of Iraq by US - led coalition .
The law lords yesterday ruled that evidence obtained by torture was not admissible in a British court .
The government will now have to demonstrate in cases against terror suspects that intelligence from overseas agencies meets international standards .
The ruling makes clear that evidence extracted by torture may be used as evidence only against torturers .
It bars evidence obtained from the " extraordinary rendition " of suspects from British courts .
Keir Starmer QC , who led a team representing 14 human rights organisations which presented arguments to the court , hailed it as " the leading judgment in the world on torture " .
Condoleezza Rice , Mr Powell 's successor as US secretary of state , appeared to bow to international pressure this week when she said on a visit to Ukraine that the US 's obligations under the UN convention on torture extended to " US personnel wherever they are , whether they are in the US or outside the US . "
Ms Rice has consistently said the US neither condones nor practises torture , but she has refused to confirm or deny the existence of CIA - run secret interrogation centres in eastern Europe that may be used to hold prisoners of the US .
Today , the US admitted for the first time that the Red Cross had not been given access to all its detainees .
The state department 's top lawyer , John Bellinger , said the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) had access to " absolutely everybody " at the US camp in Guantanamo Bay .
But when asked if the ICRC had access to all detainees held elsewhere in similar circumstances , he said " No " but declined to give further details .
Speaking to reporters in Geneva , Mr Bellinger reiterated Ms Rice 's statement that the US did not practise torture .
" It is incorrect to suggest that the US is sending people off to places knowing that they will be tortured .
We do not send people off to places knowing that they will be tortured or turn a blind eye to torture that may occur , " he said .
The ICRC has demanded access to all foreign terror suspects held by the US in " undisclosed locations " .
" The dialogue continues on the question .
We would like to obtain information and access to them , " said Florian Westphal , a spokesman for the ICRC .

Minorities are the emerging face of the subprime crisis
When Alberto and Rosa Ramirez began looking for a home , they never imagined that 18 months later they would personify a national real estate crisis .
It 's not that they bought a house with walls crawling with toxic mold or inherited an insane neighbor next door or , even , God forbid , that they did n't buy at all .
They bought , and they love , their slice of the American Dream .
" It 's all very nice and beautiful , " Rosa tells me through a translator .
" The neighborhood is very peaceful .
The problem is not with the house at all .
It 's the price of the house . "
Indeed , in a different era ( when housing prices were lower ) , their story might have been one of those bootstrap tales about homeownership transforming immigrant lives .
The husband and wife work as strawberry pickers in the fields around Watsonville , and each earns about $ 300 a week .
They have three children .
Not only did they dream the impossible dream , they managed to finance it .
It all began when they were talking to another family about escaping their subsidized apartments and getting a real house .
The other couple -- Jesus Martinez and his wife , who also have three children -- work as mushroom farmers , earning about $ 500 a week each when there is work .
The two couples decided to pool their resources and begin house - hunting .
Given their total income , they estimated that they could afford payments of $ 3,000 a month .
They spotted an ad in the local magazine La Ganga for Maria Avila of Rancho Grande Real Estate and called her .
" We wanted to live in Watsonville , " says Rosa .
" But [ the real estate agent ] said the houses there were older and more expensive . "
One of the first homes they were shown was a " new " four - bedroom , two - bath house in Hollister for $ 720,000 .
When the Ramirez 's heard the price , they worried that they could n't afford it .
But the couple says they were assured them it was possible .
" The monthly payment was supposed to be $ 4,800 , but then after we bought it , it went up to $ 5,378 , " says Rosa , speaking of their zero - down mortgage with a one - month " teaser rate . "
" Our agent told us that once we refinanced , we could get the payments down to $ 3,000 or less . "
For a number of months Avila , who arranged for the loan with New Century Mortgage , paid the difference between what the buyers had said they could afford -- $ 3,000 -- and the actual loan payment .
According to the buyers , this arrangement was supposed to carry them over until the group refinanced .
The money - saving refinance failed to materialize , and eventually , Avila stopped subsidizing their current mortgage .
( According to my analysis of interest rates during the period , hitting the $ 3,000 number would have been virtually impossible under any circumstances .
An interest - only $ 720,000 loan at a 5 percent interest rate [ 15 - year fixed ] yields a $ 3,000 mortgage , but such mortgage rates were n't available to anyone , much less a laborer with low income , no down payment and no other assets .
Plus , that does n't count another $ 750 a month in taxes and insurance . )
The two families continued to make the payments , sometimes sacrificing basic necessities , other times borrowing more .
" It was very difficult , " Rosa says .
" Sometimes we would eat less , and we took out personal loans from Bank of America . "
( Maria Avila and Rancho Grande Real Estate declined to comment .
Earlier this month , New Century Mortgage , the nation 's second largest subprime mortgage lender , filed for bankruptcy .
It 's also facing a federal criminal probe . )
Last November , the families stopped paying their mortgage and sought the advice of Pamela Simmons , an attorney who specializes in predatory - lending cases .
Upon reviewing the loan documents , they discovered more bad news .
Despite the intention that both couples would be buying the home together ( they 'd submitted income information for three of the four buyers ) , the loan was made exclusively in Alberto Ramirez 's name .
This meant that he was solely responsible for the debt .
The couple also discovered that the home was n't nearly as valuable as they thought :
When a new real estate agent valued the house , he told them he'd list it between $ 560,000 and $ 580,000 .
They have sent a letter of demand to Rancho Grande , claiming the brokers breached their fiduciary duties by selling Alberto Ramirez a home he could n't afford .
Rancho Grande declined comment .
How did a strawberry picker earning $ 15,000 a year qualify for a loan of $ 720,000 ?
The answer , say the experts , lies in a lending industry that got too innovative for its own good .
Last week , a coalition of civil rights groups , including the National Council of La Raza , the Center for Responsible Lending and the NAACP , called for a national six - month moratorium on foreclosures -- after observing that the subprime crisis disproportionately affected minorities .
" The point is to just take time out and provide services to families who might be vulnerable as a result of payment shock , " says Janice Bowdler , senior policy analyst for housing for the National Council of La Raza , referring to the hybrid loans that begin with low fixed rates , then jump to adjustable - rate mortgages .
Bowdler adds that they are hoping many homeowners can avoid foreclosure by taking advantage of such financial tools as changing their current loan terms or refinancing .
According to NCLR , " [ f ] orty percent of Latino families and over half of African Americans who receive home loans get higher - cost mortgages , predominately subprime loans . "
In a study released last month , an analysis of 2005 federal mortgage lending data of large subprime originators in six metropolitan areas , African American borrowers were 3.8 times and Latino borrowers were 3.6 times more likely to receive a higher - cost home purchase loan than white borrowers .
One argument is that these groups naturally get subprime loans because they have bad credit or are buying in riskier neighborhoods .
But according Fannie Mae , there is an enormous lending disparity across the nation :
One study found that 50 percent of all borrowers qualified for a cheaper loan than the one they eventually got .
They even discovered that female buyers tend to get higher - cost loans than male counterparts .
But for Rosa and Alberto Ramirez and many others like them , a foreclosure moratorium wo n't help .
It 's not that a better loan would have remedied their situation -- it's that they can't afford the home they bought .
" Many of my clients can't afford their homes in any circumstance , " says Simmons .
" I have a dishwasher who bought a house and never even moved in .
The moment he saw the first payment , he knew he could n't afford it . "
Indeed , the Ramirez family exemplifies a type of new buyer that did n't exist a decade ago .
Neither Rosa nor Alberto speaks English , so they were completely dependent on their real estate agent and their mortgage broker for advice and to translate and educate them about the process .
" In other business transactions in California , if you negotiate in Spanish , you are required to provide translations of all documents .
But real estate contracts are exempt from this , " explains Simmons , who currently has 30 active cases and sees her potential caseload growing by the day .
" There 's a large increase in the amount of borrowers reaching out to lawyers with subprime loans .
I 've gotten to the point that I have to say to a lot of people , ' I can't represent you , I have too many clients . '
It 's astounding to me .
I neither expected nor have I seen anything like this in all the years I 've practiced law .
It 's as if in real estate it 's gone back to the Wild , Wild West of San Francisco in the 1800s . "
Simmons says that she 's seeing more non-English - speaking clients -- mostly Latinos but also one Filipino -- who had little understanding of what they had gotten themselves into .
" I meet with a lot of clients who have negative - amortization loans who are stunned to find out that their payments are not even covering their full interest , " she says , mentioning a couple she met that morning whose adjustable negative - amortization payments had risen beyond their ability to pay .
" The wife is crying -- it was awful .
I had the very sad task of explaining to them that they cannot afford their home .
Forget about actually paying off their home in 30 years -- they can't afford the interest - only payments . "
Maeve Brown , co-founder of Oakland - based Housing and Economic Rights Advocates , says most of her clients fall into one of two categories .
There are the non-English - speaking , first - time home buyers who " buy homes that they can't afford , with mortgage brokers raking in the fees and an added twist that the homes are often substandard and they are appraised above their actual value . "
The other kind of cases involves seniors -- often African American -- who are persuaded to refinance their homes with more expensive adjustable - rate loans that carry steep prepayment penalties .
" Buying a housing is a complex process , " says Brown .
" I think we 've been sold a bill of goods about the American dream : that it 's fast , it 's fun , it 's easy .
Well , it 's not easy -- it 's really complex .
The ideal would be that every buyer retain their own counsel to protect them from their realtor and their broker , because though there are great agents and brokers out there and they have a fiduciary duty to represent your best interests , in the end , it 's a contract and you 're on the hook for it . "
Regarding subprime lenders going bankrupt , she has " no sympathy whatsoever .
They created this monster . "
What if you 're not up to reading ( and comprending ) the fine print of a refinance or a new home loan ?
Housing advocates offer the following advice :
An interesting finding was discovered in a DigitalPoint Forums thread that references a study that says that men prefer Google as a search engine and women prefer Yahoo .
From the thread :
About men , he states :
Men tend to see it as an office , a library , or a playground -- screw the community , this is about function not family .
Men tend to be more intense Internet users than women , being more likely to go online daily ( 61 % of men and 57 % of women ) and more likely to go online several times a day ( 44 % of men and 39 % of women ) .
About women , he states :
The report found that women are more enthusiastic communicators , using email in a more robust way .
Not only sending and receiving more email than men , women are more likely to write to family and friends about a variety of topics , sharing news , joys and worries , planning events , and forwarding jokes and stories .
While both sexes equally appreciate the efficiency and convenience of email , women are more likely than men to value the medium for its positive effects on improving relationships , expanding networks , and encouraging teamwork at the office .
I think this is an interesting observation .
I commented from my own personal perspective that I seek out social networks , many of which are Yahoo !
properties , but I personally think that the search engine itself does not include those " community elements " that are so heavily emphasized .
Interestingly enough , I discovered another post that showed that female Internet users outnumber males .
This is is even more interesting considering that Google is the dominant search engine .
I 'd love to know what kind of sampling was taken for the study , since I question the accuracy of the data with the information provided .
Still , the psychology behind the study is an interesting one .
Perhaps I 'm just a bit biased because I 'm so immersed in this technology and in social media as well . :)
To further test such hypotheses , Microsoft has an interesting adCenter Labs Demographics Prediction Tool .
One can certainly have fun with this .
I see that Barry did , but his findings were different .
Forum discussion continues at DigitalPoint Forums .
Female circumcision is widespread in many parts of Africa
Anybody involved in female genital mutilation ( FGM ) would be punished with a fine and imprisonment , it said .
The move follows a campaign against the practice by the National Union of Eritrean Women , which says more than 90 % of Eritrean women are circumcised .
FGM typically involves removing the clitoris and FGM supporters argue that it helps prevent promiscuous behaviour .
Female circumcision is a procedure that seriously endangers the health of women
Government proclamation
The practice is widespread in many parts of Africa and the Middle East .
Women carry out the surgery as part of an initiation rite to adulthood .
It is known to be a very painful practice that sometimes leads to excessive bleeding , infection , trauma and difficulties in childbirth .
" Female circumcision is a procedure that seriously endangers the health of women , causes them considerable pain and suffering besides threatening their lives , " the government proclamation said .
" Whosoever requests , incites or promotes female circumcision by providing tools or any other means and whosoever , knowing that female circumcision is to take place or has taken place , fails without good cause , to warn or inform the proper authorities promptly , shall be punishable with a fine and imprisonment , " it continued .
The ban came into force on 31 March , the information ministry said .
FGM is outlawed in a number of African countries , but laws are rarely enforced .
Questionable directions given by online mapping services could have contributed to the death of James Kim , who perished while trying to save his stranded family .
Kim , 35 , was driving home from a vacation with his wife , Kati , and daughters , four - year - old Penelope and seven - month - old Sabine , on November 25 when he took a wrong turn and they became lost in the wilderness in Oregon , in north - west US .
Kim left his family on Saturday to find help , but never returned .
When searchers found his lifeless body yesterday , he had already walked 13 kilometres through rugged terrain , wearing only light clothing .

I vouched for Kimberly Kagan 's academic credentials in linking to her assessment of the progress of the " surge " for the Weekly Standard .
I should have disclosed that Kagan is the wife of Frederick Kagan , the principal author of the surge ; and his brother is Bob Kagan , another pro-surge advocate and editor at the Weekly Standard , and they 're both sons of Donald Kagan , who is also a neoconservative intellectual .
More to the point : Kimberly Kagan is listed as one of the participants in her husband 's research team that came up with the surge in the first place .
So when the Weekly Standard decided to compile a regular report on the surge 's progress , they picked the wife of the main author and one of the plan 's original architects .
And they never disclosed these relevant facts .
So allow me .

Democrats , citing a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service , say presidential advisers , including 47 from the Clinton administration alone , have frequently testified before Congressional committees , both while serving the president and after they had left the White House .
Even so , legal experts say precedent does not play a role in decisions about whether to waive executive privilege ; each administration , in effect , writes its own rules .
The Bush administration has been particularly protective of executive privilege , and Republicans close to the White House say the decision about whether , or how much , to cooperate will come down to a calculation of the political risks and rewards .
Image Karl Rove , President Bushs chief political adviser , is among the officials who may be subpoenaed to testify publicly and under oath .

Senior White House officials have given public testimony in the past , including before the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks .
But more times than not , it has come on the administration ’s terms ; Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney agreed to appear before the Sept. 11 commission , but only in private and without being required to take an oath .
When Congress and the president have not been able to resolve fights over executive privilege , it has sometimes been left to the courts to decide — most notably during the Nixon administration and the legal battle over the White House tapes .
But the courts have also tried to steer clear of the wrangling over executive privilege when it is deemed strictly political .
Television talk shows on Sunday were filled with discussion of the prosecutors ’ dismissals , and whether they would cost Mr. Gonzales his job .
While Mr. Gonzales did not appear on any of the programs — he declined requests from at least two networks — two of the prosecutors who had been fired spoke out , as did at least five senators , including Mr. Leahy and a Republican colleague on the Judiciary Committee , Senator John Cornyn of Texas .
None of the Republicans who took to the airwaves on Sunday offered a spirited defense of the administration , but Mr. Cornyn and others did take exception to the Democratic vow to subpoena White House officials and accused some Democrats of trying to turn the issue to their political advantage .
First , let me make it clear .
Fred Thompson is not a libertarian , he ’s a conservative .
Nonetheless , he does have interesting things to say .
Today , he has a column up at NRO that addresses criticism about his votes on tort reform while in the Senate , but has this interesting quote about federalism :
As I understood it , states were supposed to be laboratories that would compete with each other , conducting civic experiments according to the wishes of their citizens .
The model for federal welfare reform was the result of that process .
States also allow for of diverse viewpoints that exist across the country .
There is no reason that Tennesseans and New Yorkers should have to agree on everything ( and they donâ€™t ) .
Those who are in charge of applying the conservative litmus test should wonder why some of their brethren continue to try to federalize more things â€ ” especially at a time of embarrassing federal mismanagement and a growing federal bureaucracy .
I am afraid that such a test is often based more upon who is favored between two self - serving litigants than upon legal and constitutional principles .
Isnâ€™t that what we make all the Supreme Court nominees promise not to do ?
Adhering to the principles of federalism is not easy .
As one who was on the short end of a couple of 99 - 1 votes , I can personally attest to it .
Federalism sometimes restrains you from doing things you want to do .
You have to leave the job to someone else â€ ” who may even choose not to do it at all .
However , if conservatives abandon this valued principle that limits the federal government , or if we selectively use it as a tool with which to reward our friends and strike our enemies , then we will be doing a disservice to our country as well as the cause of conservatism .
There are many things about the Constitution that can be considered the work of genius , but perhaps the most important among them was the idea of Federalism .
As originally intended , the Federal Government was supposed to have only limited jurisdiction over matters that truly impacted the nation as a whole .
The vast majority of the rules that impacted every day life were supposed to have been made at the state and local levels , where people would have more control over their legislators .
As with most everything else that the Founders believed , that idea has faded into history .
Today , the Federal Government inserts itself into virtually every aspect of our lives and the states have become more and more irrelevant .
Over the past 30 years , the Federal Government has used the power of the purse to force the states to change policy on everything from the drinking age to seatbelt laws .
And when the voters of California decide that people who are dying of cancer should have the right to utilize marijuana to alleviate their pain and suffering , the DEA steps in and shuts down the clinics … … and the Supreme Court says it ’s okay .
With the exception of Ron Paul , nearly every Presidential candidate is talking about what the Federal Government can do for you .
Almost nobody is talking about the idea that maybe there are some things that it should n’t be doing at all .
If Fred Thompson becomes the exception to that rule , then he may be a welcome addition to the race .
A neutrino signal observed by the MiniBooNE experiment .
Credit : Fermilab
Scientists of the MiniBooNE experiment at the Department of Energy 's Fermilab today announced their first findings .
The MiniBooNE results resolve questions raised by observations of the LSND experiment in the 1990s that appeared to contradict findings of other neutrino experiments worldwide .
MiniBooNE researchers showed conclusively that the LSND results could not be due to simple neutrino oscillation , a phenomenon in which one type of neutrino transforms into another type and back again .
The announcement significantly clarifies the overall picture of how neutrinos behave .
The MiniBooNE experiment relies on a 250,000 - gallon tank filled with mineral oil , which is clearer than water from a faucet .
Light - sensitive devices ( PMTs ) mounted inside the tank are capable of detecting collisions between neutrinos and carbon nuclei of oil molecules .

Currently , three types or " flavors " of neutrinos are known to exist : electron neutrinos , muon neutrinos and tau neutrinos .
In the last 10 years , several experiments have shown that neutrinos can oscillate from one flavor to another and back .
The observations made by the LSND collaboration also suggested the presence of neutrino oscillation , but in a neutrino mass region vastly different from other experiments .
Reconciling the LSND observations with the oscillation results of other neutrino experiments would have required the presence of a fourth , or " sterile " type of neutrino , with properties different from the three standard neutrinos .
The existence of sterile neutrinos would throw serious doubt on the current structure of particle physics , known as the Standard Model of Particles and Forces .
Because of the far - reaching consequences of this interpretation , the LSND findings cried out for independent verification .
The MiniBooNE collaboration ruled out the simple LSND oscillation interpretation by looking for signs of muon neutrinos oscillating into electron neutrinos in the region indicated by the LSND observations .
The collaboration found no appearance of electron neutrinos as predicted by a simple two - neutrino oscillation scenario .
" It was very important to verify or refute the surprising LSND result , " said Robin Staffin , DOE Associate Director of Science for High Energy Physics .
" We never know what nature has in store for us .
The MiniBooNE experiment was an important one to do and is to be complimented for a job well done . "
The MiniBooNE experiment , approved in 1998 , took data for the current analysis from 2002 until the end of 2005 using muon neutrinos produced by the Booster accelerator at Fermilab .
The MiniBooNE detector , located about 500 meters from the point at which the muon neutrinos were produced , looked for electron neutrinos created by the muon neutrinos .
The experiment 's goal was either to confirm or to refute the startling observations reported by the LSND collaboration , thus answering a long - standing question that has troubled the neutrino physics community for more than a decade .
" Our results are the culmination of many years of very careful and thorough analysis .
This was really an extraordinary team effort , " said MiniBooNE cospokesperson Janet Conrad of Columbia University .
" We know that scientists everywhere have been eagerly waiting for our results . "
The MiniBooNE collaboration used a blind - experiment technique to ensure the credibility of their analysis and results .
While collecting their neutrino data , the MiniBooNE collaboration did not permit themselves access to data in the region , or " box , " where they would expect to see the same signature of oscillations as LSND .
When the MiniBooNE collaboration opened the box and " unblinded " its data less than three weeks ago , the telltale oscillation signature was absent .
" We are delighted to see that the work of the MiniBooNE team has led to the resolution of this puzzle , " said Marv Goldberg , Program Director for Elementary Particle Physics at the National Science Foundation .
" We 're proud that our support yielded such an important breakthrough for neutrino physics and we look forward to additional results from this team of university and national laboratory scientists . "
Although the MiniBooNE researchers have decisively ruled out the interpretation of the LSND results as being due to oscillation between two types of neutrinos , the collaboration has more work ahead .
" We have been studying the bulk of our data for several years , " said Fermilab physicist Steve Brice , analysis coordinator for the MiniBooNE experiment , " but we have had access to these sequestered data for only a short time .
There are remaining analyses that we are eager to do next .
They include detailed investigation of data we observe at low energy that do not match what we expected to see , along with more exotic neutrino oscillation models and other exciting physics . "
At this time , the source of the apparent low - energy discrepancy is unknown .
" It is great to get the MiniBooNE results out , " said Fermilab Director Pier Oddone .
" It clears one mystery but it leaves us with a puzzle that is important to understand . "
The MiniBooNE collaboration will further analyze its data .
" As in many particle physics experiments , we have a result that answers some questions and raises others , " said MiniBooNE co-spokesperson William Louis , Los Alamos National Laboratory , who also worked on the original LSND experiment .
" We live in interesting times . "
For its observations , MiniBooNE relies on a detector made of a 250,000 - gallon tank filled with ultrapure mineral oil , clearer than water from a faucet .
A layer of 1280 light - sensitive photomultiplier tubes , mounted inside the tank , detects collisions between neutrinos made by the Booster accelerator and carbon nuclei of oil molecules inside the detector .
Since January 2006 , the MiniBooNE experiment has been collecting data using beams of antineutrinos instead of neutrinos and expects further results from these new data .

Joy White and Bob Lazar run United Nuclear from their home in New Mexico .
The first startling thing Joy White saw out of her bedroom window was a man running toward her door with an M16 .
White ’s husband , a physicist named Bob Lazar , was already outside , awakened by their barking dogs .
Suddenly police officers and men in camouflage swarmed up the path , hoisting a battering ram .
“ Come out with your hands up immediately , Miss White ! ” one of them yelled through a megaphone , while another handcuffed the physicist in his underwear .
Recalling that June morning in 2003 , Lazar says , “ If they were expecting to find Osama bin Laden , they brought along enough guys . ”
The target of this operation , which involved more than two dozen police officers and federal agents , was not an international terrorist ring but the couple ’s home business , United Nuclear Scientific Supplies , a mail - order outfit that serves amateur scientists , students , teachers , and law enforcement professionals .
From the outside , company headquarters – at the end of a dirt road high in the Sandia Mountains east of Albuquerque – looks like any other ranch house in New Mexico , with three dogs , a barbecue , and an SUV in the driveway .
But not every suburban household boasts its own particle accelerator .
A stroll through the backyard reveals what looks like a giant Van de Graaff generator with a pipe spiraling out of it , marked with CAUTION : RADIATION signs .
A sticker on the SUV reads POWERED BY HYDROGEN , while another sign by the front gate warns , TRESPASSERS WILL BE USED FOR SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS .
Science experiments are United Nuclear ’s business .
The chemicals available on the company ’s Web site range from ammonium dichromate ( the main ingredient in the classic science - fair volcano ) to zinc oxide powder ( which absorbs UV light ) .
Lazar and White also sell elements like sodium and mercury , radioactive minerals , and geeky curiosities like aerogel , an ultralightweight foam developed by NASA to capture comet dust .
The Department of Homeland Security buys the company ’s powerful infrared flashlights by the case ; the Mythbusters guys on the Discovery Channel recently picked up 10 superstrong neodymium magnets .
( These come with the sobering caveat : “ Beware – you must think ahead when moving these magnets … Loose metallic objects and other magnets may become airborne and fly considerable distances . ” )
Fire departments in Nevada and California send for United Nuclear ’s Geiger counters and uranium ore to train hazmat crews .
A former employee of the Los Alamos National Laboratory , the 47 - year - old Lazar radiates a boyish enthusiasm for science and gadgets .
White , 50 , is a trim licensed aesthetician who does herbal facials for local housewives while helping her husband run the company .
When the officers determined that Lazar and White posed no physical threat , they freed the couple from their handcuffs and produced a search warrant .

Thames & Kosmos markets one of the few chemistry sets worthy of the name .
The search was initiated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission , a federal agency best known for instigating recalls of faulty cribs and fire - prone space heaters .
The CPSC 's concern with United Nuclear was not the uranium , the magnets , or the backyard accelerator .
It was the chemicals – specifically sulfur , potassium perchlorate , and powdered aluminum , all of which can be used to make illegal fireworks .
The agency suspected that Lazar and White were selling what amounted to kits for making M - 80s , cherry bombs , and other prohibited items ; such kits are banned by the CPSC under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act .
“ We are not just a recall agency , ” explains CPSC spokesperson Scott Wolfson .
“ We have turned our attention to the chemical components used in the manu - facture of illegal fireworks , which can cause amputations and death . ”
A 2004 study by the agency found that 2 percent of fireworks - related injuries that year were caused by homemade or altered fireworks ; the majority involved the mishandling of commercial firecrackers , bottle rockets , and sparklers .
Nonetheless , Wolfson says , “ we ’ve fostered a very close relationship with the Justice Department and we ’re out there on the Internet looking to see who is promoting these core chemicals .
Fireworks is one area where we ’re putting people in prison . ”
In the past several years , the CPSC has gone after a variety of online vendors , demanding the companies require customers to prove they have a license to manufacture explosives before they can purchase any chemical associated with making them .
Many of these compounds , however , are also highly useful for conducting science experiments .
Sulfur , for example , is an ingredient in hydrogen sulfide , an important tool for chemical analysis .
Potassium perchlorate and potassium nitrate are widely used in labs as oxidizers .
The CPSC ’s war on illegal fireworks is one of several forces producing a chilling effect on amateur research in chemistry .
National security issues and laws aimed at thwarting the production of crystal meth are threatening to put an end to home laboratories .
In schools , rising liability concerns are making teachers wary of allowing students to perform their own experiments .
Some educators even speculate that a lack of chem lab experience is contributing to the declining interest in science careers among young people .
United Nuclear got its computers back a few days after they were hauled away , and three years passed before Lazar and White heard from the authorities again .
This spring , the couple was charged with violating the Federal Hazardous Substances
Act and shipping restricted chemicals across state lines .
If convicted , Lazar and White each face a maximum penalty of 270 days in prison and a $ 15,000 fine .

The lure of do - it - yourself chemistry has always been the most potent recruiting tool science has to offer .
Many kids attracted by the promise of filling the garage with clouds of ammonium sulfide – the proverbial stink bomb – went on to brilliant careers in mathematics , biology , programming , and medicine .
Intel cofounder Gordon Moore set off his first boom in Silicon Valley two decades before pioneering the design of the integrated circuit .
One afternoon in 1940 , near the spot where Interstate 280 intersects Sand Hill Road today , the future father of the semiconductor industry knelt beside a cache of homemade dynamite and lit the fuse .
He was 11 years old .
Moore ’s pyrotechnic adventures grew out of his experiments with a neighbor ’s chemistry set .
He turned a shed beside the family house into a lab , stocking it with chemicals mail - ordered from San Francisco and filling an old dresser with beakers and funnels .
Now retired , the 77 - year - old Moore looks back on his days and nights in the shed as a time when he learned to think and work like a scientist .
“ The things I made , like nitroglycerin , took a fair amount of lab technique , ” he recalls .
“ I specialized in explosives because they were fun , and I liked doing things that got results in a hurry . ”
Many of Moore ’s illustrious peers also first got interested in science by performing experiments at home .
After reading a book called The Boy Scientist at age 10 , Vint Cerf – who became one of the architects of the Internet – spent months blowing up thermite volcanoes and launching backyard rockets .
Growing up in Colorado , David Packard – the late cofounder of Hewlett - Packard – concocted new recipes for gunpowder .
The neurologist Oliver Sacks writes about his adolescent love affair with “ stinks and bangs ” in Uncle Tungsten : Memories of a Chemical Boyhood .
“ There ’s no question that stinks and bangs and crystals and colors are what drew kids – particularly boys – to science , ” says Roald Hoffmann of Cornell University , who won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1981 .
“ Now the potential for stinks and bangs has been legislated out . ”
Popular Science columnist Theodore Gray , who is one of United Nuclear ’s regular customers , uses potassium perchlorate to demonstrate the abundance of energy stored in sugar and fat .
He chops up Snickers bars , sprinkles in the snowy crystals , and ignites the mixture , which bursts into a tower of flame – the same rapid exothermic reaction that propels model rockets skyward .
“ Why is it that I can walk into Wal - Mart and buy boxes of bullets and black powder , but I ca n’t buy potassium perchlorate to do science because it can also be used to make explosives ? ” he asks .
“ How many people are injured each year doing extreme sports or playing high school football ?
But mention mixing up chemicals in your home lab , and people have a much lower index of acceptable risk . ”
The push to restrict access to chemicals by those who have no academic or scientific credentials gained momentum in the mid-’90s following the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City .
In the years since 9/11 , the Defense Department , FBI , and other government agencies have strategized ways of tracking even small purchases of potentially dangerous chemicals .
“ The fact that there are amateurs and retired professors out there who need access to these chemicals is a valid problem , ” acknowledges Rice University chemistry professor James Tour , who consulted with the Pentagon and the Justice Department , “ but there are n’t many of those guys weighed against the possible dangers . ”
A provision in the 2002 Homeland Security Act mandated background checks and licensing requirements for model - rocket enthusiasts on the grounds that ammonium perchlorate fuel is an explosive ; the Justice Department argued that terrorists could deploy model rockets to shoot down commercial airliners .
A bill pending in both houses of Congress would empower the Department of Homeland Security to regulate sales of ammonium nitrate , a common fertilizer that Timothy McVeigh used to make the Oklahoma City bomb .
“ We finally have bipartisan support and encouragement from the chemical industry on this , which is important , because we ’ve seen what can happen when these materials fall into the wrong hands , ” says US representative Curt Weldon ( R - Pennsylvania ) , who is sponsoring the House bill .
“ As we move forward , we ’re going to be taking a very close look at other chemicals that should be regulated . ”
In the meantime , more than 30 states have passed laws to restrict sales of chemicals and lab equipment associated with meth production , which has resulted in a decline in domestic meth labs , but makes things daunting for an amateur chemist shopping for supplies .
It is illegal in Texas , for example , to buy such basic labware as Erlenmeyer flasks or three - necked beakers without first registering with the state ’s Department of Public Safety to declare that they will not be used to make drugs .
Among the chemicals the Portland , Oregon , police department lists online as “ commonly associated with meth labs ” are such scientifically useful compounds as liquid iodine , isopropyl alcohol , sulfuric acid , and hydrogen peroxide , along with chemistry glassware and pH strips .
Similar lists appear on hundreds of Web sites .
“ To criminalize the necessary materials of discovery is one of the worst things you can do in a free society , ” says Shawn Carlson , a 1999 MacArthur fellow and founder of the Society for Amateur Scientists .
“ The Mr. Coffee machine that every Texas legislator has near his desk has three violations of the law built into it : a filter funnel , a Pyrex beaker , and a heating element .
The laws against meth should be the deterrent to making it – not criminalizing activities that train young people to appreciate science . ”
The increasingly strict regulatory climate has driven a wedge of paranoia between young chemists and their potential mentors .
“ I do n’t tell anyone about what I do at home , ” writes one anonymous high schooler on Sciencemadness.org , an online forum for amateur scientists .
“ A lot of ignorant people at my school will just spread rumors about me …
The teacher will hear about them and I will get into legal trouble … I have so much glassware at my house , any excuse will not cut it .
So I keep my mouth shut . ”
Ironically , a shadow of suspicion is being cast over home chemistry at a time when the contributions of amateurs to the progress of science are highly regarded .
In recent years , citizen scientists have discovered comets and supernovas and invented tools for gauging Earth ’s magnetic field .
Peer - reviewed journals like Nature now welcome papers coauthored by auto - didacts like Forrest Mims III , who studies solar storms and atmospheric conditions at his home observatory in Texas .
Personal computers , digital cameras , and other consumer electronic devices are putting more accurate means of recording and measuring phenomena into the hands of home tinkerers than were available in high - end labs just a few years ago .
The Internet is the ultimate enabling technology , allowing amateurs to collaborate with their counterparts at NASA and other organizations .
Porting the hacker ethic to the nonvirtual world , magazines like Make and blogs like Boing Boing are making it cool for geeks to get their hands dirty again , offering how - tos on everything from building your own telescope to assembling an electronic insect army .
DIY robotics - fests like Dorkbot ( “ people doing strange things with electricity , ” according to the Web site ) are taking off from Boston to Bangalore .
But the hands - on revival is leaving home chemists behind .
While surplus lab equipment is available on eBay , chemicals are subject to the site ’s filtering software , which tracks or blocks the sale of items tagged as hazardous by the US Postal Service , the Drug Enforcement Administration , and the Environmental Protection Agency .
“ There are very few commercial supply houses willing to sell chemicals to amateurs anymore because of this fear that we ’re all criminals and terrorists , ” Carlson says .
“ Ordinary folks no longer have access to the things they need to make real discoveries in chemistry . ”
The heyday of home experimentation in the US coincided with the rise of the Porter Chemical Company , makers of the legendary Chemcraft labs - in - a - box , which contained enough bottles and beakers to perform more than 800 experiments .
At the height of its popularity in the 1950s , Porter awarded college scholarships , mined its own chemicals , and was the biggest user of test tubes in the US .
The company produced more than a million chemistry sets before going out of business in the 1980s amid increasing liability concerns .
One kid whose interest in science was sparked by the gift of a chemistry set was Don Herbert , who grew up to host a popular TV show in the 1950s called Watch Mr. Wizard .
With his eye - popping demonstrations and low - key midwestern manner , Mr. Wizard gave generations of future scientists and teachers the confidence to perform experiments at home .
In 1999 , Restoration Hardware founder Stephen Gordon teamed up with Renee Whitney , general manager of a toy company called Wild Goose , to try to re-create the chemistry set Herbert marketed almost 50 years ago .
“ Don was so sweet , ” Whitney recalls .
“ He invited us to his home to have dinner with him and his wife .
Then he pulled his old chemistry set out of the garage .
It was amazing – a real metal cabinet , like a little closet , filled with dozens of light - resistant bottles . ”
Gordon and Whitney soon learned that few of the items in Mr. Wizard ’s cabinet could be included in the product .
“ Unfortunately , we found that more than half the chemicals were illegal to sell to children because they ’re considered dangerous , ” Whitney explains .
By the time the Mr. Wizard Science
Set appeared in stores , it came with balloons , clay , Super Balls , and just five chemicals , including laundry starch , which was tagged with an ominous warning : HANDLE CAREFULLY .
NOT EXPECTED TO BE A HEALTH HAZARD .
“ It was n’t really something you could use to teach kids about chemistry , ” acknowledges Thomas Nikosey , head of Mr. Wizard Studios , which handles licensing for the 88 - year - old Herbert .
Kits that train kids how to do real chemistry have yielded to innocuous science - flavored toys .
At the Web site Discover This , one typical product promises lessons in making “ rock candy , superbubbles , and molding clay … without blowing up the house . ”
One of the few companies still selling chemistry sets worthy of the name is a German - American venture called Thames & Kosmos , run by former Adobe software engineer Ted McGuire .
The company ’s top - of - the - line kit , the C3000 , is equipped with a full complement of test tubes , beakers , pipettes , litmus paper , and more than two dozen useful compounds .
But even the C3000 , which retails for $ 200 , comes with a shopping list of chemicals that must be purchased elsewhere to perform certain experiments .
“ A lot of retailers are scared to carry a real chemistry set now because of liability concerns , ” McGuire explains .
“ The stuff under your kitchen sink is far more dangerous than the things in our kits , but put the word chemistry on something and people become terrified . ”
The chemophobia that ’s put a damper on home science has also invaded America ’s classrooms , where hands - on labs are being replaced by liability - proof teacher demonstrations with the explicit message Do n’t try this at home .
A guide for teachers of grades 7 through 12 issued by the American Chemical Society in 2001 makes the prospect of an hour in the lab seem fraught with peril : “ Every chemical , without exception , is hazardous .
Did you know that oxygen is poisonous if inhaled at a concentration a bit greater than its natural concentration in the air ? ”
More than half of the suggested experiments in a multimedia package for schools called “ You Be the Chemist , ” created in 2004 by the Chemical Educational Foundation , are to be performed by the teacher alone , leaving students to blow up balloons ( with safety goggles in place ) or answer questions like “ How many pretzels can you eat in a minute ? ”
“ A lot of schools do n’t have chemistry labs anymore , ” explains CEF educational coordinator Laurel Brent .
“ We want to give kids lessons that tie in to their real - world experiences without having them deal with a lot of strange chemicals in bottles that have big long names . ”
Many students are ill at ease when faced with actual compounds and lab equipment for the first time at school .
A study of “ chemistry anxiety ” in the Journal of Chemical Education concluded in 2000 that “ the presence of this anxiety in our students could be a contributing factor in the overall poor performance of high school students in science . ”
( Commonly reported fears included “ lighting the Bunsen burner , ” “ fire , ” and “ getting chemicals on skin . ” )
Restrictions on hands - on chemical experience is “ a problem that has been building for 10 or 15 years , driven by liability and safety concerns , ” says John Moore , editor in chief of the JCE .
“ The liability issues are a cop-out , ” says Bassam Shakhashiri , the author of a four - volume guide to classroom chemistry who has taught for 36 years at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
“ Kids are being robbed of the joy of discovering things for themselves . ”
Compared with students in previous generations , he says , undergraduates raised on hands - off science seem passive : “ They want someone to do things for them .
Even those who become chem majors and grad students are not as versatile in the lab , because their experiences in middle school and high school were so limited .
This is a terrible shame .
By working with real substances , you learn how to ask the right questions about the physical world , which is half the battle in science . ”
Paradoxically , at a time when young people are particularly excited about technology , their enthusiasm for learning about the science behind it is waning .
Thirty years ago , the US ranked third in the world in the number of science and engineering degrees awarded in the 18 - to - 24 age group .
Now the country ranks 17th , according to the National Science Board .
A 2004 report called Trends in International Mathematics and Science Education Study found that while fourth graders in the US rank sixth in basic science scores when measured against their peers worldwide , by the time they ’re in eighth grade , they ’ve slipped to ninth place .
Prompted by concern that America is falling behind , President Bush proposed a $ 380 million “ competitiveness initiative ” this year that promises to train 70,000 new teachers of Advanced Placement science and math .
By the time students have the opportunity to enroll in an AP course , however , many have already absorbed the message that science is best left to trained professionals .
“ You have to capture kids ’ imaginations very young or you lose them forever , ” says Steve Spangler , a former protégé of Mr. Wizard who is now a science correspondent for the NBC affiliate in Denver .
“ But that ’s hard when you have teachers required to check out vinegar and baking soda from the front office because something bad might happen in class .
Slowly but surely the teaching tools are being taken away , so schools end up saying , ‘ Let ’s get a college professor to do this demonstration , and kids can watch the streaming video . ’ ”
To Bill Nye , the “ Science Guy ” who hosted an Emmy award - winning series on PBS in the 1990s , unreasonable fears about chemicals and home experimentation reflect a distrust of scientific expertise taking hold in society at large .
“ People who want to make meth will find ways to do it that do n’t require an Erlenmeyer flask .
But raising a generation of people who are technically incompetent is a recipe for disaster . ”
To ensure that the tradition of home chemistry survives , self - proclaimed “ mad scientists ” are creating a research underground on Web sites like Sciencemadness , Readily Available Chemicals , and the International Order of Nitrogen .
There , in comfortable anonymity , seasoned experimenters , novices , and connoisseurs of banned molecules share tips on finding alternative sources for chemicals and labware .
One key to working as a DIY chemist , says Matthew Ernst , the 25 - year - old host of Sciencemadness , is realizing how many useful chemicals are still available as household products or items designed for specialized niches .
Silver nitrate , for example , can be found at potters ’ supply stores , where it lends raku glazes an uncanny luster .
“ Amateur chemists become compulsive label readers , ” Ernst says .
“ Many compounds are available if the chemist is willing to split his shopping between the paint store , hardware store , ceramics supplier , gardening center , welding supplier , feed store , and metal recycler . ”
Out - of - print texts like Julius B. Cohen ’s 1910 Practical Organic Chemistry are being made available again in PDF form on file - sharing networks and the Internet Archive .
To route around stigmatized chemical pathways , home experimenters are reviving 19th - century methods of synthesizing reagents from scratch .
Shawn Carlson of the Society for Amateur Scientists calls this “ embracing Grandpa ’s chemistry . ”
Carlson ’s group acts as a virtual co-op for its nearly 2,000 members by facilitating small purchases of legal chemicals and equipment .
The group is also launching an ambitious national program called Labrats to provide mentoring to the next generation of researchers by teaming students with working scientists .
The father of three young children , Carlson understands parental concerns about safety .
But he believes that the exhilaration of risk has always been a powerful factor in engaging kids ’ interest in science , and should be actively encouraged – while minimizing the physical hazards .
“ We can get rid of most of the actual dangers , but it ’s important that we preserve the perception of danger in science , ” he says .
“ When I do experiments with my own kids , I ’m more than happy to let them believe that if they ’re not careful , something could happen to them .
It adds that extra element of ‘ my fate is in my hands – but if I do this right , everything will be fine . ’ ”
In March , Bob Lazar and Joy White were building a new two - story home for United Nuclear in a clearing behind their house , hiring three assistants , and weathering a nerve - wracking shortage of aerogel after Boing Boing posted a link .
Then news of the Justice Department ’s charges against them arrived , and they called their lawyer to begin planning their defense .
“ Kids read about the great scientists and their discoveries throughout history , and marvel that people once did these things , ” Lazar says .
“ But they marvel a little too much .
Taking chemicals and lab equipment away from kids who love science is like taking crayons and paints away from a kid who may grow up to be an artist . ”

Story Highlights • Campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama locked horns over supporter
• While no big deal , the tussle raises issues set to be key in Democratic primaries
• Does Clinton have too much political baggage and how does she react to attacks ?
• Can Obama stay above the fray and keep a pledge to avoid negative campaigns ?
Adjust font size :
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
The long - term impact of the Tinseltown tussle between the Clinton and Obama campaigns is no big deal , but it showcases a big issue in the primary campaign .
At issue : Can Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - New York , or Sen. Barack Obama , D - Illinois , be elected president ?
" There are some Democrats that wonder if either one can win , " political analyst Stu Rothenberg said .
( Watch how the Clinton and Obama camps went after each other )
Obama supporter and Hollywood movie mogul David Geffen raised the issue front and center about Clinton .
In an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd , Geffen called her " incredibly polarizing " and said Republicans believe " she 's the easiest to defeat . ''
( Full story )
The Clinton campaign 's tough response , in which it challenged Obama to distance himself from Geffen and return Geffen campaign donations , sent a signal .
It shows Clinton is willing to hit back when someone comes after her .
( Watch Clinton and Obama fight for Hollywood dollars )
And does Clinton have too much political baggage ?
That issue is now on the table , too .
The dust - up also raises issues for Obama .
Is he really a different kind of politician ?
Just last Sunday , Obama denounced what he called " slash and burn ' ' politics , but his campaign issued a slashing attack on Clinton .
" It 's not clear to me why would I be apologizing for someone else 's remarks , " Obama said in Iowa Wednesday night .
( Watch Obama refuse to apologize for Geffen 's comments . )
" My sense is that Mr. Geffen may have differences with the Clintons , " Obama said .
" That does n't really have anything to do with our campaign . "
Obama , though , quickly got back on the high road .
" I 've said repeatedly that I have the utmost respect for Sen. Clinton , and I have considered her an ally in the Senate , " Obama said .
In a polarized political environment , there 's a lot more strategic voting in the primaries .
" Democrats want a winner and it's not just the party insiders , and it's not just the political consultants , " Rothenberg said .
" It 's real people , real voters .
And so I think electability will be a crucial issue . "
The rule in politics is that when Candidate A and Candidate B start attacking each other , the benefit goes to Candidate C .
" If Sen. Clinton and Sen . Obama were engaged in a day - in , day - out bashing of each other , I think it probably would help somebody like John Edwards , who could stand above the fray and act presidential , " Rothenberg said .
" But we 're a long way from that . "
Do the polls say anything about who 's electable ?
Five national polls have come out this month pitting Clinton and Obama against Republican front - runners Rudy Giuliani and John McCain .
The results are always very close -- usually within the margin of error .
Nobody 's unelectable .
But nobody 's a sure winner either .
Two of the soldiers could face the death penalty if found guilty .
Seven other personnel are to face court martial over deaths in two separate cases , in north Iraq and in Hamdaniya .
Separately , President George W Bush in a TV interview acknowledged for the first time a parallel between Iraq and the Vietnam War .
Combat stress
The three court martial cases are further straining the relationship between the US and the Iraqi government , says the BBC's James Coomarasamy in Washington .
The first group , all soldiers from the 2nd Brigade of the elite 101st airborne division , were at the time serving in Mahmudiya , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) south of Baghdad .
They are charged with premeditated murder and rape .
Three are also charged with arson and housebreaking .
The military said Sgt Paul Cortez and Pfc Jesse Spielman could face the death penalty if found guilty , while Spc James P Barker and Pfc Bryan L Howard could face life - long jail terms .
The men are alleged to have helped a former private - Steven Green , who has since left the army - plan , carry out and cover up the attack .
Mr Green has pleaded not guilty in a federal court and will be tried separately in the US .
At hearings during the investigation , colleagues of the accused described intense combat stress , with troops left demoralised and emotionally drained by frequent insurgent attacks .
Propaganda
In the second case , four soldiers from the 3rd Brigade of the same division have been referred to court martial on murder charges .
President Bush 's allusion to Vietnam may raise eyebrows
Sgt Raymond Girouard , Spc William Hunsaker , Spc Juston Graber and Pfc Corey Clagett are accused in the shooting of three male Iraqi prisoners near Tikrit , Salahuddin province , in northern Iraq .
The detainees died during a US military operation near the Thar Thar Canal near Tikrit on 9 May 2006 .
The cases are two of several in which US soldiers serving in Iraq have been accused of abuses against Iraqis .
No dates have been set for the courts martial .
In his TV interview , Mr Bush agreed that the situation in Iraq could be compared with the 1968 Tet offensive in Vietnam , where the North Vietnamese inflicted a huge psychological blow on the Americans and their allies .
" There 's certainly a stepped - up level of violence , " Mr Bush said .
The White House later said Mr Bush was referring to propaganda and that the " enemy is trying to shake our will " .
The BBC's Justin Webb in Washington says that although Mr Bush appeared to be suggesting that steadiness of nerve could avoid a repeat of history , any comparison with Vietnam will raise eyebrows .
Cameras Protecting Other Cameras
There is a proposal in Scotland to protect automatic speed - trap cameras from vandals by monitoring them with other cameras .
Then , I suppose we need still other cameras to protect the camera - watching cameras .
I am reminded of a certain building corner in York .
Centuries ago it was getting banged up by carts and whatnot , so the owners stuck a post in the ground a couple of feet away from the corner to protect it .
Time passed , and the post itself became historically significant .
So now there is another post a couple of feet away from the first one to protect it .
When will it end ?

I 'm on record as predicting that we 'll understand what happened at the Big Bang within fifty years .
Not just the " Big Bang model " -- the paradigm of a nearly - homogeneous universe expanding from an early hot , dense , state , which has been established beyond reasonable doubt -- but the Bang itself , that moment at the very beginning .
So now is as good a time as any to contemplate what we already think we do and do not understand .
( Also , I 'll be talking about it Saturday night on Coast to Coast AM , so it 's good practice . )
There is something of a paradox in the way that cosmologists traditionally talk about the Big Bang .
They will go to great effort to explain how the Bang was the beginning of space and time , that there is no " before " or " outside , " and that the universe was ( conceivably ) infinitely big the very moment it came into existence , so that the pasts of distant points in our current universe are strictly non-overlapping .
All of which , of course , is pure moonshine .
When they choose to be more careful , these cosmologists might say " Of course we do n't know for sure , but ... "
Which is true , but it 's stronger than that : the truth is , we have no good reasons to believe that those statements are actually true , and some pretty good reasons to doubt them .
I 'm not saying anything avant - garde here .
Just pointing out that all of these traditional statements about the Big Bang are made within the framework of classical general relativity , and we know that this framework is n't right .
Classical GR convincingly predicts the existence of singularities , and our universe seems to satisfy the appropriate conditions to imply that there is a singularity in our past .
But singularities are just signs that the theory is breaking down , and has to be replaced by something better .
The obvious choice for " something better " is a sensible theory of quantum gravity ; but even if novel classical effects kick in to get rid of the purported singularity , we know that something must be going on other than the straightforward GR story .
There are two tacks you can take here .
You can be specific , by offering a particular model of what might replace the purported singularity .
Or you can be general , trying to reason via broad principles to argue about what kinds of scenarios might ultimately make sense .
Many scenarios have been put forward among the " specific " category .
We have of course the " quantum cosmology " program , that tries to write down a wavefunction of the universe ; the classic example is the paper by Hartle and Hawking .
There have been many others , including recent investigations within loop quantum gravity .
Although this program has led to some intriguing results , the silent majority or physicists seems to believe that there are too many unanswered questions about quantum gravity to take seriously any sort of head - on assault on this problem .
There are conceptual puzzles : at what point does spacetime make the transition from quantum to classical ?
And there are technical issues : do we really think we can accurately model the universe with only a handful of degrees of freedom , crossing our fingers and hoping that unknown ultraviolet effects do n't completely change the picture ?
It 's certainly worth pursuing , but very few people ( who are not zero - gravity tourists ) think that we already understand the basic features of the wavefunction of the universe .
At a slightly less ambitious level ( although still pretty darn ambitious , as things go ) , we have attempts to " smooth out " the singularity in some semi-classical way .
Aguirre and Gratton have presented a proof by construction that such a universe is conceivable ; essentially , they demonstrate how to take an inflating spacetime , cut it near the beginning , and glue it to an identical spacetime that is expanding the opposite direction of time .
This can either be thought of as a universe in which the arrow of time reverses at some special midpoint , or ( by identifying events on opposite sides of the cut ) as a one - way spacetime with no beginning boundary .
In a similar spirit , Gott and Li suggest that the universe could " create itself , " springing to life out of an endless loop of closed timelike curves .
More colorfully , " an inflationary universe gives rise to baby universes , one of which turns out to be itself . "
And of course , you know that there are going to be ideas based on string theory .
For a long time Veneziano and collaborators have been studying what they dub the pre-Big - Bang scenario .
This takes advantage of the scale - factor duality of the stringy cosmological field equations : for every cosmological solution with a certain scale factor , there is another one with the inverse scale factor , where certain fields are evolving in the opposite direction .
Taken literally , this means that very early times , when the scale factor is nominally small , are equivalent to very late times , when the scale factor is large !
I 'm skeptical that this duality survives to low - energy physics , but the early universe is at high energy , so maybe that 's irrelevant .
A related set of ideas have been advanced by Steinhardt , Turok , and collaborators , first as the ekpyrotic scenario and later as the cyclic universe scenario .
Both take advantage of branes and extra dimensions to try to follow cosmological evolution right through the purported Big Bang singularity ; in the ekpyrotic case , there is a unique turnaround point , whereas in the cyclic case there are an infinite number of bounces stretching endlessly into the past and the future .
Personally , I think that the looming flaw in all of these ideas is that they take the homogeneity and isotropy of our universe too seriously .
Our observable patch of space is pretty uniform on large scales , it 's true .
But to simply extrapolate that smoothness infinitely far beyond what we can observe is completely unwarranted by the data .
It might be true , but it might equally well be hopelessly parochial .
We should certainly entertain the possibility that our observable patch is dramatically unrepresentative of the entire universe , and see where that leads us .
Inflation makes it plausible that our local conditions do n't stretch across the entire universe .
In Alan Guth 's original scenario , inflation represented a temporary period in which the early universe was dominated by false - vacuum energy , which then went through a phase transition to convert to ordinary matter and radiation .
But it was eventually realized that inflation could be eternal -- unavoidable quantum fluctuations could keep inflation going in some places , even if it turns off elsewhere .
In fact , even if it turns off " almost everywhere , " the tiny patches that continue to inflate will grow exponentially in volume .
So the number of actual cubic centimeters in the inflating phase will grow without bound , leading to eternal inflation .
Andrei Linde refers to such a picture as self - reproducing .
If inflation is eternal into the future , maybe you do n't need a Big Bang ?
In other words , maybe it 's eternal into the past , as well , and inflation has simply always been going on ?
Borde , Guth and Vilenkin proved a series of theorems purporting to argue against that possibility .
More specifically , they show that a universe that has always been inflating ( in the same direction ) must have a singularity in the past .
But that 's okay .
Most of us suffer under the vague impression -- with our intuitions trained by classical general relativity and the innocent - sounding assumption that our local uniformity can be straightforwardly extrapolated across infinity -- that the Big Bang singularity is a past boundary to the entire universe , one that must somehow be smoothed out to make sense of the pre-Bang universe .
But the Bang is n't all that different from future singularities , of the type we 're familiar with from black holes .
We do n't really know what 's going on at black - hole singularities , either , but that does n't stop us from making sense of what happens from the outside .
A black hole forms , settles down , Hawking - radiates , and eventually disappears entirely .
Something quasi - singular goes on inside , but it 's just a passing phase , with the outside world going on its merry way .
The Big Bang could have very well been like that , but backwards in time .
In other words , our observable patch of expanding universe could be some local region that has a singularity ( or whatever quantum effects may resolve it ) in the past , but is part of a larger space in which many past - going paths do n't hit that singularity .
The simplest way to make this work is if we are a baby universe .
Like real - life babies , giving birth to universes is a painful and mysterious process .
There was some early work on the idea by Farhi , Guth and Guven , as well as Fischler , Morgan and Polchinski , which has been followed up more recently by Aguirre and Johnson .
The basic idea is that you have a background spacetime with small ( or zero ) vacuum energy , and a little sphere of high - density false vacuum .
( The sphere could be constructed in your secret basement laboratory , or may just arise as a thermal fluctuation . )
Now , if you 're not careful , the walls of the sphere will simply implode , leaving you with some harmless radiation .
To prevent that from happening , you have two choices .
One is that the size of the sphere is greater than the Hubble radius of your universe -- in our case , more than ten billion light years across , so that 's not very realistic .
The other is that your sphere is not simply embedded in the background , it 's connected to the rest of space by a " wormhole " geometry .
Again , you could imagine making it that way through your wizardry in gravitational engineering , or you could wait for a quantum fluctuation .
Truth is , we 're not very clear on how feasible such quantum fluctuations are , so there are no guarantees .
But if all those miracles occur , you 're all set .
Your false - vacuum bubble can expand from a really tiny sphere to a huge inflating universe , eventually reheating and leading to something very much like the local universe we see around us today .
From the outside , the walls of the bubble appear to collapse , leaving behind a black hole that will eventually evaporate away .
So the baby universe , like so many callous children , is completely cut off from communication with its parent .
( Perhaps " teenage universe " would be a more apt description . )
Everyone knows that I have a hidden agenda here , namely the arrow of time .
The thing we are trying to explain is not " why was the early universe like that ? " , but rather " why was the history of universe from one end of time to the other like that ? "
I would argue that any scenario that purports to explain the origin of the universe by simply invoking some special magic at early times , without explaining why they are so very different from late times , is completely sidestepping the real question .
For example , while the cyclic - universe model is clever and interesting , it is about as hopeless as it is possible to be from the point of view of the arrow of time .
In that model , if we knew the state of the universe to infinite precision and evolved it backwards in time using the laws of physics , we would discover that the current state ( and the state at every other moment of time ) is infinitely finely - tuned , to guarantee that the entropy will decrease monotonically forever into the past .
That 's just asserting something , not explaining anything .
The baby - universe idea at least has the chance to give rise to a spontaneous violation of time - reversal symmetry and explain the arrow of time .
If we start with empty space an evolve it forward , baby universes can ( hypothetically ) be born ; but the same is true if we run it backwards .
The increase of entropy does n't arise from a fine - tuning at one end of the universe 's history , it 's a natural consequence of the ability of the universe to always increase its entropy .
We 're a long way from completely understanding such a picture ; ultimately we 'll have to be talking about a Hilbert space of wavefunctions that involve an infinite number of disconnected components of spacetime , which has always been a tricky problem .
But the increase of entropy is a fact of life , right here in front of our noses , that is telling us something deep about the universe on the very largest scales .
Update :
On the same day I wrote this post , the cover story at New Scientist by David Shiga covers similar ground .
Sadly , subscription - only , which is no way to run a magazine .
The article also highlights the Banks - Fischler holographic cosmology proposal .
Pakistan suffers an embarrassing defeat in their crucial World Cup match with underdogs Ireland , making them the first country to be knocked out of the tournament .

A chambermaid finds the body of Woolmer , 58 , in his hotel room at the Pegasus Hotel in Kingston , Jamaica , at 10.45 am .
Efforts are made to revive him on the way to hospital but he never responds and is pronounced dead on arrival .
Tributes from the cricketing world start to pour in and it is initially thought he may have died from a heart attack .
It later emerges Woolmer 's last known communication with anyone was an email he sent to his wife Gill in Cape Town , at 3.12 am .
She says her husband was " really depressed " and could not believe Pakistan 's defeat to Ireland , but she rejects reports he had been drinking heavily and was on prescribed drugs for his type 2 diabetes as " rubbish " .
Tuesday , March 20 A first post - mortem examination proves " inconclusive " and Jamaican police announce they are treating the coach 's death as " suspicious " .
Deputy police commissioner Mark Shields says a full investigation is being carried out .
Asked directly if he is saying it was murder , he says : " No , we are not saying that , " although a spokesman later adds that nothing is being ruled out .

The devastated Pakistani team takes to the field for their final World Cup match as claims their coach has been murdered by the " match - fixing mafia " spreads across the world .
They beat Zimbabwe by 93 runs and dedicate the victory to him .
Police refuse to confirm or deny reports
Woolmer had been found with marks on his neck or that traces of poison had been found in the hotel room .
Former Pakistani fast - bowler Sarfraz Nawaz claims Woolmer 's death has " some connection with the match - fixing mafia " but his widow Gill says she does not think there is any conspiracy .
Thursday , March 22 : As police await the results of further pathology tests , Mrs Woolmer says in another interview that there is a " possibility " her husband has been murdered .
Police conclude their interviews with Pakistan players and fingerprint the team before their departure for Kingston airport .
Jamaican police later announce they have launched a murder inquiry after results of the further tests reveal the coach had died from asphyxia , as a result of manual strangulation .
Mr Shields says police have " lots of lines of inquiry " and are not ruling anything out , including the possibility more than one person was involved in the murder .

Today the Supreme Court will hear the case of “ Juneau , Alaska public schools ” v. “ Bong Hits 4 Jesus ” .
That ’s not the real name , but it ’s close enough so that no - one is confused about the litigants .
The essence of the case is that in 2002 , Joseph Frederick , a high school student , brought a large fold - out sign to an Olympic torch rally held across from his high school as it crossed the US on the way to the Salt Lake City Games .
The sign was not , in fact , supportive of the great Olympic spirit , a particular athlete , or one of town pride …
It simply said : “ Bong Hits 4 Jesus ” .
Simple , yet effective .
Anyway , his principal spotted the sign , ran across the road , and tore it down and crumpled it up .
Not completely satisfied , he then suspended Joseph for 5 days … and doubled the penalty when Joe came to school and used the words of Thomas Jefferson as defense .
Chaos ensued … and today the High Court will hear this case .
Go Joseph .
Now , I ’ll save the legal analysis here for one of the more “ intellectual ” or “ political ” - minded PBH-ers …
What I ’ve come to do today is to recreate this event in a digital manner .
My principal will certainly not be tearing down my sign or crumpling it , but I have a fear we may end up in a firestorm or causing political protests .
But … I have faith in my legal system and that the court will rule in Joseph ’s and our favor today .
And … so in good faith I present :
Bong Hits 4 Muhammad
THE US has adopted a new space policy that rejects future arms - control agreements and claims a right to deny access to space to anyone " hostile to American interests " .
The US President , George Bush , signed the new policy document , which emphasises security issues , encourages private enterprise in space and characterises the role of US space diplomacy mainly in terms of persuading other nations to support US policy .
" Freedom of action in space is as important to the United States as air power and sea power , " the policy says in its introduction .

But if I may be so bold as to offer a few tips ?
1. Location Location Location - Maybe it was the bathroom closest to your desk .
Maybe it has bigger stalls for more elbow room .
But whatever the reason , the bathroom just off the factory floor is not your best choice .
It is huge for a reason .
There are about 80 - 90 workers on that factory floor at all times , plus about 30 - 40 office workers , and there 's almost always at least one person who needs to take a squirt .
2. Silence is Golden -
While we all might empathize with your situation , NO ONE WANTS YOU HEAR YOU SLAP YOUR SALAMI !!
And we certainly do n't want to hear the gentle grunts you were letting out .
It was like being forced to listen to the audio of a bad gay porn soundtrack , minus the cheesy Casio keyboard jazz / funk fusion music .
Keep it down , will ya ?3 .
Ms Manners says ... -
Ok , so you had a poor choice in bathrooms and you are just naturally loud .
Even elemental problems such as these can be overcome by following rule # 3 .
When someone comes into the bathroom .... STOP !!!
Seriously , I 'd think that would be the easiest rule to follow .
Did you not hear me open the door ?
Did you not hear me pull the ass gasket from the holder , tear off those 3 annoying pieces that hold the center in place , and sit down ?
Good god man , another man is taking a shit not 8 feet away from you .
Should n't that take the bloom off the rose , so to speak ?
4 .
Good fences make good neighbors -
This is the most important rule of all .
If you have been caught rubbing one out in the men's room , do not , under any circumstances , come out of your stall until all affected parties have left the bathroom .
I 'm never going to be able to get the picture out of my head of you going over to the sink right next to the one I was at , and looking at me in your mirror with a big contented smile while you 're washing your hands .
They do n't make a body soap strong enough for the ick I felt after that .
No amount of showering tonight will do it I 'm afraid .
Talk to senior Israeli military officials , as I have recently , about how the Israeli government will respond to regional threats , and one hears the same refrain : " Wait for the Winograd findings . "
Well , we now know what they are .
The Winograd Commission , established last fall to investigate Israel 's war with Lebanon last summer , issued its preliminary report last week .
Among other things , Winograd holds the senior political and military leadership responsible for a hasty , poorly thought - out decision to go to war ; for failing to devise strategic goals that were either achievable or connected to the military plans ; and for not having the military prepared for the kind of war it had to fight .
Given these conclusions , many now wonder how long Ehud Olmert will remain Israel 's prime minister .
I wonder , however , how they will influence Israel 's response to the multiplicity of challenges which loom on the horizon .
How long will Israel tolerate Hamas 's buildup of arms and longer - range rockets in Gaza ?
Will it continue to passively watch as Hezbollah is re-supplied with a new arsenal of weaponry in direct violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 ?
How will it respond , if at all , to the signs -- significant new arms buildup , qualitatively different exercises , heightened readiness levels , and redeployment of forces -- that Syria is positioning itself for the possibility of conflict with Israel ?
And , is the time approaching when Israel decides that the international efforts to stop the Iranian nuclear program are progressing too slowly and that it must act on its own ?
I have little doubt that the Israel Defense Forces are learning the tactical and logistical lessons of the war last summer .
But the real question is how it will apply these lessons to fight -- or avoid -- the next conflict .
Paradoxically , I see two competing impulses among former and current Israeli security officials : Israel cannot wait for Hamas or Hezbollah to continue to acquire the military means that will make another round very costly to Israel .
Alternatively , now is the time to reach out to Syria .
The former impulse is driven , not only by the need to minimize the cost of what Hamas or Hezbollah can impose on Israel , but also by the perception that Israel must restore its deterrent .
Proving itself in a new conflict with either or both would have an effect on Syria and potentially even Iran -- or so this thinking goes .
The latter impulse is that another round with Hezbollah may well be inevitable , but this time Syria will not be allowed to stoke the conflict and sit on the sidelines with impunity .
As such , Israel , according to the military officials I spoke with , could be at war with Syria in the coming year , and if Syrian President Bashar Assad is willing to talk , should n't Israel engage Syria and see if a war can be averted ?
( For some , there is the possible added benefit that discussions with Syria might also be useful for weaning Syria away Iran and for imposing limits on Hezbollah and Hamas . )
To date , the pressure within the Israeli defense establishment to talk to Syria has not persuaded Olmert to drop his opposition to such talks -- opposition that stems in no small part from the Bush administration being dead - set against the Israelis taking up Assad on his willingness to sit down with them .
As far as the administration is concerned , Syria wants to use such talks , not to make peace , but to get Lebanon back and to forestall an international tribunal on the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri .
The Bush administration may be right .
Assad may have no genuine interest in making peace with Israel ; his continuing support for Hezbollah and Hamas and his bombastic rhetoric about Israel hardly suggest someone who is ready to end a conflict and accept reconciliation .
But if the Israeli military is right and the prospects for war in the coming year with Syria and Hezbollah are increasing as the rearming of Hezbollah continues unabated , what exactly would be lost by testing Assad 's call for talks ?
Too often the Bush administration has treated " talking " as if it means conceding .
But talks are not synonymous with surrender .
Rather , they can be a way of exercising leverage .
Consider one of the current realities in the Middle East : Iran , Hezbollah , and Hamas all refuse to recognize Israel ; all suggest that peace need not and should not be made with Israel ; all reject a two state solution ; and all claim to represent the wave of the future .
What does it say about their position and their claims if Syria -- supposedly a part of their nexus -- is opting out and talking to Israel ?
Does n't it suggest that , in fact , their position is not so dominant and that everything is not going their way ?
Statecraft requires recognizing where one has leverage and where one 's adversaries have vulnerabilities .
Syria 's relationship with Iran and Hezbollah is tactical not strategic .
There is no guarantee that by talking , the Israelis -- or the United States -- will suddenly be able to wean Syria away from Iran or Hezbollah .
It is entirely possible that neither the Israelis nor the United States can or should pay what Syria wants .
But if war is an increasing possibility and if there is tactical benefit in demonstrating that even Syria feels the need to talk to Israel , it is hard to see what is lost by doing so .
On the contrary , there are at least two additional reasons for being open to such talks at this time .
First , since Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has now met with the Syrian foreign minister under the umbrella of the regional conference on Iraq , it becomes harder to maintain that Israel must keep its distance .
Second , in the aftermath of the Winograd interim findings , Olmert ( or his successor ) is not likely to be in a rush to go to war -- at least not without feeling confident that he can show the Israeli public that a war is unavoidable and that there are clear objectives that are achievable at reasonable costs .
Will any Israeli leader be able to do that if they do n't first take up the Syrian offer to talk ?
The lesson here is that the Bush administration needs to think far more carefully about its position on talks with the Syrians .
Rather than simply telling the Israelis " no , " it should work out a coordinated game plan with the Israelis , including common red lines for the talks .
It should coordinate with the Lebanese to reassure Prime Minister Fouad Siniora 's government about the purpose of the talks -- and then give them regular briefings on what takes place in them .
Ultimately , the Bush administration has very little interest in an Israeli - Syrian war .
Maybe it is time for it to shape an approach to negotiations and not allow either the United States or Israel to be driven into talks in a way that reduces our respective leverage .
That would be an act of effective statecraft .

The US House and Senate Democrats have passed supplemental funding bills for Iraq and Afghanistan which , for the first time , put conditions of oversight upon such funding , which past Republican Congresses had merely rubberstamped , with added pork .
President Bush has cried “ Wolf ! ”
His attack upon the bill first relied upon claims that the people were with him ; “ I believe the American people support me . ”
But a large majority of Americans do not support the Bush administration ’s “ surge ” , nor should they .
Next , Mr. Bush ramps up the Karl Rovian rhetoric claiming Democrats embolden our enemies for their next attack upon America “ on these shores . ”
Having lost the “ evil empire ” as enemy , Bush and his ilk now have the “ axis of evil ” and the “ Global War on Terror ” to trot out to frighten us into making ever more precipitous preparations for “ the next attack . ”
The Democratic bills fully fund our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Democratic bills fully train our troops before any future deployments .
The Democratic bills fully supply our troops before deployment and up - armor our equipment for our troops before deployment and for those now in the field .
Each of these would be legislatively required for the first time since the start of George W. Bush ’s elective war .
The Democratic bills set benchmarks ( for the U.S. regarding training and equipment and for the Iraqis in establishing civil society ) to meet before deployment of new troops and for our later phased - in withdrawal of major troop .
We ’ll have our people home , their country safe for their democracy ( or not , as they choose ) .
The Bush plan , however , is to cry wolf again .
The myriad squadrons of right wing neocon Brown Shirt weblog echochambering yobbo yappers will join in .
“ Wolf ! ” The Bush “ surge ” will not bring US troop levels up to previously higher levels in Iraq , even as more and more of our coalition partners abandon Mr. Bush ’s “ war . ”
The Bush “ surge ” uses US troops to support Shi’ite suppression of Sunni insurgents in the capitol area , and ignores the rest of the country , and the Shi’ite militias continue to kill and maim US and coalition troops daily .
Most prominent among these is the Mahdi army of al Sadr which has killed and wounded thousands of US and coalition troops since the fall of Baghdad ( perhaps earlier ) more casualties pour in daily .
And what will the Kurds do with their de facto country ?
Claim oil rights and fight off all comers ?
That ’s my bet , and my money ’s on the Kurds !
The Bush theory :
The “ surge ” will clear and secure the capitol and everywhere else in Iraq will suddenly fall in line after four plus years of vicious sectarian warfare among radical militant groups which hate each other and hate us even more .
I think not .
If one follows Einstein by defining insanity as repeating the same activity over and over and over again , and each time expecting a different result , then Mr. Bush needs serious help .
Fortunately , the Democratic House and Senate are giving Mr. Bush the help he needs .
If Mr. Bush had a plan , any plan , or provided any leadership which made a difference instead of Rummy 24/7 , the Democrats would not have to act .
I do not excuse past Democratic failures in leadership , but now that they are in charge , they have acted properly and quickly to make Mr. Bush accountable to the American people on Iraq .
If the Democrats had failed or refused to take the actions they have now taken , they would have been no better than Mr. Bush — insane .
As hard as it is to believe , the Bush administration is at odds with one of its biggest supporters — the religious right — in the Supreme Court battle over " Bong Hits 4 Jesus . "
No , the staunchly conservative religious right has n't gone hippie , but it has allied with some unlikely partners on the left in one of the most important school free - speech cases in a half - century .
In fact , the case of Morse vs. Frederick could have serious implications on the limits of speech in public schools for generations to come , with one expert saying that a win for the administration 's side could create schools in which any form of speech that is n't directly related to the " stated educational mission " is stamped out and forbidden .
The case stems from 2002 , when students in Juneau , Alaska , schools were allowed to leave school grounds to watch the Olympic torch being carried through the streets of their town on the way to Salt Lake City .
As cheerleaders and the school band performed , a Juneau - Douglas High School student named Joseph Frederick and some friends unfurled a 14 - foot banner that read " Bong Hits 4 Jesus " just as cameras were passing them .
Principal Deborah Morse demanded that Frederick — who had clashed with school officials in the past and has admitted he flew the banner to tweak administrators — take down the banner .
He claimed it was just a joke derived from a nonsensical phrase he'd seen on a snowboard and was meant only to get him on television , not to condone drugs or religion .
When Frederick refused to roll up the banner , Morse ripped it down and gave him a 10 - day suspension , saying he was on a school - sponsored outing and it was her right to prevent him from espousing a view that could be seen as damaging to other students .
Frederick sued , asserting his free - speech rights had been violated and , so far , he 's won in court .
In the subsequent court cases , the school has argued that it had a right to limit speech that promotes illegal behavior and runs counter to school policy , such as promoting a pro-drug message .
Now Frederick awaits the Supreme Court 's take on the first major case pitting school administrators against dissenting students since the Vietnam - era Tinker vs. Des Moines School District , in which the court ruled that students could wear black armbands to school to protest the Vietnam War .
Though the court ruled after Tinker that schools have the right to limit student speech that is deemed vulgar or offensive and to control the content of school newspapers , the strange bedfellows in this case have aligned to fight the limitation of speech that could result in what some are calling " viewpoint censorship , " which Christian lawyers argue could run the gamut from anti-abortion T - shirts to anti-war banners to Bible clubs .
It is because of that fear — that a loss by Frederick could have a chilling effect on free speech of all kinds in schools — that such traditional foes as gay - rights , free - speech and religious - rights organizations have banded together in support of the now 23 - year - old Frederick .
The Bush administration has lined up behind the principals and the Juneau School Board , who are represented by notorious former Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr , while Frederick has garnered support from the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Coalition Against Censorship , as well as groups that have traditionally supported the religious right .
Among the groups that have submitted briefs in support of Frederick and have typically filed suit and spoken on behalf of the religious right in free - speech cases in the past are the Rutherford Institute , whose president , John Whitehead , said he got involved because of what he sees as the emerging " zero tolerance " polices in schools .
" Schools have become like prisons , where students are discouraged from using free speech and there 's this draconian atmosphere , " he said .
" When someone who is on a private sidewalk and said he was joking around and not advocating drugs or religion and was not on public ground ... the point of the case is , ' Can a school extend its authority off grounds and punish someone for a free - speech issue ? ' "
Whitehead said the Supreme Court has been very clear in the past that school administrations can control obscene speech , but if a phrase like " bong hit " is now considered obscene , he thinks we 're in trouble .
" The Bush administration has a drug phobia , " he said .
" And I think they 're wrong on this case .
I do n't think they see it as a religious issue but as a drug issue .
We do n't see it as a drug issue , we see it as a free - speech one . "
Though the Rutherford Institute has supported the administration in the past , Whitehead said he 's adamant about opposing the White House this time because his group is primarily a free - speech one .
But he sees the support from staunch religious - rights law organizations such as Pat Robertson 's American Center for Law and Justice and the Christian Legal Society as speaking to the bigger issues at stake .
" They want to make sure people can hand out bibles in front of schools ... or anti-war pamphlets , " Whitehead said .
What they might get , though , according to University of Michigan Law School professor Douglas Laycock , an expert on constitutional issues involving religion , is a ruling that says students cannot advocate anything that is a violation of school rules , such as drugs .
" What the Bush administration is asking for high schools would give them discretion to suppress any speech that is inconsistent with what the school defines as part of its mission , " he said .
" Which would be anything they have a notion to suppress . "
With schools around the country already restricting what students can post on their MySpace pages , making athletes sign no - drug pledges and get drug tested , and bouncing students for wearing T - shirts with messages they consider offensive or disruptive , the free - speech battleground in hallways has been red - hot for several years .
But Laycock said the ruling in this case could have far - reaching effects because of the vague way the case against Frederick is being pursued .
" Lots of schools are saying we do n't do controversy or politics , and our mission is to create a calm , quiet learning environment , and anything controversial is inconsistent with that , " he said , explaining that Starr has seized on what Laycock described as an out - of - context reading of an earlier school - speech case as the thrust of his argument .
" In that case [ Bethel vs. Fraser , 1986 ] it was not about ideas , but vulgarity .
A student was running for class president and gave a speech at a student assembly that was one sexual pun after another and he got suspended .
He sued and the court ruled that the school could require that messages be delivered in appropriate ways and prevent things that are inconsistent with their fundamental mission . "
Taken out of context by Starr , Laycock said , the phrase is being used to label any " inconsistent " speech in an open - ended way , which could run the risk of encompassing anything from anti-war speeches to religious language to any anti-authority opinions .
In the case of the Juneau School Board , as part of its requirement to receive federal money under the 1994 Safe and Drug - Free Schools and Communities Act , its mission includes the opposition of illegal drug use , according to The New York Times .
" I do n't think the court will go there , " Laycock said , " but they 've moved an awfully long way to the right , and that seems to be what the administration wants .
The Times reported that Starr seemed eager to go up against many of his old cronies .
" It 's reassuring to have lots of friends of liberty running around , " he said in what was described as a cheerful tone .
" I welcome this outpouring because it will help the court see that it should n't go too far either way . "

NAMING NAMES IN OTHER PLACES NAMING NAMES IN OTHER PLACES
Though anthropologists know of no world cultures in which men uniformly take on their wives ' family names upon marriage , there are some variations in the naming traditions for wives and children .
Among them : • In many Middle Eastern nations , including Iran , Yemen , Jordan and Syria , Muslim women retain their own names after marriage out of respect for their fathers .
In some cases , they must get a court order if they wish to go by their husband 's surname .
• In Spain and several Central American and South American nations , including Venezuela , many married women traditionally retain their birth names .
Children typically get the surnames of both parents , though the father 's is usually the one used by the child and handed on to the next generation .
• In Iceland , most people do not have family names .
Instead , someone 's second name usually indicates who their father is .
For example , Joe 's son John is known as John Joeson , John 's son Jay would be Jay Johnson , and so on .
Novel first names must be approved by the Icelandic Naming Committee .
Sometimes the mother 's name is used instead , although it is rare and usually indicates a rift with the father .
• In the United Kingdom , Prince Charles ' full formal name is Charles Mountbatten - Windsor , taking and generally using the family name , Windsor , of his mother , Queen Elizabeth II .
Mountbatten was the family name of the queen 's husband , Prince Philip .
The naming of Charles and his siblings required an act of Parliament in 1960 and was done to preserve the Windsor name .

The newlyweds knew it would be surprising , but they never expected it to go quite so badly .
As Donna and Mike entered their wedding reception , an unwitting announcer told the expectant crowd , " Ladies and gentleman , put your hands together for the new Mr. and Mrs. Salinger ! "
Some guests clapped , some chuckled at what they presumed was a joke and most looked at one another in confusion .
The couple spent the entire reception and some of their honeymoon explaining to people what they had done .
The groom , you see , had started his day as Mike Davis and ended it by doing something precious few of his brothers - in - arms do :
He took his wife 's last name instead of her taking his .
" Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought it would have caused as much of a stir as it did , " says Mike Salinger , 27 , of Seattle , who was married in November .
" We knew people might be surprised , but we figured they 'd say ' Huh ' and get on with it .
" Three months later , I 'm still taking ( flak ) from one of my college roommates . "
Breaking with the ' norm '
The Salingers broke a patriarchal tradition so ingrained in American society that many women 's studies researchers have yet to study it .
" I 'm sure somewhere there 's some anthropologist or someone who has looked at this , but I do n't know of any , " says Nancy Lutkehaus , chair of the Gender Studies program at the University of Southern California .
" It has n't been a large enough social phenomenon that it's hit the radar as something to be studied . "
That may be coming .
The California Legislature is set to consider a bill this month that would allow men to change their surnames upon marriage as seamlessly as women now can .
Only seven states now allow a man who wishes to alter his name after his wedding to do so without going through the laborious , frequently expensive legal process set out by the courts for any name change .
Women do n't have to do so .
The bill is co-sponsored by the ACLU of California as a follow - up to a federal lawsuit the civil rights group filed in December on behalf of Michael Buday , a Los Angeles man who wants to take on his wife 's surname , Bijon , to show his affinity for his father - in - law .
He accuses the state of gender discrimination for forcing him into the more complex process .
" We have the perfect marriage application for the 17th century , " says ACLU attorney Mark Rosenbaum , who is litigating the case .
Buday did not respond to requests for an interview .
" Every place Michael went , he had the door shut in his face or he was ridiculed . "
Mike Salinger , who said it cost him about $ 350 to change his name legally , concedes he changed his name " because I 'm a big ole granola liberal and I wanted to tweak the tradition while showing my wife I love her . "
The ' hyphenating ' option
But his and Buday 's approach is only one , and perhaps the boldest , possible variation .
A more frequent — if not common — occurrence , wedding consultant Sharon Naylor says , is for both members of a couple to take on both last names .
" I 'm seeing men and women discussing the possibility of hyphenating their names together more than I did before because both have a vested interest in keeping the last name they 've built their careers under , " says Naylor , a New Jersey - based author of 32 books on weddings .
" If the groom is considering it , there 's always a concern of ' What will the people think at the office ?
What will my father think ? ' " Christopher Sclafani and Jeannie Rhee avoided the wedding - night scene the Salingers endured by instructing their deejay not to introduce them with their last names , but their decision to take on both names without a hyphen caused other problems .
The new Christopher Sclafani Rhee was immediately and persistently called Mr. Rhee , which most people assumed was his whole last name .
" People could not handle the idea that a man had a two - part last name , " says the 34 - year - old Washington , D.C. , lawyer .
" The first couple of months were incredibly jarring .
Then we realized both are hard names to spell and to explain , so I just accepted this ( Rhee ) as my new last name . "
' Turn in your man card ' Sam Van Hallgren , 32 , co-host of the movie - review podcast Filmspotting , had to explain himself not just to his listeners but even to his co-host , Adam Kempenaar .
Kempenaar was caught by surprise the first time Van Hallgren introduced himself at the top of their show with his new name .
Van Hallgren was formerly Sam Hallgren until he wed Carrie Van Deest in August and they both took on the new , combined names .
Van Hallgren received a scathing note from a longtime listener with a subject line that read , " Sam , turn in your man card . "
The listener asked what " sissy juice " the host was drinking .
The Van Hallgrens , who live in Milwaukee , say they did it for their future children .
The idea of merging names , which Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa also did when the former Antonio Villar wed the former Corina Raigosa in 1987 , started out for Sam and Carrie as a joke .
Then , while talking with a friend who was surprised Carrie would take Sam 's name , Sam first uttered the merged version and they both liked it .
" I feared that people would think I did it to suggest more people should do it , " he says .
" But I did n't .
It just made sense for us . "

This US soldier is right .
Why do we fly the flag at half - staff for the VA Tech victims , for deceased US Senators and judges , but not for our soldiers fallen in war ?
A U.S. Army sergeant complained in a rare opinion article that the U.S. flag flew at half - staff last week at the largest U.S. base in Afghanistan for those killed at Virginia Tech , but the same honor is not given to fallen U.S. troops here and in Iraq .
In the article issued Monday by the public affairs office at Bagram military base north of Kabul , Sgt. Jim Wilt lamented that his comrades ' deaths have become a mere blip on the TV screen , lacking the " shock factor " to be honored by the flag as the deaths at Virginia Tech were .
" I find it ironic that the flags were flown at half - staff for the young men and women who were killed at VT , yet it is never lowered for the death of a U.S. service member , " Wilt wrote .
We should pass legislation requiring the flags to fly at half - staff for 24 hours each time a US soldier is killed during war time .
Is that too much a sacrifice for us to make , considering the ultimate sacrifice we ask of our soldiers ?
Yes , every day we lose scores of soldiers in Iraq , and thus it means our flags would likely fly at half - staff every day until the war in Iraq is over .
But what better way to honor the brave Americans service members who gave their lives for their country ?
Are we to punish them , refuse to honor them , simply because too many of them have given their lives for us ?
The magnitude of their numbers is all the more reason to honor them , not shun them .
And in spite of what the soldier says in his open letter , let 's have none of this " flying the flags at half - staff one sole day to honor all of our fallen troops " - we do n't fly the flag just one day a year to collectively honor every senator or judge who died that year .
We should fly the flag at half - staff every day a US service member is killed in war .
There is simply no excuse for anyone to refuse to honor our war dead who have given much more for their country than a senator or a judge .
Someone on the Hill , and our veterans ' organizations , should demand that legislation today .
A protein once thought to play a role only in the immune system could hold a clue to one of the great puzzles of neuroscience : how do the highly malleable and plastic brains of youth settle down into a relatively stable adult set of neuronal connections ?
Harvard Medical School researchers report in the August 17 Science Express that adult mice lacking the immune system protein paired - immunoglobulin like receptor - B ( PirB ) had brains that retained the plasticity of much younger brains , suggesting that PirB inhibits such plasticity .
Intriguingly , brains of immature PirB - deprived mice also exhibited greater plasticity than brains endowed with the protein .
Taken together , the results have important implications for the future study and repair of the brain .
“ Our study of mutant mice lacking PirB function reveals that at all ages , even during critical periods when circuits are prone to change , there are active molecular mechanisms that function to limit synaptic plasticity , ” said Josh Syken , HMS instructor in neurobiology and lead author of the study .
One way to promote new connections in brains damaged by disease or injury might be to target PirB .
“ The implications here should attract broad interest outside the field of developmental neuroscience because molecules and mechanisms that oppose neuronal plasticity represent new targets for therapy to re-establish damaged connections following spinal cord injury , head injury or stroke , ” said Syken , who carried out the study with Carla Shatz , Nathan Marsh Pusey professor of neurobiology at HMS , and colleagues .
Plasticity , the ability of functional brain circuits to change in response to experience - dependent neuronal activity , is largely restricted to critical periods of development .
In their classic Nobel - prize winning experiments , David Hubel and Torsten Weisel showed that visual areas of the brain are responsive to environmental cues during a discrete period early in life , after which they do not change .
Researchers have successfully identified proteins that promote such critical periods of plasticity but less is known about the proteins that stabilize neuronal connections .
Several years ago , Shatz and colleagues made the surprising discovery that MHC Class I genes are turned on in neurons by neuronal activity and in fact are required for normal synaptic plasticity .
In the immune system , MHC Class I proteins teach immune cells which cells to attack .
They do this by interacting with a large number of receptors found on the surface of immune cells .
Syken , Shatz and colleagues wondered whether such receptors might also be expressed in neurons and involved in MHC Class I -mediated synaptic plasticity .
Using a method called in situ hybridization , they found that the MHC Class I receptor PirB is expressed widely throughout the brain and at all ages .
To see how PirB was functioning , they generated a mouse deficient in PirB .
At first sight , the mutant ’s brain appeared normal .
To get a better sense of how PirB might be affecting plasticity , they decided to focus on the visual cortex .
In their earlier work , Hubel and Weisel showed that suturing or removing one eye causes projections from the remaining eye to invade the area that normally represents the blocked eye .
This shift is strictly limited to a critical period of development early in life .
Syken and his colleagues sutured one eye in their adult mutant mice , and also in controls , for several days .
They exposed the open eye to light and , using the activity - sensitive gene Arc as their guide , looked to see which neurons in the cortex were activated .
The PirB mutant adults exhibited a robust expansion of the area in visual cortex that responds to the open eye , suggesting that new connections representing the open eye had formed .
They repeated the experiment with younger mice and found , somewhat unexpectedly , that plasticity was enhanced even during the immature period .
“ Other factors have been shown to restrict plasticity after the critical period , but we believe that this is one of the first proteins shown to act in this way throughout life , ” Syken said .
“ Our discovery implies that there are mechanisms that enable , and also those that oppose synaptic plasticity in a push - pull fashion . ”
“ Our discovery underscores further the fascinating and common molecular parallels between the nervous system and the immune system , where PirB was first studied .
The discovery of a neuronal receptor for MHC Class I opens up a completely new avenue for thinking about broader roles for this family of molecules beyond the immune system , ” he said .

Hinode Early Operations and Near - Future Plans
The sun-observing Hinode satellite ( formerly Solar - B ) of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) was launched from the Uchinoura Space Center , Kagoshima Prefecture , Kyushu , Japan , on September 22 , 2006 at 21:36 GMT , aboard the seventh in JAXA 's series of M - V rockets .
For two weeks the satellite carried out orbit adjustments , and is now in a sun-synchronous orbit , which allows it to observe the sun for uninterrupted periods lasting months at a time .
Hinode contains three instruments dedicated to observing the sun : the Solar Optical Telescope ( SOT ) , the X - Ray Telescope ( XRT ) , and the EUV Imaging Spectrometer ( EIS ) .
Each of the instruments have now opened their protective doors and successfully commenced test observations .
Consequently , JAXA announces that the primary post - launch events of the satellite have been completed .
Currently , Hinode 's power systems and attitude pointing are stable .
For approximately the next month , activities will progress from testing the basic operational aspects of the telescopes , to implementing the scientific operation mode .
During this period , from time to time we plan to release images and telescope - performance information on the homepage for each instrument , or through other sources .
We expect to complete adjustments of the instruments and enter the scientific observation phase of the mission early in December 2006 .
At that time we intend to release a summary of initial scientific findings obtained from the test images .
Below is an outline of the initial instrument performance and plans for near - future Hinode activities .
1 ) SOT opened its front door on October 25 , and immediately began taking engineering test images and performing focus adjustments .
Attachment 1 shows an image taken during this testing phase with SOT 's broadband filter .
From this and similar images we have confirmed that SOT is achieving very high spatial resolution of 0.2 arcseconds , a primary objective of the instrument .
We also have determined that the spectropolarimeter , SOT 's primary instrument for detailed measurements of the solar magnetic field , is exceeding its expected levels of performance .
Currently , however , proper performance of SOT 's narrowband filter is limited to only a portion of the filter 's field of view .
The SOT instrument team is investigating measures to overcome this issue .
2 ) Shortly after launch , XRT experienced unexpectedly high temperatures near the front of the telescope tube .
This resulted in its front door opening earlier than expected .
Nonetheless , it successfully commenced taking high quality test images on October 23 , and has been performing well ever since ( attachment 2 ) .
We have verified that the telescope is meeting its expected level of performance , and the test images show that its observing capabilities exceed those of the highly successful soft X - ray telescope of the Yohkoh satellite , with spatial resolution reaching nearly 1 arcsecond .
3 ) EIS opened its door on October 28 and immediately began taking " spectroscopic imaging " data , allowing us to verify that it is operating properly .
This instrument takes spectroscopic images using either a spectroscopic slit or a wider " slot . "
Data from EIS consist of mixed positional and wavelength information .
We plan to release more complete test images after completing the analysis needed to extract the imaging information from the raw data .
A preliminary spectral image is shown in attachment 3 .

The poisoning death of Alexander Litvinenko in November caused by the radioactive isotope polonium - 210 sparked a sharp interest in the exotic material , but the onetime Russian spy was not the first to swallow the lethal element .
At the height of World War II , in an isolated medical ward at the University of Rochester in New York , Dr. Robert M. Fink gave water laced with polonium - 210 to a terminal cancer patient and injected four others with the isotope .
None of the five apparently died from the minute doses , though one succumbed to his cancer six days later .
The ethically dubious experiment , prompted by concern for the safety of workers in the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb , yielded the first solid information about the isotope ’s health effects on humans .
It also underscores the mystery and intrigue that have marked the history of the element since it was discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie a century ago .
The isotope has left a distinctive trail of deaths , most of them a consequence of ignorance .

Although scientists suspected polonium - 210 was dangerous , they failed to appreciate how easily it could spread -- escaping laboratory confinement like a genie from a bottle and spreading its lethal radiation on faint currents of air .
Engineers have struggled to find a use for the isotope , incorporating it for a time in spark plugs , nuclear warhead triggers and spacecraft power supplies .
It plays a small role today as an antistatic agent for printing presses .
Assassins may have finally hit on its most effective use .
“ The scientific community is intrigued ” by Litvinenko ’s slaying , said radiation biologist David A. Dooley , who studied exposure levels in workers who produced polonium for the Manhattan Project .
“ It ’s pretty clever they came up with this . ”

In many ways , polonium - 210 is an ideal poison for espionage -- deadly , and undetectable until it ’s too late .
A dose of the white powder smaller than a grain of salt could have been dropped into Litvinenko ’s drink at the Millennium Hotel ’s Pine Bar in London without altering the taste , according to chemist John Emsley of Cambridge University .
Within minutes of ingestion , the energetic particles shooting off the polonium - 210 molecules began killing the cells lining Litvinenko ’s gastrointestinal tract .
As the cells sloughed off , they caused nausea , severe internal bleeding and enormous pain .
“ It was as if his internal organs received a severe sunburn and peeled , ” said Peter Zimmerman , a physicist at King ’s College London .

Pound for pound , polonium - 210 is at least a million times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide , the poison used to execute prisoners in gas chambers , according to medical toxicology books .
Radiation safety experts calculate that a single gram of polonium could kill 50 million people and sicken another 50 million .
But it is extremely hard to get .
About 100 grams -- or 3 1/2 ounces -- are produced each year , primarily by Russia .
It is also elusive .
Whereas most radioactive elements emit gamma rays , which register on radiation detectors , polonium - 210 instead emits alpha particles .
“ There was no way that forensic scientists could detect it ” until it had done its damage , Emsley said .

Unlike other radioactive elements , polonium - 210 is relatively safe to transport .
Highly lethal gamma rays pass through most substances , but alpha particles -- each composed of two protons and two neutrons -- can be blocked by a sheet of paper or the thin layer of dead cells on the surface of the skin .
To kill , polonium must be inhaled or ingested so that it is in direct contact with healthy tissue .
“ I could put it in a tiny Ziploc bag , and I would be fine , ” said Dooley , president and chief executive of MJW Corp. , a consulting firm in Amherst , N.Y. , that specializes in radiological and health physics services .
But that does n’t mean it ’s easy to handle .
Polonium - 210 is a determined escape artist .

The energy produced as it naturally disintegrates is so great that “ small chunks , perhaps a few hundred atoms in size , are blasted out of the surface and then drift around the room , ” Zimmerman said .
“ It would tend to creep around the lab , ” Dooley said .
“ If you had polonium in an open jar and you left it overnight , the next thing you knew , it would be all over the lab .
It would jump on a dust particle and end up on lab benches and floors and things . ”
Since identifying polonium - 210 as the poison that killed Litvinenko , investigators have found traces of it in hotel rooms , airplanes , embassy rooms and other sites in the U.S. and Europe visited by Andrei Lugovoy , a former KGB bodyguard who is considered a potential suspect in the case .
Lugovoy has said he is being set up by persons unknown .
Polonium - 210 is found in very low concentrations in Earth ’s crust .
It makes its way into plants , food and water , and occurs in trace amounts in tobacco smoke .
Most people ’s bodies contain about one - millionth the level of a toxic dose , said Vilma Hunt , who studied the health effects of polonium - 210 at the Harvard School of Public Health .

Of polonium ’s 25 isotopes , polonium - 210 is the most stable .
After 138 days , half of it decays into a nonradioactive isotope of lead .
It takes 10 half - lives -- about three years -- for all of it to be converted into lead .
In the process , it emits a significant amount of heat .
A 1 - gram lump will reach more than 500 degrees Fahrenheit .
The first polonium death occurred in 1927 .
The victim was Nobus Yamada , a Japanese researcher in Marie Curie ’s lab in France .
In 1924 , he worked with Curie ’s daughter Irene Joliot - Curie to prepare polonium sources .
After returning home the next year , Yamada fell ill .

“ There was a poisoning from the emanations , ” he wrote Irene , according to Susan Quinn , author of “ Marie Curie : A Life . ”
Marie and Pierre Curie discovered polonium while they were searching for the cause of excess radiation in a uranium - rich ore called pitchblende .
In 1898 , they traced the radiation to a substance that they dubbed radium F . When Marie Curie determined that it was a unique element , she named it polonium to bring attention to the plight of her homeland , Poland , which had been partitioned among Russia , Prussia and Austria .
The Curies ’ daughter Irene also fell victim to the isotope .
She died of leukemia in 1956 , 10 years after a sealed capsule of polonium - 210 was accidentally broken in her laboratory at the Radium Institute in Paris .
About the same time , scientists developing Israel ’s nuclear program were exposed to its lethal effects .

The first signs of contamination were the traces of radiation on the laboratory desk of Israeli physicist Dror Sadeh .
He had taken what he thought were adequate precautions against the hyperactive element .
But those precautions were n’t enough .
Radiation was discovered “ in my private home , and on my hands too and on everything that I touched , ” he wrote in his diary .
Within a month , one student who worked in Sadeh ’s lab at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot , Israel , was dead from leukemia .
The lab ’s supervisor died a few years later -- contaminated by polonium - 210 as well , Sadeh suspected .
As a product , polonium - 210 has been mediocre at best .

Its first use was in automobile spark plugs .
The alpha particles emitted during its decay helped produce a stronger spark , claimed a 1929 patent issued to J.H. Dillon of the Firestone Tire & Rubber Co .
The company began marketing the plugs in 1940 , but their benefits were never proved .
Polonium - 210 played a key role in World War II .
Manhattan Project engineers alloyed the isotope with beryllium and used it to produce the neutrons that triggered the atomic bomb ’s chain reaction .
Because of polonium ’s short half - life , the nuclear triggers lost their effectiveness in two years and had to be continually replaced .
By the 1970s , engineers abandoned it in favor of the hydrogen isotope tritium , with a half - life of 12.3 years .

Polonium was considered as a power source for U.S. satellites , but its short half - life again limited its utility , and plutonium was used instead .
The Soviets , however , did employ polonium to keep their Lunokhod moon rovers running in the 1970s .
Engineers finally found a viable use for it in printing plants and textile mills , capitalizing on its electron - grabbing ability to neutralize the static electricity generated by moving sheets of paper or fabric .
Typically , a small amount of the radioactive material is embedded in a gold foil that is placed near the sources of static electricity .
It is also used in photo labs , embedded in the bristles of cleaning brushes to counter the static electricity that causes dust to cling to pictures .
Polonium - 210 could theoretically be extracted from either the foil or the brushes in a quantity sufficient to poison someone , Emsley said , but it would require a sophisticated knowledge of chemistry and a well - equipped laboratory .

Most of the research about polonium - 210 ’s health effects stemmed from concerns for the safety of the 2,000 workers who produced the isotope for the U.S. nuclear arsenal .
To test its effects , doctors recruited terminal cancer patients who were willing to participate in radiation experiments in 1944 , according to reports prepared later by the Department of Energy .
Fink and his colleagues determined that most of the polonium went into the gastrointestinal tract and was eliminated in feces .
It also collected in the spleen , kidneys and liver .

With all the attention on foreign money laundering , we ’re ignoring the problem in our own country .
How widespread is the problem ?
No one really knows for sure because the states “ have no idea who is behind the companies they have incorporated , ” says Senator Carl Levin ( D–Mich . ) , who is trying to force the states to insist on greater transparency .
“ The United States should never be the situs of choice for international crime , but that is exactly what the lax regulatory regimes in some of our states are inviting . ”
The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network , the U.S. Treasury bureau investigating money laundering , says roughly $ 14 billion worth of suspicious transactions involving private U.S. shells and overseas bank accounts came in from banks from 2004 to 2005 , the latest Treasury data available .
That ’s up from $ 4 billion for the long stretch between April 1996 and January 2004 .
Now , estimates the FBI , anonymously held U.S. shell companies have laundered $ 36 billion to date just from the former Soviet Union .
State governments provide plenty of cover for bad guys .
Every year they incorporate 1.9 million or so private companies , but no state verifies or records the identities of owners , much less screens ownership information against criminal watch lists , according to a study by the Government Accountability Office .
“ You have to supply more information to get a driver ’s license than you do to form one of these nonpublicly traded corporations , ” says Senator Levin .
