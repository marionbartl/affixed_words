Researchers at the University of Rochester may have answered one of neuroscience 's most vexing questions — how can it be that our neurons , which are responsible for our crystal - clear thoughts , seem to fire in utterly random ways ?
In the November issue of Nature Neuroscience , the Rochester study shows that the brain 's cortex uses seemingly chaotic , or " noisy , " signals to represent the ambiguities of the real world — and that this noise dramatically enhances the brain 's processing , enabling us to make decisions in an uncertain world .
" You 'd think this is crazy because engineers are always fighting to reduce the noise in their circuits , and yet here 's the best computing machine in the universe — and it looks utterly random , " says Alex Pouget , associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences at the University of Rochester .
Pouget 's work for the first time connects two of the brain 's biggest mysteries ; why it 's so noisy , and how it can perform such complex calculations .
As counter - intuitive as it sounds , the noise seems integral to making those calculations possible .
In the last decade , Pouget and his colleagues in the University of Rochester 's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences have blazed a new path to understanding our gray matter .
The traditional approach has assumed the brain uses the same method computation in general had used up until the mid-80s :
You see an image and you relate that image to one stored in your head .
But the reality of the cranial world seems to be a confusing array of possibilities and probabilities , all of which are somehow , mysteriously , properly calculated .
The science of drawing answers from such a variety of probabilities is called Bayesian computing , after minister Thomas Bayes who founded the unusual branch of math 150 years ago .
Pouget says that when we seem to be struck by an idea from out of the blue , our brain has actually just resolved many probabilities its been fervently calculating .
" We 've known for several years that at the behavioral level , we 're ' Bayes optimal , ' meaning we are excellent at taking various bits of probability information , weighing their relative worth , and coming to a good conclusion quickly , " says Pouget .
" But we 've always been at a loss to explain how our brains are able to conduct such complex Bayesian computations so easily . "
Two years ago , while talking with a physics friend , some probabilities in Pouget 's own head suddenly resolved .
" One day I had a drink with some machine - learning researchers , and we suddenly said , ' Oh , it 's not noise , ' because noise implies something 's wrong , " says Pouget .
" We started to realize then that what looked like noise may actually be the brain 's way of running at optimal performance . "
Bayesian computing can be done most efficiently when data is formatted in what 's called " Poisson distribution . "
And the neural noise , Pouget noticed , looked suspiciously like this optimal distribution .
This idea set Pouget and his team into investigating whether our neurons ' noise really fits this Poisson distribution , and in his current Nature Neuroscience paper he found that it fit extremely well .
" The cortex appears wired at its foundation to run Bayesian computations as efficiently as can be possible , " says Pouget .
His paper says the uncertainty of the real world is represented by this noise , and the noise itself is in a format that reduces the resources needed to compute it .
Anyone familiar with log tables and slide rules knows that while multiplying large numbers is difficult , adding them with log tables is relatively undemanding .
The brain is apparently designed in a similar manner — " coding " the possibilities it encounters into a format that makes it tremendously easier to compute an answer .
Pouget now prefers to call the noise " variability . "
Our neurons are responding to the light , sounds , and other sensory information from the world around us .
But if we want to do something , such as jump over a stream , we need to extract data that is not inherently part of that information .
We need to process all the variables we see , including how wide the stream appears , what the consequences of falling in might be , and how far we know we can jump .
Each neuron responds to a particular variable and the brain will decide on a conclusion about the whole set of variables using Bayesian inference .
As you reach your decision , you 'd have a lot of trouble articulating most of the variables your brain just processed for you .
Similarly , intuition may be less a burst of insight than a rough consensus among your neurons .
Pouget and his team are now expanding their findings across the entire cortex , because every part of our highly developed cortex displays a similar underlying Bayes - optimal structure .
" If the structure is the same , that means there must be something fundamentally similar among vision , movement , reasoning , loving — anything that takes place in the human cortex , " says Pouget .
" The way you learn language must be essentially the same as the way a doctor reasons out a diagnosis , and right now our lab is pushing hard to find out exactly how that noise makes all these different aspects of being human possible . "
Pouget 's work still has its skeptics , but this , his fourth paper in Nature Neuroscience on the topic , is starting to win converts .
" If you ask me , this is the coming revolution , " says Pouget .
" It hit machine learning and cognitive science , and I think it 's just hitting neuroscience .
In 10 or 20 years , I think the way everybody thinks about the brain is going to be in these terms . "
Not all of Pouget 's neurons are in agreement , however .
" … but I 've been wrong before , " he shrugs .

House candidate to face litany of criminal charges after alleging vote fraud Miriam Raftery
Published : Monday June 12 , 2006 Print This | Email This
In an exclusive interview with Florida House of Representatives candidate Charlie Grapski - arrested after he filed a lawsuit alleging voting fraud against Alachua County City Manager Clovis Watson , RAW STORY learns of corruption allegations that can only be described as not seen since the days of Boss Tweed .
Charlie Grapski , a Democrat running for the Florida House of Representatives , was arrested in April after filing a lawsuit alleging that City officials abused power and influenced the outcome of an election by manipulating the absentee voting process .
The story , however , does not start or end with election fraud allegations .
What Grapski tells is a tale that one cannot imagine occurring in a law abiding country , one of false arrest , intimidation , and a crony - business system all centered around money interests .
Clovis Watson is not only the City Manager of Alachua county and , as such , the defendant in Grapskis lawsuit , he is also the Police Commissioner of Alchua , Florida , a town dominated by the Republican Party and pro-development Democrats .
Watson , one website alleges , is funded by the Alachua County Republican Party , and declined to accept the Democrat of the Year Award because he is planning a switch to the Republican Party .
The site also takes aim at Grapski .
According to Grapski ,  Clovis Watson filed a sworn complaint as a police officer himself , and as City Manager he was the aggrieved party .
As Police Commissioner , he was his own boss and accepted the sworn complaint from himself -- and then instructed his subordinates on the police force to have me arrested .
Now , RAW STORY has learned , the Sheriffs office has announced that additional charges , including felony wiretapping , will be filed against Grapski and Michael Canney , a Green Party member who witnessed and videotaped Grapskis efforts to obtain public records .
In this exclusive interview with RAW STORY on June 11 , 2006 , Grapski reveals startling details of his situation and updates regarding an election outcome allegedly changed by absentee ballot manipulation .
He also levels serious allegations of abuse of power by public officials , including officials linked to President George W. Bush 's brother , Florida Governor Jeb Bush .
Raw Storys Miriam Raftery :
What was your background before you decided to run for public office ?
Charlie Grapiski : Im a political scientist and political theorist .
I taught those topics at the University of Florida .
I am finishing two doctorates , one in politics and one in law ; that s a PhD in law , not a JD .
Ive been involved in local politics for a long time as an activist .
I served on a campaign charter review board for the City of Gainsville .
RS : How did you become involved in election reform ?
CG : Ive been involved in election reform a long time and have been pushing for election reform through charter review board this year .
RS : Lets go back to April and what happened that that started all the troubles leading up to your arrest .
CG : On April 11th there was an election in the City of Alachua .
That s part of my district that I m running for .
I went up to the polling location to meet people and get petitions signed and campaign for my candidacy .
I knew of some problems in Alachua , but I didnt know how bad they were ; people came to me with all sorts of concerns .
I said " Ill stay around to watch the vote count on election night . "
So I went there and saw a number of violations of the law .
This was at City Hall .
The City officials conducted the elections themselves , which is problematic .
RS : What happened next ?
CG : I began investigating this matter and speaking to other people who conveyed stories of their experiences in the election .
What they were alleging is that city officials abused their authority and power and actually manipulated the election outcome through use of the absentee ballot process .
RS : How did they manipulate the absentee ballot process , in your opinion ?
CG : More will come out this week , but in effect they improperly influenced citizens who cast absentee ballots and instructed them on how to cast them .
This included Clovis Watson , the City Manager who is also the Police commissioner .
He served on the canvassing board , which is supposed to be neutral , and he is the one who personally arrested me .
Another one is Alan Henderson , the City Deputy Clerk , he acted as supervisor of elections for that election .
RS : Were they on the ballot themselves ?
CG : No .
They influenced the election for a guy named James Lewis .
He won the election by 18 absentee ballots but lost it prior to the absentee ballots being counted .
This was his election to his 40th consecutive commission .
He was on the City Commission ( like a City Council ) .
Basically they went up and actively influenced voters on how to vote .
RS : Could that be legal campaigning ?
CG : Not if you re a city official and an election official I dont want to go into too much detail , but in the conduct of giving people ballots they were also engaged in telling them how to cast the ballots .
We believe that this is not the first time that they have done this .
RS : Did they try to influence the general public , or are you referring to City employees ?
CG :
We know that one of the ways they did this was to the general public people that work for the city are either part of the problem or they are afraid to stand up against it .
The people in the City of Alachua are afraid of retaliation by the public officials and the police officials if they stand up to the government .
People are literally afraid .
RS : What did you do that started the trouble you re facing ?
CG :
The first thing I did was I began investigating on my own and organizing and explaining to people what the law was , after the April 11 election .
We began talking to others .
I spoke to a law professor and former Mayor of Gainsville .
His name is Joe Little .
He said these are very serious problems and we need to do something about them .
We met and discussed it , then I brought citizens of Alachua down to his office and we discussed what we knew .
At that point we began interviewing people who were unduly influenced in the election .
The things we found out were beyond your imagination .
We have an amended complaint being filed this week ( week of June 19 , 2006 ) .
RS : When was the earlier complaint filed ?
CG : We filed a complaint April 23 against the city officials including the mayor and Clovis Watson .
RS : What happened after that ?
CG : Later that week , what I began to do was review all of the records of the election to strengthen the case as we wrote up the filing and to document what we knew , to make sure we were correct in our allegations .
On Thursday after filing the lawsuit I filed a formal public records request under Florida law with Alan Henderson ( the City Deputy Clerk who is also Supervisor of Elections ) .
He is required under law to have those documents ready every day by noon .
I said Id come in on Friday of that week to review the documents .
I also knew that with a similar problem ten years ago , the City destroyed the records and told citizens they no longer existed .
RS : So you had reason to be suspicious ?
CG : The Citys normal approach even to City Commissioners they didnt like was to deny them the public records .
So I went in on that Friday with a witness , Eileen McCoy , who was the sole plaintiff at the time , a resident of Alachua .
A lot of people were afraid to put their name on the complaint , but she did .
I brought my video recorder , because if the city was going to tell me lies or deny me records I wanted a record of that .
So I walked in and I told Alan Henderson that I was recording him even though I didnt have to tell him , and he even talked to the recorder to make sure he was being heard clearly .
RS : Did he give you any records ?
CG : He basically denied me the records .
I said put it in writing and give me the reason you re denying access .
And he called the police !
RS : What was your reaction and what happened next ?
Were you surprised that the police were called ?
CG : Whenever anybody comes to City Hall in Alachua and speaks up , they call the police force .
Clovis Watson holds more than one office ( City Manager / Police Commissioner / Clerk Canvassing Board Member ) .
It s unlawful in state of FL to hold 2 offices .
Then Clovis came in and began speaking ; a few minutes into it said I notice you re recording me .
He said  If I dont give consent , that s a felony . 
I said ,  No , you can clearly see that I m recording , two is that you re continuing to talk , and three is you re a public official engaged in public business .
He actually wrote in a memorandum to the City Commission that he had no problem being recorded .
RS : So they arrested you ?
CG : He didnt arrest me that day .
He then said I could review the records Monday at 10:30 .
Over the weekend he e-mailed me asking for a copy of the tape .
I said Id consider it He asked to be notified in advance if I planned to record him .
I said  Be on notice that I will record all my transactions with you .
I came in on Monday , began reviewing the records and in the middle of doing that he came out with a police chief and two armed officers and arrested me for what is a felony wiretap statute .
RS : Is that a state , local or federal statute ?
CG : It s a state law intended to make wiretapping illegal .
Clovis Watson filed a sworn complaint as a police officer himself , and as City Manager he was the aggrieved party , as police commissioner he was his own boss and accepted the sworn complaint from himself and then instructed his subordinates on the police force to have me arrested !
All along , he is the defendant in the elections lawsuit we filed !
RS : What did the Mayor have to say about all of this ?
CG : The Mayor ( Jean Calderwood ) had been appointed in the past by Jeb Bush .
Her husband was the treasurer of the James Lewis campaign .
Shes also a defendant in the case .
Shes come out publicly in the newspapers over the weekend saying that she was in constant communication with Clovis Watson to arrange my being arrested She said Clovis Watson did not go out on a limb alone , he was in constant communication with her She said that in a letter to the editor of the newspaper editor .
RS : Can you send me a copy of that editorial ?
CG : Yes , I will scan in that and some other documents .
RS : When was the arrest and whats the status of your case now ?
CG : I was arrested May 1st in City Hall .
There are photos online www.freealachua.org.
A judge ordered my release by 5:00 that day .
Someone in sheriffs office decided to hold me over and we had to wake up another judge at midnight to have the original judges order [ upheld ] .
RS : Did you have to post bail ?
CG : I was released on my own recognizance .
RS : What s happened since then ?
CG :
It only got worse from there .
I tried to get the records I d been seeking .
The city put obstacles in our way and refused to turn over the documents .
Michael Canney , a member of the Green Party , came as a witness and saw me arrested .
He then began filing public records requests himself to get access to records theyve denied me Slowly but surely we began getting some documents .
One that weve been asking for and still havent given us is a log of requests for all the absentee ballots .
They think we are requesting the log to find out who cast ballots so we could interview them .
We already know who cast ballots and are in the process of interviewing them .
We have another reason .
But the City officials , Clovis Watson sent out a memorandum accusing us of intimidating voters and threatened to arrest us for that !
RS : On what grounds ?
CG : When Michael received a list of absentee ballot voters , not the one we requested but another one , Clovis Watson sent a certified letter warning him about how he uses that list .
They then put an ad in the newspaper for the last two weeks telling people who voted absentee that if we contact them , they should contact the city so they can take legal action !
RS : How many people voted absentee ?
CG :
There were about 120 requests for absentee ballots , of which 107 were counted .
Without all the records we cant say for certain anything .
RS : Were there people who say they turned in an absentee ballot request but their ballots werent counted ?
In other words , do you have reason to believe there was any destruction of ballots ?
CG :
There was destruction of ballots , but in a different context .
Now on May 15th I went into the City Commission ; it decided to try to pass the conclusions of election in a consent agenda item , which is illegal .
I went to that meeting and attempted to have them follow rules and law .
They threatened to have me arrested that night .
After that meeting , the Mayor sent a memo to Clovis Watson asking him to have me arrested .
RS : On what grounds ?
CG : Saying I violated conditions of my release from jail by attending a meeting , they called it disruption .
Of course my disruption was to basically make points of order , formal motions under the rules .
That they called disruptive .
RS : Were you arrested again ?
CG : No , but they were threatening to ; it came very close .
Last week the city commission met again .
They thought I would be there but I wasnt there for other reasons .
But the City had arranged to have a local TV station there and they were going to arrest me that night on TV .
Clovis Watson , when he arrested me the first time on May 1st , sent out press releases to the media so it was a very staged event .
RS : How is the media responding ?
Is there any outrage ?
CG : The Gainsville Sun , which is the biggest paper in town , their coverage hasnt been the best but they did run an editorial and a great editorial cartoon and they are very concerned about it .
Now Hugh Calderwood , the mayors husband and Stafford Jones the chairman of the Republican Party for Alachua County and the Republican Party of Alachua County has put up a website designed to attack me and draw a line in the sand for Alachua County , which they designate as a model of how a city should be run .
See links on the www.freealachua.org site .
The High Springs Herald has done the best job so far of reporting this .
They have been reporting it weekly .
Another , the Observer is not online but well be putting it up online today .
RS : Has there been any national coverage ?
CG :
The first national was in LA CityBeat on Thursday , an article by Andrew Gumbel , who wrote the book Steal This Vote .
RS : What s happening now ?
CG : This week the Sheriffs office and the Sheriff , a guy named Steve Oelrich , a Republican running for the State Senate right now , on Friday I was contacted by the Gainsville sun and informed ( because they alerted the newspaper and not me ) that the Sheriffs office is filing two further complaints against me for unlawful taping .
They are accusing me of felony violations of the law and now filing two charges against Michael Canney for videotaping .
The irony of this of course , is that when I contacted the television news with videotape of one of the incidents that they ( the officials ) claim Michael violated the law by videotaping , Michael videotaped me audio taping Clovis Watson .
But the television station was there too , videotaping .
They showed this on the news , yet Michael and I are being charged with videotaping while the television station isnt -- and they were there doing the exact same thing at the exact same time .
That s how absurd this whole thing is .
RS : When will these charges be heard ?
CG : The State Attorneys office has not formally charged us , but theyve refused to drop the charges , so they are playing this game of harassment .
They know the minute they drop the charges we will go on the offense and bring false arrest and civil rights charges .
To make matters worse , the former state attorney who many in state attorney office work for is Rod Smith , a Democrat running for Governor .
Rod Smith is from Alachua and he wrote Clovis Watsons dual office - holding contact .
RS : Is Clovis Watson a Republican ?
CG : Clovis Watson is a Democrat who the Republican Party says on their website is coming over to the Republican Party .
But Rod Smith is a player .
There is another dimension to whats happening in Alachua County .
The County of Alachua is one of the two Democratic voting areas in Florida ; the rest of the state has gone Republican .
The Republican Party has taken over the City of Alachua and basically opened it up for drive - through development .
There are all kinds of land deals where these city officials and cronies are benefiting by development of land , including Rod Smith .
We re talking a Wal - Mart distribution center , a Wal - Mart super - center and a Home Depot
They cant get these developed in Alachua County so they absolutely have control over some of these small towns .
They are just opening doors for unrestrained growth and development  multi-millions of dollars changing hands .
RS : What is the party affiliation of the other key players ?
CG : Henderson  I have no idea .
He used to be a journalist I believe ; Im told he may have family relationship with one of key political players .
Calderwood , the Mayor , is a Republican appointed by Jeb Bush ; she also served on the water board which had to approve the development for all of this .
Her husband , Hugh Calderwood , he and chairman of Rep .
Party are putting all this stuff on the attack site openly under their own names now .
It used to be done anonymously on blogs .
Steve Oelrich , the Sheriff , is a Republican .
Bill Cervone , State Attorney , is a Republican .
He was assistant State Attorney under Rod Smith , the Democrat .
RS : So this is basically Republicans abusing power and causing these problems , except for Smith and Clovis , whos converting to become a Republican ?
CG :
There are some Democrats , old style southern Democrats who are very development oriented .
As for Clovis being recruited by Republicans , I dont think there is any Democrat in the county who would miss him .
If you see the free Alachua site , there are all kinds of charges of corruption within the police dept under Clovis , a number of allegations going on around that .
When you start seeing the stories and documents it will blow your mind .
RS : How optimistic are you about the outcome of all of this , and what are the implications ?
CG : If you can clean up one city , you can clean up the whole country .
But if you cant clean up one city , we have no chance at the national level .
I see a lot of significance in this one case , because it is a small example of whats going on nationally , and its a lot easier to tackle corruption at the local level , which is the root and foundation of national problems .
Im confident in the end that in terms of justice , I know that what we are doing is on the side of justice .
What these officials know is that they have the power and authority and they can abuse it with very little repercussions to themselves normally .
They have a lot of power and resources .
They are used to people being afraid to stand up .
But as long as we keep fighting and pushing this issue , I believe in the end that we will prevail .
But its a struggle to do that .
We have mounting legal bills and we are trying to raise money nationally to help with that .
( see www.freealachua.org for how you can help ) .
RS : Do the officials there control the court system , too ?
CG : It s very much a company town , and it all depends on what judge we get .
Unfortunately , on our elections challenge case , we found that in another open records case a few months ago the judge completely ignored the law , and weve got that on appeal right now .
This judge is Robert Roundtree , he is also a Bush appointee .
He basically threw out with prejudice a lawsuit filed by the residents of the City of Alachua regarding this multi-million dollar land deal that was the basis of the Wal - Mart land deal with a company called Waco of Alabama .
Their lawyer had medical problems at the time and missed a filing deadline and the judge , instead of reprimanding the lawyer , used that opportunity to throw out the case without ever hearing it on the merits , so we dont have a lot of faith in him .
But there are other judges in town .
The problem is that the more local you are , there is a culture among public officials and they all have this unwritten rule to go after each other  so nobody polices the police and nobody holds to account public officials .
They have nearly free reign in anything they do .
There is one other factor .
On the Alachua City Commission , and thus the boss of Clovis Watson , is a woman named Bonnie Burgess .
She is running for the State House in the same State House race I am , as a developer - friendly Democrat .
These people are supporting her run for that office as well  Clovis and the Calderwoods , the powers - that - be in the City of Alachua .
RS : When is your primary election :
CG : September fifth ..
RS : Who else is in the race ?
CG :
There are three Democrats and one Republican , but this is a Democratic district , so they know that whoever wins the Democratic primary is going to win the race .
In this essay , the bestselling secularist author of “ The End of Faith ” delivers a scathing review of “ The Language of God , ” a new book by Human Genome Project head Francis Collins that attempts to demonstrate a harmony between science and evangelical Christianity .
Francis Collins — physical chemist , medical geneticist and head of the Human Genome Project — has written a book entitled ?
The Language of God .?
In it , he attempts to demonstrate that there is ? a consistent and profoundly satisfying harmony ?
between 21st - century science and evangelical Christianity .
To say that he fails at his task does not quite get at the inadequacy of his efforts .
He fails the way a surgeon would fail if he attempted to operate using only his toes .
His failure is predictable , spectacular and vile .
?
The Language of God ? reads like a hoax text , and the knowledge that it is not a hoax should be disturbing to anyone who cares about the future of intellectual and political discourse in the United States .
Collins ’ book reveals that a stellar career in science offers no guarantee of a scientific frame of mind .
Most reviewers of ?
The Language of God ? seem quite overawed by its author ?s scientific credentials .
This is understandable .
As director of the Human Genome Project , Collins participated in one of the greatest scientific achievements in human history .
His book , however , reveals that a stellar career in science offers no guarantee of a scientific frame of mind .
Lest we think that one man can do no lasting harm to our discourse , consider the fact that the year is 2006 , half of the American population believes that the universe is 6,000 years old , our president has just used his first veto to block federal funding of embryonic stem - cell research on religious grounds , and one of the foremost scientists in the land has this to say , straight from the heart ( if not the brain ) :
As believers , you are right to hold fast to the concept of God as Creator ; you are right to hold fast to the truths of the Bible ; you are right to hold fast to the conclusion that science offers no answers to the most pressing questions of human existence ; and you are right to hold fast to the certainty that the claims of atheistic materialism must be steadfastly resisted ?.
God , who is not limited to space and time , created the universe and established natural laws that govern it .
Seeking to populate this otherwise sterile universe with living creatures , God chose the elegant mechanism of evolution to create microbes , plants , and animals of all sorts .
Most remarkably , God intentionally chose the same mechanism to give rise to special creatures who would have intelligence , a knowledge of right and wrong , free will , and a desire to seek fellowship with Him .
He also knew these creatures would ultimately choose to disobey the Moral Law .
According to Collins , belief in the God of Abraham is the most rational response to the data of physics and biology , while ?of all the possible worldviews , atheism is the least rational .?
Taken at face value , these claims suggest that ?
The Language of God ? will mark an unprecedented breakthrough in the history of ideas .
Once Collins gets going , however , we realize that the book represents a breakthrough of another kind .
After finding himself powerless to detect any errors in the philosophizing of C.S. Lewis ( a truly ominous sign ) , Collins describes the moment that he , as a scientist , finally became convinced of the divinity of Jesus Christ :
On a beautiful fall day , as I was hiking in the Cascade Mountains ?
the majesty and beauty of God ?s creation overwhelmed my resistance .
As I rounded a corner and saw a beautiful and unexpected frozen waterfall , hundreds of feet high , I knew the search was over .
The next morning , I knelt in the dewy grass as the sun rose and surrendered to Jesus Christ .
If this account of field research seems a little thin , don?t worry — a recent profile of Collins in Time magazine offers supplementary data .
Here , we learn that the waterfall was frozen in three streams , which put the good doctor in mind of the Trinity ?
It is at this point that thoughts of suicide might occur to any reader who has placed undue trust in the intellectual integrity of his fellow human beings .
One would hope that it would be immediately obvious to Collins that there is nothing about seeing a frozen waterfall ( no matter how frozen ) that offers the slightest corroboration of the doctrine of Christianity .
But it was not obvious to him as he ? knelt in the dewy grass , ? and it is not obvious to him now .
Indeed , I fear that it will not be obvious to many of his readers .
If the beauty of nature can mean that Jesus really is the son of God , then anything can mean anything .
Let us say that I saw the same waterfall , and its three streams reminded me of Romulus , Remus and the She - wolf , the mythical founders of Rome .
How reasonable would it be for me to know , from that moment forward , that Italy would one day win the World Cup ?
This epiphany , while perfectly psychotic , would actually put me on firmer ground than Collins — because Italy did win the World Cup .
Collins ?
alpine conversion would be a ludicrous non sequitur even if Jesus does return to Earth trailing clouds of glory .
While the mere sighting of a waterfall appears to have been sufficient to answer all important questions of theology for Collins , he imagines himself to be in possession of further evidence attesting to the divinity of Jesus , the omnipotence of God and the divine origin of the Bible .
The most compelling of these data , in his view , is the fact that human beings have a sense of right and wrong .
Collins follows
Lewis here , as faithfully as if he were on a leash , and declares that the ? moral law ?
is so inscrutable a thing as to admit of only a supernatural explanation .
According to Collins , the moral law applies exclusively to human beings :
Though other animals may at times appear to show glimmerings of a moral sense , they are certainly not widespread , and in many instances other species ?
behavior seems to be in dramatic contrast to any sense of universal rightness .
One wonders if the author has ever read a newspaper .
The behavior of humans offers no such ? dramatic contrast .?
How badly must human beings behave to put this ? sense of universal rightness ?
in doubt ?
And just how widespread must ?
glimmerings ? of morality be among other animals before Collins — who , after all , knows a thing or two about genes — begins to wonder whether our moral sense has evolutionary precursors in the natural world ?
What if mice showed greater distress at the suffering of familiar mice than unfamiliar ones ?
( They do . )
What if monkeys will starve themselves to prevent their cage - mates from receiving painful shocks ?
( They will . )
What if chimps have a demonstrable sense of fairness when receiving food rewards ?
( They have . )
Wouldn ?t these be precisely the sorts of findings one would expect if our morality were the product of evolution ?
If one didn ?t know better , one might be tempted to conclude that religious dogmatism presents an obstacle to scientific reasoning .
Collins ?
case for the supernatural origin of morality rests on the further assertion that there can be no evolutionary explanation for genuine altruism .
Because self - sacrifice cannot increase the likelihood that an individual creature will survive and reproduce , truly self - sacrificing behavior stands as a primordial rejoinder to any biological account of morality .
In Collins ?
view , therefore , the mere existence of altruism offers compelling evidence of a personal God .
( Here , Collins performs a risible sprint past ideas in biology like ? kin selection ?
that plausibly explain altruism and self - sacrifice in evolutionary terms . )
A moment ?s thought reveals , however , that if we were to accept this neutered biology , almost everything about us would be bathed in the warm glow of religious mystery .
Forget morality — how did nature select for the ability to write sonnets , solder circuit boards or swing a golf club ?
Clearly , such abilities could never be the product of evolution .
Might they have been placed in us by God ?
Smoking cigarettes is n?t a healthy habit and is unlikely to offer an adaptive advantage — and there were no cigarettes in the Paleolithic — but this habit is very widespread and compelling .
Is God , by any chance , a tobacco farmer ?
Collins can ?t seem to see that human morality and selfless love may be derivative of more basic biological and psychological traits , which were themselves products of evolution .
It is hard to interpret this oversight in light of his scientific training .
If one didn ?t know better , one might be tempted to conclude that religious dogmatism presents an obstacle to scientific reasoning .
Having established that our moral sensitivities are God - given , Collins finds himself in a position to infer the nature of our Creator :
And if that were so , what kind of God would this be ?
Would this be a deist God , who invented physics and mathematics and started the universe in motion about 14 billion years ago , then wandered off to deal with other , more important matters , as Einstein thought ?
No , this God , if I was perceiving him at all , must be a theist God , who desires some kind of relationship with those special creatures called human beings , and has therefore instilled this special glimpse of Himself into each one of us .
This might be the God of Abraham , but it was certainly not the God of Einstein ?.
Judging by the incredibly high standards of the Moral Law ?
this was a God who was holy and righteous .
He would have to be the embodiment of goodness ?.
Faith in God now seemed more rational than disbelief .
I hope the reader will share my amazement that passages like this have come from one of the most celebrated scientists in the United States .
I find that my own sense of the moral law requires that I provide a few more examples of Collins ?
skill as a philosopher and theologian …

How does Collins settle the problem of theodicy — the mystery of why there is evil and misfortune in a world created by an omniscient , omnipotent and perfectly benevolent God ?
He takes it very much in stride … .
On the question of why God simply doesn?t provide better evidence for his existence :
If the case in favor of belief in God were utterly airtight , then the world would be full of confident practitioners of a single faith .
But imagine such a world , where the opportunity to make a free choice about belief was taken away by the certainty of the evidence .
How interesting would that be ?
One is tempted to say that it might be more ?
interesting ?
than a world unnecessarily shattered by competing religious orthodoxies and religious war , only to be followed by an eternity in hell for all those who believe the wrong things about God .
But , to each his own .
How does Collins settle the problem of theodicy — the mystery of why there is evil and misfortune in a world created by an omniscient , omnipotent and perfectly benevolent God ?
He takes it very much in stride :
Science reveals that the universe , our own planet , and life itself are engaged in an evolutionary process .
The consequences of that can include the unpredictability of the weather , the slippage of a tectonic plate , or the misspelling of a cancer gene in the normal process of cell division .
If at the beginning of time God chose to use these forces to create human beings , then the inevitability of these other painful consequences was also assured .
Frequent miraculous interventions would be at least as chaotic in the physical realm as they would be in interfering with human acts of free will .
Any intellectually honest person must admit that he does not know why the universe exists .
Secular scientists , of course , readily admit their ignorance on this point .
Believers like Collins do not .
But why was God obliged to make cell division susceptible to the perversity of cancer ?
And why could n?t an all - powerful , all - knowing , perfectly benevolent God perform as many miracles as He wanted ?
There is n?t time to entertain such questions , however , as Collins must solve all outstanding problems in the science of cosmology :
The Big Bang cries out for a divine explanation .
It forces the conclusion that nature had a defined beginning .
I can not see how nature could have created itself .
Only a supernatural force that is outside of space and time could have done that .
It is worth pointing out the term ?
supernatural , ? which Collins uses freely throughout his book , is semantically indistinguishable from the term ? magical .?
Reading his text with this substitution in mind is rather instructive .
In any case , even if we accepted that our universe simply had to be created by an intelligent being , this would not suggest that this being is the God of the Bible , or even particularly magical .
If intelligently designed , our universe could be running as a simulation on an alien supercomputer .
As many critics of religion have pointed out , the notion of a Creator poses an immediate problem of an infinite regress .
If God created the universe , what created God ?
To insert an inscrutable God at the origin of the universe explains absolutely nothing .
And to say that God , by definition , is uncreated , simply begs the question .
( Why can ? t I say that the universe , by definition , is uncreated ? )
Any being capable of creating our world promises to be very complex himself .
As the biologist Richard Dawkins has observed with untiring eloquence , the only natural process we know of that could produce a being capable of designing things is evolution .
Any intellectually honest person must admit that he does not know why the universe exists .
Secular scientists , of course , readily admit their ignorance on this point .
Believers like Collins do not .
The major and inescapable flaw of ?
[ the ] claim that science demands of atheism is that it goes beyond the evidence .
If God is outside of nature , then science can neither prove nor disprove His existence .
Atheism itself must therefore be considered a form of blind faith , in that it adopts a belief system that cannot be defended on the basis of pure reason .
Is disbelief in Zeus or Thor also a form of ? blind faith ??
Must we really ?
disprove ?
the existence of every imaginary friend ?
The burden of producing evidence falls on those making extravagant claims about miracles and invisible realities .
What is more , there is an enormous difference between acquiring a picture of the world through dispassionate , scientific study and acquiring it through patent emotionality and wishful thinking — and only then looking to see if it can survive contact with science .
Somewhere during the course of his scientific career , Collins acquired the revolting habit of quoting eminent scientists out of context to give an entirely false impression of their religious beliefs .
Consider the following fact : Ninety - nine percent of the species that have ever lived on Earth are now extinct .
There are two very different questions one could ask about a fact of this sort , if one wanted to assess the reasonableness of believing in God .
One could ask , ?
Is this fact compatible with the existence of an omnipotent , omniscient and compassionate God ??
Or , one could ask , ? Does this fact , alone or in combination with other facts , suggest that an omnipotent , omniscient and compassionate God exists ??
The answer to the first question is always , ?
Well , yes — provided you add that God ?s will is utterly mysterious .?
( In the present case , He may have wanted to destroy 99 % of his creatures for some very good reason that surpasses our understanding . )
The answer to the second question is ? absolutely not .?
The problem for Collins is that only the second question is relevant to our arriving at a rational understanding of the universe .
The fact that a bowdlerized evangelical Christianity can still be rendered compatible with science ( because of the gaps in science and the elasticity of religious thinking ) does not mean that there are scientific reasons for being an evangelical Christian .
Collins ? sins against reasonableness do not end here .
Somewhere during the course of his scientific career , he acquired the revolting habit of quoting eminent scientists out of context to give an entirely false impression of their religious beliefs .
Misappropriation of Einstein and Hawking , while common enough in popular religious discourse , rises to level of intellectual misconduct when perpetrated by a scientist like Collins .
Where either of these physicists uses the term ?
God ? — as in Einstein ?s famous ?
God does not play dice ?? — he uses it metaphorically .
Any honest engagement with their work reveals that both Einstein and Hawking reject the notion of Collins ?
God as fully as any atheist .
Collins suggests otherwise at every opportunity .
In his role as Christian apologist , Collins also makes the repellent claim that ?
the traditional lore about Galileo ?s persecutions by the Church is overblown .?
Lest we forget : Galileo , the greatest scientist of his time , was forced to his knees under threat of torture and death , obliged to recant his understanding of the Earth ?s motion , and placed under house arrest for the rest of his life by steely - eyed religious maniacs .
He worked at a time when every European intellectual lived in the grip of a Church that thought nothing of burning scholars alive for merely speculating about the nature of the stars .
As Collins notes , this is the same Church that did not absolve Galileo of heresy for 350 years ( in 1992 ) .
When it did , it ascribed his genius to God , ? who , stirring in the depths of his spirit , stimulated him , anticipating and assisting his intuitions .?
Collins clearly approves of this sordid appropriation , and goes on to say that all the fuss about Galileo was , in the end , unnecessary , because ?
the claims that heliocentricity contradicted the Bible are now seen to have been overstated ?.?
( And what if they were n?t overstated ?
What then ? )
It is simply astonishing that a scientist has produced such a pious glossing of the centuries of religious barbarism that were visited upon generations of other scientists .
If one wonders how beguiled , self - deceived and carefree in the service of fallacy a scientist can be in the United States in the 21st century , ? The Language of God ? provides the answer .
The only thing that mitigates the harm this book will do to the stature of science in the United States is that it will be mostly read by people for whom science has little stature already .
Viewed from abroad , ?
The Language of God ? will be seen as another reason to wonder about the fate of American society .
Indeed , it is rare that one sees the thumbprint of historical contingency so visible on the lens of intellectual discourse .
This is an American book , attesting to American ignorance , written for Americans who believe that ignorance is stronger than death .
Reading it should provoke feelings of collective guilt in any sensitive secularist .
We should be ashamed that this book was written in our own time .

Did you know that the U.S. Northern Command just tightened its control over Northern California ?
" NORTHCOM " is the combatant command created by the Bush administration to control armies on the move inside the so - called North American battle space , which includes Mexico and Canada .
The self - described job of NORTHCOM is to repel invaders , eliminate drug dealers and " terrorists , " and control civil disturbances .
To spot these nuisances , NORTHCOM runs an intelligence " fusion center " at its headquarters in Colorado Springs , Colo .
It correlates electronic data collected from military and commercial sources with duly recorded suspicions forwarded by local law enforcement agencies and neighborhood watch groups .
On Nov. 19 , NORTHCOM 's 9th Reconnaissance
Wing announced the deployment of the Global Hawk at Beale Air Force Base in Yuba County .
On that day , the Air Force 's newest unmanned spy plane flew its first official combat command mission over the continental United States .
Beale will soon host a dozen of these $ 132 million war - fighting machines , which can fly at 65,000 feet for 34 hours while leisurely photographing Americans and uploading their pixels to the fusion center at Colorado Springs .
Privacy ?
Fuhgeddaboutit .
In the Middle East , the Global Hawk 's main activity is targeting houses and individuals for instant destruction by Hellfire missiles .
It is difficult to conceive of a legitimate peacetime application for this harbinger of death in American airspace .
Global Hawk " pilots " fly by remote control from ground - based control booths the size of shipping containers .
Concurrent with the deployment of Global Hawk , NORTHCOM ran a military - law enforcement exercise in the North Bay called Golden Guardian .
The operation tested the intelligence - gathering and combat - command capabilities of local police forces and homeland - defending troops known as U.S. Army North during a simulated earthquake .
Army North 's Soldiers ( the S is always capitalized in Rumsfeldspeak ) are charged with " interdicting " enemies of the corporate state to " protect the American people and their way of life . "
Hey !
Since when did our way of life include 24 - hour surveillance by Global Hawks and interdiction by Soldiers ?
Who is the enemy ?
Us ?
On Oct. 26 , the Army released The manual declares , " The goal of modern warfare is control of the populace . "
That goal applies to domestic as well as foreign operations : " From the mid-1950s through the 1990s , the Army conducted UO [ urban operations ] in the U.S. . . . during civil unrest and anti-Vietnam [ War ] protests . "
Urban warfare doctrine targets poor inner city neighborhoods for destruction and occupation whether they are in Third World countries or festering inside the homeland .
" Urban Operations " warn Soldiers that youth gangs in Los Angeles , known collectively as " Threats , " temporarily united to fight Soldiers during the policing of the Rodney King riots in 1992 .
Ignoring the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 , which generally prohibits Soldiers from acting as law enforcers , the manual calls for " full spectrum " urban operations ( led by NORTHCOM ) , which combine law enforcement and military operations with air support against the Threat flavor of the day .
" Urban Operations " makes it clear that , as in Fallujah , Panama City and occupied Palestine , sections of rebellious cities will be exploded by air strikes or plastic explosives because " rubble piles provide excellent covered and concealed positions " for invading Soldiers .
" Shantytowns " may be " knock[ed ] down and traversed [ by tanks ] without affecting mobility at all . "
Destruction of neighborhoods and vital infrastructure is termed " a necessary shaping operation . "
It is done to keep " insurgents " from merging with and politically mobilizing the populace .
Taking a lesson from the Pentagon , " Urban Operations " warns , " [ T ] hreat forces may not abide by international agreements , such as the Geneva Conventions . "
Nor will the idle , young , politically active , dark - skinned criminals necessarily play fair with Global Hawk budgets : " Threats will [ use ] decoys to absorb expensive and limited precision - guided munitions as well as cause misallocation of other critical Army resources . "
Hint , hint .
Even worse : " [ A ] disgruntled civilian population may attack or disrupt commercial activities as a political statement against the United States . "
Beware : " [ T ] errorist elements . . . may also employ ' rent - a- crowds ' — civilians paid or incited to demonstrate against military forces armed with only sticks , stones and Molotov cocktails . "
Taking a cue from Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet , " Urban Operations " recommends that Soldiers use sports stadiums as interrogation centers and holding facilities for the disgruntled masses .
As a final warning , Soldiers are reminded that video is a two - edged sword : " [ N]egative visual images of military operations presented by the media can change political objectives .
. . .
Commanders should . . . induce cooperation between the media and Army forces . . . successfully engaging the media as a force multiplier . "
And that is why you knew little or nothing about NORTHCOM and Global Hawk until today .
Force multipliers do n't report on those things .

Update : Apparently this site ( talking about the ways in which people blew their Google interviews ) links to me .
They highlighted my mention of the guy with the thick accent , implying I blew the interview by not understanding him .
I ’d like to clarify , that part of the experience was just a relevant part of the story , which is why I shared it .
I blew the Google Interview not for that reason , but because my algorithm skills simply were not up to snuff at the time .
Blaming the rejection on having a hard time with accents would be petty and silly .
I was rejected because I was n’t good enough , plain and simple .
Recently , I had the pleasure of interviewing with Google .
It was very exciting , as I ’ve wanted to work for Google for quite some time , and they opened up a branch near my home through an acquisition recently .
I wanted to share the process of interviewing with Google , not because it was particularly noteworthy , but because I wondered about interviewing with Google before I did so , and I figured others might .
I ’ve had to sign an NDA , so I ’m going to be pretty careful about what I share in this post .
The position I interviewed for was a Software Engineer position in the Boulder , Colorado office ( near where I live ) , but they still conduct their interviews from the California office .
Because I ’m not in California , I had to go through two phone interviews first .
The questions Google asks are pretty interesting for a number of reasons .
I think the best word I could use to describe the questions is “ fair ” .
I did n’t get any tricky puzzle questions .
Nobody asked me what I would do if I were shrunk to the size of a nickel and thrown in a blender .
Not a single question was an “ a - ha ! ” type brain - teaser .
Pretty much every question was a good question for figuring out if someone can write code .
Even though I was interviewing for a Java position , I only had one Java - specific question .
I could really feel from the questions that Google was n’t concerned with me being good with a specific language ; they really wanted to know if I was just a good coder .
When I was first told by the recruiter that the questions would be algorithm - based , I was worried I ’d have to reproduce quicksort or something .
In fact , the questions were far , far more reasonable ( though reviewing sorting algorithms WAS a good idea ) .
Most of them involved manipulating data in an array for some purpose .
I ’d give an answer that worked , and they ’d ask me if there were any corner cases .
I was asked to solve the problem in a way that avoided those problems .
Then I was asked to improve the space efficiency or running efficiency of the solution .
A solution that “ worked ” was never enough , the interviewers always pushed me further , trying to squeeze out performance .
I had to say the runtime complexity for nearly every solution I suggested .
I would NOT recommend interviewing with Google without a Computer Science degree .
You need to be able to look at a function and know the Big - O for it immediately .
Specifically , you need to look at YOUR OWN functions and know the Big - O immediately .
After doing well with both of these interviews , Google actually flew me out to California for a weekend for an all - day interview on the Google campus .
They paid for my plane ticket , hotel room , rental car , and some food .
I bought a second ticket for my fiancee and we did touristy crap around San Francisco .
Overall , it was a lot of fun , but I could n’t help but keep the back of my head occupied with the thought of an all - day interview .
On Monday , I went to the Google campus .
In the main lobby , they have a projector with a scrolling list of Google searches .
I sat in the lobby waiting for my interview to begin , happily watching the searches scroll by .
Lots of female celebrities were being searched , and someone searched for “ vista crack ” which made me laugh out loud , ensuring the receptionist thought I was an idiot .
I sent my fiancee a text message telling her to search for “ Rod is awesome ” but it did n’t show up .
They also had a neat visualization showing where people were doing searches on a spinning globe .
Pictures of Googlers with celebrities adorned the wall next to the new Google whiteboard .
For those that do n’t know , Google has a giant whiteboard which was finally erased not too long ago .
Before being erased , someone took pictures and posted them to the internet .
The new board was already mostly full by the time I saw it , and a large section of it was devoted to complaining about the board being erased .
I also had lunch in one of the cafes on campus .
The Google cafes are all buffet - style , and completely free .
You simply walk in , grab whatever the hell you want , and leave .
My “ lunch - date ” was one of my phone interviewers , and he took me to the health food cafe .
Salads , tofu , bean sprouts , and similar food items filled the buffet .
I searched desperately for some meat and filled my plate when I finally found it .
I ’m definitely NOT a California person .
People looked at me like I personally killed a cow in front of them .
The on - site interviews were much like the phone interviews .
I had one - on - one meetings with a handful of people , one after another .
Each person asked me algorithm - type questions .
I did some whiteboarding , but was mostly able to write the answers in my notebook , which was better for me as I could keep up with my brain much more easily on paper than on a whiteboard .
It was sometimes difficult to focus on the questions while “ OH MY GOD I ’M INTERVIEWING WITH FUCKING GOOGLE ” whizzed by in my brain over and over .
Luckily , pretty much everyone was extremely friendly , which helped calm my considerable nerves .
The biggest difference in the questions between phone and on - site interviews was how my answers had to be presented .
On the phone , it was sufficient that I explain , at a high - level , how the solution to a problem would work .
On - site , I had to actually write it out .
Of my four interviewers , two actually wanted it to be valid Java .
I finished early with one of my interviewers , and he asked me a joke question : if a Stormtrooper shoots a red - shirt , does he hit ?
It was comical how universal this seemed .
Of course I ’d know what he was talking about , I write software .
Luckily , I was familiar with the term redshirt from being a film nerd , and I was able to come up with a joke answer that did n’t let him on to the fact I ’ve never seen a single episode of Star Trek in my life .
The worst part of the process was my fourth and final interview of the day .
The guy was from Moscow , and he had a very thick accent .
All of my life , I ’ve had immense trouble with accents , even slight ones .
My project manager at work has a thick accent from Italy , and she basically sounds like Chewbacca to me .
I ’m not complaining that Moscow Guy had an accent ( all tech companies have folks with accents ) , but it sure made the rest of the interview process challenging for me .
My interview with the Moscow Guy resembled one of those satellite interviews on the news .
He ’d say something to me , and there ’d be this long pause before I responded .
To make matters worse , he told me his first question was going to be “ an easy one ” , so when I barely understood what he said at all , I imagine I looked like a complete imbecile .
“ What was that ?
You want me to WHAT two numbers together ?
Mo de ploy ?
Mah dah bu ?
Oh , multiply !
Right , two times two is four .
I ’m obviously an idiot . ”
To make matters worse , the Moscow guy was the only person I talked to the entire day who was n’t friendly .
He was n’t a complete jerk or anything , but he definitely was n’t as warm as my other interviewers .
Right before the interview ended , he asked me what I ’d work on for my “ 20 % time ” project .
Each Google employee gets to devote 20 % of their time to a side project , which is why so many of the Google Labs projects exist ( like Gmail and Movie Search ) .
I actually had an answer to this question , since I thought about it on the plane ride out to California .
There ’s been a side project I ’ve been wanting to work on at home , but I have n’t had time .
I figured , if I got the job , I ’d just make that a Google Labs project and do it there .
I explained my idea to him , and he told me it sounded interesting , then proceeded to write it down right in front of me .
All I could think was “ I hope I get this job so I do n’t regret that . ”
I imagine the four interview feedback e-mails looked like this :
“ Candidate knew his stuff , but seemed awfully nervous . ”
“ Candidate knew his stuff and seemed relatively comfortable . ”
“ Candidate kept joking around like I was his friend .
Clearly was not nervous enough , given that he was interviewing at FUCKING GOOGLE . ”
“ Candidate seemed to have the brain of a chimp .
Was surprised he could speak without forgetting to breathe .
Interviewer confident candidate eats glue . ”
I flew back to Colorado feeling pretty good about the whole thing .
As it turns out , though , I was told over the phone ( while trying to push a car out of the snow during the Denver blizzard ) that I did n’t get the position .
I need to work on my algorithm skills , so I guess I got docked for not thinking of the best solution right away .
The Google Recruiter told me it was n’t the last guy that did me in , but I ca n’t help but wonder how close I was to writing this blog post from a desk at Google .
Considering how much I wanted the job , I admit I ’m pretty bummed about this .
I ’m allowed to re-apply in a year , but I ca n’t imagine improving my “ algorithm skills ” without more information on where my problem areas were .
What ’s really unfortunate is that I know if Google had hired me , I ’d have done a good job .
If I see my idea appear on Google Labs any time soon , I ’m going to go nuts .
All in all , it was a pretty pleasant experience .
I ’m disappointed , but I ’m proud of myself for at least being considered seriously by Google .
It was honestly kind of fun answering their interview questions .
The questions reminded me of my undergraduate work , and it was nice to think about that kind of material again .
I ’m bummed that my progress into the world of Google came to such a screeching halt , but the journey has definitely been fun and interesting .
And hey , I got a free trip to San Francisco out of it .
" I could care less " vs. " I could n't care less "
The Question Ends Here
When one usually states " I could care less " , they usually mean " I could not care less " .
[ e.g. " I could care less about linguistics . " ]
In order for one to " care less " about a subject , they must first care about it somewhat .
Saying " I could care less about ... " does indeed imply , nay dictate , that there is some degree of care .
I 've put together a handy chart to help visualize ...
It can easily be seen that , in absolute terms , there is no caring at the zero marker .
It is impossible to care less than that amount .
Let us use a different example ...
I could have less food .
I could n't have less food .
Which statement above means " I have at least some food " , and which means " I do n't have any food " ?

Is n't the key to whether one could or could not care less whether one wants to be literal or sarcastic ? :)
No .
If one wants to be sarcastic , they would say " That 's the most interesting thing ever ! " or something else that would put their caring near the top of the continuum .
Merely pulling their " level of caring " off of the absolute bottom does n't give a sarcastic effect .
Consider this statement : " I need $ 130,000 to pay off the IRS . "
Which of these is sarcastic ?
1 ) " I do n't have $ 130,000 either . "
2 ) " Let me quick write you out a check from my enormous bank account . "
3 ) " I 'm not completely broke . "
Using the principles from the sarcastic line , make up a sarcastic quote about your level of caring !
Thank you .
Aha !
Now that is good sarcasm !
It is plausible ... and I 'm not quite certain about its intent !
The statement is clear cut , and may be taken in either way .
Well done !*
*( This statement 's sarcasm level depends on the intent of your " Thank you . " statement . )
This is fun !
( This statement is not at all sarcastic .
It is actually fun . ) **
** Yes , I know both the ' fun ' statement and the explanation could be construed as sarcastic ... it is a mire ; but it honestly is fun .
Actually , I was being sincere !
All reasonable ( and inherently erroneous ) retorts will be published on this page .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Whenever there is a hike in oil prices , the idea of a return to wind - powered shipping catches favor , but sail ship designs have often fallen short on a number of points , not least that they have to rely on unpredictable weather .
However , the future of shipping could feature wind power , but with kites , not sails .
Flying a kite to propel a ship might sound like something from Kevin Costner 's cinematic damp swib , " Waterworld " , but that is exactly what a number of nautical engineering firms propose .
Sails , no matter how sophisticated their design or use of lightweight modern materials have a fundamental flaw : they take up valuable deck space and storage room that is better used for cargo .
Kites have the advantage of not needing masts , do not need a large area to store them and can be retrofitted to existing ships .
" Kites hold the potential to change the way we move goods across oceans .
They are eco-friendly and sufficiently cost effective to herald a return to sail that the Earth 's finite petroleum supplies mandate , " says Dave Culp , President of California based company KiteShip .
Another company that is throwing itself into towing kite technology is SkySails , based in Hamburg , Germany .
The company was founded by Stefan Wrage , who has developed his idea in the face of much scepticism in the past .
Neither company is proposing that engines will be made redundant with the use of a kite , rather that the added propulsion will save a considerable amount in fuel costs .
Earlier this year SkySails trailed a kite on an 800 - ton former buoy tender in the Baltic Sea .
Using a towing kite of only 80 - square - meters the Beufort reached five knots in low winds .
While this does n't sound very impressive , add to it engine propulsion and Wrage and his team believe that a saving of between ten and 35 percent could be made on fuel costs and in better wind conditions , perhaps even 50 percent .
As with fixed sails , the problem in the past was scheduling wind conditions , but this has been negated by more accurate satellite predictions and long - range forecasts of the weather available to shipping .
SkySails incorporate a computerised system that can plot a ship 's course according to the best winds and most cost - effective route .
Another key to the successful development of Wrage 's idea has been the deployment and steering mechanism .
As anyone who has flown a kite remembers , they are n't always the most predictable and easy things to navigate or keep in the air .
If a 200 - square - meter kite plummets into the North Atlantic in choppy conditions , there is going to be a problem .
Deployed from a retractable mast on the ship 's deck , the kite is controlled by a central console that operates like a plane 's autopilot system , monitoring and recording over 100 measurements in fractions of seconds to keep the kite in its optimum position .
Once up , the kite flies at between 100 and 500 meters above sea level where the winds are around 50 percent stronger .
In these conditions it 's designed to take on the optimum aerofoil shape that ensures that the kite can maximize thrust whatever the conditions .
Shipping has been coming under increased scrutiny from environmentalists for its contribution to climate change .
This coupled with the less altruistic desire by shipping companies to save money on fuel makes the new wave of towing kites an attractive possibility .
Recent studies on the environmental effects of shipping have revealed that marine diesel engines have a greater impact than previously thought .
As well as releasing nitrogen oxides and damaging PM10 particles into the atmosphere , burning marine diesel oils also contains 2.7 percent sulphur , which is over 500 times the EU 's allowed limit for diesel for automobiles .
SkySails believe that if their technology is applied to shipping it could save over 146 million tons of C02 annually .
Also working in SkySails ' favor is the recent EU legislation reducing the acceptable level of sulphur emissions for shipping .
Wrage is aiming high .
The company hopes to equip at least 15 percent of the world 's trade fleet of as well as 250 super yachts with its kite technology .
One surprising side - effect of their recent tests was the stabilizing effect of the kite when unfurled , a benefit that he believes would attract the cruise liner industry , where a smooth ride for passengers is all important .
While the shipping industry is adjusting itself to a future where it can no longer depend on fossil fuels , many remain cautious and conservative .
There are still plenty of doubts over whether SkySails ' kites or the latest designs of sailing ships will provide the answer to future fuel problems .
Keeping a weather - eye on the technology is Phil Atkinson , Technical Director of Graig Group Shipping .
" There are a number of other more cost - effective methods to save fuel costs at present , such as improved propeller technology and advanced coating technology for hulls .
There are still too many variables involved in both kites and fixed aerofoil sails , " he told CNN .
" Also , kites may be good in some areas , but in the Indian Ocean for example where the winds are light , they just would n't be practical or cost - effective . "
One company that has thrown caution to the wind is Beluga Shipping .
It has invested in SkySails and will equip a 140 meter - long cargo freighter with a 160 square meter kite later this year .
" We do n't see investing in SkySails as a risk .
Reducing emissions from shipping and investing in wind power are key to the future .
We expect to gain a 15 to 20 percent reduction of fuel cost from the kite .
We 've seen the tests and think this is being realistic " a Beluga Group spokesperson told CNN .
The MS Beluga SkySails will be unfurling its kite on its maiden voyage to South American next April .
" We will have to scale up the size of the kite to see a greater reduction in fuel costs , but as an initial additional propulsion system for the ship , we believe it will still be a success . "
There will be numerous interested observers when the MS Beluga SkySails leaves port for the first time .
As for whether or not more kites will be flown on the high seas , the answer is blowing in the wind .
The Stratosphere Giant , the world 's reigning tallest living tree , seems to have lost its title -- to not one but three contenders .
Like the 370 - foot Giant , the three trees are coast redwoods .
They were discovered this summer in Redwood National Park near Eureka by a team of California researchers who spend most of their free time bushwhacking through North Coast forests in search of taller and taller trees .
So far , the group has found about 135 redwoods that reach higher than 350 feet , said team member Chris Atkins , the man credited with finding the Stratosphere Giant in August 2000 in nearby Humboldt Redwoods State Park .
The tallest of the three new finds , a redwood named Hyperion , measures 378.1 feet .
Next in line , Helios , stands at 376.3 feet ; Icarus , the third , reaches 371.2 feet .
Redwood experts say the discovery is a bit surprising considering that so much of the state 's redwood forests have been logged .
Although officials decline to pinpoint the exact locations of the tall trees , the stand found by Atkins and fellow amateur naturalist Michael Taylor were protected less than 30 years ago by an expansion of the national park 's boundary .
Atkins and Taylor discovered Helios and Icarus on July 1 and Hyperion on Aug. 25 .
They took initial measurements with hand - held lasers before returning with Steve Sillett , a Humboldt State University biologist known for his work on the ecosystems of ancient forest canopies , and Robert Van Pelt , a forest ecologist at the University of Washington .
The foursome shot more measurements using a tripod - mounted laser fitted with a remote trigger designed to eliminate human - induced wobbles .
Atkins said Hyperion soon will be measured again with a tripod laser or with a " tape drop " -- in which someone climbs the tree and drops a measuring tape to the ground -- before its record - breaking status is confirmed .
Tape drops can't be conducted for at least two weeks because of National Park Service restrictions to protect the marbled murrelet , a small seabird that nests in old - growth redwoods .
If and when the measurement on Hyperion is confirmed , it is likely to supplant the Stratosphere Giant in the Guinness Book of World Records .
To change the record , the tree 's dimensions must be sent to Guinness , which will forward the information to its record verification department in the United Kingdom .
It could take several weeks to confirm the new record , Guinness spokeswoman Kristen Opalach said .
George Koch , a biology professor at Northern Arizona University who specializes in plant ecophysiology , called the find incredibly exciting .
" With so much of the old - growth redwoods gone -- more than 90 percent -- you would n't necessarily expect a discovery like this , " he said .
The find is all the more remarkable , Koch said , because the trees are in a tract added to the park belatedly , during President Jimmy Carter 's administration .
" They are n't all that far from an old clear - cut , " he said .
" Basically , they were almost nuked .
The fact that they were n't is amazing . "
Koch said the trees are also noteworthy for their location .
It had long been assumed , he said , that very tall redwoods favor creek bottoms where rich , alluvial soils and abundant water allow for extravagant growth .
The newly discovered trees live on slopes .
" It seems that they were close to tributary stream courses , however , so they probably were able to keep their feet wet , " he said .
Atkins confirmed that all three of the trees were adjacent to creeks or springs .
" Even though they 're on steep slopes , they 're growing in the finest redwood habitat on the planet , " Atkins said .
" They 're right below a ridge , so they 're protected from the wind .
They 're near abundant water , and they have plenty of fog , which keeps the local microclimate mild and moist .
And they have great sun exposure . "
The tree 's precise location has not been revealed and probably wo n't be .
The Stratosphere Giant 's location is generally referred to as the Rockefeller Forest .
Rick Nolan , the acting superintendent of Redwood National Park , said it would be nearly impossible for visitors to find the trees .
Unlike isolated giant sequoias , including one in Sequoia National Park that holds the record as the world 's most massive tree , coast redwoods grow together .
" From the visitors ' perspective , it 's important to understand that if they come looking for the biggest tree , they 're not going to find it , " Nolan said .
" They 're consumed by the rest of the forest . "
Reaching the backcountry is difficult .
Atkins said he takes heavy gear , including the laser tripod , over steep slopes , over downed trees and through thick vegetation .
" Bushwhacking in that kind of country is kind of like climbing Everest at 28,000 feet , " he said .
Reaching the record - breaking trees " is n't a pleasure hike . "
The difficult terrain is n't the only reason to keep the location a secret .
Ruskin Hartley is the conservation director for the Save the Redwoods League , the country 's oldest conservation group devoted to redwood ecosystem preservation .
She said problems sometimes occur when superlatives are appended to specific trees .
One such case , he said , involved the Mendocino Tree , a redwood near Ukiah that at one time was considered the world 's tallest tree .
The rush of visitors created management problems .
Similar problems , including root damage , have injured other giant trees .
" We need to remember that while redwoods are large robust trees , they are also delicate in some ways .
They have very shallow root systems , and the landscapes they comprise are vulnerable to disturbance , " Hartley said .
" We need to draw attention to the forest as a whole , to the entire system , not the individual trees . "

The NYT today writes ( my emphasis ) :
Last March , the federal government set up a Web site to make public a vast archive of Iraqi documents captured during the war .
The Bush administration did so under pressure from Congressional Republicans who had said they hoped to “ leverage the Internet ” to find new evidence of the prewar dangers posed by Saddam Hussein .
But in recent weeks , the site has posted some documents that weapons experts say are a danger themselves : detailed accounts of Iraqs secret nuclear research before the 1991 Persian Gulf war .
The documents , the experts say , constitute a basic guide to building an atom bomb .
The site in question has been taken down now , but at least Yahoo still has bits and pieces in their cache .
Wikipedia knows more .

I published a large file host list last month and good lots of positive and some negative feedback concerning the list .
The list contained sites that allow users to upload files to web services on the Internet , for instance to access them from other locations or share them with friends or even the public .
A negative aspect was that it only featured a few categories that were not that useful to find a host that suited special needs .
Therefore , I decided to compile a new list with more information available on first glance to help you pick the right file hosting site .
Information besides the site name consist of the following parameters .
Reg :
Does the site require a registration before you can use their services ?
Registration means free registration of course .
Filesize :
Is there a maximum size for a single file , in Mb ?
No res = no restrictions
Space :
How much disks pace is allocated for the user ?
If there is no registration the max filesize has been taken as max space allowed .
No res = no restrictions
Bandwidth : Are there bandwidth limitations ?
Filetypes :
Are certain filetypes not allowed to be uploaded ?
Hotlinking :
Does the site allow hotlinking ?
Expires :
Are the files auto - deleted after a time , if yes the number of days are shown .
If the number is unknown yes will be shown .
Sometimes files only get deleted after inactivity for a certain time , if thats the case a " i " is added to the number .
Sometimes file get deleted after a certain number of downloads , if thats the case a " d " is added to the number .
It took me about 6 hours to compile the list , its divided into file hosts with and without registrations and image hosts with and without registrations .
If you have additions let me know and I add them in the January list .
Free File Hosts :
Name Filesize Space Bandwidth Filetypes Hotlinking Expires 4 Shared 10 100 no res all no 30 i Bigupload 300 300 no res all no 30 i Filefactory 500 500 no res all no 15i Megashares none none none all no 25i Rapidshare 100 100 30 + hour all no 30 i Savefile 60 no res no res all no 14i Sendspace 1200 1200 100000 all no 14i Uploading 500 500 no res all no 30i Ultrashare 30 30 no res all no 30 i
Free File Hosts with registration :
Name Filesize Space Bandwidth Filetypes Hotlinking Expires Savefile 60 no res no res all no 14i
Free Image Hosts :
Name Filesize Space Bandwidth Hotlinking Expires Filehost 5 5 no res yes ?
Imageshack 1 1 100 hour yes no Tinypic 0,25 0,25 ?
yes no
Update :
We had to remove the majority of file hosts from the list as most are no longer available on the Internet .
I would like to make two suggestions though that have not been on this list before .
A great image hosting site is Imgur and a great file hosting site is Mediafire .

I used to have a website , , which I designed in 1997 .
With the white text on black background , neon - effect buttons and spinning animated GIFs , it truly was a site of the nineties and that is where it should stay .
I decommissioned the site last week , but arranged for it to record which URLs which were requested .
As expected for an essentially dead site , other than robots , there were practically no hits , with the exception of one set of files .
In 2001 , I made a desktop background , called Eye of the Code , which I submitted to themes.org .
It has been reasonably popular , and someone even based a Fluxbox theme on it .
What I did n't know was that 9 blogs and homepages were hotlinking to this image , so I was getting several hits per hour , downloading the 500 kB image .
Now , tradition dictates replacing it with a suitable shock images , which due to captain_aj 's valiant efforts I am very familiar with .
However , I thought something more creative was called for .
On reading these pages , the impression I get from all of them is people screaming for attention .
My desktop background was designed to be sedate and non-distracting ( although it does n't go well with text ) .
I thus went for something more appropriate , of course including a photo of the centre of attention .
For example with Tabatha 's MySpace page :
Using mod_rewrite I serve up the appropriate image based on the HTTP referrer .
For example , here is the result for Yuppie Killer :
Before
After
In the interest of international relations , for the German page , I used " Guck mal ... ich bin TOLL !! " , which translates to " Look ... I 'm GREAT !!" .
The full list of sites is below .
If the background does n't load correctly , hit Shift + Reload ; browsers do n't expect images to change on the basis of referrer , so often cache the wrong one .
Tabatha aka devilsangel891 – Website that plays music ; stabby , stab
avril13 <>s knuddelige HP – In German , big page , she likes Avril Lavigne and eyes apparently
Marie aka freak_taleen – " I felt like drawing a sheep . "
But you did n't ; why not just hotlink to someone else 's sheep ?
Yuppie Killer aka fuckyourcar – Angry .
Latest blog entry : " Am I missing something ?... do I have a sign on me that says : " I'm a complete fucking moron ? " .
No , but your new web page background should send a similar message
M.I.L.F. –
How can someone be a self described MILF ?
( NSFW )
h_e_x_o_n – He has a < marquee > that displays an insult ; classy
that displays an insult ; classy Jocelyn aka strangeoid – " I am a very artsy - fartsy type person .
I draw , write , paint , sing , act , sew , make my own jewlery " .
For a writer your spelling leaves something to be desired , and if you think blue text on a red background is aesthetically pleasing , I have doubts about the painting .
clompy – Wow , it makes my mouse pointer turn into a crosshair , how can I do that ?
( no photo unfortunately )
youlaugh_ibleed &ndash I think her keyboard is broken ( again , no photo ) .
And her page turns the cursor into a crosshair ; I wonder if these two know each other ?
I hope you will agree that this is a significant improvement .
I will wait and see if the web page owners concur .
Update 6 Dec 2005 :
Yuppie Killer is the first one to spot the change .
As predicted by captain_aj , Yuppie Killer says :
To whoever hacked my account and changed my background picture .... You are a fucking piece of shit
He has changed his user page to be white text on a white background , but if you highlight it then you can read his ranting .
Update 7 Dec 2005 :
Yuppie Killer has updated his message :
To whoever hacked my account and changed my background picture , is that all you got ?.... You fucking piece of shit
Myself andare working on the answer .
Update 7 Dec 2005 :
Tabatha has updated her page ( still has music ) .
She now hotlinks to a painting called " Mushroom People " .
She has n't made any comments about the change , and does n't have a blog .
Update 8 Dec 2005 :
Avril 13 has changed her background .
This time not hotlinking &ndash perhaps she is learning .
Clompy has taken her journal offline .
Perhaps she thinks it has been hacked and will bring it back later .
Update 10 Dec 2005 :
h_e_x_o_n has noticed .
In his blog post , he says :
who made the new background for me :P i really like that ......
It is still set to my image .
Any suggestions on what I should do ?
Update 11 Dec 2005 :
A fine suggestion from captain_aj was to make h_e_x_o_n 's background a screamer , albeit without the scream .
You need to wait for 8 seconds .
Update 12 Dec 2005 :
h_e_x_o_n does n't like the screamer as much as the previous image .
He now hotlinks to a 1275 × 1753 JPEG from Barb 's Bunker .
Tasteful , but makes the text unreadable .
Probably for the best .
Update 15 Dec 2005 :
h_e_x_o_n has found my journal , thanks to his ( anti - ) stalking script , and retaliated .
Sally Lever sent in her latest newsletter some interesting ideas , on how to discipline yourself further to live more with less – without torturing yourself .
In the end it always comes out to money matters , right ?
I.e .
1 . How much money do I need in order to downshift ?
You would need to have an income of some form that is higher than your living costs .
If your downshifting plans involve quitting your job and having some time out , either between jobs or in order to start your own business , then it would be wise to reduce your living costs and have some money put aside in savings to cover for that while your income is reduced .
Money experts tend to recommend a sum equivalent to 6 months ’ income .
2. Can anyone downshift ?
Most people can .
Downshifting by definition means trading a high standard of living and low ( often highly stressful ) quality of life for a higher quality of life .
A downshifted life is a simpler life and often richer in time rather than in money .
So , in order to downshift , one needs to have some money to spare at first .
This might not necessarily be a lump sum in the bank .
It might be equity tied up in your home or other possessions that you could sell .
Downshifting might then involve moving to a smaller home or a similar home in a less expensive area or selling some of your possessions .
3 . What if I am in debt ?
If you are in debt then this is an issue you will probably want to tackle as a matter of urgency .
Living frugally and downshifting your lifestyle may well form part of your plans for lifting yourself out of debt .
It can be a very satisfying way to decrease your living costs without feeling that you are depriving yourself .
4 . How does anyone manage to live on less ?
There are many pressures on us in Western Society to consume .
Whilst we continually expose ourselves to this through television , newspapers and magazines , we can easily form the opinion that we have to keep acquiring more and succeeding more in order to be accepted .
Here are a few simple things to try for one week to demonstrate to yourself that you can reduce your costs and change your money spending activities :
– Have a week that is media - free i.e. no television , radio , newspapers or magazines and notice how you are less tempted to spend money on what you feel you “ ought to have . ”
– Stay away from supermarkets .
Buy your food only from local independent retailers or farms .
Notice how much less you spend on food now that you have to work a little harder to get it and that you are less tempted to impulse buy .
– No eating out or takeaways .
If you feel like having a food treat , make yourself a special candle - lit dinner .
– Put your credit cards away and only buy what you can afford in your current account .
Better still , take an amount of cash out of the bank that is your budget for the whole week and only spend that .
Notice how much more aware you are of how you are spending your money .
If you do n’t think you can manage all of those at one time , then try each of them in turn for a week .
5 . Does downshifting always involve living on less ?
It usually does to begin with .
Ironically , in the longer term some downshifters earn more money , or have a higher level of disposable income , having reduced their costs and found a way of earning money that is more aligned with their values .
6 . Is n’t it selfish ?
It is n’t selfish to want to be the best you can be .
Ultimately others will benefit when you live in a way that is in alignment with your values and passions .
There are diplomatic and considerate ways to express your wishes to your nearest and dearest
7 . Wo n’t I be plunged into poverty ?
There is an important difference between poverty and frugal simplicity .
Poverty is involuntary and disabling whereas frugal simplicity is voluntary and empowering .
In my personal experience , the key to finding the right way for you is to stay assertive , focussed and informed in everything you do on the downshifting path .
8 . Is it a one - way ticket ?
This will depend on your confidence in your ability to :
– earn money when necessary
– stay flexible and learn from your mistakes
– continue learning new skills
Keep in mind that there are many possibilities for how you can live you life in simplicity and in alignment with your true nature .
And , you ’re allowed to try out as many of those possibilities as you like .
Have fun exploring the potentialities . :o )

A special magnetic effect , the so - called magnetorotational instability ( MRI ) , plays a key role in the formation of stars and planetary systems .
It is also what feeds the black holes in the center of galaxies .
For the first time , this effect has been observed in a laboratory experiment at the Forschungszentrum Dresden - Rossendorf ( Germany ) .
These results have recently been published in Physical Review Letters .
Everybody remembers the picture of the hungry black hole swallowing all matter in its vicinity .
Not even light has a chance to escape .
However , closer inspection reveals that feeding a black hole is far from trivial .
Typically , the matter around black holes has organized itself into so - called accretion disks .
And just as the Earth is not falling into the sun , the black hole cannot just scarf up the matter encircling it .
Before being swallowed by the black hole , the gas in the disk has to be slowed down in order to weaken the centrifugal forces , which keep the gas rotating .
But how does one put the brakes on matter in an accretion disk ?
Since this problem not only applies to black holes , but also to normal stars , it is of fundamental importance for the formation of cosmic structures .
Balbus and Hawley proposed the solution to this problem in 1991 .
They showed mathematically that stable rotating flows can be destabilized by external magnetic fields .
This effect , now known as magnetorotational instability ( MRI ) , enables sufficient angular momentum transport in accretion disks , which is essential for the mass concentration in stars and black holes .
Laboratory simulation of star formation
For approximately five years , teams throughout the world have tried to create this instability in a laboratory .
Two recent papers in the journal Nature ( November 16 , 2006 ) underlined the urgent need for an experimental demonstration of MRI by showing evidence that hydrodynamics alone is not capable of producing turbulence in accretion disks .
At the Forschungszentrum Dresden - Rossendorf the experiment PROMISE ( Potsdam Rossendorf Magnetic InStability Experiment ) was set - up and carried out as a joint project between scientists from Dresden and from the Astrophysikalisches Institut Potsdam ( AIP ) .
The experimental set - up contains unusual details , such as the use of a simple wastewater tube carrying the coil that produces the vertical magnetic field .
Within this tube , there are two co-axial copper cylinders with a two to one ratio in radius .
As long as the rotation rate of the outer cylinder is larger than a quarter of the rate of the inner cylinder , the liquid metal flow between them is stable .
The flow field is measured with ultrasonic velocity sensors .
The interesting point is that this initially stable flow is destabilized by an externally applied spiral magnetic field .
For the first time , this experiment allowed the observation of a magnetorotational instability in a laboratory .
The figure shows the measured axial flow as a function of the vertical position and time for three different currents in the coils .
In each case , the azimuthal magnetic field is produced by an axial current of 6000 Ampères .
In good agreement with numerical simulations , an upward traveling wave is observed only for certain levels of current in the coils .
Moreover , the measured frequency of the traveling wave agrees well with the numerical prediction .
The results were published recently in Physical Review Letters and Astrophysical Journal Letters .

NORTH VANCOUVER - A North Vancouver couple has complained to District of North Vancouver council and said they will sue the North Vancouver RCMP after officers responded to their hang - up 911 call by breaking down their door , making a forceful arrest and jailing them overnight when the couple refused to allow a house - search .
The RCMP said , however , that in this case , federal policy commands a home - check , designed to ensure public safety .
North Vancouver resident Marget Lieder said that in the early evening of Oct. 25 she was having wine with her partner and a guest when she misdialed the emergency number , meaning to call 411 instead .
After promptly hanging up , the police contacted her , saying two officers were dispatched and warned her her home would be searched to confirm she was n't in danger .
" I do n't want my privacy to be invaded just because I misdial a number , " she said .
Once the officers arrived , she only spoke to them on her porch , refusing entrance .
" They did n't have a search warrant and they did n't have anything to do in my house . "
She insisted she had nothing to hide and there was no cause for distress .
Three more officers arrived shortly after , broke down the door and arrested Lieder and her partner , Larry Pierce , for obstruction of justice , she said .
" I was sitting on the couch .
They stuck a Taser in my face , threatening me with 50,000 volts , " said Pierce , a well - known lawyer .
" They threw me on the floor , twisted my left arm .
A police officer stuck his knee into my ribs and jumped on me . "
Later he found out that his two ribs were cracked , recalled Pierce .
The couple said the officers began taping them right away even though their rights were n't read until they were in the car .
Once in jail , Pierce remembered he was interrogated for over an hour .
North Vancouver RCMP Const .
John MacAdam said police are obliged to search the premises after a hang - up 911 call .
Pierce maintained his rights were violated and he will go ahead with a lawsuit .
The Distrct of Columbia spends more per pupil on it ’s public education system than 47 out of the 50 states , and yet it ’s public education system ranks as one of the worst in the nation .
If nothing else , this is testament to the idea that throwing money at public schools will not solve their problems .
It also makes you wonder where the money is going if problems like this still exist :
To fix D.C. public schools — better yet , to make the school system a model for the nation — look no further than what the students say they need .
Donell Kie , a sophomore at Ballou Senior High School , and fellow student leaders came up with a pretty good list that was shared Saturday at a D.C. Council hearing on school reform .
Among the things that they wanted to see in every public school : “ books when school starts , ” “ heat in winter , ” “ air conditioning in summer , ” “ healthy meals , ” “ water fountains that work , ” “ music and art classes , ” “ counselors who are able to help us ” and “ teachers who care about their students and can teach . ”
Speaking of having air conditioning in the summer , seeing as there are companies such as Universal HVAC that exist , there should n’t be any excuses as to why these students can enjoy this during the summer months .
Having students work in unsuitable conditions is n’t going to help them progress .
Perhaps the school should install evaporative cooling to keep students cool and comfortable .
Being too hot can be really disruptive , so keeping them cool could increase their productivity .
It could be the same in the winter ; students would n’t be able to work in fridged temperatures , luckily there are companies similar to Green Horizon – see more at Https://greenhorizon.com / heating / – to ensure that their heating is completely working .
These students are n’t just belly - aching about non-existent problems , they are expressing the harsh reality of what the D.C. Public School system is like .
During the recent cold wave , when temperatures dipped into the single digits for days , schools in the District remained closed for days because of lack of heat :
This is just completely unacceptable , especially with the number of heating and air conditioning experts that could easily rectify this issue .
With professionals like Indoor Comfort Specialists , these issues could be gone and students can get back to being educated .
For the fourth day in a row , D.C. school officials scrambled to keep routines as normal as possible as they tried to repair boilers that failed during the cold snap .
This resulted in hot water problems and no heating .
Nearly 1,800 students from four schools were reassigned to other facilities this week because of heating and water problems .
The four schools were Woodson and Ludlow - Taylor Elementary , both in Northeast , and Johnson Junior High and Simon Elementary in Southeast .
More than 30 other schools had boiler malfunctions this week that left rooms or sections of buildings cold .
This could have created a lot of unnecessary interruption for the staff and pupils of these 30 schools .
To ensure that this does n’t happen again , they may want to have a read of some of these safety tips to avoid heating emergencies so that their boilers can efficiently provide warm heat for the buildings .
However , school system leaders accused the city of not providing sufficient funds to maintain aging buildings .
Parents blamed everyone .
Answer me this question , if the heat does n’t work in the winter , if there ’s no air conditioning like that available from sites similar to topwindowfans.com in the summer , and if the students do n’t have books when the school year starts , then just what is the District of Columbia spending more that $ 16,000 per pupil per year on ?
10 Most Beautiful Cars of All Time
Design , Featured
on 09/15/2006
Filed under :on
09/15/2006
Our search for the most beautiful cars was primarily guided by one criterion - undoubtful and unmistakable beauty , as much as it is possible to use that term when referring to cars .
It is a rather ungrateful theme , since beauty is very subjective and impossible to generalize .
For some , there can be no match to old timers , while on the other side there are car enthusiasts who believe that car design has never been more perfect than today .
Just think of the Rolls - Royce , Pagani Zonda , McLaren F1 , Ferrari Enzo and many other .
How can they be compared to Ferrari Dino , Talbot - Lago , Jaguar , Porsche Spyder , Duesenberg etc . ?
We hope that you approve of our choice and feel free to add your personal best in the comments .
Jaguar E Type
The Jaguar E type , also known as the XK - E , was launched in 1961 and immediately became a major hit on the market .
It combined not just performance and engineering excellence , but also a stunning design .
An aerodynamics engineer , Malcolm Sayer , is the man to blame for this beauty .
Many consider it probably the most beautiful production sports car .

This elegant design is a result of a combined effort of Count Carlo Felice Trossi , who bought the chassis of the SSK in 1930 , and an unknown English body worker , Wiilie White ( coach - builder ) , who put Trossi 's vision into reality .
It has surely earned its name , the Black Prince .
This magnificent car is in the famous Ralph Lauren car collection .
Bugatti Veyron 16.4

It is one of the fastest , the most expensive , the most powerful and the most beautiful cars of our time .
Veyron holds the Bugatti car making tradition , which never failed in creating beautiful and stylish cars .
Its aerodynamically structured body expresses a perfect union of luxurious and sportive elements .
Bugatti , or Volkswagen - Audi Gruppe to be exact , wanted to show the world the capacity of automotive industry with Veyron .
Such an engineering and design jewel is a phenomenon whose characteristics will not be available in any everyday car , but with its existence , Veyron makes the world a much better place for any automotive enthusiast .

When first describing it , the press used a special expression for this car - goute d'eau , a drop of water .
Later it was translated as ' teardrop . '
Goutte d'eau was a new term , an acknowledgment that the automobile 's speed had crossed an invisible line where aerodynamic drag and stability began to influence performance as much as weight and power .
Jaguars William
Lyons once said : ' That car is positively indecent . '

It is the beauty and the beast at the same time .
The provocative and futuristic Zonda design is the creation of Horacio Pagani , and is a result of the intense search for aerodynamic and ergonomic aesthetics linked to the need to create a sensational and exceptional car .
It is wild and raw , and surely wo n't leave you indifferent .
It is interesting that Horacio used his wife for a model during designing this car .
And actually , when looked from above , Zonda really has the figure of a supermodel .
1967 Shelby Mustang Eleanor GT500

This car became more famous than ever after the Gone in 60 Seconds movie , where it got its name - Eleanor .
The car in the movie was a modified version of 1967 GT500 and featured extensive external body upgrades .
Since it became so popular , and it is obvious why , Shelby started production of Mustang GT - 500 Es .
Everyone just went crazy for it .
Even a couple of years after the movie , Eleanor is still exceptionally popular .
In USA , there are a couple of workshops that offer outstanding Eleanor replicas with even more power than the original version had .
Ferrari Dino

The name " Dino “ honours Dino ( Alfredo ) Ferrari , the son of Enzo Ferrari , who suggested his father developed a V6 racing engine for Formula 2 in the early 60s .
He died before the car was finished , and Enzo , for the memory of his son , put the V6 into a mid-engined sports car and named it " Dino . "
Like all beautiful Ferraris , the Dino was designed by Pininfarina .
The chief designer , Leonardo Fioravanti , gave Dino a very sexy , low shoulder body which was different from previous Ferrari designs and influenced the future models .
By many , it is still the most beautiful Ferrari ever built .
1955 Mercedes - Benz 300SL Coupe

The Mercedes - Benz 300SL is a two - seat , closed sports car with characteristic gull - wing or butterfly wing doors , which , when opened , resembled a bird 's outstretched wings .
This car definitely attracts attention and has a distinctive and unique appearance , but is not very practical or comfortable .
Still , beauty comes first , and this one deserves its ' title .
Rolls - Royce Phantom

The list would n't be complete without the legendary Rolls - Royce .
It is massive ( the Phantom ’s aluminium space frame is the largest of its kind ever built for automotive use ) and every line and detail on this car screams power and elegance .
Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato

The DB4 Zagato appeared in 1960 , and was produced for only two years .
During that time , only 19 cars were built and all are still existing in the hand of Aston Martin enthusiasts .
It was basically a DB4 GT improved by the Zagato factory , by Ercole Spada .
Aston Martin wanted a series of DB4 GT's that would be lighter and more competitive racing against the Ferrari 250 GT's .
In 1960 it contracted Zagato to build bodies for 19 chassis .
What they have come up with is the most desirable Aston Martin ever - beautiful , yet aggressive .
This car marked one of the most memorable chapters in Aston history .

Your Comments
The more time you spend listening to “ social media experts ” and reading breathless press reports about the future of social media , the more value you ’ll begin to assign to “ influencers ” .
A near mythical creature through whom all information of value is transferred from the merchants to the masses .
And like most mythical creatures , tales of it ’s prowess and miraculous achievements far exceed any of it ’s sightings .
The term “ Influencer ” , like many online neologisms , is poorly defined .
The term itself is often used interchangeably with related terms , that convey different concepts , like fan , popular , early adopter and celebrity .
The problem is further compounded when network theory is layered on top of these linguistic inaccuracies resulting in a conceptual hodgepodge of little clarifying value .
Given the importance companies are placing on identifying “ influencers ” and the sheer number of companies popping up to make that happen , having a way to evaluate claims of influence , beyond simple popularity , is critical .
Thankfully , there is a wealth of academic and commercial thought around the nature and mechanics of influence available to interested strategist .
Taking that research and applying it to the evolving social media landscape a number of important evaluative questions become readily apparent .
The following questions should help you tell the difference between vendors of truly insightful analysis and those selling colorful charts and quantitative snake oil .
These questions are intended as simple set of heuristics to aide in the development of analytic programs and the vetting of commercial applications .
Answering these questions gets you closer to a identifying the truly influential people within a group and how that influence may be tapped for both commercial and more importantly , group benefit .
Vendors who cant answer these questions , or worse have n’t considered them , are unlikely to offer actionable data and should be avoided .
1 ) What is the nature of the relationship between Influencer and Influenced ?
Author Malcolm Gladwell has over 46,000 followers on Twitter .
In this group there are fans of his pop-science books , readers of his articles , critics of his writtings , personal friends and celebrity followers .
His influence over the various sub - groups that make up his “ followers ” is neither constant nor always positive .
Identifying the nature of the relationship between Mr. Gladwell and the various groups of people who follow him is critical to understanding his influence on them .
Any program that claims to be able to identify an “ influencer ” should also be able to identify the nature of the relationship they have with the groups over whom they hold sway .
Even a rough categorization of the “ influencers ” audience into groups like , Friends , Fans and Foes , would yield more actionable data then a generic total number of people “ influenced ” .
Without information on the nature of the relationship between an “ influencer ” and the sub - groups she influences , the only thing that can be assessed is relative popularity .
If a company is using social media to label someone as an “ influencer ” than it stands to reason that they should be able to discern the nature of the social influence they exert .
Unfortunately , most influence peddlers skip this step and simply assume that popularity + activity ( FOF ) = social influence .
Any vendor offering influence analytics without also offering a reasonably in - depth analysis of the relationship between the “ influencer ” and the influenced is not to be believed .
2 ) What is the structure of the network and the community that uses it ?
Danah Boyd ‘s blog post on “ the Real social network ” is a great thought piece , worth the time of every strategist developing social media products .
The main point of the piece is that when analyzing relationships in social networks , the “ social ” components do not translate across different networks .
While this initially seems like a fairly obvious notion , it is often ignored by analytics vendors promoting “ influencer ” programs .
On LinkedIn , to establish a connection with someone requires their permission .
On Twitter , you can connect to anyone with or without their permission and it requires an act on their part to sever that connection .
This slight variation in how connections are made on Linked In vs Twitter creates very different network structures and fundamentally different community behaviors .
The status update about the great Tuna sandwich one had for lunch plays very differently on Twitter than it does on Linked In .
It would also travel at different velocities through the networks , reaching a different number of nodes by traversing completely separate paths ( even if the population had a high degree of overlap ) .
On LinkedIn the nature of the ties connecting people , times associated with those links and power dynamics of those links are either expressly stated or can reasonably inferred .
The structure of the network on Linked In makes it a better candidate for influence analysis than Twitter , where none of this information is available .
Determining the influence individuals have on each other on a loosely connected network like Twitter , where connections are formed haphazardly , is far more complex than on Linked In .
Providers of “ influencer ” metrics should be able to discuss the structure of the network where their analysis was done and how that structure effects the “ influencers ” they ’ve identified .
Unfortunately , this is rarely the case .
Vendors have a tendency to declare someone an influencer and allow clients to infer that the influence is both universal and transitory .
Without any insight into the structure of the network and the community that is built on top of it all a vendor can claim to measure is popularity .
3 ) In what domain is the influence exerted and how ?
Conservative American political pundit , Steven Colbert , is a very influential figure .
However , it is only by identifying specific domains where he is highly influential ( liberal book sales , magazine attractiveness , political donations , digital downloads ) and those where he is not ( audience knowledge , satirical awareness ) that his true status as an “ influencer ” becomes meaningful .
Identifying the domain in which someone may be influential is just as important ( if not more so ) than knowing who has influence .
In what area does the “ influencer ” shape the thinking of their constituents and how do they do this ?
Again rough categorizations such as “ awareness ” , “ action ” , “ sentiment ” , “ spread ” , would be far more insightful than simply claiming someone is influential .
If someone is highly influential at increasing their constituents information awareness , is it by simply pointing it out the information ( attention ) or by highlighting some aspect of it ( contextualizing it ) ?
It is not enough to assign “ influencers ” to obvious subject matter buckets ( ie Technology , Mommy Blogger , Foodies ) as this doesnt help identify the domain of influence only the subject matter in which that domain occurs .
Without knowledge of the domain in which the influence occurs it is impossible to align influence goals with the proper “ influencers ” .
Does the person simply help spread a brand message in one way or do they deepen the relationship between a brand and its users ?
Will the influencer drive sales of the product or service or awareness of it ?
If your influence vendor cannot provide some insight into the domain where their “ influencer ” exerts control or how do they do it , then the information they provide is unlikely to have any more lasting impact then a traditional banner campaign .
Conclusion
Marketers are used to broadcasting messages at consumers , using everything from celebrity figures to experts .
Influence analytics programs are treated as the digital equivalent of this process , locating a “ super user ” to broadcast messages at all other users .
Marketers have fallen in love with the idea of locating a central figure who can broadcast their brand message into a desirable niche without requiring them to engage with that niche .
Of course this approach misses the point and much of the opportunity in identifying “ influencers ” .
Vendors have allowed marketers to confuse the ability to broadcast a message at a niche with having influence over that niche .
Sales , engagement , sentiment and distribution are all results of influence that are ignored and not addressed by many “ influencer ” analysis programs .
If an influence peddler does not offer some measure of the nature of the influence ( friend , fan , foe ) , the type of influence ( expertise , authority , emotion ) exerted and the domain ( product , experience , information ) where effective , then be wary .
YOU CAN READ 1,000 profiles of GOP presidential front - runner John McCain without encountering a single paragraph examining his core ideological philosophy .
His career is filled with such distracting drama -- torture at the Hanoi Hilton , noisy conversion to the campaign - finance - reform faith , political suicide on the Straight Talk Express -- that by the time you ’re done with the highlights , and perhaps a few “ maverick ” anecdotes , time ’s up .
People are forever filling in the blanks with their own political fantasies .
Third party candidate !
John Kerry running mate !
Far - right warmonger !
Republican In Name Only !
But with the announcement that the popular Arizona senator has formed his presidential exploratory committee , it ’s time for our long national guessing game to end .
Sifting through McCain ’s four bestselling books and nearly three decades of work on Capitol Hill , a distinct approach toward governance begins to emerge .
And it ’s one that the electorate ought to be particularly worried about right now .
McCain , it turns out , wants to restore your faith in the U.S. government by any means necessary , even if that requires thousands of more military deaths , national service for civilians and federal micromanaging of innumerable private transactions .
He ’ll kick down the doors of boardroom and bedroom , mixing Democrats ’ nanny - state regulations with the GOP ’s red -meat paternalism in a dangerous brew of government activism .
And he ’s trying to accomplish this , in part , for reasons of self - realization .
The first clue to McCain ’s philosophy lies in two seemingly irrelevant items of gossip :
His father was a drunk , and his second wife battled addiction to pain pills .
Neither would be worth mentioning except for the fact that McCain ’s books and speeches are shot through with the language and sentiment of 12 - step recovery , especially Steps 1 ( admitting the problem ) and 2 ( investing faith in a “ Power greater than ourselves ” ) .
Advertisement
Like many alcoholics who have n’t quite made it to Step 6 ( becoming “ entirely ready ” to have these defects removed ) , McCain is disarmingly talented at admitting his narcissistic flaws .
In his 2002 book “ Worth the Fighting For , ” the senator is constantly confessing his problems of “ selfishness , ” “ immaturity , ” “ ambition ” and especially “ temper , ” though he also makes clear that his outbreaks of anger can be justifiable and even laudable when channeled into “ a cause greater than self - interest . ”
“ A rebel without a cause is just a punk , ” he explains .
“ Whatever you ’re called -- rebel , unorthodox , nonconformist , radical -- it ’s all self - indulgence without a good cause to give your life meaning . ”
What is this higher power that ennobles McCain ’s crankiness ?
Just as it is for many soldiers , it ’s the belief that Americans “ were meant to transform history ” and that sublimating the individual in the service of that “ common national cause ” is the wellspring of honor and purpose .
( But unlike most soldiers , McCain has been in a position to prod and even compel civilians to join his cause . )
Liberals and conservatives alike fail to truly reflect his views , McCain writes , because “ neither emphasizes the obligations of a free people to the nation . ”
His main governmental inspiration is Teddy Roosevelt , the “ Eastern swell who became a man of the people , ” whose great accomplishment was “ to summon the American people to greatness . ”
In Roosevelt ’s code , McCain writes approvingly , it was “ absolutely required that every loyal citizen take risks for the country ’s sake . ”
This is an essentially militaristic view of citizenship , one that explains many of McCain ’s departures from partisan orthodoxy .
Unlike traditional Republicans , he will gladly butt into the affairs of private industry if he perceives them to be undermining Americans ’ faith in government ; unlike Democrats , he thinks the executive branch generally needs more power , not less .

“ Our greatness , ” he wrote in “ Worth the Fighting For , ” “ depends upon our patriotism , and our patriotism is hardly encouraged when we cannot take pride in the highest public institutions . ”
So , because steroids might be damaging the faith of young baseball fans , drug testing becomes a “ transcendent issue , ” requiring threats of federal intervention unless pro sports leagues shape up .
Hollywood ’s voluntary movie - rating system ?
A “ smoke screen to provide cover for immoral and unconscionable business practices . ” Ultimate Fighting on Indian reservations ?
“ Barbaric ” and worthy of government pressure on cable TV companies .
Negative political ads by citizen groups ?
They “ do little to further beneficial debate and healthy political dialogue ” and so must be banned for 60 days before an election if they mention a candidate by name .
If his issues line up with yours , and if you ’re not overly concerned by an activist federal government , McCain can be a great and sympathetic ally .
But chances are he will eventually see a grave national threat in what you consider harmless , or he ’ll prescribe a remedy that you consider unconscionable .
Nowhere is that more evident than in his ideas about the Iraq war .
McCain has been banging the drum from nearly Day One to put more boots on the ground in Iraq .
“ There are a lot of things that we can do to salvage this , ” he said on “ Meet the Press ” on Nov. 12 , “ but they all require the presence of additional troops . ”
McCain is more inclined to start wars and increase troop levels than George W. Bush or Bill Clinton .
He has supported every U.S. military intervention of the last two decades , urged both presidents to rattle their sabers louder over North Korea and Iran , lamented the Pentagon ’s failure to intervene in Darfur and Rwanda and supported a general policy of “ rogue state rollback . ”
He ’s a fan of Roosevelt ’s Monroe - Doctrine - on - steroids stick - wielding in Latin America .
And -- like Bush -- he thinks too much multilateralism can screw up a perfectly good war .
The price of all this war - making , in money and manpower , would be staggering ; it ’s hard to imagine without a draft ( McCain has long been a fan of mandatory national service , at the least ) .
But the costs to his political ambitions may even be greater .
The nation is in no mood for the war we ’ve got now , let alone a doubling - down on Iraq and ramped - up unilateralist tough talk in the Middle East .
The trend lines of public opinion on these counts are not pointing in McCain ’s direction .

One of the many charming confessions in “ Worth the Fighting For ” is McCain ’s complaint that the man he replaced in the Senate -- Republican icon Barry Goldwater -- was “ never as affectionate as I would have liked . ”
Small wonder .
Goldwater , a man who seemed to emanate from Arizona ’s dust , was the paragon of limited government , believing to his core that the feds should n’t tell you how to run a business or whom you can sleep with .
McCain , on the other hand , is a third - generation D.C. insider who carpetbagged his way into office , believing to his core that “ national pride will not survive the people ’s contempt for government . ”
On Nov. 7 , those conflicting worldviews collided when Arizonans voted on whether to outlaw gay marriage .
McCain campaigned in favor of the ban , in the name of “ preserving the sanctity ” of heterosexual unions .
His exhortations went down to surprising defeat .
Not , one suspects , for the last time .
PHYS771 Lecture 9 : Quantum
Scott Aaronson
There are two ways to teach quantum mechanics .
The first way -- which for most physicists today is still the only way -- follows the historical order in which the ideas were discovered .
So , you start with classical mechanics and electrodynamics , solving lots of grueling differential equations at every step .
Then you learn about the " blackbody paradox " and various strange experimental results , and the great crisis these things posed for physics .
Next you learn a complicated patchwork of ideas that physicists invented between 1900 and 1926 to try to make the crisis go away .
Then , if you 're lucky , after years of study you finally get around to the central conceptual point : that nature is described not by probabilities ( which are always nonnegative ) , but by numbers called amplitudes that can be positive , negative , or even complex .
Today , in the quantum information age , the fact that all the physicists had to learn quantum this way seems increasingly humorous .
For example , I 've had experts in quantum field theory -- people who 've spent years calculating path integrals of mind - boggling complexity -- ask me to explain the Bell inequality to them .
That 's like Andrew Wiles asking me to explain the Pythagorean Theorem .
As a direct result of this " QWERTY " approach to explaining quantum mechanics - which you can see reflected in almost every popular book and article , down to the present -- the subject acquired an undeserved reputation for being hard .
Educated people memorized the slogans -- " light is both a wave and a particle , " " the cat is neither dead nor alive until you look , " " you can ask about the position or the momentum , but not both , " " one particle instantly learns the spin of the other through spooky action - at - a - distance , " etc. -- and also learned that they should n't even try to understand such things without years of painstaking work .
The second way to teach quantum mechanics leaves a blow - by - blow account of its discovery to the historians , and instead starts directly from the conceptual core -- namely , a certain generalization of probability theory to allow minus signs .
Once you know what the theory is actually about , you can then sprinkle in physics to taste , and calculate the spectrum of whatever atom you want .
This second approach is the one I 'll be following here .
So , what is quantum mechanics ?
Even though it was discovered by physicists , it 's not a physical theory in the same sense as electromagnetism or general relativity .
In the usual " hierarchy of sciences " -- with biology at the top , then chemistry , then physics , then math -- quantum mechanics sits at a level between math and physics that I do n't know a good name for .
Basically , quantum mechanics is the operating system that other physical theories run on as application software ( with the exception of general relativity , which has n't yet been successfully ported to this particular OS ) .
There 's even a word for taking a physical theory and porting it to this OS : " to quantize . "
But if quantum mechanics is n't physics in the usual sense -- if it 's not about matter , or energy , or waves , or particles -- then what is it about ?
From my perspective , it 's about information and probabilities and observables , and how they relate to each other .
Ray Laflamme :
That 's very much a computer - science point of view .
Scott : Yes , it is .
My contention in this lecture is the following : Quantum mechanics is what you would inevitably come up with if you started from probability theory , and then said , let 's try to generalize it so that the numbers we used to call " probabilities " can be negative numbers .
As such , the theory could have been invented by mathematicians in the 19th century without any input from experiment .
It was n't , but it could have been .
Ray Laflamme :
And yet , with all the structures mathematicians studied , none of them came up with quantum mechanics until experiment forced it on them ...
Scott : Yes -- and to me , that 's a perfect illustration of why experiments are relevant in the first place !
More often than not , the only reason we need experiments is that we 're not smart enough .
After the experiment has been done , if we 've learned anything worth knowing at all , then hopefully we 've learned why the experiment was n't necessary to begin with -- why it would n't have made sense for the world to be any other way .
But we 're too dumb to figure it out ourselves !
Two other perfect examples of " obvious - in - retrospect " theories are evolution and special relativity .
Admittedly , I do n't know if the ancient Greeks , sitting around in their togas , could have figured out that these theories were true .
But certainly -- certainly ! -- they could 've figured out that they were possibly true : that they 're powerful principles that would 've at least been on God 's whiteboard when She was brainstorming the world .
In this lecture , I 'm going to try to convince you -- without any recourse to experiment -- that quantum mechanics would also have been on God 's whiteboard .
I 'm going to show you why , if you want a universe with certain very generic properties , you seem forced to one of three choices : ( 1 ) determinism , ( 2 ) classical probabilities , or ( 3 ) quantum mechanics .
Even if the " mystery " of quantum mechanics can never be banished entirely , you might be surprised by just how far people could 've gotten without leaving their armchairs !
That they did n't get far until atomic spectra and so on forced the theory down their throats is one of the strongest arguments I know for experiments being necessary .
A Less Than 0 % Chance
Alright , so what would it mean to have " probability theory " with negative numbers ?
Well , there 's a reason you never hear the weather forecaster talk about a - 20 % chance of rain tomorrow -- it really does make as little sense as it sounds .
But I 'd like you to set any qualms aside , and just think abstractly about an event with N possible outcomes .
We can express the probabilities of those events by a vector of N real numbers :
( p 1 , .... , p N ) ,
Mathematically , what can we say about this vector ?
Well , the probabilities had better be nonnegative , and they 'd better sum to 1 .
We can express the latter fact by saying that the 1 - norm of the probability vector has to be 1 .
( The 1 - norm just means the sum of the absolute values of the entries . )
But the 1 - norm is not the only norm in the world -- it 's not the only way we know to define the " size " of a vector .
There are other ways , and one of the recurring favorites since the days of Pythagoras has been the 2 - norm or Euclidean norm .
Formally , the Euclidean norm means the square root of the sum of the squares of the entries .
Informally , it means you 're late for class , so instead of going this way and then that way , you cut across the grass .
Now , what happens if you try to come up with a theory that 's like probability theory , but based on the 2 - norm instead of the 1 - norm ?
I 'm going to try to convince you that quantum mechanics is what inevitably results .
Let 's consider a single bit .
In probability theory , we can describe a bit as having a probability p of being 0 , and a probability 1 - p of being 1 .
But if we switch from the 1 - norm to the 2 - norm , now we no longer want two numbers that sum to 1 , we want two numbers whose squares sum to 1 .
( I 'm assuming we 're still talking about real numbers . )
In other words , we now want a vector ( α , β) where α2 + β 2 = 1 .
Of course , the set of all such vectors forms a circle :
The theory we 're inventing will somehow have to connect to observation .
So , suppose we have a bit that 's described by this vector ( α , β ) .
Then we 'll need to specify what happens if we look at the bit .
Well , since it is a bit , we should see either 0 or 1 !
Furthermore , the probability of seeing 0 and the probability of seeing 1 had better add up to 1 .
Now , starting from the vector ( α , β ) , how can we get two numbers that add up to 1 ?
Simple : we can let α2 be the probability of a 0 outcome , and let β 2 be the probability of a 1 outcome .
But in that case , why not forget about α and β , and just describe the bit directly in terms of probabilities ?
Ahhhhh .
The difference comes in how the vector changes when we apply an operation to it .
In probability theory , if we have a bit that 's represented by the vector ( p,1 - p ) , then we can represent any operation on the bit by a stochastic matrix : that is , a matrix of nonnegative real numbers where every column adds up to 1 .
So for example , the " bit flip " operation -- which changes the probability of a 1 outcome from p to 1 - p -- can be represented as follows :
Indeed , it turns out that a stochastic matrix is the most general sort of matrix that always maps a probability vector to another probability vector .
Exercise 1 for the Non-Lazy Reader : Prove this .
But now that we 've switched from the 1 - norm to the 2 - norm , we have to ask : what 's the most general sort of matrix that always maps a unit vector in the 2 - norm to another unit vector in the 2 - norm ?
Well , we call such a matrix a unitary matrix -- indeed , that 's one way to define what a unitary matrix is !
( Oh , all right .
As long as we 're only talking about real numbers , it 's called an orthogonal matrix .
But same difference . )
Another way to define a unitary matrix , again in the case of real numbers , is as a matrix whose inverse equals its transpose .
Exercise 2 for the Non-Lazy Reader : Prove that these two definitions are equivalent .
Gus Gutoski :
So far you 've given no motivation for why you 've set the sum of the squares equal to 1 , rather than the sum of the cubes or the sum of the fourth powers ...
Scott : I 'm gettin ' to it -- do n't you worry about that !
This " 2 - norm bit " that we 've defined has a name , which as you know is qubit .
Physicists like to represent qubits using what they call " Dirac ket notation , " in which the vector ( α , β ) becomes .
Here α is the amplitude of outcome |0〉 , and β is the amplitude of outcome | 1 〉 .
This notation usually drives computer scientists up a wall when they first see it -- especially because of the asymmetric brackets !
But if you stick with it , you see that it 's really not so bad .
As an example , instead of writing out a vector like ( 0,0,3/5,0,0,0,4/5,0,0 ) , you can simply write , omitting all of the 0 entries .
So given a qubit , we can transform it by applying any 2 - by - 2 unitary matrix -- and that leads already to the famous effect of quantum interference .
For example , consider the unitary matrix
which takes a vector in the plane and rotates it by 45 degrees counterclockwise .
Now consider the state |0 〉 .
If we apply U once to this state , we 'll get -- it 's like taking a coin and flipping it .
But then , if we apply the same operation U a second time , we 'll get |1 〉 :
So in other words , applying a " randomizing " operation to a " random " state produces a deterministic outcome !
Intuitively , even though there are two " paths " that lead to the outcome |0〉 , one of those paths has positive amplitude and the other has negative amplitude .
As a result , the two paths interfere destructively and cancel each other out .
By contrast , the two paths leading to the outcome |1 〉 both have positive amplitude , and therefore interfere constructively .
The reason you never see this sort of interference in the classical world is that probabilities can't be negative .
So , cancellation between positive and negative amplitudes can be seen as the source of all " quantum weirdness " -- the one thing that makes quantum mechanics different from classical probability theory .
How I wish someone had told me that when I first heard the word " quantum " !
Mixed States
Once we have these quantum states , one thing we can always do is to take classical probability theory and " layer it on top . "
In other words , we can always ask , what if we do n't know which quantum state we have ?
For example , what if we have a 1 / 2 probability of and a 1 / 2 probability of ?
This gives us what 's called a mixed state , which is the most general kind of state in quantum mechanics .
Mathematically , we represent a mixed state by an object called a density matrix .
Here 's how it works : say you have this vector of N amplitudes , ( α 1 , ...,α N ) .
Then you compute the outer product of the vector with itself -- that is , an N - by - N matrix whose ( i , j ) entry is α i α j ( again in the case of real numbers ) .
Then , if you have a probability distribution over several such vectors , you just take a linear combination of the resulting matrices .
So for example , if you have probability p of some vector and probability 1 - p of a different vector , then it 's p times the one matrix plus 1 - p times the other .
The density matrix encodes all the information that could ever be obtained from some probability distribution over quantum states , by first applying a unitary operation and then measuring .
Exercise 3 for the Non-Lazy Reader : Prove this .
This implies that if two distributions give rise to the same density matrix , then those distributions are empirically indistinguishable , or in other words are the same mixed state .
As an example , let 's say you have the state with 1 / 2 probability , and with 1/2 probability .
Then the density matrix that describes your knowledge is
It follows , then , that no measurement you can ever perform will distinguish this mixture from a 1/2 probability of |0 〉 and a 1/2 probability of | 1 〉 .
The Squaring Rule
Now let 's talk about the question Gus raised , which is , why do we square the amplitudes instead of cubing them or raising them to the fourth power or whatever ?
Devin Smith : Because it gives you the right answer ?
Scott : Yeah , you do want an answer that agrees with experiment .
So let me put the question differently : why did God choose to do it that way and not some other way ?
Ray Laflamme :
Well , given that the numbers can be negative , squaring them just seems like the simplest thing to do !
Scott :
Why not just take the absolute value ?
Alright , I can give you a couple of arguments for why God decided to square the amplitudes .
The first argument is a famous result called Gleason 's Theorem from the 1950's .
Gleason 's
Theorem lets us assume part of quantum mechanics and then get out the rest of it !
More concretely , suppose we have some procedure that takes as input a unit vector of real numbers , and that spits out the probability of an event .
Formally , we have a function f that maps a unit vector to the unit interval [ 0,1 ] .
And let 's suppose N=3 -- the theorem actually works in any number of dimensions three or greater ( but interestingly , not in two dimensions ) .
Then the key requirement we impose is that , whenever three vectors v 1 , v 2 , v 3 are all orthogonal to each other ,
f(v 1 ) + f( v 2 ) + f( v 3 ) = 1 .
Intuitively , if these three vectors represent " orthogonal ways " of measuring a quantum state , then they should correspond to mutually - exclusive events .
Crucially , we do n't need any assumption other than that -- no continuity , no differentiability , no nuthin ' .
So , that 's the setup .
The amazing conclusion of the theorem is that , for any such f , there exists a mixed state such that f arises by measuring that state according to the standard measurement rule of quantum mechanics .
I wo n't be able prove this theorem here , since it 's pretty hard .
But it 's one way that you can " derive " the squaring rule without exactly having to put it in at the outset .
Exercise 4 for the Non-Lazy Reader :
Why does Gleason 's Theorem not work in two dimensions ?
If you like , I can give you a much more elementary argument .
This is something I put it in one of my papers , though I 'm sure many others knew it before .
Let 's say we want to invent a theory that 's not based on the 1 - norm like classical probability theory , or on the 2 - norm like quantum mechanics , but instead on the p-norm for some .
Call ( v 1 , ... , v N ) a unit vector in the p-norm if
|v 1 |p+...+ |v N |p = 1 .
Then we 'll need some " nice " set of linear transformations that map any unit vector in the p-norm to another unit vector in the p-norm .
It 's clear that for any p we choose , there will be some linear transformations that preserve the p-norm .
Which ones ?
Well , we can permute the basis elements , shuffle them around .
That 'll preserve the p-norm .
And we can stick in minus signs if we want .
That 'll preserve the p-norm too .
But here 's the little observation I made : if there are any linear transformations other than these trivial ones that preserve the p-norm , then either p=1 or p=2 .
If p=1 we get classical probability theory , while if p=2 we get quantum mechanics .
Ray Laflamme :
So if you do n't want something boring ...
Scott : Exactly !
Then you have to set p=1 or p=2 .
Exercise 5 for the Non-Lazy Reader : Prove my little observation .
Alright , to get you started , let me give some intuition about why my observation might be true .
Let 's assume , for simplicity , that everything is real and that p is a positive even integer ( though the observation also works with complex numbers and with any real p≥0 ) .
Then for a linear transformation A= ( a ij ) to preserve the p-norm means that
whenever
Now we can ask : how many constraints are imposed on the matrix A by the requirement that this be true for every v 1 , ... , v N ?
If we work it out , in the case p=2 we 'll find that there are constraints .
But since we 're trying to pick an N - by - N matrix , that still leaves us N ( N - 1 ) / 2 degrees of freedom to play with .
On the other hand , if ( say ) p=4 , then the number of constraints grows like , which is greater than N2 ( the number of variables in the matrix ) .
That suggests that it will be hard to find a nontrivial linear transformation that preserves 4 - norm .
Of course it does n't prove that no such transformation exists -- that 's left as a puzzle for you .
Incidentally , this is n't the only case where we find that the 1 - norm and 2 - norm are " more special " than other p-norms .
So for example , have you ever seen the following equation ?
xn + yn = zn
There 's a cute little fact -- unfortunately I wo n't have time to prove it in class -- that the above equation has nontrivial integer solutions when n=1 or n=2 , but not for any larger integers n.
Clearly , then , if we use the 1 - norm and the 2 - norm more than other vector norms , it 's not some arbitrary whim -- these really are God 's favorite norms !
( And we did n't even need an experiment to tell us that . )
Real vs. Complex Numbers
Even after we 've decided to base our theory on the 2 - norm , we still have at least two choices : we could let our amplitudes be real numbers , or we could let them be complex numbers .
We know the solution God chose : amplitudes in quantum mechanics are complex numbers .
This means that you can't just square an amplitude to get a probability ; first you have to take the absolute value , and then you square that .
In other words , if the amplitude for some measurement outcome is α = β + γi , where β and γ are real , then the probability of seeing the outcome is |α|2 = β 2 + γ 2 .
Why did God go with the complex numbers and not the real numbers ?
Years ago , at Berkeley , I was hanging out with some math grad students -- I fell in with the wrong crowd -- and I asked them that exact question .
The mathematicians just snickered .
" Give us a break -- the complex numbers are algebraically closed ! "
To them it was n't a mystery at all .
But to me it is sort of strange .
I mean , complex numbers were seen for centuries as fictitious entities that human beings made up , in order that every quadratic equation should have a root .
( That 's why we talk about their " imaginary " parts . )
So why should Nature , at its most fundamental level , run on something that we invented for our convenience ?
Answer :
Well , if you want every unitary operation to have a square root , then you have to go to the complex numbers ...
Scott : Dammit , you 're getting ahead of me !
Alright , yeah : suppose we require that , for every linear transformation U that we can apply to a state , there must be another transformation V such that V2 = U .
This is basically a continuity assumption : we 're saying that , if it makes sense to apply an operation for one second , then it ought to make sense to apply that same operation for only half a second .
Can we get that with only real amplitudes ?
Well , consider the following linear transformation :
This transformation is just a mirror reversal of the plane .
That is , it takes a two - dimensional Flatland creature and flips it over like a pancake , sending its heart to the other side of its two - dimensional body .
But how do you apply half of a mirror reversal without leaving the plane ?
You can 't !
If you want to flip a pancake by a continuous motion , then you need to go into ... dum dum dum ...
THE THIRD DIMENSION .
More generally , if you want to flip over an N - dimensional object by a continuous motion , then you need to go into the ( N+1 ) st dimension .
Exercise 6 for the Non-Lazy : Prove that any norm - preserving linear transformation in N dimensions can be implemented by a continuous motion in N+1 dimensions .
But what if you want every linear transformation to have a square root in the same number of dimensions ?
Well , in that case , you have to allow complex numbers .
So that 's one reason God might have made the choice She did .
Alright , I can give you two other reasons why amplitudes should be complex numbers .
The first comes from asking , how many independent real parameters are there in an N - dimensional mixed state ?
As it turns out , the answer is exactly N2 -- provided we assume , for convenience , that the state does n't have to be normalized ( i.e. , that the probabilities can add up to less than 1 ) .
Why ?
Well , an N - dimensional mixed state is represented mathematically by a N - by - N Hermitian matrix with positive eigenvalues .
Since we 're not normalizing , we 've got N independent real numbers along the main diagonal .
Below the main diagonal , we 've got N ( N - 1 ) / 2 independent complex numbers , which means N ( N - 1 ) real numbers .
Since the matrix is Hermitian , the complex numbers below the main diagonal determine the ones above the main diagonal .
So the total number of independent real parameters is N + N( N - 1 ) = N2 .
Now we bring in an aspect of quantum mechanics that I did n't mention before .
If we know the states of two quantum systems individually , then how do we write their combined state ?
Well , we just form what 's called the tensor product .
So for example , the tensor product of two qubits , α|0 〉 + β |1 〉 and γ |0 〉 +δ |1〉 , is given by
Again one can ask : did God have to use the tensor product ?
Could
She have chosen some other way of combining quantum states into bigger ones ?
Well , maybe someone else can say something useful about this question -- I have trouble even wrapping my head around it !
For me , saying we take the tensor product is almost what we mean when we say we 're putting together two systems that exist independently of each other .
As you all know , there are two - qubit states that can't be written as the tensor product of one - qubit states .
The most famous of these is the EPR ( Einstein - Podolsky - Rosen ) pair :
Given a mixed state ρ on two subsystems A and B , if ρ can be written as a probability distribution over tensor product states , then we say ρ is separable .
Otherwise we say ρ is entangled .
Now let 's come back to the question of how many real parameters are needed to describe a mixed state .
Suppose we have a ( possibly - entangled ) composite system AB .
Then intuitively , it seems like the number of parameters needed to describe AB -- which I 'll call d AB -- should equal the product of the number of parameters needed to describe A and the number of parameters needed to describe B :
d AB = d A d B .
If amplitudes are complex numbers , then happily this is true !
Letting N A and N B be the number of dimensions of A and B respectively , we have
d AB = ( N A N B ) 2 = N A 2 N B 2 = d A d B .
But what if the amplitudes are real numbers ?
In that case , in an N - by - N density matrix , we 'd only have N( N+1 ) / 2 independent real parameters .
And it 's not the case that if N = N A N B then
Question : Can this same argument be used to rule out quaternions ?
Scott : Excellent question .
Yes !
With real numbers the left - hand side is too big , whereas with quaternions it 's too small .
Only with complex numbers is it juuuuust right !
There 's actually another phenomenon with the same " Goldilocks " flavor , which was observed by Bill Wootters -- and this leads to my third reason why amplitudes should be complex numbers .
Let 's say we choose a quantum state
uniformly at random ( if you 're a mathematician , under the Haar measure ) .
And then we measure it , obtaining outcome |i〉 with probability |α i |2 .
The question is , will the resulting probability vector also be distributed uniformly at random in the probability simplex ?
It turns out that if the amplitudes are complex numbers , then the answer is yes .
But if the amplitudes are real numbers or quaternions , then the answer is no !
( I used to think this fact was just a curiosity , but now I 'm actually using it in a paper I 'm working on ... )
Linearity
We 've talked about why the amplitudes should be complex numbers , and why the rule for converting amplitudes to probabilities should be a squaring rule .
But all this time , the elephant of linearity has been sitting there undisturbed .
Why would God have decided , in the first place , that quantum states should evolve to other quantum states by means of linear transformations ?
Answer : Because if the transformations were n't linear , you could crunch vectors to be bigger or smaller ...
Scott : Close !
Steven Weinberg and others proposed nonlinear variants of quantum mechanics in which the state vectors do stay the same size .
The trouble with these variants is that they'd let you take far - apart vectors and squash them together , or take extremely close vectors and pry them apart !
Indeed , that 's essentially what it means for such theories to be nonlinear .
So our configuration space no longer has this intuitive meaning of measuring the distinguishability of vectors .
Two states that are exponentially close might in fact be perfectly distinguishable .
And indeed , in 1998 Abrams and Lloyd used exactly this observation to show that , if quantum mechanics were nonlinear , then one could build a computer to solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time .
Question :
What 's the problem with that ?
Scott :
What 's the problem with being able to solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time ?
Oy , if by the end of this class you still do n't think that 's a problem , I will have failed you ... [ laughter ]
Seriously , of course we do n't know whether NP - complete problems are efficiently solvable in the physical world .
But in a survey I wrote a couple years ago , I explained why the ability to solve NP - complete problems would give us " godlike " powers -- arguably , even more so than the ability to transmit superluminal signals or reverse the Second Law of Thermodynamics .
The basic point is that , when we talk about NP - complete problems , we 're not just talking about scheduling airline flights ( or for that matter , breaking the RSA cryptosystem ) .
We 're talking about automating insight : proving the Riemann Hypothesis , modeling the stock market , seeing whatever patterns or chains of logical deduction are there in the world to be seen .
So , suppose I maintain the working hypothesis that NP - complete problems are not efficiently solvable by physical means , and that if a theory suggests otherwise , more likely than not that indicates a problem with the theory .
Then there are only two possibilities : either I 'm right , or else I 'm a god !
And either one sounds pretty good to me ...
Exercise 7 for the Non-Lazy Reader : Prove that if quantum mechanics were nonlinear , then not only could you solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time , you could also use EPR pairs to transmit information faster than the speed of light .
Question :
But if I were crafting a universe in my garage , I could choose to make the speed of light equal to infinity .
Scott : Yeah , you 've touched on another one of my favorite questions : why should the speed of light be finite ?
Well , one reason I 'd like it to be finite is that , if aliens from the Andromeda galaxy are going to hurt me , then I at least want them to have to come here first !

SIX years after it was “ officially ” sequenced , the human genome continues to throw up surprises .
The latest , reported in the scientific journal Nature by a large , multinational team of geneticists , is that individual human genomes are more varied than had previously been realised .
The original genome projects ( there were two ; one publicly funded and one private ) , worked with DNA from a small number of individuals in order to provide an agreed sequence that could act as a platform for further research .
It was , therefore , never quite “ the ” human genome .
Since then , one task for researchers has been to see how much variation there is from person to person .
To find out how much things vary between people , they had previously focused on places in the string of molecular “ letters ” of which DNA is made where one letter is replaced by another in a significant fraction of the population .
( These are known as single - nucleotide polymorphisms . )
But it has been known for a long time that there is another sort of variation around .
During the process by which DNA is copied , entire blocks of DNA can be accidentally deleted or multiplied .
( Following such multiplied and deleted regions between the generations was an important genetic technique before the invention of cheap and rapid gene - sequencing technology . )
What the team has shown in the latest report is that duplication and deletion are much more widespread than was previously realised .
Also , the duplication and deletion often involve active genes as well as the so - called non-coding part of the DNA , which is not translated into the protein molecules that keep cells running .
Does all that matter ?
The absence of a gene has obvious implications .
Unless it is covered up by the presence of that gene on a sister chromosome ( for chromosomes come in pairs ; one from the mother and one from the father ) , trouble is likely to ensue .
Multiple copies of a gene may bring more subtle problems .
Genes pass their orders to the rest of the cell via messenger molecules copied from their DNA .
Too many copies of a gene might mean too many messengers and thus too much protein .
That might , in turn , cause disease .
DNA duplication of the sort previously known about can cause illness .
A number of brain diseases , most famously Huntington 's chorea , are caused by a genetic “ stutter ” in which three genetic letters get repeated more often than they should be .
One curious feature of such “ triplet - repeat expansions ” is that once established , they tend to get worse down the generations .
For reasons not yet understood , the number of repeats grows each time new sex cells are generated .
Certain diseases are similarly associated with multiple genes .
It has been known for decades that one group of blood diseases is linked to unusual numbers of copies of one of the genes involved in making haemoglobin , although there is no suggestion that these diseases , too , get worse down the generations .
However , the team has discovered several hundred genes whose copy number varies , and they suspect there may be more to come .
If copy numbers do shift between the generations , perhaps because the genes in question are in places that the DNA - copying machinery finds difficult to handle , that could explain some odd disease patterns that seem to run in families , but do not obey the normal laws of genetic inheritance .
This is speculation , of course .
But it gives medical geneticists a new lead .
And generating new leads was the whole point of the human genome projects in the first place .

Electron Waves Unveil the Microcosmos
You can use a microscope to see the cell structure of a leaf .
Optical microscopes employ waves of visible light .
To see smaller objects such as viruses and irregularities in the atomic arrangement of crystals , however , you have to use electron waves .
Why ?
Because wavelengths of visible light are too large to probe such small sizes .
Are electrons waves ?
Yes , they can behave like waves , which are trains of crests and troughs just like the ripples on the surface of water .
Using the electron microscope , we can see the crest height and the trough depth of the electron waves after they are disturbed from passing by the objects being examined .
However , there are some objects that do not affect the height or depth of the waves , but pull back ( or push forward ) the crests and troughs .
This can be observed by superposing two waves , one pulled back and the other unaffected , and letting them interfere .
The electron waves will interfere constructively if the crests overlap , and destructively if the crests meet the troughs .
This is the principle of holography , which the lecturer explains in detail during the discourse .
Then , you will be able to understand the fascinating sceneries in the microcosmos that electron holography has unveiled , such as the quantised bundles of magnetic lines of force in a superconductor , and how they dance and hop !

How to Make Teaching Come Alive
The Council on Primary and Secondary Education 2002 summer program hosted 70 pre-college teachers at MIT to attend MIT Physics Professor Walter Lewin 's inspired talk about physics .
The teachers came from 15 US states and seven countries including Argentina , Austria , Hong Kong , Israel , Lebanon , Norway , and West Indies .
This lecture has been described as one that can make you " see " a rainbow in ways you have never seen it before , and provides answers to questions like " why is the sky blue " ?.
During the live lecture , many of the colors discussed were visible as described .
However since this lecture was video taped and then compressed in order to create video streams , many of the colors did not survive the compression process .
In the lecture hall , viewers did indeed see all of the colors of the rainbow , however once the video is streamed , you will see mostly red and blue .
At 14:02 , during the rotating disc demonstration , the black and white lines appear brown on the inside and dark blue on the outside , and when reversed , appear dark blue on the inside and brown on the outside .
Professor Lewin is introduced by Professor Ron Latanision , Chairman of the Council on Primary and Secondary Education , and Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and Professor of Nuclear Engineering at MIT .
Polarization : Light Waves , Rainbows , and Cheap Sunglasses
In this lecture taped before a live audience of elementary and middle school students and their families , MIT Physics Professor Walter Lewin explains polarization , and demonstrates properties of light in rainbows , smoke and the sky .
He answers the perennial question , " why is the sky blue ? " and creates a red sunset in the laboratory .

The Birth and Death of Stars
We know that some stars exist because we can see them with our own eyes .
In this lecture Walter Lewin provides illuminating evidence of stars we cannot see .
He describes the birth of stars , in the arms of a nebula , to their explosive or implosive ends .
There are super hot white dwarves , detectible only by measuring the shift in color as light leaves them .
As some massive stars age , they collapse into incredibly dense neutron stars — 1000 times smaller than white dwarves — that release more x-rays than light .
One teaspoon of neutron star matter would weight 500 million tons .
Lewin champions Jocelyn Bell , who discovered evidence for these stars in 1967 but was overlooked for the Nobel Prize .
When Bell ’s radio telescope picked up mysterious signals pulsing every 1.3 seconds , her lab described the phenomenon as “ little green men , ” at first unsure if these might be signs of intelligent alien life .
In his ringing finale , Lewin pulls out a tuning fork to demonstrate the Doppler Effect , where the pitch of a sound changes as it moves .
Astronomers measured an analogous Doppler shift in star light to prove the existence of black holes .
The Sounds of Music
Have you ever wondered about the annoying hum your car makes at a certain speed on a particular stretch of highway ?
Or why a flute ’s notes are higher than a trombone ’s ?
Walter Lewin uses rubber hose , wooden boxes with holes , metal plates and an assortment of other home - made instruments to demonstrate how objects produce sound .
It all boils down to how something vibrates -- pushing air out in all directions .
Lewin illustrates the shape of sounds , taking a rope tethered at one end , shaking it up and down at different speeds and producing specific wave shapes .
These shapes are the rope ’s resonant frequencies , or harmonics .
It ’s the same for a bowed violin , where the oscillations of the strings generate a set of harmonics , producing the notes we hear -- the faster the oscillations , the higher the tones .
Lewin invites children from the audience to produce sounds with their musical instruments , and shows the amplitude and frequency of the tones .
Later he demonstrates destructive resonances : video of a bridge that twists so violently that it collapses , and then , live in the laboratory , the shattering of a wine glass with progressively louder and higher tones .
In this event where physics meets performance art , Lewin provides surprises throughout .

Being a relative newcomer to unix , forking , threading , and parallelization versus serialization has been kind of a murky black art to me .
Only recently have I felt like I have begun to get a handle on things .
Anyway , I wrote a script to demonstrate the difference between running a series of five simple two - second commands " serially " ( one after the other ) versus running them in parallel .
Serially , it takes ten seconds .
Parallelly , it takes two .
So obviously , this forking stuff is something that can save time if mastered :)
To understand this script , it 's important to know that in bash , you can fork a process by using the & character .
There may be other ways to fork a process , but that 's the way I use .
Also , processes in ( ) run in their own process space .

Drug resistance has rendered the cheapest and most widely - used anti malarial drugs useless in many parts of Africa , hence the need for more research into more effective malaria control tools .
The Gates Foundation donation will support three projects over five years ( as follows ) :
$ 107.6 m to the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative ( MVI ) to work with GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals and African investigators to complete testing and development of an anti-malaria vaccine candidate
$ 100 m to the Medicines for Malaria Venture ( MMV ) to work on anti-malaria drug research
$ 50.7 m to the Innovative Vector Control Consortium ( IVCC ) , led by the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine , to fast - track development of improved insecticides and other mosquito control methods
Each recipient of the Gates Foundation 's grant has developed a plan to make its anti-malaria tools accessible and affordable for developing countries .
The Gates Foundation 's cash pledges follows a new study by the Malaria R&D Alliance , an international coalition of malaria research groups , will reports that global funding for malaria R&D last year amounted to an inadequate $ 323 m – less than 0.3 per cent of total health research spending worldwide .
" For far too long , malaria has been a forgotten epidemic .
It ’s a disgrace that the world has allowed malaria deaths to double in the last 20 years , when so much more could be done to stop the disease , " the Microsoft founder said . ®
Memories of our life stories may be reinforced while we sleep , MIT researchers report Dec. 17 in the advance online edition of Nature Neuroscience .
Matthew A. Wilson , professor of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT 's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory , and postdoctoral associate Daoyun Ji looked at what happens in rats ' brains when they dream about the mazes they ran while they were awake .
In a landmark 2001 study , Wilson showed that rats formed complex memories for sequences of events experienced while they were awake , and that these memories were replayed while they slept -- perhaps reflecting the animal equivalent of dreaming .
Because these replayed memories were detected in the hippocampus , the memory center of the brain , the researchers were not able to determine whether they were accompanied by the type of sensory experience that we associate with dreams -- in particular , the presence of visual imagery .
In the latest experiment , by recording brain activity simultaneously in the hippocampus and the visual cortex , Wilson and Ji demonstrated that replayed memories did , in fact , contain the visual images that were present during the running experience .
" This work brings us closer to an understanding of the nature of animal dreams and gives us important clues as to the role of sleep in processing memories of our past experiences , " Wilson said .
Reinforcing memories
By recording the spiking patterns of electrodes in individual neurons in the rats ' brains , Wilson is able to compare the activity of the neurons when the animal is awake and asleep .
It turns out that neurons activated when the animal experiences an event while awake are reactivated during sleep .
In addition , the region of the cortex that processes input from the senses and the hippocampus " talk " to each other during sleep , leading researchers to speculate that this process reinforces and consolidates memories .
But research to date lacked specific evidence that episodic memory -- times , places and emotions related to events that make up our life stories -- is reinforced in the cortex , the hippocampus or both during sleep .
For the first time , this work shows that the brain is replaying memory events in two locations at once -- in the visual cortex and in the hippocampus .
" These results imply simultaneous reactivation of coherent memory traces in the cortex and hippocampus during sleep that may contribute to or reflect the result of the memory consolidation process , " Wilson and Ji wrote .

There 's no doubt that laughter feels good , but is there real neurophysiology behind it and what can you do about it ?
In a paper being presented in an American Physiological Society session at Experimental Biology 2006 , Lee S. Berk of Loma Linda University , reports that not only is there real science and psychophysiology , but just the anticipation of the " mirthful laughter " involved in watching your favorite funny movie has some very surprising and significant neuroendocrine / hormone effects .
According to Berk : " The blood drawn from experimental subjects just before they watched the video had 27 % more beta - endorphins and 87 % more human growth hormone , compared to blood from the control group , which did n't anticipate the watching of a humorous video .
Between blood pulls , the control group stayed in a waiting room and could choose from a wide variety of magazines , " he explained .
* Paper presentation : " Beta - Endorphin and HGH increase are associated with both the anticipation and experience of mirthful laughter , " 12:30 p.m.- 3 p.m. Sunday April 2 , APS Behavioral neuroscience & drug abuse Section abstract 233.18 / board # C706 .
Research was by Lee S. Berk , Department of Health Promotion and Education , School of Public Health and Department of Pathology , School of Medicine , Loma Linda University ; Stanley A. Tan , Oakcrest Health Research Institute , Yucaipa ; and James Westengard , Dept. of Pathology , School of Medicine ; Berk is associated with all three institutions .
HGH , endorphin difference is long - lasting ; setting the baseline and environment is key
Berk said that the strong difference between the two groups in terms of human growth hormone ( HGH ) and beta - endorphin blood levels was maintained from just prior to the beginning of video watching , throughout the hour of viewing and afterwards , also .
" We believe the results suggest that the anticipation of a humor / laughter eustress ( positive stress ) event initiates changes in neuroendocrine response prior to the onset of the event itself , " Berk said .
" From our prior studies , this modulation appears to be concomitant with mood state changes , and taken together , these would appear to carry important , positive implications for wellness , disease - prevention and most certainly stress - reduction , " he noted .
In the current experiment , Berk and his colleagues studied 16 healthy and fasting males , who had n't exercised for at least a day and were not taking supplement medications .
The test subjects had chosen a favorite video .
Three days before the experiment , all the subjects were told which group they were randomly selected to be in , experimental ( video watching ) or control ( no video watching ) .
All subjects had blood drawn just before the video watching experiment began ( baseline ) , four times during the hour - long experiment , and three times afterward .
" One of the keys in this kind of experiment is to set the baseline and control environment carefully , " Berk said .
" In this case , the control group basically sits in a ' neutral ' room waiting to have their blood drawn , and on the tables there is a wide variety of magazines that they can browse , because you do n't want to bias what they do or watch .
Time and behavior have proved me right with this approach , " he added .
Earlier experiments showed stress reduction
Berk said the results of this " anticipatory mirthful laughter experience , which is a kind of eustress or ' positive / good stress ' event , builds on our earlier work and may constitute a real construct for what is the ' biology of hope . ' "
Earlier experiments showed that viewing a favorite funny video can offset symptoms of chronic stress , which can suppress various components of the immune responses , particularly those related to anti-viral and anti-tumor defenses .
In addition , there appears to be a rebalancing of the Th1 / Th2 immune response which suggestively could lead to reduction of autoimmune issues .
" Mirthful laughter diminishes the secretion of cortisol and epinephrine , while enhancing immune reactivity .
In addition , mirthful laughter boosts secretion of growth hormone , an enhancer of these same key immune responses .
The physiological effects of a single one - hour session viewing a humorous video has appeared to last up to 12 to 24 hours in some individuals , " Berk noted , " while other studies of daily 30 - minute exposure produces profound and long - lasting changes in these measures .
Next steps to seek physiological linkage mechanisms
In addition , Berk noted : " An area we will pursue is the modulation and change in Th1 and Th2 cytokine and inflammatory immune responses to the anticipation and experience of the positive mood state changes associated with mirthful laughter . "
Future research in this area with more subjects " needs to elaborate these findings in psychoneuroimmunology understanding and the mechanism linkage modulation between anticipatory positive behaviors and neuroendocrine and immune responses , " Berk said .
" It may sound corny but we in the health care medical sciences need to ' get serious about happiness ' and the lifestyle that produces it , relative to mind , body and spirit and its biotranslation , " he added .
" Why do you think Reader 's Digest has claimed that ' Laughter is the Best Medicine ' for so many years ? "
Berk concludes .

A photo story for your entertainment .
On a training day this week , The Ranger and his colleagues discovered a small hole in the ground near a little - used public footpath ; on investigation the hole led to an intriguing tunnel .
A hole in the ground … but what ’s inside ?
Imagining himself too sensible or , perhaps more honestly , acknowledging himself a little more portly than his companions , The Ranger declined to go down – but when they returned with tales of massive spiders , his interest was kindled .
On examining the photos they brought back he was delighted to identify Meta menardi , the cave spider , a fairly common but hardly - ever recorded spider which lives almost exclusively in complete darkness , and so is rarely seen and often thought of as very rare .
So , the next day , armed with camera and slightly more appropriate gear , he arrived on site and prepared to enter the grotto .
Preparing to descend
The first thing that he noticed was a tiny rocky tunnel with water in it , and a nice plastic bag floating there , too .
The second thing was the smell – that place stank .
The Ranger was glad he ’d shed all his jumpers and fleeces , and was wearing his slippery Barbour oilcloth coat , as he then had crouch , walking bent - kneed in Groucho Marx - style , to squeeze down the tiny , slimy tunnel , splashing through the stagnant water .
You ’ll probably have spotted that he also swapped his normal hat for a more expendable one !
Manipulating both the torch and the camera was a challenge , but whilst doing that he spotted a tell - tale sign of Meta menardi – the characteristic egg sac suspended from the ceiling , on a stalk about 20 mm long :
Stunning !
After dropping one torch into the filth and having to retrieve it with his bare hands ,
The Ranger finally came face to face with his quarry – the slow - moving gentle giant of the UK spider world ; with a body about 15 mm long , and a awesome leg span of about 60 mm ( more than two inches ) .
Meta menardi ( c ) Karl Dyson
On further inspection , there were probably a dozen mature specimens , and probably some immature ones .
The Ranger gazed at these cave - dwellers in wonder .
What a treat !
Eventually , the stench and crouching became too much , and the spell was broken .
The Ranger had to reverse clumsily away from his new spider friends and re-enter the real world .
He was delighted with the success of his mission .
But there was one task remaining !
That smells !
The spiders probably do n’t get many visitors , but some passer - by had let a plastic bag fall into their cave , and The Ranger brought it out as mitigation for having disturbed the silent darkness .
He emptied the filthy water from the bag , and found it to be one of the rankest - smelling objects he ’d ever encountered .
It did n’t help that he was covered in the slime himself , either .
Far from the nearest bin , he had to carry the reeking bag at arm ’s length back to the car park , shunned by his companions .
At last he was able to pay his debt to the spiders , and put the bag in a bin ; then the party could retire to the pub to sip restorative shandy and boast about the size of ‘ the ones that got away ’ …

It 's no joke : IU study finds The Daily Show with Jon Stewart to be as substantive as network news
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Oct. 4 , 2006
BLOOMINGTON , Ind. --
Which would you think has more substantive news coverage -- traditional broadcast network newscasts or The Daily Show with Jon Stewart ?
Would you believe the answer is neither ?
Julia R. Fox , assistant professor of telecommunications at Indiana University is n't joking when she says the popular " fake news " program , which last week featured Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf as a guest , is just as substantive as network coverage .
While much has been written in the media about The Daily Show 's impact , Fox 's study is the first scholarly effort to systematically examine how the comedy program compares to traditional television news as sources of political information .
The study , " No Joke : A Comparison of Substance in The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and Broadcast Network Television Coverage of the 2004 Presidential Election Campaign , " will be published next summer by the Journal of Broadcast and Electronic Media , published by the Broadcast Education Association .
" It is clearly a humor show , first and foremost , " Fox said of Stewart 's program .
" But there is some substance on there , and in some cases , like John Edwards announcing his candidacy , the news is made on the show .
You have real newsmakers coming on , and yes , sometimes the banter and questions get a little silly , but there is also substantive dialogue going on …
It 's a legitimate source of news . "
Most people have little direct contact with politicians and get most of their political information from the media .
Given the growing number of young voters who say they look to The Daily Show to meet their political information needs ,
Fox thought it was important to see whether the program did so .
She and two graduate students at IU -- Glory Koloen and Volkan Sahin -- analyzed coverage of the 2004 national political conventions and the first presidential debate by the networks and Stewart 's program .
They examined broadcast nightly newscasts on July 26 - 30 , Aug. 30 - 31 and Sept. 1 - 3 in 2004 .
Similarly , they studied episodes of The Daily Show on July 27 - 30 , Aug. 31 and Sept. 1 - 3 in 2004 .
" Conventions typically offer candidates a chance to present their views on what they consider to be the important issues facing the nation and are critically important for shoring up political bases and reaching out to independent voters , " Fox said in explaining her reasoning .
" While debates tend to reinforce pre-existing candidate preferences , they are particularly important for activating supporters and can sway undecided voters . "
Not surprisingly , a second - by - second analysis of The Daily Show 's audio and visual content found considerably more humor than substance -- Stewart himself has insisted that he is a comedian and not a journalist .
A similar analysis of network coverage found considerably more hype than substance in broadcast newscasts .
Examples of such hype included references to polls , political endorsements and photo opportunities .
" Interestingly , the average amounts of video and audio substance in the broadcast network news stories were not significantly different than the average amounts of visual and audio substance in The Daily Show with Jon Stewart stories about the presidential election , " she wrote in the paper .
" It should be noted that the broadcast network news stories about the presidential election were significantly shorter , on average , than were The Daily Show with Jon Stewart stories , " she added .
" The argument could be made that while the amount of substance per story was not significantly different , the proportion of each story devoted to substance was greater in the network news stories ...
On the other hand , the proportion of stories per half hour program devoted to the election campaign was greater in The Daily Show . "
The analysis was run again using the half - hour program , rather than the story , as the unit of analysis , and Fox still found no significant differences in substance .
The study does not address differences in the ways viewers of both programs process and remember political information or the differences in tone between them .
" We 've been wringing our hands for decades that the networks are n't doing enough substance in the political coverage , so is it any real surprise that it 's just as substantive ? , " Fox said of The Daily Show .
" Our findings should allay at least some of the concerns about the growing reliance on this non-traditional source of political information , as it is just as substantive as the source that Americans have relied upon for decades .
" In an absolute sense , we should probably be concerned about both of those sources , because neither one is particularly substantive .
It 's a bottom - line industry and ratings - driven .
We live in an ' infotainment ' society , and there certainly are a number of other sources available . "

A story first posted on ArabNews.com has been making the rounds on the Internet , involving an Indian student who has allegedly found a method of storing compressed digital information on a regular sheet of paper .
Sainul Abideen claims that his technique , dubbed Rainbow Technology , can store between 90 and 450 GB on a single sheet of paper .
The system allegedly works by encoding data into small geometrical shapes ( circles , squares , and triangles ) in various colors , then printing them out on a piece of paper .
A scanner is used to read the data back in to the computer .
Abideen claims that his storage method is more environmentally friendly due to the biodegradable nature of paper , and envisions magazine publishers printing tear - out sheets of paper containing demos and programs , replacing the traditional plastic - wrapped CD or DVD .
Storing digital information on paper dates back to the earliest days of computing .
When I was a little kid , my dad used to bring home punched cards from his job programming a mainframe computer at Vancouver General Hospital .
The cards had 80 columns — an artifact that remains with us today as the default width for console - mode applications — and could only store a maximum of 120 bytes ( about one - eighth of a kilobyte ) per card .
Abideen demonstrates paper storage
However , despite technological advances in scanning and printing technology since those days , Abideen 's claims quite simply do not hold water .
A little bit of math is in order here .
Starting with a scanner with a maximum resolution of 1,200 dots per inch , this leads to a maximum of 1,440,000 dots per square inch , or just over 134 million dots on a sheet of standard 8.5 " by 11 " paper ( excluding margins ) .
Getting a scanner to accurately pick up the color of a single dot on a page is a difficult affair ( it would take near - perfect color calibration , for example , and be prone to errors from ambient light and imperfections in the paper ) but let 's be generous and say that the scanner can accurately pick out 256 shades of color for each dot .
That 's a single byte per dot , making the final calculation easy : a maximum theoretical storage of 134MB , which would likely go down to under 100 MB after error correction .
It 's a decent amount of storage , but several orders of magnitude smaller than the 450 GB claimed by Abideen .
The claim that " circles , triangles , and squares " can achieve these extra orders of magnitude can be easily challenged .
There is a word for using mathematical algorithms to increase the storage space of digital information : it 's called compression .
No amount of circles and triangles could be better than existing compression algorithms : if it was , those formulas would already be in use !
Compression could easily increase the 100MB theoretical paper storage by a factor of two or three , but so could simply compressing the files you wished to store into a .zip archive before converting them to a color printout .
Ultimately , storage is about bits , and the smaller the bits are physically , the more storage can be packed into a given space .
The magnetic bits on hard drive platters and the tiny pits in optical media are orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest dot that can be recognized by any optical scanner , and this is the simple reason why they store orders of magnitude more information .
Even if a much higher - density printer were used ( such as an expensive laser printer or offset printing process ) the limiting factor is still the scanner required to get the information back into the computer .
In the end , a picture may be worth a thousand words , but it can not be worth half a thousand megabytes .
jsMath : A Method of Including Mathematics in Web Pages
The jsMath package provides a method of including mathematics in HTML pages that works across multiple browsers under Windows , Macintosh OS X , Linux and other flavors of unix .
It overcomes a number of the shortcomings of the traditional method of using images to represent mathematics : jsMath uses native fonts , so they resize when you change the size of the text in your browser , they print at the full resolution of your printer , and you do n't have to wait for dozens of images to be downloaded in order to see the mathematics in a web page .
There are also advantages for web - page authors , as there is no need to preprocess your web pages to generate any images , and the mathematics is entered in TeX form , so it is easy to create and maintain your web pages .
Although it works best with the TeX fonts installed , jsMath will fall back on a collection of image - based fonts ( which can still be scaled or printed at high resolution ) or unicode fonts when the TeX fonts are not available .
There is a control panel connected to a small floating button that lets the user select which fallback method to use or change some other settings like a scaling factor to use for the mathematics compared to the other text on the page .
The jsMath package is based on the TeX mathematics layout engine as described in Appendix G of Donald Knuth 's The TeXbook .
Since jsMath uses the TeX fonts , it also has the font metric information from the associated .tfm files at its disposal , so it handles italic correction and kerning in essentially the same way as TeX .
This makes the output of jsMath as nearly identical to that of TeX as I could manage .
JsMath does not use MathML , but this is not intended to indicate that MathML is not a good or useful thing , because it is , and I know that .
But MathML is not designed to be written directly by human beings , and I wanted a format that I could easily write by hand and include in quick , non-archival web pages like homework assignments , while not having to require students to use a particular browser or download extra software to be able to view it .
At the time I wrote jsMath , only Mozilla on the PC implemented MathML directly , and MSIE on the PC could do it with a plugin , but there was n't a Mac - based browser that handled MathML adequately ( it looks like Mozilla 1.5 might finally have it working ) , and I 'm not sure what the situation is for unix .
I wanted a solution that worked out - of - the - box with a wider range of browsers , and on the Mac in particular since that is what I use .
Thus jsMath was born .
I could not tell if the look on the woman 's face was disdain or pity .
But either way she did not understand that I wanted to rent a small car , not a big one .
' Are you sure you do n't want an upgrade , honey ? ' she said , eyeing me suspiciously ' The car you 've booked is really small . '
She offered a bigger car at the same price , perhaps thinking I was angling for a deal .
No , I told her , I genuinely do n't like driving big cars .
I can't see the point and they are hell to park .
Give me something small and boxy , please .
In the end she let me have my way but I think she was genuinely offended .
That was in Texas .
But it 's happened at rental car counters all over America .
The concept that you actually prefer a little car to a tank - like SUV seems difficult to grasp .
Invariably I get offered a bigger vehicle for the same price .
When I turn down the deal I am usually spoken to in a tone of voice that suggests I must be an escaped village idiot .
Or very poor .
It is just one example of Americans ' fanatic relationship with their cars .
As political observations go that is hardly astute or original .
A bit like a visitor to England making the wide - eyed discovery that the natives ' have a remarkable fondness for tea .
But what is less well known is that America 's obsession with the car , which goes so deep it is reflected in virtually every facet of socio- economic life , did not happen by accident .
Much of it was by deliberate design .
Or to put it another way : it did not have to be like this .
In between the wars many American cities had fully functioning electric tram systems that shuttled millions of citizens from their homes to their jobs without the need for a private car .
American cities were more compact , more walkable and had vibrant downtowns that were the centre of urban life .
Even in southern California , which is now seen as the ultimate creation of the automobile , railways and trams were a huge part of life .
Los Angeles was served by the largest mass transit system in the nation , including 1,000 trains a day running on the Pacific Electric Railway 's 760 miles of track .
But take a drive - and it will have to be a drive - through most major US cities today ( and particularly LA ) and you see a different world .
Downtowns lie abandoned to office blocks , gridlock rules on city freeways that have destroyed old urban neighbourhoods and suburbia sprawls out across miles upon mile of territory that only a generation or two ago was rural farmland .
The figures tell the story best .
Americans make one billion trips a day and just 1.9 percent of them are by mass transit .
There are 220 m cars in a country of 290 m people .
The average US family makes 10 car trips every day .
But this did not just happen .
Big business and government helped plan it this way .
Many of those electric tram lines ended up being bought by car firms , notably General Motors .
Between 1936 and 1950 a holding company backed by GM , Firestone and Standard Oil bought 100 tram firms in 45 American cities .
They were dismantled and replaced by GM buses : more inefficient , more likely to lead to congestion and , in the end , more profitable to GM .
Many bus lines then failed , leaving consumers with no choice but to buy cars .
But it was not just ' conspiracy ' by the big car firms .
Urban planners of the 1940s and 1950s seemed possessed with a manic zeal to push the car at the expense of public transit .
Their vision was a sprawling suburbia linked by huge , broad expressways .
One of the most influential was Robert Moses , who is responsible for much of modern New York 's sprawl .
Though never elected to office he was probably the most powerful man in New York from the 1930s to the 1950s .
He once declared ' Cities are for traffic ' and planned to build a huge freeway through downtown Manhattan that would have levelled much of SoHo and Greenwich Village .
Just think of that .
Some of the most culturally and financially valuable real estate in the world was scheduled for destruction just so car owners could get across Manhattan more quickly .
Many other less famous ( but no less vibrant ) neighbourhoods across America were not so lucky .
The focus on the car was a tragedy of human planning .
Nor is it ending .
Though much has been written about the revitalisation of American downtowns in recent years , by far the more important socio-economic phenomenon is the growth of the exurbs .
These are the suburbs of the suburbs and - believe it or not - or even more car dependant .
They are so spread out , so distanced from city centres and so utterly car - centric that mass transit is inconceivable for them .
But they are also now in pain .
The current American obsession is not Iraq , it is not NSA wiretapping or even the never - ending abortion debate .
It is quite simply petrol prices .
Americans are being squeezed at the pump , now paying more than $ 3 a gallon .
That is still cheap by most European standards but the shock is palpable in America .
It also undercuts the economic model of the exurbs , rendering commuting costs so painful that suddenly , at long last , living by the car alone is starting to become unattractive .
Thank God , I say .
There is little political or cultural will in America to tackle the love of the car .
But brutal economics might just achieve it .
Whenever I see those petrol prices ticking higher I give a lonely little cheer .
I keep it quiet of course .
I 'm already seen as nuts just for liking small cars .

A shy 8 - year - old Long Island boy wonder is making money hand over fist by teaching grownups how to master a popular video game .
The brown - eyed second grader , Victor De Leon III , has been tutoring gaming greenhorns in Halo 2 , an Xbox game in which the player fights to save Earth from destruction , for $ 25 an hour .
That ’s a ton of money , considering most of his peers have no income beyond their tooth - fairy stash .
“ It ’s fun , ” said the digital - pastime prodigy , who ’s been tutoring people online from the gaming room of his Mastic home for more than a year .
His students hail from as far away as Australia .
He ’s even given some free pointers to New Jersey Net star Richard Jefferson .
“ He ’s better at basketball , ” Victor giggled .
His proud father , Victor De Leon II , said Jefferson was pretty star - struck meeting the youngster , who goes by the name Lil Poison II in gaming circles .
“ He actually asked my son for his autograph , ” said De Leon .
Victor happily obliged but had to print it because he does n’t know cursive yet .
Coaching from the littlest Xbox phenom – who has already won thousands in tournaments by beating people twice and three times his age – is booked through gaminglessons.com , where he ’s the youngest of the 12 instructors , who get paid up to $ 65 an hour .
Victor teaches players about “ map control , ” hidden secrets in the game , when players should leave the corners they ’re ducking in and other tricks , his father said .
Still , the kid does have homework of his own – like learning what two times three equals and how to spell ‘ picnic ’ – so Dad said he only takes about four clients a month .
Victor began playing video games when he was 2 years old .
“ He was crying a little bit , so I gave him the console to play with , ” De Leon recalled .
It was like Pac Man gobbling a power pellet .
Within months , the toddler was deftly maneuvering around the game .
First , for some background .
Almost of all of Nigeria 's cuurent production of about 2.6 / mbpd comes from the onshore Niger Delta region shown here .
Let 's take an in - depth view of the the ever - worsening potential oil shock in Nigeria and its implications for US imports and world oil prices .
Let 's look at some basic supply and export numbers first .
From the EIA Nigeria Country Brief
Most importantly , as recently as November of 2005 , Nigeria was the 4th largest crude oil exporter to the US - - 1.163 / mbpd .
Oil and Gas Journal ( 1/1/05 ) estimates Nigeria 's proven oil reserved at 35.2 billion barrels .
The Nigerian government plans to expand its proven reserves to 40 billion barrels by 2010 .
The majority of reserves are found along the country 's coastal Niger River Delta , with the majority of the oil located in approximately 250 small ( i.e. , less than 50 million barrels each ) fields .
At least 200 other fields contain undisclosed reserves .
Nigeria is the largest oil producer in Africa and the eleventh largest in the world , averaging 2.5 million barrels per day ( bbl /d ) in 2004 .
In August 2004 , Nigeria 's finance minister announced plans to produce 2.6 million bbl/d of oil in 2005 .
The Nigerian government plans to increase oil production to 3 million bb/d in 2006 and 4 million bbl/d in 2010 .
Are these kinds of projections realistic at all given the escalating violence and civil unrest there ?
Problems in Nigeria
The causes of unrest in the Niger Delta region are not hard to understand .
But a good place to start is with Nigeria 's president Olusegun Obasanjo .
Good Friends  President Bush and Nigeria's
President Olusegun Obasanjo
From the Christian Science Monitor article 
" Yet Shell and other oil companies pay the government royalties and taxes that amounted to a whopping $ 27 billion in 2004 .
This is one of the world 's most corrupt countries , however , and much of the oil money disappears into personal accounts of officials "  naturally , the corruption starts at the top .
Needless to say , the ethnic groups living in the Niger Delta itself do not benefit from any of this oil revenue and thus large scale oil production stands side by side with great poverty in the region .
Next to an impoverished settlement of mud houses and rusted zinc roofs lies the Utorogu oil facility run by Royal Dutch Shell in Nigeria 's oil - rich Niger Delta .
As a giant tongue of flame leaps repeatedly in the wind - making a ferocious hissing sound as its fire feeds on disused natural gas from a pipeline - local women keep a respectable distance to dry their cassava flakes in its heat .
" The opportunity to dry our farm produce by this fire is the only benefit we derive from having oil in our land , " said Reivu Umukoro , a 38 - year - old mother of four among the women .
According to Umukoro , while oil workers who run the Shell facility and Nigerian troops who guard them live in air - conditioned comfort , the Utorogu community nearby manages without electricity , potable water , and health amenities .
There has also been substantial environmental damage in the region including natural gas flaring , ruptured pipelines and other accidents .
On July 21 , 2005 , the pipeline that runs near here ruptured .
Streams of black goo oozed into farmers ' fields and a fishing creek .
Because of a complicated dispute between villagers and the major oil company in this region , Royal Dutch Shell , the oil has n't been cleaned up .
Black residue still covers thousands of plants .
Residents are angry .
" We will face Shell , " says village chairman Daniel Oweh surrounded by agitated young men .
" The next stage will be violent . "
The levels of violence are now increasing rapidly .
As much as ( or more than ) 100 / kbpd are either shut - in due to attacks on oil facilities or pipelines .
The EIA has estimated that in 2004 139 / kbpd of production were being disrupted on a daily basis due to attacks on oil facilities or sabotage .
For example , the EIA states that " in December 2004 , SPDC and ChevronTexaco suspended Nigerian oil exports of 134,000 bbl/d due to unrest in the Niger Delta .
In January 2005 , ChevronTexaco announced that it was losing 140,000 bbl/d of oil due to the closure of facilities in the Niger Delta " .
In other cases the oil is just ( stolen ) by militant groups to support their activities and buy weapons .
One important player  no doubt , a self - serving African chieftain and despot on the rise  is Alhaji Dokubo - Asari ( shown at right ) a prominent member of the Niger Delta Ijaw ethnic group and militant head of the Niger Delta People 's Volunteer Force ( NDPVF ) .
In fact , after President Obasanjo threw him in jail last September , one of the four MEND demands after kidnapping the oil workers recently was for his release .
Alhaji Dokubo - Asari seeks to create a new country in the Niger Delta , taking the oil money with it .
The situation in the Niger Delta is so chaotic and unstable that it is impossible to do it justice in a short post .
However , in August of 2005 NPR's Steve Inskeep " traveled to Nigeria for two weeks to see firsthand a country of increasing importance to America 's oil - driven economy " .
It is a series of 7 reports examining various aspects of the problem entitled Oil Money Divides Nigeria .
Only partial transcripts are available online but there are complete audio segments for each story available at the cited link .
So if you are interested in learning more and have a broadband connection , I highly recommend that you listen to these stories .
You will hear unbelievable stuff about the precarious nature of the situation there .
Violence , sabotage and kidnapping are now a daily occurrence in the Niger Delta .
Oil company operations are almost all heavily fortified and protected by Nigerian army troops .
The situation is a mess and getting worse .
And the latest news is ominous .
From the The poverty of oil wealth in Nigeria 's delta link cited above , we learn
" This release [ of the kidnapped oil workers ] does not signify a ceasefire or softening of our position to destroy the oil export capability of the Nigerian government , " MEND said in an email to reporters .
The group said it soon would launch fresh attacks aimed at cutting Nigeria 's exports by 30 per cent in February .
It warned all foreign oil workers to leave as new hostages taken by the group would not be freed ....
An expert security study commissioned by Shell two years ago fingered illegal sale of crude oil as the major source of funds for illegal weapons now awash in the region .
An average of 1,000 lives are being lost in the region every year due to militia violence , the report said , predicting that at the current pace of violence Shell may be forced to abandon all onshore oil production in Nigeria by 2008 .
What remains is to see how the government plans to pacify the armed militants , who have vowed that oil will no longer flow without their consent , and have mastery of the delta 's maze of rivers and creeks so far impenetrable to the military .
And although we have the usual assurances from President Obasanjo that all will be well , Nigeria may not be in the same league as Saudi Arabia or Russia but it is a very important exporter to both the US and Europe and is counted on to increase exports in the future .
As reported in the CS Monitor article , David Goldwyn , a former US assistant energy secretary who now consults in the region says , " the loss of more Nigerian oil could send the price to $ 80 or $ 95 per barrel or higher ....
The likelihood of a significant disruption always has to be counted as relatively high " .
If MEND makes good on its promise to reduce Nigerian exports by 30 % in the near future , that will have a significant affect in the US and other importers of Nigerian oil .
To put this in perspective , the 4 other largest oil exporters to the US are Canada , Mexico , Saudi Arabia and Venezuela .
Mexico seems to be about to tip over into permanent declines ( given Cantarell ) , Hugo Chavez has shown some inclination to sell his oil to China instead , Saudi Arabia has the usual uncertainties we 're all familiar with and in Canada , production is flat despite the over - hyped promise of tar sands from Alberta .
So , Nigeria is looking pretty important in the overall scheme of things in the near term .
And the way things look now , the likelihood of a significant disruption of oil exports from Nigeria must be taken very seriously indeed in 2006 .
( Original introduction has been moved down here ... tied to the news of that day ... )
Things are not looking good in Nigeria ( also pointed out by Leanan ) :
Armed militants carried out a wave of attacks across Nigeria 's troubled Niger delta on Saturday , blowing up oil and gas pipelines and seizing nine foreign oil workers .

A foreigner living legally in the United States , his lawyers say , is not the same as a soldier captured on a battlefield .
Even if the president does have the power , they say , he should be required to support his assertions with evidence .
The government argues that Judge Floyd gave Mr. Marri too full a hearing .
It cited the recent Military Commissions Act , which says that the courts have no jurisdiction to hear challenges from any alien “ who has been determined by the United States to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant . ”
The case will be heard Feb .
1 .
The government offered Mr. Marri a sort of consolation prize should the appeals court dismiss his case .
It said he could try to persuade a combatant status review tribunal , convened by the Defense Department , that he was not an enemy combatant .
That would apparently be the first such proceeding on the mainland ; all of the others known to have been conducted were at Guantánamo Bay .
A Different View
In a brief filed in November , eight former Justice Department officials , including Janet Reno , the attorney general in the Clinton administration , said that taking Mr. Marri out of the criminal system as his case approached trial “ has given to the appearance of manipulation of the judicial process . ”
The brief listed several criminal statutes available to prosecute people accused of terrorism along with many successful prosecutions under them .
“ The criminal justice system has proven that it can make the cases , ” Ms. Reno said in an interview .
“ For the president to be able to designate someone as an enemy combatant , without process and without regulation , just does n’t make any sense and is n’t necessary . ”
Ms. Blomquist , the Justice Department spokeswoman , said , “ While we respect the views of former law enforcement officials , the United States cannot afford to retreat to a pre-September 11 mind - set that treats terrorism solely as a domestic law enforcement problem . ”
Mr. Marri shared a fantasy with one of his lawyers not long ago .
“ I ’d love to be taken back to Saudi Arabia and they would beat the ” — here , he swore — “ out of me for six months , ” Mr. Marri said , according to Mr. Savage .
“ It would be brutal , but it would be finite . ”

Looking for the easiest way to join the anti-drug war movement ?
You 've found it
There was quite a bit of teeth gnashing across the web throughout the evening yesterday as TypePad , LiveJournal , and all the other hosted Six Apart websites went dark ; we learned late in the night that the cause was a “ sophisticated distributed denial of service attack ” against the sites .
Digging a little deeper , though , it does n’t look like this is a particularly accurate description of what happened — but instead of this being a case of the folks at Six Apart trying to cover up some internal issue , it instead looks like they ’re being far too gracious in not revealing more about another company , Blue Security , which appears to have been responsible for the whole disaster .
An explanation of this requires a slight bit of background .
Blue Security is a company which has recently garnered a little bit of notoriety on the ‘ net due to its unorthodox method of attempting to control the problem of spam email .
Last summer , PC World publshed a reasonably good summary of Blue Security ’s antispam efforts ; a charitable way of describing the method would be to say it attempts to bury spammers in unsubscription requests , but a more accurate description would be that the service performs outright denial - of - service attacks on spammers , and does so by convincing people to install an application ( Blue Frog ) on their computers which launches and participates in the attacks .
Without a doubt , Blue Security ’s system has generated controversy from the perspective of both unsolicited emailers and regular ‘ net citizens alike , so it ’s not all that surprising that the spammers recently began fighting back .
One of the methods used against Blue Security has been a more traditional denial - of - service attack against the company ’s main web server , www.bluesecurity.com, an attack which was effective enough to knock that web server offline for most of yesterday .
OK , so why is any of this information — about a company completely unrelated to Six Apart — important background ?
Because according to a post on the North American Network Operators Group mailing list , at some point yesterday the people at Blue Security decided that the best way to deal with the attack was to point the hostname www.bluesecurity.com to their TypePad- hosted weblog , bluesecurity.blogs.com .
This effectively meant that the target of the attack shifted off of Blue Security ’s own network and onto that of Six Apart , and did so as the direct result of a decision made by the folks at Blue Security .
( The best analogy I can think of is that it ’d be like you dealing with a water main break in your basement by hooking a big hose up to the leaking joint and redirecting the water into your neighbor ’s basement instead . )
Soon thereafter , the Six Apart network ( understandably ) buckled under that weight and fell off the ‘ net , and over four hours passed before packets began to flow again .
( And given that the www.bluesecurity.com hostname was still pointed at TypePad for most of today , I ’d imagine that the only way those packets began to flow was as the result of some creative filtering at the edge of its network . )
Judging from the outage , it ’s unlikely that Blue Security gave them any warning — although who knows whether a warning would ’ve prevented the basement from filling up with water all the same .
So , returning to my original point : saying that Six Apart ’s services were taken down as the result of a “ sophisticated distributed denial of service attack ” is an incredibly gracious statement that only addresses about 10 % of the whole story .
The other 90 % of that story is that Blue Security , a company with already - shady practices , decided to solve its problems by dumping them onto Six Apart ’s doorstep , something I ’m pretty damn sure is n’t part of the TypePad service agreement .
I know that ultimately , the denial - of - service attack came from the spammers themselves , but it was specifically redirected to the Six Apart network by Blue Security , and I hope that they get taken to the cleaners for this one .
( I ’ve just begun experimenting with the social bookmarking / commenting site Digg ; as I ’m clearly in favor of more people understanding how the outage came to occur , feel free to Digg this post . )
Update : Computer Business Review Online has picked up the story , and has some other details .
Netcraft also has a post on the DDoS , and News.com picked up the bit from them , but there ’s not much more in either bit .
Conservationists hope the vulture chick will be the first of many
The bird belongs to one of three species of Asian vulture that are listed as critically endangered .
Populations in the wild have crashed because they eat carcasses containing traces of the drug diclofenac .
The use of the anti-inflammatory drug in the region is being phased out but it could take 10 years , scientists say .
Dr Vibhu Prakash , principal scientist for the vulture breeding programme , said : " This is the most precious new year gift from nature to vulture conservation . "
The egg was laid in November and the centre 's staff had been waiting and hoping ever since , he added .
" This success shows that we have got the conditions right , so we can plan ahead with confidence . "
Soaring death toll
We have to measure all of our successes against the backdrop that we are still talking about the extinction of the vultures
Nick Lindsay ,
Zoological Society of London
Nick Lindsay , ZSL's head of international zoo programmes , said the society had been heavily involved in the centre since the late 1990s .
" It was established with a UK government Darwin Initiative grant , when the cause of the decline in vultures was still being investigated , " he said .
The centre shifted its focus from research to breeding once it was discovered that diclofenac , a drug widely used by vets in the region to treat cattle , was the main reason for the vultures ' deaths .
The link was firmly established in 2004 when tests on captive vultures fed carcass flesh traced with the drug produced symptoms that were strikingly similar to those witnessed in sick birds in the wild .
Mr Lindsay said the centre 's work concentrated on the three species most seriously affected by diclofenac : the oriental white - backed vulture ( Gyps bengalensis ) , the long - billed vulture ( Gyps indicus ) and the slender - billed vulture ( Gyps tenuirostris ) .
In the past 15 years , population losses of more than 95 % have been reported in these birds .
' Worrying scenario '
Although India , Pakistan and Nepal were taking steps to phase out the use of the drug , Mr Lindsay said the birds ' battle for survival was far from over .
Vultures used to be a more common sight in the skies
" The communities that use this drug can be remote ; cattle are literally found in their millions and people care very much for their well - being , so the drug is still being widely used because it is a very effective treatment for the cattle .
" If you take all those different factors , it creates quite a worrying scenario . "
But he added that there were some projects on the ground that were helping to take the drug out of circulation .
In Nepal , conservation groups were visiting pharmacies and clinics located within areas used by vultures and swapping supplies of diclofenac with a bird - friendly replacement , meloxicam .
" This sort of thing might be possible in Nepal because it is a much smaller country than India and the problem is not as extensive , " he suggested .
" But even then it is going to be a struggle because the range of these birds is so vast . "

Torrent101 and Bitroll are two relatively new BitTorrent clients that can seriously damage your computer .
The worst thing about it is that popular sites like Torrentspy , Torrentscan , and even The Pirate Bay display ads for them .
Both clients are scam products that claim to bring you ‘ high speeds downloads ’ , but all they do is install malware , and hijack your browser .
We already posted about Bitroll a while ago , and if you take a look at the comments on that post you will see that these clients bring nothing but bad things .
Even worse is the fact that they advertise these malware clients on several torrent sites , using phrases like “ Download Torrents using Torrent101 for high speed downloads ” .
Torrentspy and Torrentscan are two reputable sites that knowingly advertise for these clients .
They go so far as to integrate the ads into their design .
Experienced BitTorrent users will probably not fall into this trap , but I bet many newcomers will .
You might wonder why respectable BitTorrent site admins advertise for these clients .
Well the answer to that is simple : MONEY .
The developers pay a lot of cash to these admins , who get paid for installing malware on their turn .
The ads also appear on The Pirate Bay and several other sites through contextual ad- services like Adbrite and Targetpoint ( screenshot ) .
They they tried to get on mininova as well , but the site admins rejected the ad proposal on Adbrite , and blocked ads from these malicious clients via Targetpoint .
Another site that was recently infected is Snarf - it .
One of the junior admins accidentally made a deal with Torrent101 , something that goes completely against the ‘ safe ads ’ policy of one of the cleanest BitTorrent sites on the net .
The contract was canceled as soon as possible , and Rafe , the site admin later apologized for the mistake .
So watch out !
And avoid these malicious clients .

Israel ’s long - standing policy of nuclear ambiguity came to an end the other day when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , in answer to a question about his country ’s rumored WMD arsenal , replied ,
“ Iran openly , explicitly , and publicly threatens to wipe Israel off the map .
Can you say that this is the same level , when they [ the Iranians ] are aspiring to have nuclear weapons , as America , France , Israel , Russia ? "
Ha’aretz avers , " It is not clear whether this was a slip of the tongue on the part of Olmert or an intended statement "  and his aides and supporters are certainly scrambling to explain his comments away as a linguistic mix - up .
Yet , taken in context  not only the context of the interview , but the context of Israel ’s present position 
I would argue the Israeli Prime Minister was sending a message not only to Iran , but also to the U.S .
As a rebuke to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ‘s rants about wiping Israel off the map , Olmert ’s is the perfect retort .
Everyone knows that Israel has at least 400 nukes , and it is n’t hard to guess in which direction they ’re aimed .
Olmert is pointedly reminding the Iranians of what everyone has known for quite some time .
All the Israeli prime minister has to do is give the order , and Tehran would be reduced to a pool of molten glass .
The message sent to Washington  and , indeed , to the entire world  is that Israel is making a clean break with the policies of the past , based as they were on a strategy of economic , diplomatic , and military dependence on Western allies .
Israel feels it has been abandoned by the West , including not only Britain but also the U.S.  and all bets are off .
This fear of abandonment , although greatly exaggerated , is not entirely unfounded .
It is based on a sensitive reading of the political dynamics in the U.S. and the threatened future of Israel ’s " special relationship " with the Americans .
The Israel lobby in the U.S. has recently taken it on the chin four times in a row , without so much as getting a punch in edgewise : it started with the arrest and indictment of two top AIPAC officials , Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman , for espionage .
They are charged with funneling classified information , some of it high - level stuff , to Israeli embassy officials .
Then there was the Harvard University research paper authored by professors John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt , documenting and decrying what they called " the Lobby " and its distorting effect on American foreign policy .
Now there ’s the Baker - Hamilton commission linking the Palestinian question to our " grave and deteriorating " prospects in Iraq , and , to top it off , the Jimmy Carter book .
The Lobby is reeling .
For the first time since the Eisenhower era , our Israeli - centric policy in the Middle East is being openly and successfully challenged .
In the past , Israel ’s amen corner in the U.S. has been able to effectively neutralize all critics by smearing them , and the charge of " anti-Semitism " has been applied with an absurdly broad brush to everyone from Gore Vidal to Pat Buchanan and all points in between .
However , this case is getting increasingly hard to make .
Are we now to believe that the U.S. Department of Justice , Harvard University , Baker and the Bush I crowd , and Jimmy Carter are all part of a vast anti-Semitic conspiracy ?
Surely not .
With the British endorsement of the Baker group ’s conclusions , one would also have to include Tony Blair among the conspirators .
When Mearsheimer and Walt published their paper , the Lobby likened them to David Duke .
They ca n’t pull that , however , with Baker ’s wise men , a former president , and the British prime minister .
The Lobby has cried wolf once too often .
Tony Judt , who has taken more than a few hits from the tireless efforts of the amen corner , recently noted the new atmosphere of glasnost when it comes to discussing the " special " status of American - Israeli relations :
" What seems to me the case is that if you keep pushing , if you insist there at least be a discussion of the Mearsheimer - Walt paper even a discussion about the failure to discuss it , something does change .
And it seems to me there ’s a shift . "
The Israelis recognize this shift , and Olmert ’s alleged slip of the tongue is their answer .
The " clean break " strategy embraced by the Israelis , predicated on the invasion and occupation of Iraq by the Americans , has so far played out pretty much as outlined in a notorious game plan drawn up by top U.S. policymakers , including neocon point - man and former Defense Policy Board official Richard Perle , former Deputy Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith , and David Wurmser , currently Dick Cheney ’s top adviser on Middle Eastern affairs .
The agenda put forth in this widely cited 1996 document , intended as advice to then - incoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , was meant to confront the central conundrum at the heart of the Zionist predicament : how to overcome its essential dependence on the West .
As a settler colony , implanted by force of arms and sustained by aid from abroad , Israel has from the start been dependent on outside forces to ensure its survival .
What was needed , argued the Clean Breakers , was a new offensive that would repudiate the concept of " land for peace " and set Israel free from Western - imposed constraints .
Invoking the " right of hot pursuit , " Israel would launch periodic invasions of Palestinian and Lebanese territory  and set the stage for strikes against Syria and Iran .
The road to Damascus and Tehran would run through Baghdad , however , as the authors of " A Clean Break " put it :
" Israel can shape its strategic environment , in cooperation with Turkey and Jordan , by weakening , containing , and even rolling back Syria .
This effort can focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq  an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right  as a means of foiling Syria ’s regional ambitions . "
Syria and Lebanon were seen by the Clean Breakers as the front line in their battle to expand the frontiers of Israeli power .
Following a successful campaign to " redefine Iraq , " it would be possible to envision a " profound " shift in the regional " strategic balance of power . "
Jordan would be drawn into the new order , and the Israelis would succeed in " diverting Syria ’s attention by using Lebanese opposition elements to destabilize Syrian control of Lebanon . "
A decade after the Clean Break scenario was conceived , its policy prescriptions read like prophecies .
However , as the game plan approaches its projected climax  an attack on Iran and / or Syria  there are numerous indications the U.S. is bailing , and not only in Iraq .
The appearance on the American political and intellectual scene of forces willing and able to challenge the Lobby ’s unquestioned hegemony over U.S. foreign policy  especially when it comes to the crucial [ . pdf ]
Middle East  threatens to scuttle the Clean Break scenario .
Israel wants regime - change in Syria and Iran , while the Baker - Hamilton folks want to open up negotiations with them over the future of Iraq .
And the Mearsheimer - Walt thesis on the Lobby ’s vanguard role in fomenting war with Iraq is taking root .
As the two distinguished professors put it :
" Pressure from Israel and the Lobby was not the only factor behind the decision to attack Iraq in March 2003 , but it was critical .
Some Americans believe that this was a war for oil , but there is hardly any direct evidence to support this claim .
Instead , the war was motivated in good part by a desire to make Israel more secure . "
Citing Philip Zelikow ’s by - now infamous remarks that the war was really all about the threat to Israel , and not the U.S. , Mearsheimer and Walt reference a report in the Washington Post that
" ’ Israel is urging U.S. officials not to delay a military strike against Iraq ’s Saddam Hussein . ’
By this point , according to Sharon , strategic coordination between Israel and the U.S. had reached ‘ unprecedented dimensions ’ , and Israeli intelligence officials had given Washington a variety of alarming reports about Iraq ’s WMD programs .
As one retired Israeli general later put it , ‘ Israeli intelligence was a full partner to the picture presented by American and British intelligence regarding Iraq ’s non-conventional capabilities . ’ "
Now that the full disaster in Iraq is unfolding in all its bloody viciousness and tragic futility , the Israelis are catching a lot of the blame , and the power of the Lobby is being undermined , perhaps fatally .
The cord to the U.S. , which has sustained Israel for so long , is in danger of being cut  before Israel is ready to make the break .
Iraq is destroyed , but the front - line enemies of Israel  Syria and Iran  are still left standing .
Not only that , but Iran is moving ahead with its nuclear program , and James Baker is whispering sweet nothings in Bashar Assad ’s ear .
No wonder the Israelis have abandoned all pretenses of reasonableness and are now threatening to plunge the Middle East into the throes of a nuclear Armageddon .
Israel is alone against the world , or so their leaders seem to believe : cornered , they are revealing their true face , snarling their resentment and defiance  their ire directed not just or even primarily at the Iranians , but at U.S. policymakers .
Olmert has found the elusive " weapons of mass destruction " said to be lurking somewhere in the Middle East , threatening the peace and shadowing the land with the darkest , most ominous war clouds .
We know  now  they are n’t anywhere in Iraq , and our own CIA tells us the Iranians are a good 10 years away from acquiring nukes .
No , they are right where Mordechai Vanunu told us they were .
Would the Israelis ever use them ?
That is the question that we have to ask in light of Olmert ’s unprecedented admission .
After all , why " come out " to the world as a nuclear power at this particular moment ?
Surely the threat of a nuclear first strike against Iran is implicit in Olmert ’s " slip of the tongue . "
The Israeli conceit is that to equate a regime such as the one that rules in Tehran with Israeli " democracy " is an obscene " moral equivalence " that overlooks the obvious : after all , we can trust Tel Aviv with WMD , but not the Iranian ayatollahs .
Yet the growing extremism dominating Israeli political life , as demonstrated by the rise of such a dangerous character as Avigdor Lieberman , points to a troubling trend that has culminated in Olmert ’s stunning announcement .
We are now about to experience the consequences  the " blowback "  of our Israel - centric policy , which has fostered and nurtured Israeli ultra-nationalism in the womb of the " special relationship . "
As in so many other cases of aiding and abetting foreign " freedom fighters , " we ’ll find we have created yet another monster .
By the time this realization dawns on us , however , it will , unfortunately , be too late .

This is the second edition of Code Reads , a weekly discussion of some of the central essays , documents and texts in the history of software .
You can go straight to the comments and post something if you like .
Here ’s the full Code Reads archive .
The title of Edsger Dijkstra ’s 1968 “ Go To Statement Considered Harmful ” is among the best - known phrases in the history of programming .
Interestingly , the phrasing of the title — which has become so regular a cliche in the field it inspired Eric Meyer to compose the waggish “ ‘ Considered Harmful ’ Essays Considered Harmful ” — was not Dijkstra ’s work at all .
As Dijkstra explained it :
Finally a short story for the record .
In 1968 , the Communications of the ACM published a text of mine under the title “ The goto statement considered harmful , ” which in later years would be most frequently referenced , regrettably , however , often by authors who had seen no more of it than its title , which became a cornerstone of my fame by becoming a template : we would see all sorts of articles under the title “ X considered harmful ” for almost any X , including one titled “ Dijkstra considered harmful . ”
But what had happened ?
I had submitted a paper under the title “ A case against the goto statement ” , which , in order to speed up its publication , the editor had changed into a “ letter to the Editor ” , and in the process he had given it a new title of his own invention !
The editor was Niklaus Wirth .
How did Wirth come up with the odd phrase ?
My hunch is : some combination of English - as - a - second - language ( though , since Wirth got his PhD here at Berkeley , that may be completely wrong ) combined with the essential trait of radical concision drummed into the heads of programmers of that era .
Fewer words !
Fewer characters !
Less space in memory !
The content of Dijkstra ’s brief essay itself is far less widely known than its title .
David Tribble , the author of an extensive annotation of the original essay , calls it “ probably the least read document in all of programming lore ” — hyperbole , but telling .
As Tribble and others have pointed out , Dijkstra did n’t advocate the total elimination of “ go to , ” but he did aim to radically curtail it : “ The go to statement as it stands is just too primitive ; it is too much an invitation to make a mess of one ’s program . ”
Dijsktra ’s essay was an important milestone in the structured programming movement of its era .
His argument is straightforward enough : “ Go to ” is problematic because , in jumping arbitrarily from one spot in a process to another , it fails to maintain context ( or “ state awareness ” ) — and that invites messes .
From what I can tell , the specifics of this debate have been largely left behind by the march of programming - language progress .
Nonetheless I found plenty to chew on in Dijkstra ’s brief essay , particular his assertion that the programmer ’s “ true subject matter ” is creating the “ process taking place under control of his program , ” with the program and its code serving simply a means to that end .
I wonder what practicing programmers reading these arguments today make of them .
Are there analogies in today ’s languages to Dijkstra ’s “ invitation to make a mess ” ?
Higher - level - abstraction versions of the “ Go To ” statement that we have yet to eliminate ?
Should “ Go To Statement Considered Harmful ” be on the software - document reading list at all — or should we let it age peacefully into its cliche - dom ?

Many Guantanamo detainees have been held for years
Justices upheld the challenge by Osama Bin Laden 's ex-driver to his trial at Guantanamo , saying the proceedings violated Geneva Conventions .
The ruling is seen as a major blow to President George W Bush - but it does not order the closure of Guantanamo .
Mr Bush said he would respect it but also protect Americans from " killers " .
The Cuba - based facility currently holds about 460 inmates , mostly without charge , whom the US suspects of links to al - Qaeda or the Taleban .
Profound implications
Osama Bin Laden 's ex-driver , Salim Ahmed Hamdan , is one of 10 Guantanamo inmates facing a military tribunal .
He launched the proceedings demanding to be tried by a civilian tribunal or court martial , where the prosecution would face more obstacles .
In its ruling , the court said : " Whether or not the government has charged Hamdan with an offence against the law of war , cognisable by a military commission , the commission lacks power to proceed . "
" The procedures adopted to try Hamdan also violate the Geneva Conventions , " the justices said .
The ruling does not demand the release of prisoners held at Guantanamo but gives the administration an opportunity to come up with another way of trying those held .
The BBC's Nick Miles in Washington says the implications of the decision are profound , as Washington will either have to court - martial the detainees or try them as civilians .
It may end up releasing many prisoners and returning them to their home countries , our correspondent adds .
' Serious look '
One of the dissenters , Justice Clarence Thomas , took the unusual step of reading part of his opinion from the bench , saying the decision would " sorely hamper the president 's ability to confront and defeat a new and deadly enemy " .
Hamdan was a driver for Osama Bin Laden
He added that he would work with Congress " to determine whether or not the military tribunals will be an avenue in which to give people their day in court " .
The decision was welcomed by senior Democratic Senator Carl Levin .
" The Supreme Court has once again demonstrated its vital constitutional role as a check and balance on the actions of the executive and legislative branches of government , " he said in a statement .
Mr Hamdan had success in his first legal outing , in the US District Court in Washington , which ruled that he could not face a military trial unless he had previously been found not to be a prisoner of war under the Geneva Convention .
He claims POW status , but like all camp prisoners , he is denied this and is instead designated an " unlawful combatant " by the Bush administration .
However , an appeal court reversed this decision and said Mr Bush had the authority to order the trials .

A daily dose of fish oil is better at treating hyperactivity than Ritalin - the ' chemical cosh ' linked to the deaths of children , stunning research has revealed .
Just six capsules a day of the naturally - occurring oil can vastly improve children 's behaviour without any of the side - effects of Ritalin and related drugs .
The controversial drugs can cause heart problems , dizziness and insomnia and have been blamed for the deaths of nine children in the UK and dozens more in the US .
A mother 's story
• Case study : ' How fish oil improved my hyperactive son '
The new study provides a natural alternative - and gives fresh hope to the parents of the 30,000 British children prescribed Ritalin and similar medicines such as Concerta .
Last night , experts accused doctors of being too quick to boost the coffers of large drug companies by writing out prescriptions - and urged parents to look into the value of improving their child 's diet .
Psychiatrist Dr Sami Timimi ( CORR ) said : ' It stands to reason that using a natural supplement that has few dangers or side - effects must be preferable to using drugs which have considerable dangers associated with them .
' This is a non -toxic way of doing something that might make a difference . '
Last year , a study by Durham Local Education Authority showed that omega 3 can improve the brainpower and concentration of hyperactive children .
The latest findings , from the University of Adelaide , are the first to show that omega 3 fish oil may be better than medication at treating Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder .
The compound , which occurs naturally in oily fish such as salmon , mackerel and tuna , is responsible for a range of health benefits , from combating heart disease to boosting intelligence .
Despite this , most people eat just a fifth of the amount recommended for good health .
The Australian researchers looked at the effect of eye q ( CORR ) fish oil capsules on a group seven to 12 - year - olds with ADHD .
Some were given the capsules , while others took a placebo or dummy capsule .
Within three months , the behaviour of those on the fish oils had dramatically improved and , by seven months , many of the children were less restless and doing better at school .
The most striking improvement was in concentration or attention , which improved by a third .
When those taking the dummy capsules switched to the fish oils , they also saw their behaviour improve .
Researcher Natalie Sinn ( CORR ) said : ' Many of those who had children who showed improvements commented that their children were calmer , were doing better at school and were able to concentrate longer and were therefore reading more .
' Overall , 30 to 40 per cent of children over 15 weeks and 40 to 50 per cent of children over 30 weeks had improvements . '
She added that week - on - week improvements were still being seen at the end of the study - suggesting the results of an even longer course of treatment , may be even more dramatic .
The researchers also compared their results to those from studies of Ritalin and Concerta and found fish oils are more effective , a Sydney conference on omega - 3 will hear this week .
British experts said the research , which is to be published in the Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics ( CORR ) , underlined the value of exploring alternative treatments to Ritalin .
The number of hyperactive children on medication is soaring , with a staggering 330,000 prescriptions written out each year , or 6,350 a week .
Nine British children have died after taking the drugs .
Two died of heart problems , while others suffered illnesses including strokes and swelling of the brain .
Dr Timimi , a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist at Lincolnshire NHS Trust , said : ' Drugs like Ritalin have considerable dangers associated with them , including insomnia , changes in personality and cardiotoxicity - they are bad for the heart and can cause heart attacks , strokes and sudden death .
' It must be preferable to that . '
Nick Giovannelli( CORR ) , of the Hyperactive Children 's Support Group , urged parents to consider using natural alternatives to Ritalin .
He said : ' GPs seem to be too quick to prescribe medication .
' This new study adds to the mounting evidence that nutrition is safer and more effective than stimulant medication . '
Dr Madeleine Portwood , the educational psychologist who led the Durham trial , said : ' This study shows once again that omega 3 can have a very beneficial effect for children with concentration and behaviour problems . '
The Royal College of Psychiatrists said the findings were ' promising ' and warranted further research .
Other studies have shown that omega 3 is also effective in children without ADHD or learning difficulties , boosting their grasp of the three Rs and improving their GCSE grades .
Concerta 's manufacturers , Buckinghamshire - based Janssen - Cilag ( CORR ) , said the drug is part of a package of care which should include attention to diet .
Dr Tony Donovan , the firm 's associated medical director , said Concerta had a good safety record but did not suit all children .
He advised parents considering switching their child to fish oil to consult their child 's specialist .
' It is not a decision to make off your own bat , ' he said .
' I would advise a parent to have a discussion with their specialist about the benefits or otherwise about changing medication before making any changes . '
The makers of Ritalin , Swiss - based Novartis , said the drug had a long record of being a safe and effective medication .
A spokesman advised anyone concerned about side - effects to consult their doctor .
The three men's lawyer claims they risk further ill treatment
Christopher Greenwood QC said facts in Bisher al - Rawi 's case made the foreign secretary decide on " a specific , security - related request " to the US .
Mr al - Rawi , Jamil el - Banna and Omar Deghayes have asked the court to force Jack Straw to press for their release .
The judges are expected to give their decision in the next couple of weeks .
They reserved their judgement after the two - day hearing .
The government has always maintained that it cannot help the men as they are not British nationals .
The three men are believed to be among at least five UK residents still held at the US - run detention camp in Cuba .
The case of Mr al - Rawi , an Iraqi - born businessman who has lived in the UK since 1985 , had been " reconsidered separately " by Mr Straw , the QC told the court .
Lawyers for Mr Al - Rawi have argued that he helped British intelligence .
He said the facts in his case , which could not be gone into in open court , had led Mr Straw to conclude representations should be made on his behalf to the US government .
Mr Greenwood told the court the actual form which the intervention would take had not yet been decided .
The QC told Lord Justice Latham and Mr Justice Tugendhat at the London court there were currently no plans to make " general requests " on behalf of Mr el- Banna and Mr Deghayes .
' Security related '
" To put it succinctly and candidly , the likely reaction to a security - related request may be different from the reaction to a general request , " he said .
In documents previously submitted to the court , Mr al - Rawi and Mr el - Banna were alleged to have connections with al - Qaeda through radical Muslim cleric Abu Qatada .
However , lawyers for Mr al - Rawi have consistently argued he had contact with Qatada " expressly approved and encouraged by British intelligence " .
Mr al - Rawi maintains intelligence staff had told him they would help him if he ever ran into trouble .
Lawyer Timothy
Otty , appearing for all three men , told the court on Wednesday that documents established " communications " between British and US security services relating to Mr al - Rawi and Mr el - Banna before their arrests .
Mr Otty said : " We will certainly be contending there has been real injustice , and there is a causal link on the part of those acting for the UK in that injustice . "
Amnesty says
Mr al - Rawi and his friend Mr el - Banna , a Jordanian refugee who had been living in London , were arrested in November 2002 at Banjul airport , during a business trip to Gambia , on suspicion of having links to terrorism .
Libyan - born Mr Deghayes , 36 , of Brighton , has been held at Guantanamo for three years and was on a hunger strike , Mr Otty said .
He was arrested in Pakistan and accused of committing terrorist acts against the US , but his lawyers claim it is a case of mistaken identity .
Mr Deghayes fled Libya for Britain in the 1980s after his father was assassinated .
He was granted refugee status in the UK , where he was educated and applied for British citizenship .
Mr Otty had also told the court there was " compelling evidence " the three men had been " severely tortured " at Guantanamo and were at " real risk " of further ill treatment .
Mr Greenwood told the judges on Wednesday the government was " attaching considerable weight " to the US denial that torture or inhuman treatment had taken place at Guantanamo Bay .
The government would " certainly not accept that there was compelling evidence that the men have been tortured " , he added .

Field Notes
A celebrated science - fiction author creates a template for the ' perfect ' business plan
If you need any further proof that entrepreneurship has entered the mainstream of popular culture , take a look at Cryptonomicon ( Avon Books ) , the newest work from author Neal Stephenson .
Stephenson -- labeled " the Quentin Tarantino of post - cyberpunk science fiction " by The Village Voice -- is best known for his 1992 novel , Snow Crash , a compelling vision of our technological future that became required reading in the boardrooms of Silicon Valley .
A possibly apocryphal story has the CEO of one high - tech start - up tossing the book on the table in a staff meeting and declaring , " This is our business plan . "
Imagine what the same CEO would do with Cryptonomicon , which despite its complex multigenerational story line ( and intimidating 918 - page length ) reached # 12 on the New York Times best - seller list .
It tells two stories that are generations apart .
One is the tale of Silicon Valley techies on the thrill ride of an entrepreneurial start - up of their own .
The other is about the Allied cryptographers -- the high - tech geeks of their day -- who broke the Axis military codes in World War II .
In the course of the present - day story , Stephenson makes his most telling observation : in today 's increasingly entrepreneurial culture , building a business is the way those who seek adventure pursue their dreams .
" The people who , 100 years ago , would have been carrying their crates over the Chilkoot Pass to join the Klondike Gold Rush now start companies , " Stephenson tells Inc .
" Starting your own company has become a standard rite of passage . "
That may be true in the cash - rich culture of high tech , but it does n't explain why a hipster novelist like Stephenson would include his take on the language and conventions of the modern business plan - - a wickedly insightful take -- in a major work .
Is the business plan becoming so much a part of our cultural vernacular that it's now grist for the satirist 's mill ?
" It is part of our vernacular , " Stephenson says .
" That would have been unthinkable years ago .
Think of the movie The Graduate .
The guy who said ' plastics ' symbolized the sheer awfulness and boredom of business .
That whole attitude has completely turned around .
Today starting a company is the way you express yourself and rebel and change things . "
At one point some years ago , Stephenson himself caught the entrepreneurship bug and was involved in a start - up effort or two .
" For a while I considered trying to get something going with interactive media , " he says .
" Pretty early on I learned that you have to have a business plan , so I started getting into that process a little bit . "

In order to get a better feeling for what can be done with functools .
partial ( )
I am taking some “ real world ” python code of mine and refactoring it to use curried functions .
In the example below the construct_getopt_data ( ) function ( lines 7 - 17 ) takes the data structure shown on lines 44 - 54 ( below ) and returns a 2 - tuple where
the first element is a string of option letters ( second argument to getopt ( ) ( see variable shortflags in the output below ) ) and
( see variable in the output below ) ) and the second element is a list of strings with the names of long options ( third argument to getopt ( ) ( see variable longflags below ) )
The resulting data is thus as follows :
mhr@playground2:~/src/published$
python2.5 partialf.py shortflags = ' l : ep:a:x:r:o:i:dc ' longflags = ( ' lines= ' , ' echo ' , ' fyo ' , ' pager= ' , ' pgr= ' , ' algo= ' , ' recipient= ' , ' decrypt ' , ' crypt ' ) >> test ok
And the code that ’s producing the output above looks as follows :
1 #!/usr /bin/env python 2 from pprint import PrettyPrinter as PP 3 from itertools import ( imap , repeat ) 4 from functools import partial 5 from operator import ( ge , lt ) 6 7 def construct_getopt_data ( args ) : 8 " " " uses lambdas " " " 9 # single and multi-character flag iterators 10 shortiter = lambda args : argiter ( args , lambda s : s <= 2 ) 11 longiter = lambda args : argiter ( args , lambda s : s > 2 ) 12 13 # single character flags 14 shortfs = imap ( formatf , shortiter ( args ) , repeat ( ' : ' ) )
15 # multi-character flags 16 longfs = imap ( formatf , longiter ( args ) , repeat ( ' = ' ) ) 17 return ( '' . join ( shortfs ) , tuple ( longfs ) ) 18
Please note :
the function above uses the lambda construct ( on lines 10 - 11 ) to customise the short and long argument iterator respectively .
construct ( on lines 10 - 11 ) to customise the short and long argument iterator respectively .
the use of itertools .repeat( ) to supply the fchar parameter to the formatf ( ) function ( lines 14 and 16 )
The analogous function construct_getopt_data2 ( ) ( lines 19 - 29 ) below performs the same taks but uses curried functions as opposed to lambdas .
19 def construct_getopt_data2 ( args ) : 20 " " " uses functools .
partial " " " 21 # single and multi-character flag iterators 22 shortiter = partial ( argiter , op=partial ( ge , 2 ) ) 23 longiter = partial ( argiter , op=partial ( lt , 2 ) ) 24 25 # single character flags 26 shortfs = map( partial ( formatf , fchar= ' : ' ) , shortiter ( args ) ) 27 # multi-character flags 28 longfs = map( partial ( formatf , fchar= ' = ' ) , longiter ( args ) ) 29 return ( '' . join ( shortfs ) , tuple ( longfs ) ) 30
It utilises functools . partial ( )
on lines 22 - 23 : to customise the argument iterator by currying the built - in operator functions operator.ge ( ) ( greater or equal ) and operator.lt ( ) ( less than ) using these curried operator functions to preset the op parameter of the argiter ( ) generator on lines 26 and 28 to preset the fchar parameter of the formatf ( ) function ( the ruse with itertools .
repeat ( ) is hence not needed any more )
31 def argiter ( args , op ) : 32 " " " pair short / long flags will their respective types " " " 33 for flags , argdata in args.iteritems ( ) : 34 for flag in flags : 35 if op ( len ( flag ) ) : yield ( flag , argdata [ 1 ] ) 36
The argiter ( ) generator above facilitates the iteration over the input data structure ( lines 44 - 54 ) in ( single character flag , type ) and ( multi - character parameter , type ) pairs respectively .
37 def formatf ( ( argn , argt ) , fchar ) : 38 " " " format for getopt ( ) , 39 argn is the flag , argt is its type , fchar is one of ' :' or ' = ' " " " 40 return argt == bool and argn.lstrip ( ' - ' ) or " %s%s " % ( argn.lstrip ( ' - ' ) , fchar ) 41
The formatf ( ) function above returns the single and multi- character command line flags in the format required by getopt ( ) .
42 if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : 43 # dictionary with command line args along with their types and defaults 44 args = { 45 ( ' - a ' , ' - x ' , ' -- algo ' ) : ( ' algo ' , str , None ) , 46 ( ' - c ' , ' -- crypt ' ) : ( ' crypt ' , bool , None ) , 47 ( ' - d ' , ' -- decrypt ' ) : ( ' decrypt ' , bool , None ) , 48 ( ' - e ' , ' -- echo ' , ' -- fyo ' ) : ( ' echo ' , bool , None ) , 49 ( ' - l ' , ' -- lines ' ) : ( ' lines ' , int , ' 25 ' ) , 50 ( ' - i ' , ) : ( ' input ' , str , None ) , 51 ( ' - o ' , ) : ( ' output ' , str , None ) , 52 ( ' - p ' , ' -- pager ' , ' -- pgr ' ) : ( ' pager ' , str , ' /usr / bin/less ' ) , 53 ( ' - r ' , ' -- recipient ' ) : ( ' recipient ' , str , None ) 54 } 55 pp = PP ( indent=4 ) 56 sfs1 , lfs1 = construct_getopt_data( args ) 57 sfs2 , lfs2 = construct_getopt_data2( args ) 58 print " shortflags = " , pp.pformat ( sfs1 ) 59 print " longflags = \
" , pp.pformat( lfs1 ) 60 61 if ( sfs1 == sfs2 ) and ( lfs1 == lfs2 ) : print " \
>> test ok " 62 else : print " \
>> test failed "
In conclusion
While functools.partial( ) is certainly an interesting and cool addition to the python toolchest it would appear that it ’s not indispensible for functional style programming .
I would love to see examples or code snippets that are made possible and / or improved greatly by leveraging functools .

Scale of the investigation is immense , say police
The statement in full
The statement read out by Peter Clarke , the deputy Assistant Commissioner , was as follows :
This is the first time we have been able to release information about the progress of the investigation , since the morning of the arrests on 10th August .
This is not because we have wanted to withhold information from the public .
On the contrary , we have wanted to tell the public as much as we can about the terrorist threat .
But we have now reached the stage where I can give you more details .
I cannot give you a running commentary on the enquiry .
Enquiries will span the globe
DAC Peter Clarke
Neither can I give details of the specific evidence against individuals .
What I can give is an indication of the type of evidence that will be presented in support of the prosecution .
First , there is evidence from surveillance carried out before 10th August .
This includes important , indeed , highly significant video and audio recordings .
I can also tell you that since 10th August we have found bomb making equipment .
There are chemicals , including hydrogen peroxide , electrical components , documents and other items .
We have also found a number of video recordings - these are sometimes referred to as martyrdom videos .
This has all given us a clearer picture of the alleged plot .
However , the investigation is far from complete .
The scale is immense .
Enquiries will span the globe .
The enormity of the alleged plot will be matched only by our determination to follow every lead and line of enquiry .
From the computers alone , we have removed some 6,000 gigabytes of data
Peter Clarke
I shall try to give you an idea of the size and complexity of this investigation .
There have been 69 searches .
These have been in houses , flats and business premises , vehicles and open spaces .
As well as the bomb making equipment , we have found more than 400 computers , 200 mobile telephones and 8,000 items of removable storage media such as memory sticks , CDs and DVDs .
So far , from the computers alone , we have removed some 6,000 gigabytes of data .
The meticulous investigation of all this material will take many months .
All the data will be analysed .
There will be thousands of forensic examinations and comparisons .
Fingerprints , DNA , electronic data , handwriting comparisons , chemical analysis , and indeed the full range of forensic disciplines will be used .
The threat from terrorism is real , it is here , it is deadly and it is enduring
Peter Clarke
Aside from this particular case , we continue , working with the Security Service and others to investigate the threat from terrorism .
I would like to reassure the public that we are doing everything we can to keep you safe , for you to live your lives without being in constant fear .
However , we must be realistic .
The threat from terrorism is real , it is here , it is deadly and it is enduring .
As we all look for explanations , we cannot afford to be complacent and ignore the reality of what we face .
These are difficult times for all communities , but I can assure you that the police service will not flinch from its duty to protect the public .
More information will be given as and when it is appropriate to do so .

The French and Hindi 'd ' sounds were played to participants
Neuroscientists at University College London say they have more " white brain matter " in a part of the brain which processes sound .
Their brains could also be less symmetrical than others .
It is hoped the research , published in the journal Cerebral Cortex , could be used help to identify reasons for language difficulties .
Those involved in the trial - all native French speakers - were asked to distinguish between two similar sounds from different languages .
The first was the " d " sound found in their own language which is made by placing the tip of the tongue against the top teeth .
The second was a " d " found in Hindi , which is pronounced by curling the tongue upwards towards the roof of the mouth .
Both types of d were followed by the letter a , so the participants heard " da " .
The differences between the sounds are heard in the first 40 milliseconds .
Researchers tested the speed at which participants could process the information .
Those who identified more than 80 % of sounds correctly were then asked to listen to even more acoustically similar sounds .
Some of the fastest learners were able to tell these apart within a few minutes , while the slowest learners were only able to make random guesses at the less difficult stage after 20 minutes of training .
Predicting abilities
Dr Narly Golestani from UCL's Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience said the brain 's white matter was involved in the efficient processing of sound information into the lower levels of the brain - known as the primary cortex .
Its fibres are involved in connecting brain regions together .
Fast language learners had a greater volume , and that may mean they have more or perhaps thicker fibres , she said .
" The bigger picture is that we are starting to understand that brain shape and structure can be informative about people 's abilities or pathologies - why people are good at some things and not others is evident from these scans , " she said .
White brain matter is involved in connecting different parts of the brain together , and greater amounts of this could indicate an increased ability to process sound .
In faster learners , brain scans showed a greater volume of white matter in the left auditory region known as Heschl 's gyrus , where sound is processed .
And there was a difference in its position in the right brain hemisphere between faster and slower learners .
The researchers also found there was greater asymmetry in the volume of the parietal lobes , which are also involved in the processing of speech sound in the left hemisphere of the brain .
Previous research suggested that having a talent for music was linked to the structure of grey matter in the brain .
This latest research could be extended to other applications , Dr Narly said .
" We can start to make predictions regarding whether people will be good at something or not based on their brain structure , " she said , " or diagnose clinical problems . "
Brain structure predicts the learning of foreign speech sounds , by Narly Golestani , Nicolas Molko , Stanislas Dehaene , Denis LeBihan and Christophe Pallier , is published in the journal Cerebral Cortex .
As you may or may not know , 12 - year Contract -w/ - America breaker Charlie Bass is in the fight of his life against netroots candidate Paul Hodes .
Now that the polls are trending away from Bass , and his support among independents is weaker than it has ever been , the NRCC has been called in to bail his sorry butt out .
So in true GOP form , the NRCC decided to carpet bomb our state with robocalls that pretend to come from the Hodes campaign , while eventually providing misleading negative info .
So what , you say ?
Typical lowlife GOP sleaze tactic .
Well , there is a big difference here .
The NRCC was calling Granite Staters on the Do -Not - Call list , which is a violation of state law , carrying a penalty of $ 5,000 per violation .
To date , the NRCC admitted to 200,000 robocalls .
That means the NRCC is potentially facing a $ 100 million dollar penalty .
Maus with simulated turret during tests at Boblingen .
Panzerkampfwagen VIII
Maus at Kummersdorf , 1945 .
Captured Maus hull and turret at Krupp plant in Essen , 1945 .
German engineers , concerned over the effect of turns upon track performance , made this electric - powered , remote controlled , large - scale wooden replica .
A head - on view of the Mouse model affords an idea of the formidable appearance of the original Mice .
Note the exceptional width of the tracks .
Panzerkampfwagen VIII
Maus applied with camouflage paint .
The Mouse was designed to ford up to 45 feet of water .
To do so , the tank was made watertight .
A trunk was fitted over the hull escape hatch , and trunk extensions bolted over the engine vents .
The trunk contalned an escape ladder , and was divided into three sections , the number used varying with water depth .
A second Mouse supplied electricity to the fording Mouse motors through a cable attached to the rear , as shown .
Panzerkampfwagen VIII
Maus at Kummersdorf , 1945 .
Sectionalized plan view of the Mouse hull gives another view of many of the features shown in the first illustration .
The driver 's and radio operator 's seats ( left ) are flanked by the main fuel tanks .
Just to their rear is the main engine , flanked by air pumps and radiators .
Further to the rear is the generator , with ammunition stowage in the sponsons on either side .
In the sponson on the front right of the generator is the auxiliary engine , with storage batteries to its rear .
To the rear of the hull , also in the sponsons , are the motors furnishing the electric drive .
The actual transmission is in the deep part of hull between the motors , behind generator .
The Mouse was as vulnerable to close - in attack as any other tank , if not more so .
The large hull openings were a particular disadvantage .
Note their extent : the grills of the engine access hatch , the grilled air vents which flank it , and the grills under the rear of the turret , which cool the electric motors .
The auxiliary fuel tank on the rear was a considerable fire hazard .
The size and weight of the Mouse made necessary extremely wide tracks in relation to hull width .
This view also shows half of the engine air - cooling system ( left ) , and rear of right fuel tank , with an oil tank just to its left .
The development of super heavy tank started as early as 1941 , when Krupp started the studies of superheavy Soviet tanks .
In early 1942 , Krupp produced designs of Tiger - Maus ( VK7001 ) and PzKpfw VII Lowe ( VK7201 ) , but on March 5/6th of 1942 , order for heavier tank was placed .
Lowe never reached the prototype stage but paved the way for their successor 's development .
On March 21/ 22nd of 1942 , Porsche received the contract for new 100 - ton Panzer - VK10001 / Porsche Typ 205 .
On April 14/15th , it specified that new 100 - ton tank must carry at least 100 rounds of ammunition .
VK10001 was to be developed by Professor Ferdinand Porsche and Dr.Muller ( Krupp ) at the personal demand of Adolf Hitler made in May of 1942 .
He demanded 120 - ton " indestructible " super - heavy tank armed with high performance L/60 or L/72 gun .
The task of producing hulls , turrets and armament was given to Krupp , while Alkett was responsible for the assembly .
First specifications demanded that armament should consist of 150 mm L/40 gun and 20 mm MG151 / 20 heavy machine gun , while usage of 128 mm L/50 was under consideration .
It was stated that prototype should be operational before the Spring of 1943 .
On June 23rd of 1942 , Porsche provided their design for improved VK10001 armed with turret mounted 150 mm L/37 and 105 mm L/70 guns .
Porsche promised that first prototype will be ready in May of 1943 .
In December of 1942 , new armaments such as 150 mm gun , 127 mm naval gun , 128 mm Flak and the longest version of 128 mm were considered .
Also in the same month , it was restated that first vehicle was to be ready in Summer of 1943 , followed by the production 5 per month .
First official names VK10001 and Porsche Typ 205 ( " Mammoth " ) were used in April of 1942 , followed by Maeuschen ( Mousy ) in December of 1942 and Maus ( Mouse ) in February of 1943 .
In January of 1943 , Hitler decided that the Maeuschen was to be fitted with turret mounted with 128 mm and 75 mm guns , while turret mounted with 150 mm KwK 44 L/38 or 170 mm KwK 44 gun was to be designed for future use .
Specification for ammunition storage space were never met and decreased by further modifications .
From the designs emerged 188 tonnes heavy monster .
On May 1st of 1943 , wooden mockup of the Maus was presented to Adolf Hitler , who agreed on production and ordered series of 150 to be produced .
On November 4 of 1943 , development of Maus was to be ceased and only one was to be completed for evaluation .
In October of 1943 , original order placed by Hitler for 150 vehicles was cancelled .
On December 24th of 1943 , first turretless prototype was completed by Alkett and was put to the extensive tests .
During the tests , the Maus could hardly move due to its enormous weight and power / weight ratio .
First prototype V1 ( Maus I ) , was powered by modified Daimler - Benz MB 509 ( developed from DB 603 aircraft engine ) , which could not provide planned speed of 20 km / h but only 13 km / h in ideal conditions .
Also problems arouse with suspension system which had to be modified in order to take the weight of the vehicle .
Another problem that emerged from its weight , was that simply there were no bridges able to take the its weight .
To overcome this problem Maus had to be provided with a " snorkel " arrangement which allowed it to submerse to the maximum depth of 8 meters .
In December of 1943 , V1 was fitted with ( Belastungsgewicht ) simulated turret ( representing the weight of the turret ) and was tested .
Maus I was applied with camouflage paint and marked with red star and hammer and sickle disguised as a captured Russian vehicle .
In March of 1944 , second prototype V2 ( Maus II ) which differed in numerous details from V1 was produced .
V2 lacked the powerplant , which was fitted in mid 1944 .
On April 9th of 1944 , Krupp produced the turret , which in June of 1944 , was delivered and then mounted on V2 and tested .
Krupp produced a turret mounted with 128 mm KwK 44 L/55 gun with coaxial 75 mm KwK 44 L/36.5 gun and 7.92 mm MG34 , providing the Maus with an enormous firepower .
Maus ' main gun could penetrate front , side and rear armor ( at 30 degrees from vertical ) of Sherman , Cromwell , Churchill , T - 34/85 and JS - 2 tanks at ranges of 3500 + meters .
Turret included mounts for rangefinder ( by Zeiss ) , but was not fully finished and some of the missing components were shipped later on .
Maus I was to be fitted with Krupp 's second turret but it was never delivered and it remained fitted with simulated turret .
On July 25th of 1944 , Krupp reported that two hulls will be available soon and two more later on .
On July 27th of 1944 , Krupp was ordered to scrap those four hulls .
On August 19th of 1944 , Krupp informed Porsche that it was order to stop further work on Maus .
In September of 1944 , second prototype started its tests .
It was installed with Daimler - Benz MB 517 diesel engine that made little difference in comparison with previously used engine .
Advanced electric steering system was used to steer the vehicle .
Its running gear designed by Skoda , consisted of double - wheeled trucks supported by twelve return rollers with 1100 mm wide tracks .
The crew had to be provided with oxygen supplied by built - on fans / ventilators when all the hatches were closed .n order to transport the Maus , special 14 - axle railroad transport car ( Verladewagon ) was produced by Graz - Simmering - Pauker Works in Vienna .
From mid January to early October of 1944 , trials took place at armored vehicle proving grounds in Kummersdorf ( near Berlin ) and then at Porsche proving grounds at Boblingen .
Tests were long , delayed by engine failures and production delays caused by Allied bomber attacks on German factories .
During tests , it was determined that in case of any failure each Maus would have to be towed by two other Maus tanks .
It is also reported that Germans worked on Flakzwilling 8.8 cm auf Maus , which was to be Maus mounted with a modified turret housing two 88 mm Flak 43 guns and used as heavy Flakpanzer .
Some sources state that according to Porsche , Hitler 's aim for the Maus was to plug holes in the Atlantic coastal defenses on the Western Front , where it 's limited range and mobility would n't have been too much of a hindrance .
The popular version states that V2 prototype was blown up by the personnel at proving grounds in Kummersdorf , while some sources state that actually V2 saw combat while defending the facility at Kummersdorf .
When war ended , almost finished V1 turret and third hull were found at Krupp facilities in Essen .
Overall , Maus was an interesting design but it would be of limited combat value because of its poor mobility and heavy weight making it more of a mobile fortification rather than a super tank .
One fully assembled example ( V2 turret mounted on V1 hull ) was tested at Kubinka in 1951 / 52 and can be seen today in the Museum of Armored Forces in Kubinka ( near Moscow ) in Russia .
ARMAMENTFor the main armament , a pea-shooter like an 88 - mm gun was ignored .
Selected instead was the powerful 128 - mm tank and antitank gun , which was later to be replaced by a 150 - mm piece 38 calibers in length .
( The standard German medium field howitzer 15 cm s.F.H. 18 is only 29.5 calibers in length . )
Instead of mounting a 7.9 - mm machine gun coaxially , the Mouse was to have a 75 - mm antitank gun 76 calibers in length next to the 128 - or 150 - mm gun .
A machine cannon for antiaircraft was to be mounted in the turret roof , along with a smoke grenade projector .
SizeIn size , the Mouse was considerably larger than any German tank .
Its length of 33 feet made it nearly 50 percent longer than the King Tiger .
Because of rail transport considerations .
its width was kept to 12 feet ( that of the Royal Tiger and Tiger ) .
A 12 - foot height made it a considerable target .
In order to reduce the ground pressure so that the tank could have some mobility , the tracks had to be made very wide — all of 43.3 inches .
With the tracks taking up over 7 of its 12 feet of width , the Mouse presents a very strange appearance indeed from either a front or rear view .
With such a track width , and a ground contact of 19 feet 3 inches , the Mouse keeps its ground pressure down to about 20 pounds per square inch — about twice that of the original Tiger .
POWER PLANTSDesigning an engine sufficiently powerful to provide motive power for the mammoth fighting vehicle was a serious problem .
Though the Germans tried two engines , both around 1,200 horsepower ( as compared to the Royal Tiger 's 590 ) , neither could be expected to provide a speed of more than 10 to 12 miles an hour .
The Mouse can , however , cross a 14 - foot trench and climb a 2 - foot 4 - inch step .
Whatever the military possibilities of the Mouse might be , it certainly gave designers space in which to run hog wild on various features which they had always been anxious to install in tanks .
One of these gadgets was an auxiliary power plant .
This plant permitted pressurizing of the crew compartment , which in turn meant better submersion qualities when fording , and good antigas protection .
Auxiliary power also permitted heating and battery recharging .
Underwater ?
One of the fancy installations was equipment designed for fording in water 45 feet deep — a characteristic made necessary by weight limits of bridges .
Besides sealing of hatches and vents , aided by pressurizing , submersion was to be made possible by the installation of a giant cylindrical chimney or trunk , so large that it could serve as a crew escape passage if need be .
The tanks were intended to ford in pairs , one powering the electric transmission of the other by cable .
Transmission
The electric transmission was in itself an engineering experiment of some magnitude .
This type of transmission had first been used on the big Elephant assault gun-tank destroyer in 1943 , and was considered by some eminent German designers as the best type of transmission — if perfected — for heavy tanks .
Another interesting feature of the Mouse from the engineerig point of view was the return from torsion bar suspension — such as was used in the Pz. Kpfw .
III , the Panther , the Tiger , and the King Tiger — to a spring suspension .
An improved torsion bar design had been considered for the Mouse , but was abandoned in favor of a volute spring type suspension .
Whereas such a heavy tank might conceivably have had some limited military usefulness in breakthrough operations , it was no project for Nazi Germany experimentation in 1943 , 1944 , and 1945 .
For not only did German authorities waste time of engineers and production facilities on the two test models , but they even went so far as to construct a special flat car for rail transport .
The drawbacks inherent in such a heavy tank are patent .
Weigh not only denies practically every bridge in existence to the Mouse , but it impedes rail movement unless railways are properly reinforced at bridges , culverts , and other weak points .
Fording to 45 - foot depths would have solved many of the stream - crossing problems in Europe , but it seems that the Mouse could actually cross in water no deeper than 26 feet .
Though sitting in a rolling fortress , the six men of the Mouse crew are practically as blind as in any tank .
Because of low speed and high silhouette their vehicle would be most vulnerable to hits .
Since it is reasonable to suppose that heavily fortified , static positions suitable for attack by a Mouse would also be fitted with very heavy , high - velocity guns capable of antitank fire , the even occasional combat value of the Mouse comes into question .
The German 128 - mm Pak 44 ( also known in modified forms as the 12.8 cm Pak 80 ) is reputed to be able to penetrate 7 inches of armor at 2,000 yards .
Since the Germans actually had their Pak 44 in service in 1945 , when the Mouse was not yet in the production stage , it would appear that the Germans had the antidote before the giant tanks were ready .
Moreover , in the later days of the war , a rolling colossus like a Mouse would have been almost impossible to conceal , and would have fallen an easy prey to air power .
The psychological factor thus appears to have played a large part in the demand for construction of the Mouse .
The German Army would never have desired such a tank , especially in 1942 when its design was apparently initiated .
On the other hand , it would have made lurid headlines and Sunday supplement copy in both Allied and German press circles .
But whatever the public reaction might have been , it seems questionable that the Mouse could have exerted any psychological effect on Russian , British , or American front - line troops unless the Germans possessed almost overwhelming strength , as they did when they crushed the Maginot Line in 1940 .
In 1944 - 45 it would have been too easy a mark for Allied gun and planes the first instant it appeared .

The future looks bright
by Richard Dawkins Language can help to shape the way we think about the world .
Richard Dawkins welcomes an attempt to raise consciousness about atheism by co-opting a word with cheerful associations I once read a science - fiction story in which astronauts voyaging to a distant star were waxing homesick : " Just to think that it 's springtime back on Earth ! "
You may not immediately see what 's wrong with that , so ingrained is our unconscious northern hemisphere chauvinism .
" Unconscious " is exactly right .
That is where consciousness - raising comes in .
I suspect it is for a deeper reason than gimmicky fun that , in Australia and New Zealand , you can buy maps of the world with the south pole on top .
Now , would n't that be an excellent thing to pin to our class - room walls ?
What a splendid consciousness - raiser .
Day after day , the children would be reminded that north has no monopoly on up .
The map would intrigue them as well as raise their consciousness .
They 'd go home and tell their parents .
The feminists taught us about consciousness - raising .
I used to laugh at " him or her " , and at " chairperson " , and I still try to avoid them on aesthetic grounds .
But I recognise the power and importance of consciousness - raising .
I now flinch at " one man one vote " .
My consciousness has been raised .
Probably yours has too , and it matters .
I used to deplore what I regarded as the tokenism of my American atheist friends .
They were obsessed with removing " under God " from the Pledge of Allegiance ( it was inserted as late as 1954 ) , whereas I cared more about the chauvinistic nastiness of pledging allegiance to a flag in the first place .
They would cross out " In God we Trust " on every dollar bill that passed through their hands ( again , it was inserted only in 1956 ) , whereas I worried more about the tax - free dollars amassed by bouffant - haired televangelists , fleecing gullible old ladies of their life savings .
My friends would risk neighbourhood ostracism to protest at the unconstitutionality of Ten Commandments posters on classroom walls .
" But it 's only words , " I would expostulate .
" Why get so worked up about mere words , when there 's so much else to object to ? "
Now I 'm having second thoughts .
Words are not trivial .
They matter because they raise consciousness .
My favourite consciousness - raising effort is one I have mentioned many times before ( and I make no apology , for consciousness - raising is all about repetition ) .
A phrase like " Catholic child " or " Muslim child " should clang furious bells of protest in the mind , just as we flinch when we hear " one man one vote " .
Children are too young to know their religious opinions .
Just as you can't vote until you are 18 , you should be free to choose your own cosmology and ethics without society 's impertinent presumption that you will automatically inherit your parents ' .
We 'd be aghast to be told of a Leninist child or a neo - conservative child or a Hayekian monetarist child .
So is n't it a kind of child abuse to speak of a Catholic child or a Protestant child ?
Especially in Northern Ireland and Glasgow where such labels , handed down over generations , have divided neighbourhoods for centuries and can even amount to a death warrant ?
Catholic child ?
Flinch .
Protestant child ?
Squirm .
Muslim child ?
Shudder .
Everybody 's consciousness should be raised to this level .
Occasionally a euphemism is needed , and I suggest " Child of Jewish ( etc ) parents " .
When you come down to it , that 's all we are really talking about anyway .
Just as the upside - down ( northern hemisphere chauvinism again : flinch ! ) map from New Zealand raises consciousness about a geographical truth , children should hear themselves described not as " Christian children " but as " children of Christian parents " .
This in itself would raise their consciousness , empower them to make up their own minds and choose which religion , if any , they favour , rather than just assume that religion means " same beliefs as parents " .
I could well imagine that this linguistically coded freedom to choose might lead children to choose no religion at all .
Please go out and work at raising people 's consciousness over the words they use to describe children .
At a dinner party , say , if ever you hear a person speak of a school for Islamic children , or Catholic children ( you can read such phrases daily in newspapers ) , pounce : " How dare you ?
You would never speak of a Tory child or a New Labour child , so how could you describe a child as Catholic ( Islamic , Protestant etc ) ? "
With luck , everybody at the dinner party , next time they hear one of those offensive phrases , will flinch , or at least notice and the meme will spread .
A triumph of consciousness - raising has been the homosexual hijacking of the word " gay " .
I used to mourn the loss of gay in ( what I still think of as ) its true sense .
But on the bright side ( wait for it ) gay has inspired a new imitator , which is the climax of this article .
Gay is succinct , uplifting , positive : an " up " word , where homosexual is a down word , and queer , faggot and pooftah are insults .
Those of us who subscribe to no religion ; those of us whose view of the universe is natural rather than supernatural ; those of us who rejoice in the real and scorn the false comfort of the unreal , we need a word of our own , a word like " gay " .
You can say " I am an atheist " but at best it sounds stuffy ( like " I am a homosexual " ) and at worst it inflames prejudice ( like " I am a homosexual " ) .
Paul Geisert and Mynga Futrell , of Sacramento , California , have set out to coin a new word , a new " gay " .
Like gay , it should be a noun hijacked from an adjective , with its original meaning changed but not too much .
Like gay , it should be catchy : a potentially prolific meme .
Like gay , it should be positive , warm , cheerful , bright .
Bright ?
Yes , bright .
Bright is the word , the new noun .
I am a bright .
You are a bright .
She is a bright .
We are the brights .
Is n't it about time you came out as a bright ?
Is he a bright ?
I can't imagine falling for a woman who was not a bright .
The website http://www.celebatheists.com/ suggests numerous intellectuals and other famous people are brights .
Brights constitute 60 % of American scientists , and a stunning 93 % of those scientists good enough to be elected to the elite National Academy of Sciences ( equivalent to Fellows of the Royal Society ) are brights .
Look on the bright side : though at present they can't admit it and get elected , the US Congress must be full of closet brights .
As with gays , the more brights come out , the easier it will be for yet more brights to do so .
People reluctant to use the word atheist might be happy to come out as a bright .
Geisert and Futrell are very insistent that their word is a noun and must not be an adjective .
" I am bright " sounds arrogant .
" I am a bright " sounds too unfamiliar to be arrogant : it is puzzling , enigmatic , tantalising .
It invites the question , " What on earth is a bright ? "
And then you 're away : " A bright is a person whose world view is free of supernatural and mystical elements .
The ethics and actions of a bright are based on a naturalistic world view . "
" You mean a bright is an atheist ? "
" Well , some brights are happy to call themselves atheists .
Some brights call themselves agnostics .
Some call themselves humanists , some freethinkers .
But all brights have a world view that is free of supernaturalism and mysticism . "
" Oh , I get it .
It 's a bit like ' gay ' .
So , what 's the opposite of a bright ?
What would you call a religious person ? "
" What would you suggest ? "
Of course , even though we brights will scrupulously insist that our word is a noun , if it catches on it is likely to follow gay and eventually re-emerge as a new adjective .
And when that happens , who knows , we may finally get a bright president .

[ First published in The Guardian , June 21 , 2003 ]
At the same time , he said , their differences allow them to approach each problem from a different perspective .
“ I find myself feeling out of balance or awkward without him there to bounce things off of , ” he said .
The third Hindenburg experiment would theoretically test the notion that the original craft ’s fabric had been treated with a thermite - like substance .
The crew had mixed about 15 pounds of actual thermite , which is highly explosive , into the fabric .
For this test , no one was allowed near the building .
Yellowish brown smoke billowed out and tore at throats and burned eyes .
On the monitors , the flames were blindingly bright .
White sparks were thrown far and wide .
It was all over in moments .
The purpose of the third burn — aside from an excuse to have a truly awesome conflagration — was to suggest what the Hindenburg might have looked like if the chemicals used to coat its skin had actually been thermite instead of a chemical cousin .
“ The skin of the Hindenburg was not coated in 100 pounds of thermite , ” Mr. Hyneman said .
Mr. Savage watched the replay again .
“ Dude , there ’s no doubt that does not look like the Hindenburg . ”
The sun was setting as they finished the day ’s shoot .
Mr. Savage ’s face was smudged , and both men seemed exhausted .
Mr. Hyneman and Mr. Savage set fire to the remaining tub of thermite paint for the cameras , and then the crew packed up .
Earlier in the day , Mr. Hyneman said that he sometimes worried about “ glorifying explosions , ” which could send the wrong message to young and impressionable viewers .
“ If I had my druthers , we would n’t be blowing stuff up , ” he said .
Mr. Savage appeared behind him .
“ But then we would n’t have a show , ” he said with a cackle , and darted away .
On 30 November 2006 , Pakistan announced what must count as one of the more far - reaching educational reforms for a generation : from September 2007 , English will replace Urdu as the language in which science and mathematics will be taught in all state schools .
At a stroke , the government has chosen to reverse the policy introduced two decades ago under the military regime of General Zia ul - Haq ( 1977 - 88 ) , whereby English is not formally taught in state schools until a child reaches the age of 10 .
The new policy is good in principle , because higher education , research and access to better - paying jobs need a degree of proficiency in English that pupils from Urdu- language schools tend not to have .
Moreover , introducing English alongside Urdu and other regional languages from the earliest years will undoubtedly make a difference to the lives of many .
But whether the government can make the policy work is another matter .
Like the Zia ul - Haq initiative , it will need at least one complete ten - year cycle of primary and secondary schooling before it becomes embedded in the education system .
Pakistani government officials , however , have a habit of making life more difficult than it already is .
Of all the places in the world they could have chosen , the new language policy was outlined at a press conference in Washington DC .
This was the same event at which the Bush administration announced $ 100 million in education aid to Pakistan .

" Millennium Development Goals : back to school "
( August 2006 )
" Physics in revolution " ( October 2006 )
" The upside of down " ( 29 November 2006 )
In what would have been a carefully - scripted event , two senior administration officials ( under - secretary Nicholas Burns and education secretary Margaret Spellings ) linked the aid to counter - terrorism goals .
Pakistan 's education minister Javed Ashraf Qazi seemed to reiterate this when he said : " Today we have realised that we need to educate our people , otherwise illiterate masses become ready recruits for all sorts of unhealthy activities . "
Some commentators have understandably taken this as a sign of American fingerprints over Pakistan 's education reforms .
The facts are somewhat different .
The US money will go towards an education reform plan that was authored in Islamabad , and be an additional part of a $ 1.5 billion package of grants and loans that Pakistan has been receiving towards education reforms , and which were announced soon after General Pervez Musharraf took power in 1999 .
The US is a relatively small donor to these reforms , dwarfed as it is by the World Bank , the Asian Development Bank and the countries of the European Union .
The reforms are well underway and include ramping - up the numbers of trained teachers , upgrading failing schools , reviewing the curriculum , subsidising the costs of textbooks and uniforms , raising adult literacy and getting more young people into higher education .
The private option
The total aid package may seem large , but it is nowhere near what is needed if Pakistan is to achieve its Millennium Development Goal of universal primary education before 2015 .
According to the education ministry 's own data some 17.5 million children are expected to be in primary school by 2015 , for which some $ 17 billion will be needed to put them through school .
The government reckons it can find $ 13 billion from existing sources .
But it is at least $ 4 billion short , and most likely will need at least twice as much .
Observers and critics of the government ought to start asking Qazi where this extra money is to be found .
They could do something better and ask him whether alternative strategies are worth thinking about .
There is good reason to ask .
A paper by the World Bank ( A Dime A Day : The Possibilities and Limits of Private Schooling in Pakistan , 1 November 2006 ) suggests that additional investment in public sector education could be leading to diminishing returns .
The paper shows that overall enrolment rates in government schools have stood still over time .
In contrast , enrolment in private schools has shot up , with the steepest increases in rural areas where you would least expect this to happen .
Overall , more than one - third of primary school - age children are in private schools .
The authors understandably ask whether it could be possible to raise this percentage further at little or no extra cost to parents .
Why are private schools so popular among Pakistan 's poorest , when in developed countries , less than 5 % of families on low incomes send children to private schools ?
A major factor is educational quality .
Worldwide , privately - funded schools tend to offer a significantly better quality of education compared to state - funded ones .
In Pakistan , however , the difference between the two amounts to a chasm .
Pakistan 's state schools are notoriously bad .
Some figures from the largest Punjab province are indicative .
Some 3,500 schools do not have a building ; of those that do , 4,000 are classed as being " dangerous " ; 29,000 schools have no electricity ; 14,000 have no drinking water ; 22,000 do not have a toilet ; 4,000 consist of a single classroom ; and fewer than 100 secondary schools have science labs .
A second reason for their popularity is that private schools offer better facilities , improved teaching , and early introduction of English compared with state schools .
A third reason is expense .
Pakistan 's private schools offer incredible value for money .
The World Bank has worked out that the median fee per pupil comes to $ 24 per year .
Fees are kept low in part because teachers are predominantly female , who are paid less than men would earn in the same job .
A hard choice
If there is demand from parents , and the ability exists to pay towards costs , common sense suggests more needs to be done to develop private schools and to bring them under some sort of regulatory framework .
There are excellent initiatives already underway such as The Citizens Foundation , a community group that builds and maintains good schools in deprived areas .
One of the benefits of such a strategy for international donors is that it does n't require billions of dollars to build and maintain infrastructure .
Instead , targeted assistance could be used to purchase expertise in teacher - training , schools management , inspections and parent / staff associations .
Pakistan might be a nuclear power , but half of its people cannot read or write , and at least one third of the nation 's children are not in primary school .
Admittedly , these figures are an improvement on the past , but they still lag behind India ( 83 % primary - school enrolment ) , Sri Lanka ( 90 % ) , even Nepal ( 70 % ) .
And they are behind government targets for 100 % primary enrolment by 2015 .
Private schools can never be the only solution to Pakistan 's education crisis , and they will never be affordable to the very poorest .
But they remain enormously popular among lower - income families .
A strategy to develop them further will in the very least help Pakistan to advance towards its target of education for all .

BAGHDAD , Dec. 22 — As the United States debates what to do in Iraq , this country ’s Shiite majority has been moving toward its own solution : making the capital its own .
Large portions of Baghdad have become Shiite in recent months , as militias press their fight against Sunni militants deeper into the heart of the capital , displacing thousands of Sunni residents .
At least 10 neighborhoods that a year ago were mixed Sunni and Shiite are now almost entirely Shiite , according to residents , American and Iraqi military commanders and local officials .
For the first years of the war , Sunni militants were dominant , forcing Shiites out of neighborhoods and systematically killing bakers , barbers and trash collectors , who were often Shiites .
But starting in February , after the bombing of a shrine in the city of Samarra , Shiite militias began to strike back , pushing west from their strongholds and redrawing the sectarian map of the capital , home to a quarter of Iraq ’s population .
The Shiite - dominated government publicly condemns violence against Sunnis and says it is trying to stop the militias that carry it out .
But the attacks have continued unabated , and Sunnis have grown suspicious .
Prepare to be disturbed .

There 's a new page about my favorite illustrators , a page about my Java games ( although it 's difficult to get Java applets to run in browsers nowadays ) , I 've added a cake recipe ( in Swedish ) , and there 's a new image in the portfolio .
I 've made some corrections to the site code ; some minor functions are still missing , but as of this update , the site seems to be working more or less as it should , and I 'll start concentrating on adding more content .

Researchers who used five different medical imaging techniques to study the brain activity of 764 people , including those with Alzheimer ’s disease , those on the brink of dementia , and healthy individuals , have found that the areas of the brain that young , healthy people use when daydreaming are the same areas that fail in people who have Alzheimer ’s disease .
On the basis of their data , the researchers are proposing a new hypothesis that suggests that Alzheimer ’s disease may be due to abnormalities in the regions of the brain that operate the “ default state . ”
This is the term used to describe the cognitive state people defer to when musing , daydreaming , or thinking to themselves .
Brain regions active during default mental states in young adults
( shown in blue on the background brain ) reveal remarkable correlation
with those regions showing Alzheimer ’s disease pathology as observed by
novel human molecular imaging techniques that can visualize amyloid
plaques ( shown in red on the foreground brain ) .
Writing in the August 24 , 2005 , issue of the Journal of Neuroscience , the researchers state that “ the default activity patterns of the brain may , over many years , augment a metabolic - or activity - dependent cascade that participates in Alzheimer ’s disease pathology . ”
“ The regions of the brain we tend to use in our default state when we are young are very similar to the regions where plaques form in older people with Alzheimer ’s disease , ” said the lead author of the study , Randy L. Buckner , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute ( HHMI ) investigator at Washington University in St. Louis .
“ This is quite a remarkable convergence that we did not expect , ” Buckner adds .
The new findings are important because they could help scientists and clinicians identify and understand the beginnings of what is probably a cascade of events that ultimately leads to Alzheimer’s .
The most common form of dementia among older people , Alzheimer ’s is characterized outwardly by the erosion of language , thought and memory .
Within the brains of people with Alzheimer ’s disease , abnormal clumps of plaque and tangled bundles of fibers form and characterize the physical manifestation of the disease , which may affect as many as 4.5 million Americans .
The causes of the disease are unknown .
The availability of powerful imaging techniques and the ability to merge different sets of imaging data through new bioinformatics and statistical methods enabled Buckner and his team to construct a picture of Alzheimer ’s from molecular changes to the structural and functional manifestations of the disease .
In the process , the team unexpectedly observed that the regions of the brain that light up when we slip into comfortable patterns of thought are the same as those that , later in life , exhibit the disabling clumps of plaque characteristic of Alzheimer ’s , a disease that most frequently manifests itself after age 60 .
That remarkable correlation , said Buckner , suggests that dementia may be a consequence of the everyday function of the brain .
“ It may be the normal cognitive function of the brain that leads to Alzheimer ’s later in life , ” said Buckner .
“ This was not a relationship that we had even considered .
The hypothesis is that the cascade of events that leads to Alzheimer ’s begins at young adulthood . ”
Scientists have long known that when the mind is not concentrated on a task — reading , engaging in conversation or solving a math problem , for example — it switches to a default mode , a state of mind where we may muse , daydream or retrieve pleasant memories .
When a young person is asked to concentrate on a specific task , they are easily able to shut off the default mode — and the corresponding regions of the brain that run this mode .
With the help of powerful imaging technologies such as positron emission tomography ( PET ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , scientists , including Buckner ’s HHMI team , have begun to map the activity of the brain in its different states , including the default state .
Among the observations they are making is that when a person who has clinical Alzheimer ’s disease is asked to concentrate on a specific task , the default mode actually becomes more active — rather than showing less activity , as it would in a young , healthy adult .
The default state , according to Buckner , is characterized by metabolic activity in specific regions of the brain , notably the posterior and cortical regions .
“ These regions were active in the default states in young adults and also showed amyloid ( plaque ) deposition in older adults with Alzheimer ’s disease , ” the researchers write in the new Journal of Neuroscience paper .
“ The key insight is that brain activity and metabolism are not uniform across the brain , ” Buckner said .
“ When we looked at people on the cusp of dementia , we saw a loss of brain tissue in the regions we predicted it would occur , ” based on our observations of metabolism .
Insight from the new study may help explain why the memory systems of the human brain are vulnerable .
“ We appear to use memory systems often in our default states .
This may help us to plan and solve problems .
Maybe it helps us be creative .
But it may also have metabolic consequences , ” Buckner explained .
The newfound correlation may also have future clinical implications as Alzheimer ’s is typically diagnosed when it is too late to intervene .
To develop and administer effective treatments , clinicians will need to figure out ways to detect the disease in its earliest stages , said William Klunk , associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh and a co-author of the Journal of Neuroscience paper .
“ You have to get to this pathology before it has its biggest effect , before it has done its damage , ” said Klunk , who has developed techniques for imaging the amyloid plaques in Alzheimer ’s patients .
The findings reported in the new study , he said , suggest that there is now the potential to begin to trace the patterns of the disease and develop methods to detect it before the clinical symptoms set in .
Buckner emphasized that the notion of a causative relationship between everyday metabolic functions of the brain and Alzheimer ’s remains a hypothesis .
However , new studies may help “ show if amyloid ( plaque ) deposition is really dependent on metabolism .
Can we find a biologically plausible reason for how metabolism causes Alzheimer ’s disease ? ”
Moreover , looking to see if the phenomenon varies or is the same among many individuals will be required to firm up the link between brain metabolism in early life and Alzheimer ’s pathology later in life .
Understanding variation may also help us to explain why some people are at high risk for Alzheimer ’s disease .
“ We are very interested in exploring these new observations to understand who is at risk and who is protected from Alzheimer ’s , ” said Buckner .
In addition to Buckner and Klunk , authors of the Journal of Neuroscience article include Abraham Z. Snyder , Benjamin J. Shannon , Gina LaRossa , Rimmon Sachs , Anthony F. Fotenos , Yvette I. Sheline , John C. Morris and Mark A. Mintun , all of Washington University ; and Chester Mathis of the University of Pittsburgh .

Subject : Retirement
Four weeks from this date , on April 15 , 1970 , I shall be retiring , and this constitutes my four weeks notice in conformance with company standards for professionally classed employees .
I realize that retirement is an odd term to use at my age , but it is the only one that can validly be applied .
The circumstances of my life are such that I need only work half the year for my physical support , and rather than spend or hoard the excess for 25 years , which is the usual custom , I would rather take my semi retirement in easy stages while I am still young enough to make good use of it .
It is really sad that the only work choice open to people is that of the 40 - hour / 50 - week year , or none at all .
There are so many reasonable combinations which might be put together that each of us could live his life in a human , rewarding fashion if the alternatives were actually available .
Instead , in an economy that brags about its affluence and leisure , we are working at the same mad pace that was required in far more austere periods of our history .
This is something which exists because each and all of us permit it to exist , as though we do not run our own lives or our own business functions .
A business is no more than a collection of individuals , and when they decide to control their own destiny , they shall .
Fortunately , there are still personal alternatives available , and this is mine — semi retirement .
Most Sincerely ,
Irv Thomas
Barely eight months before the above resignation was written , I had arrived in Seattle with less than $ 400 in my pocket and the suit on my back .
I did not know a soul in town , and had no idea where or when I was going to find a job .
I had just left a shattered marriage behind me in California ... along with all my worldly possessions and a job paying $ 12,500 per year .
That my wife and I had been living to the hilt of our income was evidenced by the small amount of cash I had brought with me .
And yet , here I am , loftily telling my boss where he can stuff it because I do n't need any more of his filthy loot !
Fantastic ?
In a way , yes ... but not nearly so fantastic as the way all of us have been thoroughly conned into the idea that we really have to work all year to stay alive and pay our bills .
It just is n't true , and I 'm going to prove it and show you the way out .
Though it may be very hard for confirmed rat-racers to believe , neither economics nor social pressure is keeping you from living the kind of life you 'd like for a large part of the year ; of having the time to develop the creative or academic activity to which you would really prefer to be devoting your life .
The price is a willingness to accept less income , and that 's what this article is all about .
Three thousand dollars per year is not a poverty level existence for a single person , even in the inner city .
You who need five , eight or ten thousand a year are victims of a cluster of addictions that can be broken .
There are easy and hard ways of breaking habits .
There are even pleasant ways .
This is not a theoretical concept .
I have lived through the breaking of these addictions , and although some of it hurt , I have learned how to keep my balance .
I can pass many of the creative tricks on to you .
There are withdrawal pains to be sure , but be consoled — they are only temporary and there are many ways of easing them .
How I Entered Semi Retirement
My own way out of the morass was forced upon me .
The costs of resettling , getting a job and just the barest of living essentials drove my pocket cash into the ground in no time at all .
I had isolated myself completely and intended to stay that way , so there was no answer but to dig in hard and just hang on .
I laid out what I called a ' bare bones ' three month plan for myself , and just counted the days , knowing that if I stuck with it , I 'd be okay .
My monthly allowance was :
The rest of my $ 400 cash on hand went to bills I had left back in California , and toward paying for a job referral .
This was a prudent investment since it enabled me to get my first paycheck before I was reduced to begging in the streets .
I did live through it .
I 'll spare the details , for they are incorporated in the rest of the article , but I should say here that a good portion of my idle time was spent planning the luxurious life I was going to live after the ordeal was over :
How I was going to get a brand new VW bus and outlandishly outfit it as a live - in camper .
But a very strange thing happened before the three months were up : I realized that I was no longer hurting ; I no longer had withdrawal pains .
I had actually adapted to this spartan schedule and felt almost as fully provided for as back in the days when I used to have trouble keeping my monthly expenses within an $ 850 per month net income !
- Advertisement -
At first this was merely curious — an interesting little insight into the intricacies of the human mind .
Then the real implications slowly began to dawn on me .
Two hundred and fifty per month is $ 3,000 per year , which equates to about 4.5 working months at the salary I was earning .
Wow !
True , it did n't provide for a few occasional extra expenses like doctor bills , a new suit , and perhaps something set aside for real emergencies — but how little more that would require !
I began to see the real nature of what I had achieved — a kind of independence that all my remaining years in the system would never have been able to buy .
Some interesting relationships can be found .
Relatively small increments in monthly income will release each month up to about six , but beyond that point the required increase for each free month becomes more prohibitive as you go up .
This is an automatic guard against ambition creeping into the picture .
Ambition is simply not worth it .
Also , strange as it seems , the less you are earning , the easier it is to gain free time !
At $ 300 / month , each $ 25 you knock off your living expenses gives you a free month , while at $ 600 / month it takes a $ 50 reduction to gain another free month .
I have since cut my monthly costs to $ 220 by eliminating the TV ( it turned out there were not many lonely hours ) , newspapers ( I 'm happier and have much more time without them ) , and cigarettes ( this just seemed to drop of its own weight when I got the bicycle . )
And there is still some slush left .
I 'm convinced that I can do quite well without the phone , for instance .
It may sound , by now , as though I 'm leading a sterile , ascetic existence — but nothing could be farther from the truth .
I do n't mean to imply that I am only spending $ 220 per month , but merely that this is the cost of my necessary support .
A few well - chosen and inexpensive activities keep my hours well filled , and my life is richer and more rewarding right now than it has ever been within my memory .
No small part of this is the immediate prospect of a half - year of total removal from the rigors of the rat-race .
At this point you are probably wondering what is the big secret .
How is it done ?
Well , it 's really a series of little secrets — a kind of mental tug of war with yourself .
You keep the lid on until you think something is going to explode , and then you let off a bit of steam — but in another direction .
That is to say , you reward yourself when the pressure is too great ... but in such a way that you move in the direction you want to go instead of sliding back in the direction you are trying to get away from .
It is difficult to select an illustration , because the reward must be a very personalized thing , and if I give an example that does n't happen to turn you on , the point may be lost .
But I shall try anyhow , so keep that caution in mind .
During the period I was going through automobile withdrawal , and before I had my bicycle to compensate , the dreary weekends of relative confinement started to weigh heavy .
All that beautiful northwest country around me , and I could not get out to it .
Renting a car would be far too expensive ; talking a friend into a country drive would only rub in the deprivation I was going through and bus rides leave me cold .
But then ferry boats are something else again !
Seattle has long ferry routes out to country islands in the Sound , and for a cost of just a few dollars for the whole day , I was in another world .
I returned much refreshed and laughing to the skies at those poor people busting up the freeways to get away from town !
That was a piece of creative withdrawal — I removed the pressure , at the same time moving closer to the goal .
I also fortified myself with knowledge of a relief valve that I could call upon again .
Replacement is another technique .
This is really a longer term reward that fills the gap left by something you 've given up .
Let 's say you 've got the habit of fraternizing down at the corner bar every Friday night and you always drop ten or fifteen dollars before Saturday morning rolls around .
So you make the Great Sacrifice .
Don't , for God 's sake , try to sit home on Friday night with a book or TV .
You 'll be back in the bar within two weeks .
Find something you 've always wanted to do that involves other people , for that is really what you 're looking for .
Try a neighborhood discussion group or volleyball at the high school gym .
Even if it , too , costs money .
The important thing is that you 're breaking an addiction , and each one you break gives you that much more confidence .
Then there is the principle of making it easy on yourself ; which is sort of an overall guideline .
In the first flush of determination ; it is so easy to go plowing ahead and damn the torpedoes .
But it 's a lot wiser to consider the expected consequences of every move you make , and try to gear yourself to the effects .
If you are moving from a three room to a two room apartment to save $ 30 per month , for example , what will the space reduction do to your daily living ?
The advance preparation you make to offset the sudden feeling of being cramped and stifled will affect your ability to accept the adjustment .
This principle is of vital importance in dropping out of the automobile game .
The Automobile
This is a good point to begin detailed examination of how to live better for less , for the automobile is way ahead of every other flagrant money - waster in our lives .
First of all , let 's see what you - YOU - are really paying for the questionable pleasure of driving one .
I am going to detail my own cost figures here , but it 's very important that you get a pencil right now and figure your costs alongside mine , for unless you realize what you are paying , you will not find the necessary incentive to give up your chariot .
Mine was a modest car , priced at $ 3,400 , with a four - year turn - in value of $ 1000 ... and I 've been very reasonable with these estimates .
It is possible to spread the capital expense of a car over more than 4 years , of course , but repairs have a way of catching up with the paper savings , quality being what it is .
Most studies have shown that the difference between new and used car total operating costs is not very great .
See Chart 1 for the per year figures .
According to Chart 1 , that is $ 1,704 per year !
If your net take home pay is $ 850 per month , you are putting two months work a year into supporting that car .
If your net take home pay is $ 570 per month , that car is making you work three months a year for its support .
Since this about spans the normal range of take home pay , it means that some 20 percent of all the work done in this country is solely devoted to supporting automobiles !
Are you quite sure you want to be a part of that addiction ?
There are alternatives if you do n't .
I would like to say that I quit driving because I reasoned this all out and exerted a tremendous force of will power to sell my car and be done with it .
I did n't , of course , and I do n't think anyone really can .
There are more creative and pleasurable ways to give up addictions .
Certainly more effective ways .
In my case , I was literally forced out of my auto addiction — I had no car and no money to buy one .
There is a lot to be said for this method , since nothing in the way of will power is required .
Unfortunately , these conditions cannot be artifically created , so those of you — other than the lucky few who are flat broke ( and they are lucky ) — will have to approach it from another direction .
A little relocation of your life might be necessary and , as you consider the plan that I lay out , you might think about the 2 - 1 / 2 to 3 months each year that you 're working to support that bummer out there in the garage .
First of all , you will have to find some way of getting your job and your home within a mile or two of each other .
Whether this means changing one or the other is for you to decide , but it is a basic requirement , for nothing can kill resolve faster than a bad commuting trip twice a day .
A rare exception to the " two mile " rule can be made if you have access to a truly good transit system .
But do n't rely on one that takes an hour in each direction and do n't rely on car pools or good neighbors who happen to be going your way .
Part of your purpose is to learn how to live without the beast .
The moving bit may be required for other reasons .
It is essential that you live within close walking distance of a reasonably good shopping district and that there be some kind of public transit ( preferably a couple choices ) within range of your home .
Those are the hard requirements .
Beyond that , I would suggest that you be near a library , a park , some decent inexpensive eateries , and in the kind of neighborhood you think you might enjoy ( people , trees , whatever turns you on . )
What we have accomplished by this move is the neutralization of potential pressure points .
You still have the car , but you 're going to stick it in a garage .
You might not be using it very often any more .
Now you are going to walk to work — every day , rain or shine .
If the weather really gets heavy , treat yourself , to a bus ride , not a car .
But try to avoid any kind of ride .
This is psychological conditioning .
You are re-experiencing your youth and relearning patterns of living that do n't involve an automobile .
And you will do one more thing during this breaking - in period .
Each day you walk to work , you 'll set aside whatever it used to cost for driving to work .
Gas money , parking money , bridge or highway tolls if there were any .
When the pot has $ 100 in it — or sooner if you can't wait that long — go down to the local bicycle shop and order yourself the flashiest 3 or 10 speed bicycle you can find because you have earned it .
The walking has put you in good enough condition for you to start riding the bike the day it 's ready .
Now you are really on your way to beating the game with bike commuting .
During the weeks you 've been walking to work , you 've probably gotten further into the spirit of the thing by doing most of your shopping on foot and using the bus lines for short trips that are outside the immediate neighborhood .
You have found that many things you habitually went downtown or to a favorite store across town for are obtainable right in your own neighborhood , and you have even begun to develop a sense of identity with the shops in the area .
Now , with the bike , your neighborhood will expand from one mile to several , and you 'll find yourself seldom taking the bus anymore except when weather dictates or you know you 'll bring back packages ( although you 'll be surprised at how much a bike carrier with a few straps can hold . )
If you have not been leaving the car in the garage that much , it 's time you begin to do so .
This is the part you 'll have to put some will power in to start , but very soon you 'll be realizing that that trip was n't necessary after all .
Remember :
It is the automobile itself , not the need of it , which encourages its use .
Set yourself a countdown period — say 30 days — at the end of which you 'll just get rid of the car .
Period !
Again , think of the 2 - 1/ 2 to 3 months .
The leap has got to be made , and the psychological value of the countdown is that you will be emotionally pacing yourself toward a point in time .
When it arrives , you 'll be ready .
Depending on how addicted you are — how much you 've actually been using the car these last few weeks — you may panic at this point , so it 's best to be prepared for it .
Line up some family , friends or neighbors who will agree to rush over at a moment 's notice if some emergency need for a car develops .
It wo n't .
This is just your last minute emotional ploy to keep the habit .
I have had only one - single occasion in the past eight months when I had to have a vehicle — to pick up some goods from a warehouse — and I rented a truck for a few hours .
If an emergency does come up , there are always ways .
I am not trying to say that you wo n't be making certain sacrifices .
Like you wo n't be able to go out to that wonderful place in the hills that serves a fantastic dinner for $ 6 .
So you 'll save the price of two fantastic dinners in the hills .
You wo n't be able to see that new movie on the other side of town that everyone 's talking about .
Funny thing about that sacrifice ; you 'll be surprised to find out you do n't really care .
Movies are like impulse purchases — you want them right now , but they 're so very easy to live without .
My rule of thumb has been that if anything is worth travelling half way across town for , it 's worth taking a bus for .
It 's amazing how discriminating my taste has become .
When I talked about $ 1,700 per year for the car itself , I did n't even mention the hundreds of dollars you 'll probably save on things that really were n't worth bothering with anyhow .
You 'll come to realize that there are a lot of little addictions which support the big ones .
There are other dividends awaiting you , too .
Suddenly you are no longer living in a metropolis , but in a community .
Your basic horizons have pulled back in , and you begin to feel a closeness to the neighborhood you call home .
Neighborhoods have n't vanished since your childhood , as you might have thought , your orientation has just overstepped their boundaries .
You have `progressed ' from the intimate seminar to the lecture hall , and now you can return to where relationships are once more on a human basis .
You probably learned that on your daily walks :
There actually are people along the way .
Animals too .
I used to have a regular morning chat with an Alaskan husky and a couple of squirrels on the way to work .
Pity the prospect on the crosstown freeway !
And , speaking of freeways , have you any idea what it 's like to be without that mad , blasting speedway for a part of every day ?
Think about it the next time you 're cutting into the morning traffic mess .
It also feels good to know that you have made a personal contribution to cleaning up the atmosphere .
Suddenly you 're aware of all the hypocrisy being spouted around as everyone waits for Big Brother to do something about it .
You stand a little taller .
In fact , there is something in you that stands a lot taller when you realize you 've busted the habit .
You know you 're no longer the pawn that you 've been played for much of your life .
You have just whipped the most powerful mesmerism that the industrial complex has been able to throw at the American public , and you feel damn good and clean about it .
In a way , that one single fringe benefit has been worth more to me than all the dollars I 've saved .
I simply know I 'm my own man now , and the system can never enslave me again .
There is much more to be said about cutting your cost of living , but the automobile is the cornerstone to the whole subject .
All the other savings you can put together , in one fat bundle , may approach — but will never equal — what you save by doing away with the automobile .
This is probably true even if your 4 wheels is a second - hand clunk that will never see another used car lot .
So if you can't make the car break , my advice is to forget the rest of this article and accept your servitude .
I am sure there are hardship situations where it really is impossible to be without a car and , if that 's the case , you 'd better work toward altering the situation before tackling this approach .
Living Quarters
While no other waste in our addicted lives carries anywhere near the impact of the automobile , housing is probably the closest runner - up for most of us .
The standard societal myth says that 1 / 4 of your income should go for living quarters , which is ridiculous .
Obviously the man who earns $ 800 per month needs the same living space and comfort as the man who earns $ 400 per month .
So much for mythology .
It is safe to say that everyone could probably cut his cost of housing by 10 percent and never feel it ; by 20 percent and just begin to feel it .
Some of us could probably whack it by 50 percent !
I have always been personally sensitive to the quality of my living quarters ( is n't that a beautiful example of a rationalized addiction ? ) , and when I began looking for a place in Seattle , I regarded a single bedroom apartment as ' bare essential ' .
I found a fairly nice one for $ 115 , but it would not be open for another month .
Since it was a bit lower than most in the neighborhood , I took a $ 95 studio apartment in the building to wait the month out .
I thought I 'd feel cramped , but I really did n't .
And that 's how easy it is to save 20 percent .
But you have to be careful with substitutes that add up to less than what you were really looking for .
Any of a hundred little things — sometimes as insignificant as the way people can look into your window from the street — may send you running for the door after you 've been inside for an hour , and that can be fatal to an economy drive .
Somehow , after you 've moved in , an apartment never looks the same as it did before .
I have not been able to figure out this illusion , but it never seems to fail .
So proceed with caution and look carefully at everything , especially those things that are most important to you , personally .
A good idea is to settle back quietly in your present quarters and think about the things you have consciously appreciated .
Make a list of these points to watch for in your search .
Check the neighbors , both around and above , for you are likely to be hearing their TVs , parties and arguments .
Are they the kind of people who have much of these and — if so — are they tractable ?
Pay particular attention to the managers , for they will have a lot to say in your life .
They should be easy going , tolerant people ( but not too much so , for they also rent to your neighbors . )
Naturally you 'll make compromises , but try to follow your real feelings , and do n't make compromises where you can't emotionally afford to make them .
It 's a matter of knowing yourself .
Neighborhood , to help you drop the auto may be more important than the actual residence itself :
Near your job , near good shopping and near transportation .
It is also good to be close to whatever institutions have direct relevance for you ; schools , gyms , churches , parks , libraries , community gathering places , or whatever .
These are general points to look for in house hunting , but they assume a greater significance in the context of saving money .
You are going to be thrown hard upon your personal resources , and it is most important that the environment be as supportive as possible .
If you do find yourself committed to a certain neighborhood , there may be the temptation to take a place as expensive as you 've been living in for ' just a month ' while you look around the district for something more reasonable .
Do n't do it .
You are are giving in to the addiction and only making it harder on yourself in the long run .
One thing I 've found to be true in rentals is that there are price patterns that seem to go in steps .
You may find very little difference in rentals from $ 100 to $ 120 , but then $ 125 seems to be a large jump in quality .
Look around enough to determine these patterns , and then try to rent at the bottom of a step .
If you 're geared to sharing living quarters with others , you are in a position to cut way back on housing expense .
It should not be difficult to arrange lodging at $ 40 or $ 50 per month , or even less .
Obviously , this can mean a sizeable saving to one who has been living in private quarters , and is worth considering if there is any likelihood that you can so adapt .
There are various arrangements to suit individual tastes — all the way from sharing living rooms to sharing beds — with several steps in between .
Older multiple - bedroom homes can be shared by 4 to 6 people with a good deal of personal privacy possible , but there are several tricks to watch for .
If the owner is offering on this basis , he may be using the gimmick to charge 50 percent more than the rental is really worth .
Or the prime renter may be subleasing in order to cover his own rental cost and expect to pay nothing himself .
Check the situation closely , and look for equivalent values in the neighborhood .
Also be wary of the situation with 4 or fewer co-renters , where the departure of one would throw an abnormal rent burden on the others .
Years ago , boarding houses used to be a popular answer to inexpensive living for single people .
In the large cities there are still some good residence houses — as the more presumptuous ones call themselves — but most are generally much deteriorated from former glories .
The few good ones are not cheap .
I would advise you to avoid this approach unless you want to afford the good ones .
Most of the others are no bargain when you find out that their food often drives you out to restaurants .
Those of you who are buying homes have an entirely different set of circumstances to contend with .
In any other context than this article I would be hands down in favor of the home , and where you now have other values going than those advocated here — country property , productive acreage , a real retreat from urban life — I still advise you to hang on to the place .
But if you have a cute little suburban box with 27 inches of grass to your neighbor 's property line , the answer is no .
The very simple reason , of course , is the car .
Suburbanites are commuters , and the automobile is the cornerstone of suburbia .
You will have to decide if your home is worth slavery to the car .
The choice is that direct .
If you own or are buying what I call productive country property , you should bend every possible effort to get your job out to where you live .
Or find some dependable alternative to your own automobile for transportation to work .
If neither is possible then you , too , are going to have to face the slavery - to - the - car question .
It should be becoming increasingly clear how much we are really slave to that smog belching monster .
It not only robs us of 20 percent of our personal lives , but it has forced upon us some powerful pressure points to perpetuate its own existence .
It reminds me very much of the computer in Star - Trek which refused to let anyone pull out the plug .
Eating : In and Out
I 'm sure this will come as quite a surprise to most of you , but I eat almost all my food out .
I manage to do so for under $ 20 per week , thus defeating another popular American myth , that it is cheaper to prepare your own food .
It might be for two people , but not for one .
I did n't come by this through any brilliant revelation , but as a natural development of my 3 - month ' bare bones ' program .
My studio apartment had a fine electric stove and refrigerator , and I drew up a list of the most essential cooking and eating ware I felt I would need .
It came to almost $ 15 — just enough to have to put off for a couple weeks .
So I decided to make do with hamburgers till I could afford the plunge .
Whether it was fate or luck or purely the conditioning of necessity , I do n't know , but I found a place in the neighborhood that served the most fantastically delicious and filling broiled cheeseburger on a french roll that I had tasted since I was a kid .
This , with a large salad and coffee — a full meal — cost only $ 1.40 .
I am still eating those cheeseburgers 4 or 5 nights a week , and if the thought of such monotony makes you sick , they are still delicious , nevertheless .
I vary it occasionally with something healthy and inexpensive like liver , fish or ham and eggs .
But in all honesty , the price and quality keep me coming back to the cheeseburgers .
My weekly dinners are less than $ 12 , even including the indulgence of a good $ 2 chinese meal every weekend .
Where is the housewife who can keep a dinner budget much below that level ?
Lunch is a passable hot meal in the company cafeteria and costs about a dollar .
On weekends I try to avoid a midday meal because I usually have an earlier and somewhat larger dinner .
The only thing I eat at home is breakfast .
During the week this is simply a bowl of dry cereal with a rich mix of milk and half & half , and a glass of orange juice .
On weekends , I sometimes switch to soft - boiled eggs with melba toast and fresh grapefruit .
All breakfast supplies cost , perhaps , $ 1.50 per week .
I used to bring home cookies and pastriesr the in - between hours but that tapered off .
Hard candy — a good , cheap energy source — and seven - up are my only pacifiers now .
I made one small start at setting up a kitchen six months ago , and it taught me to let well enough alone .
I 'd gone fishing with friends , and brought home 8 or 10 ' free ' trout .
Well , that meant a frying pan with spatula , one dinner plate , silverware ( other than my one spoon ) , butter , bread , lemon and who ever heard of fresh fish without fresh tartar sauce , so mayonnaise and pickles , and such a dinner would need a salad , so two kinds of lettuce , tomato , vinegar and oil !
My free trout dinner cost me nearly $ 10 plus an hour of preparation and cleaning up .
The pickles , oil and vinegar are still sitting on the shelf .
One cannot , of course , call food an addiction .
But the creative preparation of food can be an extremely expensive hobby , with literally no end to its possibilities .
In the old days I used to follow the ' live to eat ' school of thought ; but I have reversed my field , and I think I have lopped another few weeks off my working year in the process .
If I were to try and draw generalized rules from my experience , I would make them these :
1 . Keep home foods down to the simplest of preparations , mostly those that can be mixed with milk or water .
2. Breakfast should always be a home meal because it requires the least of all utensils and condiments .
A non-fried breakfast is best for digestion early in the day .
3 . Avoid processed store foods like TV dinners or any completely pre-prepared foods .
You pay a tremendous percentage for the convenience , and if some seem cheap it 's because the quality is poor .
4 . Find the best of the neighborhood restaurants ( they may be the moderately expensive ) and stick to their cheapest foods .
There are such things as 22 cent burgers , and I suppose there are people who can stomach them , but I have never been one of those people .
5 . The most reasonable meals , and the ones you can usually depend on for quality are eggs , fish and liver .
Do n't overlook salads ; $ 1.50 might seem expensive for ' rabbit food ' but it can be an entire meal in itself , and very healthy .
6 . Eat at the counter so you do n't feel obligated to tip .
I have found , to my happy surprise , that I get every bit as pleasant service from waitresses I consistently never tip .
Another myth busted .
7 . If you pay more than $ 2.50 for any meal , you are paying for atmosphere , not food .
If you are irresistably drawn to dinner dating , try Saturday afternoon lunch .
It 's easily as rewarding socially , and far more economical .
8 . Try to find a good Chinese restaurant .
They have a huge variety of very healthy and inexpensive dishes — especially for group dining — and it can really take the edge off a monotonous economy diet .
Chinese and Filipino cooks , incidentally , are among the best you 'll find anywhere .
9 . If the place you work does not have an inexpensive cafeteria nose around some nearby large companies .
They are frequently open to the public but , even if not , it is n't at all difficult to move right in as though you belong .
These should be 20 to 30 percent cheaper than commercial eateries .
10 .
Many people do quite well on two meals a day , a late breakfast and an early dinner .
Excellent if you have that kind of flexibility in your day .
A bowl of soup is an effective and cheap in - between dinner - postponer .
So is toast and coffee .
11 . Try to stop thinking of food as an experience or a reward , and see it simply as fuel .
Tasty fuel , to be sure , but that 's all .
Odds and Ends
By the time you have gotten rid of your car , cut down your rent and faced up to the tyranny of the local supermarket , you will begin to see all the creative possibilities of cracking myths and breaking habits .
I wondered for weeks if I could live without knowing what was happening in the world around me , and finally made the bold move of cutting off newspapers and news magazines .
The world and I went our separate ways .
I , perhaps a little more ignorant , but a few dollars and many hours richer .
The straight press never had much to say to me anyhow , and I 'm able to put more reading time into things of value .
I 'm constantly telling myself that I must see this or that show , but I seldom get as far as the box office .
When I do , the price almost always turns me off , and I have somehow survived without all the great epics I 've missed .
The rented television was my original creative attempt to kill the theatre urge , and it worked very well , so I considered it a good investment .
But eventually it , too , became a drag and I turned it in .
If I had owned the set , I 'd still have it , but now I 'm in the unique position of living in a nearly non-advertising society ( except for billboards ) and it's really kind of nice and quiet .
My head is less bothered without all that crap , and the tiresome breathless news reporting that goes with it .
After awhile , excess addictions begin to fall away freely , as you sense — on a deep emotional level — that you can live without them .
One week in December , my smoking dropped from a pack a day to one - third that amount .
I neither pushed nor fought it .
After a couple weeks , I raised the nerve to try and go all the way , and it was easier than I had expected .
But even there , I exercised a creative touch :
When the urge became too strong , I filled a pipe .
Now I smoke perhaps 3 or 4 pipefuls a week , and there is no guilt or strain involved .
If you 've ever added up the cost of cigarettes , you 'll find that they 're a considerable expense .
A pack a day costs a week of work a year to support !
The whole trick to this business is to try not to drive yourself into the ground .
Be alert to withdrawal pains and find a creative compensation .
You wo n't always be able to , but each time you do , it gives you a lift and makes the whole trip that much easier .
You 're not out to prove the strength of your will , but the agility of your imagination .
No matter how well you fight the battle , there will be days during those first few months when everything seems to fall in on you .
Here 's a tip to remember :
When that happens , sit yourself down in total privacy and quiet , with a notebook , and just write about it .
A letter to yourself , with all the deep feelings you can pull out .
I do n't know why , but it takes the pressure off .
It does more , but I 'll leave that for you to explore .
Fringe Benefits
By now , this might sound like a real monastic trip , and you 're probably wondering if a few months to yourself each year is really worth it all .
For my part it is , even if that were all there was to gain .
And there is so much more .
The release from work is only the pièce de résistance .
First of all , let me make sure you understand very clearly that you are not expected to confine your spending to $ 250 per month , or whatever figure it is that you finally arrive at .
My checkbook is full of things like $ 30 for a University course , $ 100 for a bicycle , $ 10 for an underground magazine , and so forth .
It may seem as though I am defeating my own purpose .
Far from it !
These are all discretionary purchases , not addictions , and they each enrich my life .
The main difficulty with most budget plans is that they lump discretionary and supportive expenses together and kill all incentives by putting a clamp on both .
The purpose of this program is to return your life to you .
The benefits can be either six or more continuous months of free time each year or an equivalent amount of discretionary cash .
If you are wise , you will mix these alternate possibilities in some equitable combination based on your own personal needs .
I am quite content that I can afford any luxury I care to purchase , but I habitually measure the working cost of these luxuries against their real value to me .
As a result , I work a month or two longer than I might absolutely have to in order to give my life the level of meaning that I prefer .
I am willing , in other words , to work 4 days out of this year to buy a bicycle , but I am not willing to work 68 days of this and every year to pay for an automobile .
It is as simple as that .
Now we can talk about some of the fringe benefits .
We 're usually inclined to measure our various consumer addictions in terms of money alone .
In this article , I have so far related them to working time , but some of them can be related to another kind of time that I 'll call active time .
The cigarette habit cost me 6 days a year in working time , but virtually nothing in active time since it is not done to the exclusion of other activities .
The newspaper habit — on the other hand — returns only 2 days in working time , but its dividend in active time is out of sight .
If you spend only half an hour each day with the daily newspaper and 3 hours each weekend with the Sunday paper ( not at all abnormal ) , you are putting 312 hours per year of active time into that pursuit .
If we relate that to the 8 - hour working day , we can say that the equivalent of 39 working days is spent reading newspapers !
It does not take long , with the concept of active time , to build a sizable vacuum in your personal life when you start dropping addictions .
Newspapers , TV , movies , meal preparation time , unnecessary auto trips — there is a huge void to fill , and it has to be filled positively during the critical withdrawal period if the program is to be a success .
This is your golden opportunity to start living the way you want ... even while you are still tied in to the rat race .
All the hobbies you 've never had time for ; all the pursuits of youth you had to drop when you entered the system ; all the activities you have only dreamed about until now become new grist for your imagination .
At one and the same occurence you have both the discretionary cash and the discretionary time with which to begin reshaping your life .
If you 've only recently become embedded in the system , the ideas will be quick and the choices easy .
On the other hand , you may draw a total blank if you have n't enjoyed this kind of freedom in many years .
Which way to move and for what ?
The following suggestions may help :
1 . Get the course listings of the local night schools — preferably university , but adult secondary school if necessary — and find something that you just feel like taking .
Perhaps in a field you have always wondered about .
Do n't take any course to advance your career or because you think you should .
2 . Go to the library .
Not to read , but to browse .
Walk along the open stacks of non-fiction and pick up whatever interests you at the moment .
Follow your own intuition .
If this does n't work at once , try it again .
You will soon find yourself drawn to some part of the library for either a study - type or an activity - type subject .
Pursue your interest wherever it leads .
Branch libraries are best for a start , if you bury easily under sheer volume .
3 . Also at the library , ask about local clubs or discussion groups .
If you 're bashful about this , turn to the telephone book under " clubs " and run down the list .
If something sounds good , phone or write for more information .
4 . Check the local recreation department for sponsored community activities and groups .
Find something to fill those vacant hours .
It is far better to have too much to do than too little .
If you feel pushed , you can always cut back again .
On hobbies , anything is fair game as long as it's something you really want to do , but beware of one pitfall !
Some hobbies , like rock collecting or pencil sketching , require a modest initial outlay and almost no sustaining expense .
The first cost is almost all of it .
Others , like photography or golf , are a perpetual drain on your funds .
You never stop paying for them , and they eventually assume the status of an addiction in their own right .
Try to avoid these whenever possible .
As a general rule , the nature hobbies and the creative hobbies are the most reasonable , unless — as with some musical instruments — extensive personalized instruction is required .
I hasten to add another word here :
There is no requirement that your activities be either outside or people oriented .
If you 've always wanted to sit down and write poetry or paint still life , now is as good a time as you will ever find .
Even just plain relaxed reading can be rewarding .
Find your own mix , and watch carefully for the emotional signals that will tell you if you are leaning too hard in a particular direction .
If anything seems to become a chore or a task you wish were over , drop it .
At least one night a week should be devoted to a really exhausting physical activity .
This is not just for body conditioning .
It also serves wonderfully as a general tension outlet .
Gym activities like volleyball or basketball are excellent , and swimming is also good .
Bowling or golf do not do it , and are a continuing major expense .
I have always felt a sense of almost ecstatic relaxation after a couple of hours of volleyball and a shower .
Awhile back , I tried something new and it was every bit as effective : soul - rock dance lessons .
The Security Hangup
If you 're thinking seriously about this plan — and for the sake of your own freedom I hope you are — there is probably one big nebulous question still lurking in your mind about ... security .
The great American hangup : Job security , health security , old age security , the whole bit .
Before one can possibly consider breaking out of the system , one has to come to terms with these fears :
What if I get sick ...
What if I can't get a job ...
What about old age ...
What about my career ...
What if two or even three disasters strike at once ...
What about a depression ...
What about my age ...
What about ...
There is literally no end to the fears , and they — not society — enforce our slavery .
I wish I could give you some magic prescription — some golden rule — that would banish all these fears .
I can only tell you of my own approach , my own attempt to cope with them ( for it is just an attempt ) , and my own view of the future as it applies to me .
If you can draw strength from this , you are welcome to it , but I 'm afraid that each man is largely on his own in this area .
To begin with , accept your fears .
If you deny their existence , you cannot reason with them , and that is ultimately your best weapon .
These apprehensions are a part of the fabric of our society , and you would be strange indeed if you did not possess them ( more correctly , if they did not possess you . )
They seem to increase with age , and it is my personal theory that they are a counter - balance for the competitive pressures of society .
I suspect that the aggressive drives decrease with age and , since we must remain in a competitive environment in the ordinary course of events , we have developed this obsession with security in order to compensate .
If I 'm correct , the deliberate removal of ourselves from a competitive way of life will tend to release the grip of this insecurity .
In the meanwhile , we must constructively cope with it .
Our insecurity fears basically fall into two classes :
The 'act of God ' such as illness and accident , over which we have no control and those others such as unemployment , which are at least in some degree responsive to our own actions .
An 'act of God ' can strike anywhere , anytime and in any fashion .
This total unpredictability has left most of us paying for half a dozen insurance policies covering a hundred different ' acts ' but somehow , as often as not , failing to cover the very act that happens .
That 's because insurance companies simply cannot afford to cover the things that most frequently occur .
So the system operates against you .
We fearful people usually overlook the fact that there is extremely little likelihood that two acts will strike at the same time .
How much more simple , then , to set aside one fund to cover one act ... but any one act .
How large a fund ?
There is no absolutely right answer .
I feel a bit safe with $ 1,000 ; for you , it might be twice that amount .
Naturally , I could be busted by one big calamity , but so could I with all the insurance policies I 've ever had .
There is some point where faith and fear must meet , and for me it is $ 1000 .
At least I know that whatever does happen — anything at all — will be ' covered ' $ 1000 worth .
Even more important , I can replace the entire fund with the excess earnings of two months work .
I have to laugh at the way people are so relieved when their insurance ' pays ' a $ 200 medical bill that they have covered many times with policy premiums since their last claim .
If you are wondering whether you could set enough money aside , I would say it depends on the intensity of your fear and the legitimacy of your desire to be free .
As with everything else in this plan , it is squarely up to you .
Just as coping with ' acts of God ' requires some level of blind faith , coping with the second class of fear requires a measure of faith in yourself .
For some reason , I have always found this more difficult , even though I have proven myself to myself many times over .
I have come to the conclusion that I must confront these apprehensions over and over , like stage fright , and whip them each time .
In that sense they have come to be familiar opponents , and each new challenge is like the reopening of an old contest .
I have had my share of wins , and that knowledge gives me the confidence to have at it again .
The battle is real each time , but there comes to be almost a gritty pleasure in it .
In order to gain your freedom for part of each year , many of you will have to face the recurrent insecurity of looking for a job about once each year .
The plan itself will lead you to answers after the first few times around , but in order to face that hard start , there are certain emotional tricks that can help .
The next section will consider a few job possibilities that are nicely geared to this program , but right here let 's look at a protective emotional approach to the job interview itself .
We have been raised , most of us , to respect the omnipotence of the personnel interviewer , and he uses that lever to its best advantage .
Now we must learn to turn the tables in our own minds , and here is how I go about it :
1 . I am at a distinct advantage in this encounter , for I know all about myself and I should know at least something about the work in question .
The employer knows the work , but he knows absolutely nothing about me except what I want to tell him , either true or false .
So I control the interview even though he thinks he does .
2 . I watch and listen for clues to what he wants to hear , either in his attitudes , his questions or in his reactions to my replies and I proceed to tell him as much as possible exactly what he wants to hear .
3 . He thinks he is evaluating the kind of person I am .
But I know exactly what he is looking for because it is standard image for all employers :
Intelligent , alert , neat , responsive , pleasant , etc .
So I play that part of me to the hilt and leave out all else .
As you can see , I am making a tactical game of the interview .
This prevents me from really investing my emotions in the encounter , so I do n't give fear a chance to work .
In addition , I try to lay a barrage of interviews so that no one or two will assume any great importance .
I bring blind faith into play by knowing that there is some percentage for me — however small — in the law of averages , and sooner or later I have got to connect .
I have developed this form of attack through well over half a hundred jobs in my work history .
It has worked every time , in widely diverse fields , usually within a week or two .
Yet I still have to persuade myself , each time , that it will work again .
The question of old age security is neither an act of God , as I am using that term , nor something we can control .
It is in a class of its own ; an inevitability , like death .
Most older people deep in the system have locked themselves up tight because of their fear of approaching old age .
They become more and more concerned about what they will do after 65 than about the 10 , 20 or 30 years before 65 .
The fact that they are worrying so intensely over a probably 7 years , according to life expectancy tables , seems not to enter their heads .
My own answer is a very simple and personal one .
I accept the fact that one way or another I shall have to provide my own income until I die .
And so what !
That simple decision saves me all the agony of retirement problems and being tied to a job I do n't want to keep .
As my resignation points out , I am getting a fair share of the good years right now , and I wo n't have to look toward any stultifying inactive years later .
I have been asked how I will get a job at that age , but there are so many creative possibilities of earning an income , especially when one can subsist on a ' poverty ' level , that the question really does n't worry me .
The question of career advancement assumes a new meaning in the context of this program .
Very possibly , its original meaning .
Instead of working for increased income — which becomes meaningless — you will find yourself working toward self - fulfillment .
Possibly self - fulfillment in the arena of your present activity , but more likely in an entirely new direction .
You 'll be able to make a separation between a job that satisfies your financial needs , and a career that provides deep personal involvement .
It is possible the career will produce income but , for the first time in your life , it will not be necessary !
Play with that thought for awhile .
And What Kind of Work ?
Do not worry , at this point , about the shape your working life will take after you are well along on your own freedom trip .
Your personal feelings will go through a regenesis that is impossible to contemplate now , and your real capabilities and interests may do more to determine the final outcome than your present employment .
You might approach your current job on a free - lance or part - time basis , or you may find that the required skills can be used in consulting related businesses .
The next few months will bring many new possibilities to mind so do not be impatient .
In case your creative opportunities are temporarily limited , there are certain kinds of work that require little or no experience .
Over the course of my own job ramblings .
I have found them beautifully adapted to transiency and personalized living .
If you are well acquainted with the city in which you live and can stand being in traffic all day ( after awhile you just get kind of numb to it ) , you can always drive a cab .
This is a very easy job .
You are almost completely on your own , frequently have some choice as to your shift , many people to talk to or not at all — as you choose and much time for reading or studying if that 's your thing .
Transiency is not usually held against you as long as your driving record is okay and drivers are almost always in short supply because there is no ' future ' to the job .
The pay is a percentage of what you take in plus tips , and should run close to $ 500 per month .
Seven months a year could see me through quite easily at this rate .
In a sense , the mobility of the job is a fringe benefit , but it will keep you partially addicted to a vehicle , so be careful .
If you live in one of the larger metropolitan areas , you might look into process serving .
This job normally requires a car , but each large outfit usually has a ' downtown route ' which can often be done on foot or bicycle .
It 's worth looking into because business addresses are the easiest to serve , and it 's possible to make $ 10 to $ 15 in just a few hours .
You are not expected to work all day , but merely to cover a route , which may include 20 or more stops in a concentrated downtown area .
It is straight commission — usually $ 2 and up per service — with no required experience , very transient and easy to get .
The important thing is turnover of new services daily , which a small outfit may not have .
It is possible to work for two or three outfits at once , but keep it to yourself if you do .
This does not double the work , it merely concentrates it .
Also in the large metropolitan area , if you look in the Yellow Pages under ' Shopping Services ' , you 'll get a lead to another interesting — if poorly paid — occupation .
Sometimes also listed under Detective Agencies , store shoppers are the people who unobtrusively go from firm to firm making purchases with company money simply to see that it 's properly rung into the cash register .
They travel between stores — and frequently between towns — in company cars , as a group , but do their work individually or in pairs .
The pay is low , but out of town expenses are covered , and the daily route usually includes one or two eating spots for a free lunch .
Turnover is high , and it 's partially deliberate to keep shoppers from being spotted too often .
The job is easy to get , it 's fun and interesting .
One kind of work with a conveniently built - in transiency factor and an unbeatable environment is the resort circuit .
You can take your choice — summer or winter — sea or ski , mountain or desert .
Cooks , bartenders , maids , waitresses , desk clerks , handymen and specialties like life guards , social directors and baby sitters are in demand .
Experience is preferred but there are often last minute or emergency mid-season openings when they 'll take the first halfway reasonable choice they can get .
These are 4 to 6 month jobs that usually provide room and board and also pay an additional $ 200 to $ 400 or more .
It 's a wonderful opportunity for a change from the city .
The food is usually good to excellent , and employees can use the resort 's facilities during their free time .
The short - term aspect of the job should entitle you to immediate unemployment pay and you can work both ends of the circuit , as many people do .
Usually one or two employment agencies in a large city — particularly near a resort area — will specialize in this type of placement .
The action begins about a month before the season starts and lasts right up to the last minute and beyond .
These are offered not so much as suggestions , but as assurances for those of you still fearful about leaving the good old security of the good old rat-race .
Even if your present occupation does not have transient or part - time possibilities , such qualities are not hard to find .
I think , however , that within six months your entire approach will alter — as mine has — in a way that you can't possibly now envision and I suggest you ride loose on the question of employment .
Without being pressured to earn in order to buy , so many things become possible .
What Comes After ?
This brings us to the very edge of the great unknown .
I cannot really write the end of this article .
I can only speculate upon it , for I have not yet crossed into that promised land .
But I have though about the question enough to know that I am going to experience something far more deep and significant than merely free , unstructured time .
Consider , for a moment , the last occasion you looked forward to a broad expanse of unstructured time .
For me it was summer vacations in junior high school , about 30 years ago .
By high school , those vacations had already been converted to summer classes and jobs .
It is difficult to recall — but I am able to remember — the fluid sense of joy and life which arrived with the last day of the school year .
Three months was a significant portion of a lifetime at that age .
Thirty years since I have not been pressured by calendar , clock , appointment , itinerary , schedule or bill collector !
Fully half a lifetime since I have owned myself ... with all the delicious implications of impulse and spontaneity .
I wonder , first of all , if one can really retrace the path to that stage of idyllic innocence and adventure .
And then I wonder how one copes with the emotional shock of such a return .
And finally :
The question of what middle age maturity might do given the freedom of early youth — is the most intriguing prospect of all .
By the time this is published , I will be somewhere in Canada — with bicycle and sleeping bag — finding the answers .
I do n't expect that they will come easily , for very little that is worthwhile does .
But I will learn as I go , and try to react with the same kind of constructive creativity that has brought me this far along on my own personal search for freedom .
I do n't really care how long the road is , nor where it leads , because the joy of life is in the journey , not the arrival .
About Bicycle
A word on bicycles .
If they are so far back in your life that you can't conceive of a grown man riding one ... or if you 're afraid that you'd be confused by the geared variety : Bicycles are a popular form of transportation for all ages in many European countries .
Most of Scandinavia boasts a ratio of one bicycle for every two inhabitants .
This country was also going in that direction during the 1800s , before we became crazy about power and ' progress ' .
Get a copy of Bicycling Magazine at any bicycle shop , or look up the local bicycle club or American Youth Hostel chapter .
You 'll find that there are a great many older people who ride bikes quite unselfconsciously .
Gears are easy to learn and worth their weight in silver .
Do n't let them scare you off .
If you are absolutely certain that you 'll just be riding around the neighborhood and to work , a 3 - speed will probably do .
But if I were you , I would n't bet on any such certainty .
A 10 - speed bike is not just a 3 - speed with 7 more gear ratios .
It is as different from a 3 - speed in performance and handling as a 3 - speed is from a balloon - tire 1 - speed bike .
There are so many delightful things you can do with a touring bicycle that you may be cheating yourself if you do n't go all the way :
Long weekend rides in the country , camping vacations , hosteling in certain areas , air - freighting yourself and bicycle to faraway places , etc .
All of these can be done with 3 - gear models , but are easier and more enjoyable with a 10 - speed bike .
If you 're in doubt , find a place you can rent or borrow one a few times .
Frame size and seat adjustment can also make all the difference in the world , so check these carefully with someone who knows the answers before you come to any conclusions .
Single , Married or Multiple
Most of the information in this article is directed to the single person , for that is the nature of my own experience .
For larger family units , some approaches — such as the question of shared living quarters or eating out versus eating in — may have to be changed .
The general proposition of buying back your life by cutting addictions , however , is just as applicable to any size family unit .
The critical question is not how many individuals are living on how many incomes , but rather :
How many unnecessary addictions are those incomes now covering ?
A family living on one income will — of necessity — have already slashed ( or never developed ) some addictions and will , therefore , have less to cut .
On the other hand , a couple with two incomes may have so many ' monkeys on their backs ' that they simply wo n't believe how much they could cut their working year .
Regardless of family size , however , the automobile is a common addiction that cuts across all income levels .
It 's safe to say that no matter what your family situation demands in other respects , the release of the automobile will return to you 3 months of every year , and give you the opportunity to find a new lifestyle .
Knowing Yourself
How well you know yourself can be the deciding factor in whether your withdrawal trip is an easy or a hard one .
Each of us has his own private hangups — things which are critical to our enjoyment of life .
To the extent that your real needs have been obscured by addictions , you may have some difficulty determining what these personal quirks really are .
It is worth putting some serious thought toward finding them .
Many years ago I tried to cut expenses while in school , and I rented the smallest , ugliest , most miserable room I could find because it was also the cheapest .
I learned very quickly that I have certain basic living requirements which I cannot deprive myself of , at least not yet .
I can put up with a good deal of other kinds of privation as long as my living quarters have an aura of comfort and cleanliness about them .
It is worth it to me to maintain this indulgence for my own peace of mind .
If you seem to be having withdrawal pains out of all proportion to something you have dropped , look closely to see whether you have stumbled into such an area .
But examine it carefully , for the real emotional need may be hidden under a facade .
Versatility is Possible
The breaking of consumer addictions gives us a radically new frame of reference .
Many kinds of living — which seem remote , if not altogether impossible in your present straight jacket way of life — become reasonable .
I got to wondering how one could live in the country and work in town without owning an automobile nor being subjected to daily bus commuting .
This is the basis of one variation of the " Have More Plan " in the March / April 1970 issue of MOTHER EARTH NEWS .
At first it appears impossible , but there actually is a creative way and it illustrates how to mold this plan to your own needs .
Let 's say you have a piece of country property now , about 50 miles out of town , and you drive the distance and return daily .
If you take the bus , it 's $ 2 each way — $ 88 a month — plus the agony of the daily trip .
Other than that , you can get along on $ 250 a month and your take - home pay is $ 500 per month .
This means a basic work requirement of six months per year .
But there 's another way :
You could share an inner city rental close to your job with friends at $ 50 per month for the five day work week .
This cuts your commuting to one round - trip a week at a cost of about $ 17 a month .
That 's a total of $ 67 — which is high — but still lower and easier than the straight commute bit .
What would this actually do to your six month work plan ?
Six times $ 67 is $ 402 ... or one more month of work .
Seven months of weekend farming , and five months of full - time country living !
Eating In
I have lived variations of my own " work six months — retire six months " plan for 12 years and I agree with almost everything Irv says in this excellent article .
It has been my experience , however , that one person definitely can enjoy a more varied , more filling , infinitely more satisfying and less expensive diet by eating in .
As a matter of fact — although a refrigerator is indispensable — a stove is n't even necessary .
A simple little one - burner hot plate will do the trick and a two burner unit can really set you up in grand style .
The capital expense wo n't bankrupt you , either .
I 've bought used , single - burner models from the Salvation Army for $ 4 and the most expensive push - button , twin - burner , chromed , variable - heat hot plate I ever saw ( and purchased in Seattle four years ago ) only set me back $ 24.95 .
That seemed a big investment at the time ( as did the $ 4 unit when Barry Slothauer and I split the cost in Honolulu ) but it 's already had a lot of rough use from the west coast to North Carolina to Ohio and should faithfully serve for another 10 or 20 years .
The only real drawback to a hot plate is the limited heat range of the average unit .
The lowest heat is always far too intense for simmering stews and other lazy cooking .
I solve this problem by bending the wire from three or four heavy coat hangers into a series of triangular , three - legged racks of various heights .
Using a combination of the heats on the plate and a high or low or in - between rack , I can vary cooking speeds over a greater range than the most expensive electric stove .
Incidentally , these racks get hot so I always switch them with the same pair of pliers I used to make them .
I have an old Army surplus mess kit that cost me — I think — two bucks 10 years ago and it fits a round hot - plate burner perfectly .
It has a tight fitting lid and , over the years , I 've eaten some heroic stews out of that rig .
Stews are beautiful .
Just brown one or two or three kinds of meat , throw it into the pot , add all the vegetables you can find , top with a layer of barley and some vinegar and — adding water as needed — let the whole savory mix bubble lightly for about three days ... if it lasts that long .
Dip out steaming bowlfuls as you desire .
I 've even baked cookies and cornbread on a hot plate by draping an aluminum foil " oven " over a flat pan set up on a high rack .
The idea , of course , is to set the foil up so it directs as much heat to the top of the " cookie sheet " as the burner applies to the bottom .
By substituting a blue enameled roaster for the flat pan , I have also " oven roasted " some memorable pork shoulders and chunks of beef .
Have you ever baked a potato by burying it in the sand near a roaring beach fire ?
I 've worked a variation on that by wrapping a potato in foil , covering it well in sand in a big tin juice can and baking the whole thing on my trusty hot plate .
All in all , with a cheap burner , a pair of pliers and a few odds and ends , I 've eaten exceptionally well for months at a time on $ 8 to $ 10 a week .

Discretionary Spending
The concept of discretionary expenses may need more clarification .
In your current lifestyle , discretionary expense is the major portion of the budget because — by definition — it is that which is not necessary for life support .
The object of this program is the entire separation of discretionary spending from support expense .
Then — with the awareness that it is totally discretionary — to turn such spending toward that which has real meaning in your life .
The support expense , once its true level is achieved , is necessary and inevitable .
It should equal from 4 to 8 months work per year .
Discretionary spending , however , competes directly against free time and must be evaluated accordingly .
There can be no hard rule on this spending because it is a function of each individual 's needs and many variables are involved .
But there are some good guidelines .
Chart No. 2 will show you the cost in work time for different levels of discretionary spending as a function of your take - home pay .
This will enable you to arrive at a target amount according to how much additional time you are willing to work .
But beware of judging the discretionary limit by your current standards if you are intent on attaining and preserving your freedom .
There are two basic rules for discretionary expenditures :
One , each should be a single purchase and not a continuing series ;
Two , the purchases should not be immediately consumable .
A bicycle is a beautiful example .
Even though relatively expensive as a single purchase , it is a one - time purchase — practically maintenance free — and will last for years .
Other good examples are musical instruments , well made clothing , a radio , reference books or a typewriter .
The pitfall to watch for is the item which appears to be a one - time purchase but requires or induces continual outlay .
Phonographs , cameras and golf clubs are examples .
These must be considered carefully lest they create new addictions .
A night school course is consumable in a sense , but it can be the medium for permanent enrichment .
It also comes to a definite end without any requirement for repetition .
Neither statement can be made for golf clubs .
In this context a $ 50 allowance per month is a considerable amount .
It would not be so for addictive expenditures .
Going out to dinner and a show every week could blow the allowance and leave absolutely nothing to show for it except a craving for more .
Depression ?
A depression ( economic , that is ) worries me not at all .
Far from having difficulty finding work , I shall be in a position to offer my services for less than most men can live on .
I shall have long since adapted to conditions that will have others jumping off buildings .
And when I really can't get work , I 'll be able to live like a prince on unemployment while others — trying to support an automobile on the same check — will be starving .
No , I shall welcome depression with open arms , for it will be the start of a new society and I will already be part way there .
These beakers contain various samples of carbon nanotubes or the nanomaterial C 60 , also known as ' buckyballs , ' mixed in water stabilized either by surfactants or natural organic matter .

Laboratory experiments with a type of nanomaterial that has great promise for industrial use show significant potential for dispersal in aquatic environments -- especially when natural organic materials are present .
When mixed with natural organic matter in water from the Suwannee River -- a relatively unpolluted waterway that originates in southern Georgia -- multiwalled carbon nanotubes ( MWNTs ) remain suspended for more than a month , making them more likely to be transported in the environment , according to research led by the Georgia Institute of Technology .
Carbon nanotubes , which can be single - or multiwalled , are cylindrical carbon structures with novel properties that make them potentially useful in a wide variety of applications including electronics , composites , optics and pharmaceuticals .
" We found that natural organic matter , or NOM as we call it , was efficient at suspending the nanotubes in water , " said Jaehong Kim , an assistant professor in the Georgia Tech School of Civil and Environmental Engineering .
The research will be published in the January issue of the American Chemical Society journal Environmental Science & Technology .
Kim is the senior author and conducted the research with Professor Joseph Hughes , graduate student Hoon Hyung , both at Georgia Tech , and postdoctoral researcher John Fortner from Georgia Tech and Rice University .
" We do n't know for certain why NOM is so efficient at suspending these nanotubes in the laboratory , " Kim said .
" We think NOM has some chemical characteristics that promote adhesion to the nanotubes more than to some surfactants .
We are now studying this further . "
In the lab , Kim and his colleagues compared the interactions of various concentrations of MWNTs with different aqueous environments organic - free water , water containing a 1 percent solution of the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , water containing a commercially available sample of Suwannee River NOM and an actual sample of Suwannee River water from the same location as the commercially available preparation .
They agitated each sample for one hour and then let it sit for up to one month .
The researchers then used transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , measurements of opacity and turbidity , and other analyses to determine the behavior of MWNTs in these environments .
The results were :
-- MWNTs added to organic - free water settled quickly , and the water became completely transparent in less than an hour .
--
When added to the SDS solution , the nanotubes immediately made the water dark and cloudy .
After one day of settling , some nanotubes remained suspended , and the water was a light gray color .
-- Water containing the commercially available sample of Suwannee River NOM originally appeared dark and cloudy , then gradually lightened after four days of settling .
Some MWNTs remained suspended for more than a month .
--
The results with an actual Suwannee River sample were similar to those with the commercially available preparation .
In addition , Kim and his colleagues used TEM to find that most MWNTs in both samples of NOM were suspended as individually dispersed nanotubes , rather than being clustered together as some other nanomaterials do in water .
" This individual dispersion might make them more likely to be transported in a natural environment , " Kim explained .
In light of these findings , Kim and his colleagues have expanded their research to other nanomaterials , including single - walled carbon nanotubes and C60 , the so - called " buckyball " molecules in the same family as carbon nanotubes .
They are also experimenting with other NOM sources and studying different mixing conditions .
" We are getting some interesting results , though our findings are still preliminary , " Kim noted .
While researchers explore applications of nanomaterials and industry nears commercial manufacture of these novel products , it 's essential for scientists and engineers to study the materials ' potential environmental impact , Kim added .
" Natural organic matter is heterogeneous , " he explained .
" It 's a complex mixture made from plants and microorganisms , and it 's largely undefined and variable depending on the source .
So we have to continue to study nanomaterial transport in the lab using various NOM sources to try to better understand their potential interaction in the natural environment . "
In related research , Kim 's research team is studying various other aspects of the fate of nanomaterials in water -- including photochemical and chemical reactions of C 60 colloidal aggregates -- with the ultimate goal of understanding the environmental implications of nanotechnology .

A cyclist who travelled 335,500 miles on the same bike had it stolen within hours of arriving in the UK .
Heinz Stucke had reached Portsmouth , Hampshire , on his continuous voyage - which began in 1962 - when his bicycle was stolen as he slept in his tent .
" I would do anything to get my bike back - I 'm emotionally attached to it , " he told the Portsmouth News .
Mr Stucke , from Germany - who was registered as the most travelled man in history in the Guinness Book of Records between 1995 and 1999 - put up his tent in Island View Terrace after getting off a ferry at the nearby port .
At around 3 am on Monday , he went to check on his bike and discovered it was missing .
The bicycle is black with two sets of handlebars , and is covered in stickers from around the world .
PC Paul Jones of Hampshire police , who received the report of the theft , has taken pity on 66 - year - old Mr Stucke and arranged for a replacement bike to be donated to him from the force 's lost property .
" I just felt sorry for Mr Stucke and wanted to help him as much as I could , " he said .
" I think someone just saw his bike and thought it would be fun to take it . "
( This is from an email sent by Mike Vanier .
It is such a well - written description of the problems hackers face that I thought everyone should see it . )
My Ph.D. research involved writing very complex simulations of nervous systems .
I used a simulation package that was written in C and had its own scripting language , all written in - house .
I extended the hell out of it , but the experience was so painful I do n't think I can ever work on a large C project again .
Since I want to continue working in this field , and since I love to hack , I want to re-write the simulator " the right way " .
However , I 've been dithering on the choice of language .
It 's pretty clear that the core simulation objects have to be written in C ++.
C is too painful , and anything else is going to give an unacceptable hit in speed ( simulation is one of those rare fields where it is impossible to have too much speed ) .
But this is probably less than 50 % of the code , maybe much less .
The rest is infrastructure ; scripting interface as well as a lot of support code .
For scripting I want to use Scheme or some Lisp dialect .
But the language choice for infrastructure is unclear .
I could use C++ , but that 's unnecessarily painful especially since the infrastructure is not speed - critical .
So I 'd decided to use Java ; it 's fast enough , there are a lot of libraries , and a lot of people know it so I could conceivably get others to work on it as well .
After making this decision , my interest waned and I started another ( unrelated ) project .
In the process of working on that other project ( which involves Scheme and Objective Caml ( Ocaml ) , an ML dialect ) , it occurred to me that Ocaml would be a better choice than Java for the intermediate layer .
It 's faster , has better type - checking , is much more powerful , and can even be used as its own scripting language because of the type inference and interactive REPL .
If necessary , I could write a simple Lisp - like language on top of Ocaml with little difficulty .
The C interface to Ocaml is also quite mature , and there is a good - sized standard library ( though nothing like the enormous Java libraries ) .
Also , it 's much lighter weight than Java .
But here is the most important reason : it 's a hell of a lot more fun to program in than Java .
Writing Java code , though not particulary painful in the sense that C is painful ( core dumps etc. ) , puts me to sleep .
Writing Ocaml ( which is a " language designed for smart people " if there ever was one ) is exciting .
My motivation to tackle the project has tripled overnight .
The interesting question is : why is Ocaml so much more fun than Java ?
Why are " languages designed for smart people " ( LFSPs ) so much more fun to program in than " languages designed for the masses " ( LFMs ) ?
One possibility is that LFSPs tend to be more unusual , and hence are more novel .
I 'll admit that this is part of the answer , but it misses the main point .
Any new language is going to be novel , but the novelty usually wears off quickly .
The real point is that LFSPs have a much greater support for abstraction , and in particular for defining your own abstractions , than LFMs .
This is not accidental ; LFMs deliberately restrict the abstractive power of the language , because of the feeling that users " ca n't handle " that much power .
This means that there is a glass ceiling of abstraction ; your designs can only get this abstract and no more .
This is reassuring to Joe Average , because he knows that he is n't going to see any code he can't understand .
It is reassuring to Joe Boss , because he knows that he can always fire you and hire another programmer to maintain and extend your code .
But it is incredibly frustrating to Joe Wizard Hacker , because he knows that his design can be made N times more general and more abstract but the language forces him to do the Same Old Thing again and again .
This grinds you down after a while ; if I had a nickel for every time I 've written " for ( i = 0 ; i < N ; i++ ) " in C I 'd be a millionaire .
I 've known several programmers who after only a few years of hardcore hacking get burned out to the point where they say they never want to code again .
This is really tragic , and I think part of it is that they 're using LFMs when they should be using LFSPs .
“ THE governor 's action seems to signify that God 's moral law regarding sex outside of marriage can be transgressed without consequence . ”
Those words came this week from Rick Scarborough of Vision America , a Christian lobbying group .
The US Pastor Council and various Republican politicians have piled in too .
Usually , this sort of right - wing animosity is reserved for the likes of Hillary Clinton , but this week 's attack was on one of the Christian right 's favourite sons : Rick Perry , the deeply religious Republican governor of Texas .
His offence ?
Promoting the use of a highly effective new vaccine that is sure to save many women from a nasty form of cancer .
But to some people , it is tantamount to encouraging promiscuity .
On February 2nd Mr Perry bypassed the state legislature and mandated vaccination against the human papilloma virus ( HPV ) .
His order would affect all girls entering sixth grade ( at about 11 ) unless their parents opt out in writing .
Perhaps 20 m Americans carry this virus , making it one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the country .
Most strains are harmless , but a few can lead to cervical cancer , the second most deadly form of cancer in women .
Merck , a drugs giant , won federal approval for its HPV vaccine last year and has been lobbying for its adoption .
California , South Dakota , New Hampshire and other states now make it available .
Virginia , Maryland and the District of Columbia are considering the matter , while Washington state this week announced a voluntary scheme .
But no state has mandated its use until now .
Why did Mr Perry do it ?
Some sneerers have noted that his former chief of staff is now a lobbyist for Merck .
Others think that the wily governor is distancing himself from his conservative base so that he can make a plausible vice - presidential candidate in 2008 .
But there is another explanation : that he had the courage to make a politically difficult but sound policy decision .
As he said this week : “ If the medical community developed a vaccine for lung cancer , ” he asked , “ would the same critics oppose it , claiming it would encourage smoking ? ”
9/11 Conspiracy Theories :
The 9/11 Truth Movement in Perspective
by Phil Molé
At the Hyatt Regency O’Hare near Chicago , a crowd of approximately 400 people has gathered on a pleasant summer evening .
Some are old and some are young ; some are dressed in colorful tie - died shirts while others wear dress shirts and slacks , but most seem cheerful and friendly .
We are all waiting for the opening of the main lecture hall for the evening ’s event , the first of many scheduled talks during a weekend - long conference .
We bide some time by looking at the items for sale : DVD copies of Michael Moore ’s Fahrenheit 9/11 , the anti-Karl Rove documentary Bush ’s Brain , and the more recent Walmart : The High Cost of Low Price .
There is nothing especially unusual here , since all of these are available at the Borders or Best Buy near you .
But then as the doors to the main hall are about to open , one anxious attendee tries to start a chant of “ 9/11 was an Inside Job . ”
A few people join in before another attendee tells him , quite emphatically , “ we already know ! ”
The weekend conference is the Chicago meeting for 911truth.org , one of the most visible organizations within a larger coalition known as the “ 9/11 Truth Movement , ” and most of the crowd believes that the United States government planned and orchestrated the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
The statement “ we already know ! ” well summarizes the attitude of the conference attendees toward the material presented during the lectures .
Many at the conference do not seem to be looking for new information that might lead to more accurate perspectives about the events of 9/11 .
A fellow sitting near me admits , “ We already know this stuff ; we ’re here to reconfirm what we already know . ”
The conference is a way for attendees to consolidate their group identity , and try to bring their message to those people at home and abroad who believe the “ official story ” of 9/11 .
As someone who does not share the views of the 9/11 Truth Movement , I have another objective .
I want to listen to their arguments and view their evidence , and understand the reasons why so many likable and otherwise intelligent people are convinced that the United States government planned the murder of nearly 3,000 of its own citizens .
The Collapse of World Trade Center Buildings 1 & 2
When most of us recall the events of 9/11 , we think of the image of those two seemingly indestructible World Trade Center towers crumbling to the ground .
Not surprisingly , their collapse is also a central issue for the 9/11 Truth Movement .
An overwhelming amount of the organization ’s talks and publicity materials address the fall of Buildings 1 and 2 .
But as these materials show , 911truth.org does not believe the official story that the primary damage to the WTC occurred when two airplanes hijacked by terrorists crashed into the towers .
Rather , they maintain that the towers fell due to a controlled demolition , planned in advance by the United States government .
Why do they think this ?
A primary reason seems to be that the collapse of the towers looks like the result of a controlled demolition .
Since there is no structural resistance to gravity in a controlled demolition , the building collapses straight into its own footprint , with each floor “ pancaking ” onto the floors below at or near the speed of a free fall .
Many of the presenters at the Hyatt Conference compared videos of the collapse of the towers with videos of known controlled demolitions , noting the similarity in both the appearance and speed of collapse .
911truth.org maintains that if actually hit by an airplane , the steel structure of the WTC buildings should have provided at least some resistance to the weight of the floors above , causing the falling structure to pitch over to one side rather than pancake straight down .
They further argue that fires caused by burning jet fuel from the crashed planes could not have caused the collapse , since jet fuel burns at a temperature of no more than 1500° Fahrenheit , 1 while a temperature of approximately 2800° is needed to melt steel .
David Heller makes the point in a widely read article :
The official story maintains that fires weakened the buildings .
Jet fuel supposedly burned so hot it began to melt the steel columns supporting the towers .
But steel - framed skyscrapers have never collapsed from fire , since they ’re built from steel that does n’t melt below 2750° Fahrenheit .
No fuel , not even jet fuel , which is really just refined kerosene , will burn hotter than 1500° Fahrenheit .
2
Since burning jet fuel is not hot enough by itself to melt steel , reports that melted steel was observed at Ground Zero suggest to conspiracy theorists that some other incendiary substance must have been introduced .
Finally , many of the leaders of the movement claim that demolition “ squibs ” can be seen in videos of the WTC collapse just before and during the time the towers began to fall .
In professional demolition lingo , a “ squib ” is an explosive device used to weaken building structure during a controlled demolition .
Several presenters at the conference pointed out small bursts of debris spraying out horizontally from the towers during collapse , and identified these as “ squibs ” secretly detonated to fell the buildings .
What can we make of these allegations ?
First , let ’s examine the similarity in appearance between the collapse of the World Trade Center towers and the collapse of buildings destroyed through planned demolitions .
In controlled demolitions , detonating devices weaken or disrupt all major support points in a building at the same time .
Therefore , once the collapse begins , all parts of the building are simultaneously in motion , free - falling to the ground .
However , this is definitely not what happens during the collapse of WTC Buildings 1 and 2 .
Carefully review footage of the collapses , and you will find that the parts of the buildings above the plane impact points begin falling first , while the lower parts of the buildings are initially stationary .
3
The parts of the towers below the impact point do not begin to fall until the higher floors have collapsed onto them .
This is not what we would expect if the towers collapsed from a controlled demolition , but it is exactly what we would expect if the building collapse resulted from damage sustained by the impact of the planes and subsequent fire damage .
A conspiracy theorist may counter that the buildings were rigged to begin falling from the top down , but what are the chances that those planning such a complicated demolition would be able to predict the exact location the planes would impact the towers , and prepare the towers to begin falling precisely there ?
Additionally , footage of the collapse of the South Tower , or Building 2 reveals that the tower did not fall straight down , as the North Tower and buildings leveled by controlled demolitions typically fall .
Instead , the tower tilted toward the direction of the impact point , and then began to pancake downward with the top part of the building tilted at an angle .
The difference between the two collapses can be explained by the different way each airplane struck the buildings .
The first plane struck the North Tower ( Building 1 ) between the 94th to 98th floors and hit it head on , burrowing almost directly toward the core of the building .
The second airplane struck the South Tower between the 78th and 84th floors , but sliced in at an angle , severely damaging the entire northeast corner of the building .
4 Compared with the North Tower , the South Tower sustained damage that was both less evenly distributed and significantly lower on the building ’s frame , requiring the weakened point to support more upper building weight than the corresponding crash site on the North Tower .
This explains both the tilt of the building as it fell toward the weakened corner , and the fact that the South Tower fell first despite being struck after the North Tower was struck .
Again , this scenario makes good sense if the buildings fell due to damage inflicted by the plane crashes , but makes very little sense if the buildings fell due to a planned demolition .
The 9/11 Truth Movement often states or implies that steel would have needed to melt in order for the structure to collapse at the speed of a free - fall .
While there are varying assessments of the temperature of the fire at WTC , most agree that the temperature probably reached 1,000° Fahrenheit and possibly higher than 1,800° F .
Flames of this temperature would be far short of the approximately 2800° F needed to melt steel , but they would have been sufficient to severely reduce the structural integrity of the metal .
Best engineering estimates tell us that steel loses 50 % of its strength at 650° F , and can lose as much as 90 % of its strength at temperatures of 1,800° F.5
Even if we assume temperatures of no higher than 1,000° F during the fire , we would still have more than enough reasons to expect damage severe enough to result in eventual collapse .
The unique structure of the WTC towers exaggerated the problems caused by the weakened steel .
The towers had a lightweight “ perimeter tube ” design consisting of 244 exterior columns of 36 cm square steel box section on 100 cm centers , with 95 % of the structure ’s interior consisting of nothing but air ( see Figure 1 ) .
6
Within this perimeter tube design there was a 27 m by 40 m core , designed to provide additional support to the tower .
Steel trusses , or joists , connected the outer beams to the core at each story , and provided much of the overall support to the weight of each floor .
The impact and explosion of the airplane crashes probably knocked off most of the insulating material intended to fireproof the steel beams , considerably increasing their vulnerability to flames .
The heat of the flames reduced the steel to a fraction of its initial strength , while also causing the steel trusses to expand at each end until they no longer supported the weight of the building ’s floors , triggering the collapse .
The expansion and warping of the steel would have been particularly significant due to temperature differences within the burning structure .
7
Thus , the trusses went limp much like a slackened laundry line , providing little or no resistance to the weight of the floors overhead .
What about the “ melted steel ” that 9/11 conspiracy theorists claim was at Ground Zero ?
Dr. Steven Jones ’ popular article cites several anecdotal sources speaking about flowing or pooled samples of melted steel found at Ground Zero.8
However , the sources in question are informal observations of “ steel ” at Ground Zero , not laboratory results . 9
To many people , any grayish metal looks sufficiently like steel to call it “ steel ” when speaking informally .
To actually establish that the substance in question is steel , we need analytical laboratory results using atomic absorption ( AA ) or another suitable test .
It seems far more likely that the metal seen by the contractors was aluminum , a component of the WTC structural material that melts at a much lower temperature than steel and can look superficially similar to it .
As for the “ squibs ” conspiracy theorists claim to see in videos of the WTC collapse , these are plumes of smoke and debris ejected from the building due to the immense pressure associated with millions of tons of falling towers ( see Figure 2 ) .
Videos of the WTC collapse show that these plumes do not begin until after the towers begin falling and increase in intensity as the collapse continues — this is not the scenario one would expect if the plumes were actually explosives used to cause the buildings to fall .
The Collapse of World Trade Center Building 7
“ Not so fast , ” the 9/11 Truth Movement might say .
How do you explain the collapse of WTC Building 7 , which was not struck by an airplane ?
Many 9/11 conspiracy theorists maintain that the collapse of this building at about 5:20 pm on 9/11 would not have occurred unless it was already prepared for demolition .
The conspiracy theorists assume that damage sustained by WTC 7 during the attack was not sufficient to trigger its collapse .
The site wtc7.net claims that “ fires were observed in Building 7 prior to its collapse , but they were isolated in small parts of the building , and were puny by comparison to other building fires . ”
They further claim that any damage from falling debris from WTC 1 and WTC 2 would have needed to be symmetrical to trigger the pancaking collapse of WTC 7.10
These arguments only reveal the assumptions of their authors .
First , the fires burning in WTC 7 were extremely extensive , as Figure 3 shows .
The reason this is not obvious from 9/11 Truth Movement presentations and documentaries is that they tend to only show the north side of WTC 7 , selectively causing the building to appear both far less ravaged by fire and structural damage than it actually was ( see Figure 4 ) .
Firefighter Richard Banaciski notes the difference in appearance between the north and south sides of the building in his first - person account :
We were told to go to Greenwich and Vesey and see what ’s going on .
So we go there and on the north and east side of 7 it did n’t look like there was any damage at all , but then you looked on the south side of 7 there had to be a hole 20 stories tall in the building , with fire on several floors .
11
Emergency response workers at Ground Zero realized that extensive damage to the lower south section of WTC 7 would cause collapse as early as 3 pm on 9/11 , a fact reported on news broadcasts at the time .
12 Video footage shows that when collapse occurred , the south wall of the building gave in first , which is exactly what we would expect based on the location of the most extensive damage .
As noted for the collapse of the South Tower , the mechanics of the building ’s fall are completely consistent with the nature of the damage sustained .
The planned demolition hypothesis , on the other hand , fails to explain why collapse would begin at exactly the point where damage was inflicted , since the conspirators would have had to been able to predict exactly where debris from the fallen North and South Towers would strike WTC 7 .
And while the makers of the documentary Loose Change comment that WTC 7 “ fell straight down , into a convenient pile , ” the truth is that the pile of debris was 12 stories high and 150 meters across , hardly the kind of “ convenient pile ” described by conspiracy theorists .
13
For those who believe that Building 7 fell due to controlled demolition , some of the most powerful “ evidence ” seemingly comes from WTC leaseholder Larry Silverstein ’s alleged “ confession ” that he authorized the tower ’s destruction .
The quote in question comes from a September , 2002 PBS Special called America Rebuilds , in which Silverstein says :
I remember getting a call from the , er , fire department commander , telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire , and I said , “ We ’ve had such terrible loss of life , maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it . ”
And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse .14
To conspiracy theorists such as Alex Jones at prisonplanet.com , this quote seems to be a “ smoking gun ” because they interpret the phrase “ pull it ” to be “ industry jargon for taking a building down with explosives .
” 15 Silverstein seems to be saying that he and the firefighters decided to pull ( destroy ) Building 7 , and watched it fall after authorizing the demolition .
No building could be controllably demolished so quickly , the conspiracy theorists go on to argue , so WTC 7 must have been prepared for demolition long in advance .
On closer inspection , this supposedly devastating evidence does not seem to mean what the 9/11 Truth Movement thinks it means .
There is far from unanimous industry agreement that the phrase “ pull it ” always signifies a controlled demolition with explosives — more specific phrases such as “ pull away ” would be used to designate the specific operation to be performed .
16
And of course , “ pull ” has many common language uses quite separate from demolition lingo .
But if Silverstein was n’t describing a decision to destroy WTC 7 , what could the words “ pull it ” mean ?
A good place to seek the answer is this September 9 , 2005 statement by Mr. Dara McQuillan , a spokesperson for Larry Silverstein :
In the afternoon of September 11 , Mr. Silverstein spoke to the Fire Department Commander on site at Seven World Trade Center .
The Commander told Mr. Silverstein that there were several firefighters in the building working to contain the fires .
Mr. Silverstein expressed his view that the most important thing was to protect the safety of those firefighters , including , if necessary , to have them withdraw from the building .
Later in the day , the Fire Commander ordered his firefighters out of the building and at 5:20 p.m. the building collapsed .
No lives were lost at Seven World Trade Center on September 11 , 2001 .
As noted above , when Mr. Silverstein was recounting these events for a television documentary he stated , “ I said , you know , we ’ve had such terrible loss of life .
Maybe the smartest thing to do is to pull it . ”
Mr. McQuillan has stated that by “ it , ” Mr. Silverstein meant the contingent of firefighters remaining in the building [ emphasis added ] .17
McQuillan ’s response also indicated that firefighters were present at WTC 7 to evacuate tenants , and worked at the site until late in the afternoon shortly before the collapse occurred .
There is in fact abundant evidence that firefighters were present in and around WTC 7 in evacuation and rescue missions until late in the day on 9/11 .
As one account describes :
The most important operational decision to be made that afternoon was [ that ] the collapse [ of the WTC towers ] had damaged 7 World Trade Center …
It had very heavy fire on many floors and I ordered the evacuation of an area sufficient around to protect our members , so we had to give up some rescue operations that were going on at the time [ emphasis added ] and back the people away far enough so that if 7 World Trade did collapse , we [ would n’t ] lose any more people .
We continued to operate on what we could from that distance and approximately an hour and a half after that order was [ given ] , at 5:30 in the afternoon , World Trade Center collapsed completely .18
Another first responder adds that there were “ tremendous , tremendous fires going on .
Finally they pulled [ emphasis added ] us out .
” 19 The first - hand accounts of rescue operations at WTC 7 tell a consistent story , and the latter quote also uses the word “ pull ” to describe the removal of firefighters from the vicinity of the building , just as McQuillan ’s statement does .
Indeed , there is large agreement between McQuillan ’s response and the testimony of the firefighters , including the fact that :
firefighters were in fact in the vicinity of WTC 7 on 9/11 ; their activities involved evacuation and rescue missions ; firefighters remained near WTC 7 until late in the afternoon of 9/11 ; firefighters realized that WTC 7 would probably fall by approximately 3 pm on 9/11 ; and firefighters pulled back from the building shortly after this realization , and watched the building collapse at approximately 5:20 pm .
Despite the objections of conspiracy theorists , the “ official story ” is both logically coherent and supported by evidence .
By contrast , the story told by the 9/11 Truth Movement is riddled with holes .
It assumes that Larry Silverstein destroyed WTC Building 7 , presumably in order to claim a huge insurance payoff .
But if this is so , why would he tell the world of his plot on a PBS special ?
Furthermore , what relationship does Silverstein have with the United States government who , according to conspiracy theorists , destroyed the WTC buildings in order to terrorize its citizens into accepting domination by a police state ?
20
And if the government controlled the demolition of the WTC buildings in order to strike fear into its citizens , why in this one case would it wait until all of the tenants were evacuated from WTC 7 so that there were no reported casualties ?
21
The government ’s strategy appears wildly inconsistent in the Truth Movement account — killing nearly 3,000 people in the destruction of the two main towers , while allowing an entire afternoon for the tenants of WTC 7 to escape .
We should also note that the alleged 9/11 plot was needlessly complicated , since the building was wired for a controlled demolition and targeted to be hit by airplanes — why not just do the controlled demolition , ditch the airplanes and blame it on the terrorists of your choice ?
There ’s also the problem that , as even the 9/11 Truth Movement admits , prepping a building for demolition takes considerable time and effort .
Usually a building targeted for demolition has been abandoned for considerable time and partially gutted to allow explosives intimate contact with the structure of the building .
But since all of the WTC buildings were occupied right up to 9/11 , how did the government gain access to wire 3 towers for complete demolition without anyone noticing ?
Imagine trying to sneak wires and bombs into buildings while thousands of people are working in offices , riding the elevators and milling about in the halls — that scenario is unlikely in the extreme .
The Pentagon
Many people in the 9/11 Truth Movement believe that the Pentagon was not actually struck by Flight 77 , as the “ official story ” claims .
Instead , they believe that the United States government somehow staged the damage , perhaps through the use of a bomb or strategically fired missile .
This claim first attracted attention in French author Thierry Meyssan ’s book , Pentagate , which claims that the damage done to the Pentagon was too limited to have resulted from the crash of a Boeing 757.22
The documentary “ Loose Change ” claims that the hole left in the Pentagon by the alleged airplane was “ a single hole , no more than 16 feet in diameter , ” and that no remains whatsoever of Flight 77 were found at the crash site .
23
To dramatically support this last point , conspiracy theorists cite CNN correspondent Jamie McIntyre ’s report from the crash site on 9/11 , which says , “ From my close - up inspection , there ’s no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon . ” 24
Like the previously discussed arguments about WTC 7 not being damaged enough to fall on its own , complaints about the size of the hole in the Pentagon left by Flight 77 rely on selective choice of perspective .
9/11 conspiracy theorists like to reference pictures of the damaged Pentagon in which the hole made by the plane appears to be small , but are n’t as fond of the pictures accurately showing the full extent of the damage .
Some conspiracy theorists also do n’t seem satisfied that the shape of the hole matches that expected for a crashed airplane .
But the expectation that the plane should have left an immediately recognizable hole in the building is delusional — a speeding Boeing 757 will not leave a snow - angel style impression of itself in a concrete building ( versus the mostly - glass exterior of the WTC buildings , which did leave an outline of a plane ) .
And the contention that no remains of Flight 77 were found at the crash site is simply absurd .
Many pictures taken of the area around the Pentagon crash site clearly show parts of an airplane in the wreckage .
In an excellent article about 9/11 conspiracy theories in Popular Mechanics , blast expert Allyn E. Kilsheimer describes his own observations as the first structural engineer to arrive at the Pentagon after Flight 77 crashed :
I saw the marks of the plane wing on the face of the building .
I picked up parts of the plane with the airline markings on them .
I held in my hand the tail section of the plane , and I found the black box .
Kilsheimer ’s eyewitness account is backed up by photos of plane wreckage inside and outside the building .
Kilsheimer adds : “ I held parts of uniforms from crew members in my hands , including body parts .
Okay ? ” 25
But if there is so much evidence that a plane crashed into the Pentagon , why did CNN correspondent Jamie McIntyre report that he could find none ?
The answer is that McIntyre did not report this at all , and the 9/11 Truth Movement is once again selectively manipulating evidence to fit their conclusions .
When McIntyre noted that no debris from a plane was observable near the Pentagon , he was responding to a specific question asked by CNN anchor Judy Woodruff during the segment .
Flight 77 came in flying very low , and there had been speculation that the plane might have struck the ground shortly before reaching the Pentagon .
McIntyre ’s response , when quoted in full , makes clear that he is saying that there was no evidence that the plane hit the ground before hitting the Pentagon , but he certainly does not deny that the plane struck the Pentagon itself .
WOODRUFF : Jamie , Aaron was talking earlier — or one of our correspondence was talking earlier — I think — actually , it was Bob Franken — with an eyewitness who said it appeared that that Boeing 757 , the American jet , American Airline jet , landed short of the Pentagon .
Can you give us any better idea of how much of the plane actually impacted the building ?
MCINTYRE :
You know , it might have appeared that way , but from my close - up inspection , there ’s no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon .
The only site is the actual site of the building that ’s crashed in [ emphasis added ] , and as I said , the only pieces left that you can see are small enough that you can pick up in your hand .
There are no large tail sections , wing sections , fuselage , nothing like that anywhere around , which would indicate that the entire plane crashed into the side of the Pentagon and then caused the side to collapse [ emphasis added ] .
26
Note that McIntyre never questions that an airplane crash damaged the Pentagon , and indeed describes seeing many pieces of the aircraft around the crash site in an earlier section of the CNN transcript .
27
Of course , this has not stopped conspiracy theorists from picking and choosing the evidence to push their own agendas .
Flight 93 and Other Alleged Anomalies
On April 5 , 2006 , the creators of the 9/11 conspiracy documentary “ Loose Change ” and their supporters decided to attend the premiere of the film “ United 93 , ” about the hijacked airplane that crashed on 9/11 .
They wanted to take the opportunity to expose the alleged lies about this flight , and in the words of one “ Loose Change ” forum member , to “ bite these bastards where it hurts , and have this Fight 93 movie backfire on them .
” 28 To many Americans , the passengers on United 93 who fought back against the terrorists and caused it to crash before it could reach its target are heroes , but the 9/11 Truth Movement sees things differently .
Depending on which conspiracy theorist you ask , you will either learn that Flight 93 actually landed safely , or that a US military jet shot the plane out of the sky .
29
The first claim stems from confusion in the initial Associated Press ( AP ) reports between Flight 93 and Flight 1989 , the latter of which did land at Cleveland ’s Hopkins Airport on 9/11 .
The AP subsequently corrected the error , but many conspiracy theorists have not followed suit .30
The second claim rests largely on unsupported assertions that the main body of the engine and other large parts of the plane turned up miles from the main wreckage site — too far away to have resulted from an ordinary crash .
This is incorrect , because the engine was found only 300 yards from the main crash site , and its location was consistent with the direction in which the plane had been traveling .
31 Furthermore , the black box for the flight records the struggle onboard preceding the plane ’s crash .
Conspiracy theorists are left with not only an evidentially worthless theory , but also a confusing one .
Why would the same U.S. government that allegedly destroyed the WTC shoot down Flight 93 before it could cause similar damage to other buildings ?
Of course , this question assumes a standard of logical consistency that the 9/11 Truth Movement seems to lack .
Another alleged flight anomaly concerns the supposed “ stand down ” order given by the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) on 9/11 to allow the hijacked airplanes to reach their destinations without interference .
The 9/11 Truth Movement believes that NORAD had the capability of locating and intercepting planes on 9/11 , and its failure to do so indicates a government conspiracy to allow the attacks to occur .
To support this assertion , they claim that NORAD could have quickly neutralized the hijacked planes because flight interceptions are routine , with 67 such intercepts occurring before 9/11.32
Significantly , this claim does not specify the length of time over which these alleged intercepts occurred , or tell us whether they took place near major cities or over , say , miles of open ocean .
More specific and accurate information comes from the Popular Mechanics article , which states :
In the decade before 9/11 , NORAD intercepted only one civilian plane over North America : golfer Payne Stewart ’s Learjet , in October 1999 .
With passengers and crew unconscious from cabin decompression , the plane lost radio contact but remained in transponder contact until it crashed .
Even so , it took an F - 16 1 hour and 22 minutes to reach the stricken jet .
Rules in effect back then , and on 9/11 , prohibited supersonic flight on intercepts .
33
It is not a quick or easy matter to locate and intercept a plane behaving erratically .
NORAD personnel must first attempt repeated communication with the planes in question to rule out more mundane problems , and then must contact appropriate military personnel to scramble the planes and direct them to the appropriate location .
The situation on 9/11 was further complicated by the fact that terrorists on the hijacked jets had turned off or disabled the onboard radar transponders .
Without a transponder signal identifying the airplanes , each hijacked airplane would have been only one moving blip among many others on NORAD ’S screens , making it much harder to track .
Thus , even a direct NORAD decision to intercept any of the hijacked planes on 9/11 would have still entailed a significant amount of time to reach the jet — time that was simply not available on 9/11 .
Various other conspiracy theories focus on the government ’s alleged foreknowledge of the terrorist attacks .
One popular theory suggests there was a suspiciously high volume of “ put ” trading of airline stocks in the days just before 9/11 .
Since “ put ” trading is effectively a gamble that the price of a stock will decrease , conspiracy theorists surmise that trading “ insiders ” knew about the coming events of 9/11 and placed their bets accordingly .
While this may look suspicious in isolation , the general volume of put trading on these stocks reached similar levels at earlier points in the year .
The spike in American Airlines trading was the highest of the all airline companies involved , but that ’s hardly surprising considering that the company had just released a major warning about possible losses .
34 Indeed , general bad news about the airline industry prompted investment companies to advise their clients to take the put options , removing any need to blame the trading options on foreknowledge of the attacks .
Another theory alleges that the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) arrived at the World Trade Center on September 10 , 2001 , thus showing that the government knew about the coming disaster .
This claim is based on a statement by Tom Kenney of the Massachusetts task force , who told CBS news anchor Dan Rather on September 13 , 2001 , “ We ’re currently , uh , one of the first teams that was deployed to support the city of New York for this disaster .
We arrived on , uh , late Monday night and went into action on Tuesday morning .
And not until today did we get a full opportunity to work , uh , the entire site . ” 35 The rather mundane explanation for this quote is that Mr. Kenney confused his days — not an unusual occurrence for someone who had been working for more than two long days in emergency response activities .
Thus , a straightforward interpretation of Kenney ’s response is that he arrived at Ground Zero on 9/11 ( which he incorrectly identified as Monday , rather than Tuesday ) , went into action on 9/12 ( mistakenly identified as Tuesday ) and did not get a chance to work the whole WTC site until “ today ” ( the day he was speaking to Rather , or Thursday , 9/13 ) .
Additionally , many sources document the arrival of FEMA on 9/11 , and Kenney ’s wife confirmed the day her husband was dispatched to Ground Zero as 9/11.36
The degree to which the 9/11 Truth Movement will exaggerate and exploit simple misunderstandings does not speak well of their concern for truth .
Much of this discussion has focused on explanations given by the 9/11 Truth Movement , but we should note that the explanations they do n’t give are just as problematic .
I have not been able to locate any significant discussion of al Qaeda , radical Islamic terrorists or the modern history of the Middle East in any of the 9/11 Truth Movement ’s writings .
The most likely reason for this is that , like most other Americans , many of them simply did n’t pay very much attention to the Middle East before 9/11 .
Yet , it is impossible to understand the threat of terrorism unless we also understand how the fall of the Ottoman empire , the fragmentation of much of the Middle East into new nations with largely arbitrary boundaries after WW II , Muslim reaction to the creation of the state of Israel , the birth of Islamic fundamentalism , conflict with and influence by Soviet Russia , and frustration over America ’s support for Israel have shaped the ideology and mission of groups like al Qaeda .
Islamic terrorist groups arose in this context , and have actively and repeatedly targeted American interests for over two decades .
The idea that Islamic terrorists would target U.S. buildings for attack fits well with recent events over the past two decades , including :
an attack by the radical Hezbollah faction on Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983 ;
the hijacking of the Achille Lauro in 1985 ;
a truck bomb attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 ; killing 6 people and injuring over 1,000 more ;
a thwarted attempt to blow up 12 planes heading from the Philippines to the U.S. in January , 1995 ;
an attack on Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996 , killing 19 U.S. military personnel and injuring hundreds more ;
the bombings of U.S. Embassy buildings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 , killing 12 Americans and 200 Kenyans and Tanzanians ;
a thwarted attempt by Ahmed Ressam to attack Los Angeles international airport in late 1999 ;
a suicide boat bombing against the U.S.S. Cole on October 12 , 2000 , killing 17 sailors and injuring 39 others .37
Additionally , there is well - documented evidence that Osama Bin Laden has repeatedly organized and prompted attacks against the United States .
His role as a financier for major terrorist organizations and the leader of al Qaeda is well - established .
Bin Laden issued a 1996 fatwa officially declaring a jihad against the United States , and a second fatwa in 1998 declaring “ to kill the Americans and their allies — civilian and military is an individual duty for any Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it .
” 38 Since bin-Laden and al Qaeda have officially claimed responsibility for the attacks of 9/11 , there is no point in seeking alternative theories .
39
The best explanation for the events of 9/11 is that it was the latest and most damaging attack yet in a series of attacks by radical Islamic terrorists who wish to end what they believe is an evil U.S. foreign policy .
As a nation , we were psychologically and strategically unprepared for this attack due to our failure to acknowledge the seriousness of the threat .
Sadly , the 9/11 Truth Movement continues to divert its gaze from the real problems , preferring the solace of delusions to reality .
Conclusion : The Power of Conspiracy Theories
This article has analyzed the arguments of the 9/11 Truth Movement and found them lacking .
Yet , the 400 people who attended the conference and the thousands of others who support their efforts find these theories convincing , and the reason does not necessarily seem to be grounded in common political ideology .
Based on my informal survey of the crowd at the Hyatt conference , I noted that attendees seemed to come from each extreme of the political spectrum .
There were representatives of the far right who decry any form of government authority , but there were also members of the far left waging a tireless campaign against the perceived evils of capitalism and imperialism .
We need to return to a question posed near the beginning of this discussion :
Why do so many intelligent and promising people find these theories so compelling ?
There are several possible answers to this question , none of them necessarily exclusive of the others .
One of the first and most obvious is distrust of the American government in general , and the Bush administration in particular .
This mistrust is not entirely without basis .
The American government deceived its citizens about the real human costs of Vietnam , and resorted to military tactics that were ethically questionable even by the standards of war .
The revelations of Watergate , the Iran - Contra scandal , and other nefarious schemes great and small have understandably eroded public confidence in government .
Couple that with an administration , that took office after the most controversial presidential election in more than a century , and one that backed out of international agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol , misled citizens about the science of global warming and stem cell research , initiated a war in Iraq based on unsupportable “ intelligence ” about weapons of mass destruction , and failed to respond in adequately to the effects of a hurricanes in the Gulf Coast , and you have strong motivations for suspicion .
40 ( Suffice it to say , admiration for George W. Bush is not my motivation for defending him against the claims of conspiracy theorists ) .
However , there are a few things to be said about suspicion .
First , there is the simple philosophical point that suspicion alone demonstrates nothing — any theory needs evidence in its favor if it is to be taken seriously .
Second , the mistakes made by our government in the past are qualitatively different from a conscious decision to kill thousands of its own citizens in order to justify the oppression of others .
Most importantly , there is the fact that most of what we know about the bad decisions made by our government is only knowable due to the relative transparency with which our government operates , and the freedom to disseminate and discuss this information .
The full irony of this last point hit me while I was at the conference .
Here was a group of about 400 people gathered to openly discuss the evil schemes of the U.S. government , whom they accuse of horrible atrocities in the service of establishing a police state .
But if America really was a police state with such terrible secrets to protect , surely government thugs would have stormed the lecture halls and arrested many of those present , or would at the very least have conducted behind the scenes arrests and jailed the movement ’s leaders .
Yet even the most vocal leaders of the 9/11 Truth Movement are still going strong , and no one at the conference seemed very worried about government reprisals .
This fact seemingly indicates that at some level , the conspiracy theorists themselves do n’t really believe what they are saying .
Another reason for the appeal of 9/11 conspiracies is that they are easy to understand .
As previously mentioned , most Americans did not know or care to know much about the Middle East until the events of 9/11 forced them to take notice .
( The brilliant satirical newspaper The Onion poked fun at this fact with its article “ Area Man Acts Like He ’s Been Interested In Afghanistan All Along ” ) .
41
The great advantage of the 9/11 Truth Movement ’s theories is that they do n’t require you to know anything about the Middle East , or for that matter , to know anything significant about world history or politics .
This points to another benefit of conspiracy theories — they are oddly comforting .
Chaotic , threatening events are difficult to comprehend , and the steps we might take to protect ourselves are unclear .
With conspiracy theory that focuses on a single human cause , the terrible randomness of life assumes an understandable order .
The great writer Thomas Pynchon memorably expressed this point in his novel Gravity ’s Rainbow : “ If there is something comforting — religious , if you want — about paranoia , there is still also anti-paranoia , where nothing is connected to anything , a condition not many of us can bear for long . ” 42 The promiscuity of conspiracy theories toward evidence thus becomes part of their appeal — they can link virtually any ideas of interest to the theorist into a meaningful whole .
This point was illustrated nicely during the Q & A session following the conference screening of Rick Siegel ’s Eyewitness : Hoboken .
An attendee wanted to know what role the Freemasons played in the plot , and seemed very concerned that Siegel ’s account had neglected them .
After waffling on the answer for a few moments without appeasing his questioner , Siegel finally relented and said , “ Sure , they ’re involved . ”
And why not ?
With the standards of evidence used by conspiracy theorists , there is no reason why the Freemasons , the Bavarian Illuminati , or the Elders of Zion cannot also be involved in the 9/11 plot — it just depends on what you find the most solace in believing .
As it turns out , some conspiracy theorists do throw one or more of these other parties into the mix , as a popular and bogus rumor that 4,000 Jews mysteriously failed to come to work on 9/11 shows .43
Solace is something all of us needed after the horrible events of 9/11 , and each of us is entitled to a certain degree of freedom in its pursuit .
However , there is no moral right to seek solace at the expense of truth , especially if the truth is precisely what we most need to avoid the mistakes of the past .
Truth matters for its own sake , but it also matters because it is our only defense against the evils of those who cynically exploit truth claims to serve their own agendas .
It is concern for the truth that leads us to criticize our own government when necessary , and to insist that others who claim to do so follow the same rigorous standards of evidence and argument .
9/11 was a powerful reminder of how precious and fragile human life and liberty are — the greatest possible rebuke to those who would live in service to delusions .

In addition to the specific sources cited above , readers seeking responsible analysis of the claims of the 9/11 Truth Movement can use the following general sources :
Guy Ritchie hates his wife Madonna 's music .
The ' Hung Up ' singer admitted her director husband - who she married in 2000 - is not a fan of her more recent work , but her children Lourdes , nine , and Rocco , six , love it .
She told French magazine VSD : " My children adore everything that I do .
They love my dance music .
My husband is n't a great fan . "
Madonna - who is currently on the road with her ' Confessions ' tour - also revealed that she struggles with the trappings of fame .
She added : " Of course I regret losing the freedom of being able to go out alone to a club - dancing alone without anyone to disturb me or draw attention to me .
" I regret not being able to take advantage of such anonymity .
Last week , I went to a club where I danced with lots of my friends .
It was very enjoyable . "
Despite her love of clubbing , Madonna insists her she devotes the majority of her free time to her children .
She said : " The small amount of free time that I have , I reserve for my children .
There 's the ice rink , pizza , DVD or a horse ride with my daughter .
" That may seem boring to you , but that 's how it is .
The times have changed for me . "
Pity the poor bacterium , the Rodney Dangerfield of the unicellular world .
It eats our trash , makes soil fertile , turns the food we swallow into useful vitamins , and yet it gets no respect .
Most people , when you get right down to it , are just plain bacteria bigots .
They want to run all 2,000 - plus species of bacteria out of town just because of a few ornery germs that can harm us .
And now , it seems , our pursuit of a bacteria - free world is making us sick .
Got antibacterial soap ?
It could be doing you more harm than good .
A study published this month in Chest ( trust me , it 's a medical journal ) finds that antibiotic exposure during infancy is associated with asthma .
This follows a string of studies from the past few years , such as those from the Immune Tolerance Network , revealing that early exposure to harmful bacteria builds a healthy immune system .
Kids exposed to endotoxin - releasing bacteria , for example , are less likely to be allergic to dogs and cats .
These docs have a sense of humor , too .
They call this the Pigpen Effect , after the Peanut 's character with his protective cloud of dirt .
It 's a dirty little secret the antibacterial soap people do n't want you to know about .
The rising incidence of asthma and allergies in the developed ( cleaner ) world , doctors say , could be tied to the relatively sterile environments our children live in compared to a generation ago .
Children not exposed to harmful bacteria , or conversely , given antibiotics to kill bacteria , do not receive the germ workout required to make antibodies .
More specifically , they do not develop T - helper cells , which fight foreign cellular invaders and minimize allergies .
Unfortunately the American consumer is at war with all bacteria .
According to the Soap and Detergent Association ( too bad its acronym could n't spell SUD ) , more than three - quarters of liquid soap and more than a quarter of bar soaps on supermarket shelves contain triclosan , an antibiotic that kills most bacteria , both good and bad .
Ridding ourselves of bacteria is a hopeless endeavor .
Bacteria outnumber human cells in your body 10 to 1 .
This is a good thing .
The entire digestive tract is lined with bacteria , from top to , uh , bottom .
These bacteria work with the body 's own chemicals in breaking down food , converting it to useful vitamins and minerals , and making sure the intestinal walls can absorb the nutrients for the bloodstream to circulate .
Without these bacteria , we could not digest food .
Babies , born relatively bacteria - free , are extremely limited in what they can eat .
Human skin contains many species of harmless bacteria .
Their presence prevents harmful bacteria , what we commonly call germs , from gaining a foothold on your skin .
Numerous studies show that antibacterial soap is no more effective than ordinary soap in cleaning your hands .
Either kind lifts off germ - laden dirt .
But antibacterial soap kills helpful bacteria on the skin , freeing up valuable real estate so that harmful bacteria can move in later .
The marketing of antibacterial products during flu and cold season is a scam , because colds and flu are caused by viruses , not bacteria .
Most bacterial infections in the United States are food - borne : salmonella , listeria , and E. coli .
We can not wash food in triclosan .
Apparently we tolerate feces in our food supply yet reach for an antibacterial wipe to clean some jelly off the counter .
It 's enough to make you sick .

I 'll add them as I see them .
There are a lot more English bastards these days than there used to be .
Professor John Ermisch at ISER , University of Essex , explains why in his fascinating new working paper : An Economic History of Bastardy in England and Wales ( PDF ) .
Here 's the summary :
A remarkable feature of English demographic history is the explosion in childbearing outside marriage during the last quarter of the twentieth century , after 400 years of relative stability .
Over the period 1845 - 1960 , the percentage of births outside marriage moved within a small range , averaging about 5 % .
The paper finds that , up to the First World War , higher unemployment discouraged marriage and increased non-marital births , with a recovery in marriages in the subsequent year .
This pattern is consistent with poorer labour market conditions discouraging marriages among pregnant would - be brides , thereby increasing bastardy .
During the inter - war period , higher unemployment continued to produce postponement of marriages , but non-marital childbearing was no longer linked to unemployment , nor is there a clear link to unemployment in the post - war period .
After 1960 , when the contraceptive pill was introduced , childbearing outside marriage began to climb slowly , and it exploded after 1980 , reaching 42 % in 2004 .
This was partly driven by a steep increase in the age - specific non-marital births rates of women aged 20 - 34 from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s , after which they stabilised at a high level .
At fixed average non-marital and marital age specific birth rates , this increase in the proportion of births outside marriage can be mainly accounted for by a large fall in the proportion of women aged 20 - 34 who are married , which is in turn associated with a dramatic rise in cohabiting unions .
These unions are short - lived before either dissolving or being converted into marriage .
But this begs the question : why did n’t average non-marital fertility rates fall when more women cohabited ?
Women had the means ( contraception and legal abortion ) to avoid nonmarital childbearing if they wanted to do so , and so the substitution of cohabiting unions for marriages need not have raised non-marital fertility .
A theory of marriage market search ( courtship ) in which out - of - wedlock childbearing is an option suggests why it may be a rational choice , even when fertility can be controlled .
A woman ’s welfare as a single mother is likely to be influenced by the prevalence of single mothers in the population , which may reflect social stigma against single mothers .
When their prevalence is low , nonmarital childbearing is discouraged .
A temporary change in the determinants of non-marital childbearing that raises it , like the large rise in unemployment in the late 1970s / early 1980s , can produce rapid erosion of the stigma and a self - reinforcing rise in childbearing outside marriage .
This dynamic is likely to be concentrated among a segment of the population who already had stronger incentives to have a child before marriage .
If this social influence model is valid , then it is likely to be the case that socio-economic differences in the chances of having a child before marriage widen as childbearing outside marriage becomes more common , and the paper provides evidence that this has happened .
An alternative , or complementary , explanation stresses the role of the rise in cohabiting unions and delay in partnership .
These generated an increase in non-marital births by increasing the unmarried population .
This view also points to the operation of a social influence model in explaining the dramatic rise in cohabitation , and the paper provides evidence of a diffusion of cohabiting unions from the better educated to the less educated population .

No. 3 bank to buy MBNA , creating the nation 's largest credit card issuer ; 6,000 jobs to be cut .
Video More video Bank of America is buying credit card giant MBNA for $ 35 billion .
CNN 's Andy Serwer reports .
Play video
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - Bank of America , betting that financial " supermarkets " are the future despite recent skepticism , announced Thursday that it will buy credit card giant MBNA Corp. for $ 35 billion .
The cash - and - stock deal would make Bank of America ( Research ) , already the nation 's third - biggest bank , also the largest credit card issuer in the country , with 40 million active accounts containing $ 143 billion in outstanding balances .
The Charlotte , N.C. - based financial services giant ranked fourth in the card business at the end of 2004 , according to CardWeb.com .
Bank of America plans to eliminate 6,000 jobs once the merger is done .
Subject to regulatory and MBNA shareholder approval , the deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter .
( To read about how the deal will affect cardholders , click here . )
The banking behemoth has long had a voracious appetite for adding customers through acquisitions .
Two weeks ago , Bank of America took a $ 3 billion stake in a Chinese bank .
It spent last year digesting FleetBoston Financial as part of a takeover valued at $ 47 billion on the day it was announced .
Even so , the Bank of America deal caught Wall Street off guard .
Bank of America stock fell on the news , trading down throughout Thursday 's session .
MBNA shares jumped about 25 percent on the news .
Art Hogan , the chief market analyst at Jeffries & Co. , said Wall Street 's reaction reflected the fact that the 31 percent premium that Bank of America is paying for MBNA " has n't been baked into the market yet . "
The deal values MBNA at $ 27.62 a share , or about $ 35 billion based on Wednesday 's closing prices .
Under deal terms , MBNA shareholders will receive $ 4.125 in cash and 0.5009 shares of Bank of America common stock for each of their shares .
That would be a 31 percent premium above Wednesday 's $ 21.07 close for MBNA .
" It 's obviously a very rich price , " said Richard Bove , an analyst with Punk , Ziegel & Co .
But he said the deal makes sense for Bank of America , whose yields on mortgage loans have flattened in the face of low interest rates .
" If you have a portfolio filled with mortgages , you have a real problem in that you 've got to get higher yields , " he said .
" Even though they paid a rich price , it makes sense from a balance - sheet standpoint . "
Besides , he said , Bank of America is known to pay high premiums for companies and then " slash and burn " costs to get deals to work .
Motives aside , Bove and Hogan agreed that the MBNA sale sends one strong signal : that the heavily hyped concept of one - stop shopping for consumers is " alive and well " in financial services .
Recent moves by rivals , including steps by Citigroup to shed some consumer businesses and Morgan Stanley to explore spinning off its Discover credit card unit , had called that vision into question .
At the same time there have been other deals in the credit card business .
Washington Mutual , the nation 's biggest savings and loan , announced one early this month for Providian Financial , one of the largest independent credit card companies , for about $ 6.5 billion in cash and stock .
Some analysts had said the Providian deal would make Washington Mutual , long the subject of takeover rumors , too large to be acquired .
But the Bank of America - MBNA deal signals that Washington Mutual could still be in play , said Hogan , who sees further consolidation in the industry .
" When you see a deal of this size , obviously ( Washington Mutual ) is still acquirable , " said Hogan .
What does 1 + 1 equal ?
At an analyst meeting after announcement , Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis and MBNA CEO Bruce Hammonds faced some skepticism about the deal and whether it would benefit shareholders in the long run .
About 22 percent of the combined company 's customer base already consists of MBNA and Bank of America cardholders .
What 's more , MBNA has approximately $ 15 billion in credit card receivables through partnerships with 350 financial institutions .
The Bank of America deal turns MBNA into a direct competitor of its current partners .
Bank of America management told analysts that they expect to lose some business as a result , leading to a 7 percent drop in revenues by 2009 .
They declined to discuss specific partnerships , including a major one that MBNA has with American Express .
Instead , Lewis and Hammonds touted the benefits of the deal .
Lewis said MBNA adds to Bank of America business lines that are less prone to market conditions .
He also made it clear that he considers MBNA 's marketing muscle to be just as valuable as its credit card accounts .
MBNA sells its credit cards through partnerships with 5,000 professional organizations , universities , sports teams and other financial institutions .
MBNA , continued Lewis , also gives Bank of America access to credit card customers in the mid- and upper Midwest and a handful of overseas locations , including the United Kingdom and Spain .
Lewis said MBNA 's forays abroad , especially its success in Great Britain , " opens up a whole new thought process for us . "
For its part , MBNA has been trying diversify into new products and expand abroad in the face of sluggish top line growth , according to Hammonds .
The Wilmington , Del. - based company reported in April a 94 percent drop in first - quarter earnings due to higher - than - expected payment volumes and a restructuring charge .
MBNA also issued a profit warning .
Bank of America promises a level of consumer access that it can't get on its own , said Hammonds , who would become CEO of Bank of America 's credit card division , to be headquartered in Delaware .
Direct marketing " does n't work as well anymore , " he said .
And neither does telemarketing because of do - not - call lists .
Hammonds , who was involved in a harrowing helicopter crash in New York City this month , said Bank of America also gives MBNA a foothold in a market that so far the company has been unable to crack : China .
On June 16 , Bank of America announced that it had bought a 9 percent stake in China Construction Bank , the country 's second - largest commercial bank .
Bank of America has the option to increase its stake in coming years .
" We 've been unable to forge the right kind of relationships ( necessary to enter the Chinese market ) , " said Hammonds .
The fact that China lacks the sophisticated consumer credit databases that exist in the United States does n't dampen Hammonds ' enthusiasm .
" We can use our old - fashioned judgmental lending , " said Hammonds .

Microsoft invented Ajax : Let 's give credit where it's due
It is n't very hip to compliment Microsoft these days .
There are many manifestations of this bias , but none more aggravating to me than to whom the credit for Ajax goes .
For example , in Lee Gomes ' much discussed Wall Street Journal article on programming languages , he says :
" Both Ruby on Rails and Ajax were developed by small software - consulting companies eager to let the world know about their skills . "
This is simply wrong about Ajax .
There is also this quotation from Mitchell Baker , the Mozilla chief , in The Economist .
The context of the statment is Firefox 's contribution to Ajax innovation .
" Web 2.0 could have happneded a lot earlier , if Microsoft had not had a monopoly for a decade . "
What chutzpah !
Microsoft invented Ajax in 1999 .
It just took the rest of the software world 6 years to catch up .
I 've developed a brief timeline at the end of this post .
The two key technologies for Ajax – the ability to modify HTML on the client side and the ability to initiate and capture an asynchronous HTTP request – were introduced in Internet Explorer in 1997 and 1999 , respectively .
Outlook Web Access was the first product that I know of to use both heavily .
It took about 5 years for Safari 1.2 and 6 years for Opera 8 to implement XMLHttpRequest or a XMLHttpRequest - like API .
Firefox did n't have a production release until 2002 .
Once the non-IE browsers caught up developers could now use asynchronous requests to spruce up their Web apps and still have it work in multiple browsers .
Ajax development became more affordable , and , therefore , more popular .
Prominent and very well - designed sites like Google Maps and GMail made users and developers aware of what is possible .
Finally -- 6 years later -- Jesse James Garrett of Adaptive Path coined a catchy phrase : the term Ajax was born .
Ajax is popular now because using asynchronous requests in Web apps is affordable and well - known sites use it .
Libraries like Prototype smooth over the browser - specific API wrinkles even further to make life easier .
Make no bones about it : the fundamental innovation behind Ajax was created by Microsoft .
Let ’s give credit where credit is due .
Ajax Timeline :
1997 – IE 4.0 introduces ability to modify the UI via the DOM and client - side script
1998 , 2000 , and 2004 – W3C releases or updates standards on the DOM
1999 – Internet Explorer includes XMLHttpRequest
2002 – First production Firefox release
2004 – Safari 1.2 released with XMLHttpRequest support .
2004 – Google Maps , GMail , and other popular Web apps demonstrate great UI design with AJAX
2005 – Opera 8 released with XMLHttpRequest support
2005 – Adaptive Path coins the term AJAX and makes it popular

You are right but I agree with Mozilla chief because XUL was ready for production use a lot of years ago !
Posted by : Grub at January 11 , 2006 09:35 PM
Actually , there was a technology that is very similar to AJAX that was around and I used prior to AJAX called Pushlets .
It 's the same concept without the standard .
So if you really want to give credit , you should be talking to the Pushlet people .
They did it first .

Open Courseware Movement Grows
MIT is putting the course materials for all their courses online and other universities are following suit .
By the end of this year , the contents of all 1,800 courses taught at one of the world 's most prestigious universities will be available online to anyone in the world , anywhere in the world .
Learners wo n't have to register for the classes , and everyone is accepted .
The cost ?
It 's all free of charge .
The OpenCourseWare movement , begun at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in 2002 and now spread to some 120 other universities worldwide , aims to disperse knowledge far beyond the ivy - clad walls of elite campuses to anyone who has an Internet connection and a desire to learn .
Lectures , diagrams , graphs , and other course material will all be widely and cheaply available - mostly for free .
You too can go through courses from MIT .
The MIT site ( ocw.mit.edu ) , along with companion sites that translate the material into other languages , now average about 1.4 million visits per month from learners " in every single country on the planet , " Ms. Margulies says .
Those include Iraq , Darfur , " even Antarctica , " she says .
" We hear from [ the online students ] all the time with inspirational stories about how they are using these materials to change their lives .
They 're really , really motivated . "
What is lagging ?
Videos of the lectures .
So far MIT has published 1,550 of its courses for OCW and plans to get the rest online by the end of this year .
The materials for each course vary .
Full videos of lectures , one of the most popular features , are available for only 26 courses , about 1,000 hours of video in all .
" We 'd like to do more video because it 's really quite popular and our users love it , " Marguiles says .
" But it 's quite expensive . "
The program relies on " generous support " from foundations , individuals , and MIT itself for funding , she says .
We still need two more essential elements : First , automated online tests .
Students need a way to check their level of knowledge .
Once they are confident they know to pass tests then they need to be able to go to a school and get tested in person so that they can get credits toward degrees .
How will smart kids use the ability to watch lectures and take tests online and earn credit ?
They start earning college credits sooner and get through college faster .
Rather than impress people with a Harvard or MIT degree they 'll impress with college degrees earned at age 19 and younger .
They 'll also save a hundred thousand dollars a piece and start making big money sooner .
Why work for minimum wage while in college at age 20 when you can start earning several times that at 19 by graduating sooner ?
The OpenCourseWare Consortium site serves as a good starting point if you want to look for online course material .
高度ユビキタス化社会の到来は、プライバシーを守ろうとする人々のリテラシーをこうもややこしくする。一昨年書こうと思って準備したもののその後放置していた話を以下に書く。
2004年7月11日の日記に書いていたように、コンビニエンスストアのam/pmには、club apという会員サービスがある。am/pmで販売されているEdyカードには図1のように、club ap用の「仮パスワード」を記した紙が同封されている。
これを使って、club ap のWebサイトでユーザ登録をするようになっている（図2）。
このサービスで特徴的なのは、「 Edyご利用実績」という、am/pmでの買い物履歴を閲覧できるというものである。
経費管理や家計簿に役立つというが（そうかあ？）、この仕組みの真の目的はam/pm側のメリットにある。これについては以下の記事などが参考になるだろう。
am/pmで同じお茶を買い続ける率は？──Edyを使ったCRMの秘訣 , ITmediaニュース , 2005 年7月13 日 しかし商品を軸にデータをとるPOSの場合、顧客が何を買ったかは分かっても、誰に買ったかが分からないという問題点があった。 新しいCMSの手段を導入するにあたり、大きな目標としたのは2つ。顧客と購買履歴をひも付けることと、顧客1人1人にマッチした商品提案や情報配信を行うことだった。 （中略） POS 単体では、いつ何がいくつ売れたかしか分からない。POSデータに、Edyによる購買履歴と顧客のIDを組み合わせることにより可能になるのが「ある製品を買った人が、次に類似商品の中で何を買ったか」の追跡だ。
モード FeliCaのビジネス活用（その1）−−am / pmジャパン , 日経IT Pro , 2004年8 月 Edyそのものは匿名性のある電子マネーであるため，普通に顧客が精算した場合には誰が使ったのかという情報は収集できない。そこでam/pmジャパンはEdy導入と同時に，Edy利用者向けの会員制サービス「Club ap」を作った。Edyカード利用者に個人属性を登録してもらい，Edyカードに割り振られたID番号と対応付ける仕組みである。具体的には，パソコンでam/pmのClub ap登録サイトにアクセスし，EdyカードのID番号と個人属性を登録する。
Club ap会員の購買行動を把握することで，購買行動の属性分析などを通じて商品開発に結びつけるのが狙いである。会員にはメール・アドレスも登録してもらい，キャンペーン情報などの告知にも活用している。
これだけの話ならば、従来のポイントカードでも同様だ。個人情報（住所氏名、電話番号、メールアドレス）を書かせるポイントカードを発行しているドラッグストアなどが、従来より存在していた。自分の個人情報と購買履歴と引き換えに店から何らかのメリットが得られればいいと思う人が、利用していたであろう。
ところが、実際に試してみると、思いもよらない結果となった。図3は、club apにメンバー登録した際に履歴を照会した様子である。
メンバー登録した人だけ購買行動が記録されるのかと思っていたら、なんと、登録前から記録されていたのである。（しかも、「3ヶ月前から2日前まで」とあるのに、なぜか5か月前の行動までもが表示された。）
このような性質は、従来のポイントカードにはなかったものだ。
ポイントカードを作るという行為は、店に気を許すデレの態度であり、気を許せる店にプライバシーを預けて代わりのメリットを頂くという、Win-Winの関係の構築に同意するという契約だった。
ところが、am/pmは、契約する前から勝手に記録をしている。
これは、am/pmで販売されているEdyカードを使った場合に限られない。ANAマイレージカード、MySonyカード、ソニースタイルのEdy、サークルKのKARUWAZA
CLUB、そしておサイフケータイと、どれを使った場合でも、am/pmはすべての購買行動をEdyナンバーでインデックス化して記録しているわけだ。
Edyはもはや社会の公器と言えるまで成長した。こんなことを同意なしにやってよいのだろうか。
「 クレジットカードだって同じじゃないか」というのは的外れである。クレジットカード番号を加盟店が顧客管理に使うことは許されていないはずであるし、クレジットカード会社側に購買内容の明細が渡されることは通常ない。
am / pmの「明細」の内容は図4のように詳細なものになっている。
もっとも、これは個人情報保護法的には合法だろう。なぜなら、club apにメンバー登録する前の段階では、住所氏名等の「個人を特定する情報」を渡していないからだ。
そして、メンバー登録する際にはどうなのかというと、club apの説明にも、Edyの利用規約にも、過去の購買履歴までもが個人情報に結合されるという事実は説明されていない。（club ap ご利用規約、club ap プライバシーポリシー、club ap セキュリティ、club ap よくある質問 ）
個人情報保護法は、識別情報の扱いについてしか規定しておらず、それに結合される属性情報の扱いの説明責任について何も言っていないので、このような行為は合法となってしまっている。つまり、個人情報保護法が無能だということだ。
さて、こういうユビキタスとかいう社会を渡り歩くには、こういうことを事前に察知して、自衛策を講じて行くほかない。
まず、人からEdyカードを譲り受けることがあったら注意が必要だ。そのEdyは既にclub apに登録されているかもしれない。そうと知らずにam/pmで買い物をすると、あなたが何月何日何時何分にどこの店で何を買ったかは、元の持ち主に見守られてしまう 。
これは、どの種類のEdyでもそうだ。am/pmのレジに任意のEdyを渡すと「仮パスワード」を印刷してもらえるようになっている（図5）。
逆に、am/pmで使ったことのあるEdyを人に譲渡すると、後の持ち主がclub apに登録した場合、あなたの過去の行動および購買の履歴を期せずして閲覧してしまうことになる。
さらに、Edyをam/pmで使っている、あるいは今後使うかもしれない場合は、一時的にでもカードが人の手に渡らないようにしないといけない。その人がam/pmのレジで仮パスワードを取得してしまえば 、club apに登録され、返却後もあなたの行動を見守られてしまう。
2004年6月30日のあるはてな日記で、
ゴミとして捨てられてたのを発見。
チャージ額はゼロだと思うが、一応キープ。
と、Edyカードを拾ったと書いていた人がいた。この人はam/pmに行くと書いていたが、もしかすると、そのカードは元の持ち主に見守られているのかもしれない。

How One Story Changed My Leadership Style for the Better
Four or so years ago , Avanoo was still a new - ish organization , and we were at a crossroads .
We ’d grown by partnering with hundreds of renowned experts , helping them create powerful video stories , and having them sell those stories to corporate crowds .

On the eve of the fifth anniversary of 9/11 , one of Britain 's most celebrated and original writers analyses - and abhors - the rise of extreme Islamism .
In a penetrating and wide - ranging essay he offers a trenchant critique of the grotesque creed and questions the West 's faltering response to this eruption of evil .
Click here to read
It was mid-October 2001 , and night was closing in on the border city of Peshawar , in Pakistan , as my friend - a reporter and political man of letters - approached a market stall and began to haggle over a batch of T - shirts bearing the likeness of Osama bin Laden .
It is forbidden , in Sunni Islam , to depict the human form , lest it lead to idolatry ; but here was Osama 's lordly visage , on display and on sale right outside the mosque .
The mosque now emptied , after evening prayers , and my friend was very suddenly and very thoroughly surrounded by a shoving , jabbing , jeering brotherhood : the young men of Peshawar .
At this time of day , their equivalents , in the great conurbations of Europe and America , could expect to ease their not very sharp frustrations by downing a lot of alcohol , by eating large meals with no dietary restrictions , by racing around to one another 's apartments in powerful and expensive machines , by downing a lot more alcohol as well as additional stimulants and relaxants , by jumping up and down for several hours on strobe - lashed dancefloors , and ( in a fair number of cases ) by having galvanic sex with near - perfect strangers .
These diversions were not available to the young men of Peshawar .
More proximately , just over the frontier , the West was in the early stages of invading Afghanistan and slaughtering Pakistan 's pious clients and brainchildren , the Taliban , and flattening the Hindu Kush with its power and its rage .
More proximately still , the ears of these young men were still fizzing with the battlecries of molten mullahs , and their eyes were smarting anew to the chalk - thick smoke from the hundreds of thousands of wood fires - fires kindled by the multitudes of exiles and refugees from Afghanistan , camped out all around the city .
There was perhaps a consciousness , too , that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan , over the past month , had reversed years of policy and decided to sacrifice the lives of its Muslim clients and brainchildren , over the border , in exchange for American cash .
So when the crowd scowled out its question , the answer needed to be a good one .
' Why you want these ?
You like Osama ?'
I can almost hear the tone of the reply I would have given - reedy , wavering , wholly defeatist .
As for the substance , it would have been the reply of the cornered trimmer , and intended , really , just to give myself time to seek the foetal position and fold my hands over my face .
Something like : ' Well I quite like him , but I think he overdid it a bit in New York . '
No , that would not have served .
What was needed was boldness and brilliance .
The exchange continued :
' You like Osama ? '
' Of course .
He is my brother .'
' He is your brother ? '
' All men are my brothers . '
All men are my brothers .
I would have liked to have said it then , and I would like to say it now : all men are my brothers .
But all men are not my brothers .
Why ?
Because all women are my sisters .
And the brother who denies the rights of his sister : that brother is not my brother .
At the very best , he is my half - brother - by definition .
Osama is not my brother .
Religion is sensitive ground , as well it might be .
Here we walk on eggshells .
Because religion is itself an eggshell .
Today , in the West , there are no good excuses for religious belief - unless we think that ignorance , reaction and sentimentality are good excuses .
This is of course not so in the East , where , we acknowledge , almost every living citizen in many huge and populous countries is intimately defined by religious belief .
The excuses , here , are very persuasive ; and we duly accept that ' faith ' - recently and almost endearingly defined as ' the desire for the approval of supernatural beings ' - is a world - historical force and a world - historical actor .
All religions , unsurprisingly , have their terrorists , Christian , Jewish , Hindu , even Buddhist .
But we are not hearing from those religions .
We are hearing from Islam .
Let us make the position clear .
We can begin by saying , not only that we respect Muhammad , but that no serious person could fail to respect Muhammad - a unique and luminous historical being .
Judged by the continuities he was able to set in motion , he remains a titanic figure , and , for Muslims , all - answering : a revolutionary , a warrior , and a sovereign , a Christ and a Caesar , ' with a Koran in one hand ' , as Bagehot imagined him , ' and a sword in the other ' .
Muhammad has strong claims to being the most extraordinary man who ever lived .
And always a man , as he always maintained , and not a god .
Naturally we respect Muhammad .
But we do not respect Muhammad Atta .
Until recently it was being said that what we are confronted with , here , is ' a civil war ' within Islam .
That 's what all this was supposed to be : not a clash of civilisations or anything like that , but a civil war within Islam .
Well , the civil war appears to be over .
And Islamism won it .
The loser , moderate Islam , is always deceptively well - represented on the level of the op - ed page and the public debate ; elsewhere , it is supine and inaudible .
We are not hearing from moderate Islam .
Whereas Islamism , as a mover and shaper of world events , is pretty well all there is .
So , to repeat , we respect Islam - the donor of countless benefits to mankind , and the possessor of a thrilling history .
But Islamism ?
No , we can hardly be asked to respect a creedal wave that calls for our own elimination .
More , we regard the Great Leap Backwards as a tragic development in Islam 's story , and now in ours .
Naturally we respect Islam .
But we do not respect Islamism , just as we respect Muhammad and do not respect Muhammad Atta .
I will soon come to Donald Rumsfeld , the architect and guarantor of the hideous cataclysm in Iraq .
But first I must turn from great things to small , for a paragraph , and talk about writing , and the strange thing that happened to me at my desk in this , the Age of Vanished Normalcy .
All writers of fiction will at some point find themselves abandoning a piece of work - or find themselves putting it aside , as we gently say .
The original idea , the initiating ' throb ' ( Nabokov ) , encounters certain ' points of resistance ' ( Updike ) ; and these points of resistance , on occasion , are simply too obdurate , numerous , and pervasive .
You come to write the next page , and it 's dead - as if your subconscious , the part of you quietly responsible for so much daily labour , has been neutralised , or switched off .
Norman Mailer has said that one of the few real sorrows of ' the spooky art ' is that it requires you to spend too many days among dead things .
Recently , and for the first time in my life , I abandoned , not a dead thing , but a thriving novella ; and I did so for reasons that were wholly extraneous .
I am aware that this is hardly a tectonic event ; but for me the episode was existential .
In the West , writers are acclimatised to freedom - to limitless and gluttonous freedom .
And I discovered something .
Writing is freedom ; and as soon as that freedom is in shadow , the writer can no longer proceed .
The shadow , in this case , was not a fear of repercussion .
It was as if , most reluctantly , I was receiving a new vibration or frequency from the planetary shimmer .
The novella was a satire called The Unknown Known
Secretary Rumsfeld was unfairly ridiculed , some thought , for his haiku - like taxonomy of the terrorist threat :
' The message is : there are known " knowns " .
There are things that we know that we know .
There are known unknowns .
That is to say , there are things that we know we do n't know .
But there are also unknown unknowns .
There are things we do n't know we do n't know . '
Like his habit of talking in ' the third person passive once removed ' , this is ' very Rumsfeldian ' .
And Rumsfeld can be even more Rumsfeldian than that .
According to Bob Woodward 's Plan of Attack , at a closed - door senatorial briefing in September 2002 ( the idea was to sell regime - change in Iraq ) , Rumsfeld exasperated everyone present with a torrent of Rumsfeldisms , including the following strophe : ' We know what we know , we know there are things we do not know , and we know there are things we know we do n't know we do n't know . '
Anyway , the three categories remain quite helpful as analytical tools .
And they certainly appealed very powerfully to the narrator of The Unknown Known - Ayed , a diminutive Islamist terrorist who plies his trade in Waziristan , the rugged northern borderland where Osama bin Laden is still rumoured to lurk .
Ayed 's outfit , which is called ' the " Prism " ' , used to consist of three sectors named , not very imaginatively , Sector One , Sector Two and Sector Three .
But Ayed and his colleagues are attentive readers of the Western press , and the sectors now have new titles .
Known Knowns ( sector one ) concerns itself with daily logistics : bombs , mines , shells , and various improvised explosive devices .
The work of Known Unknowns ( sector two ) is more peripatetic and long - term ; it involves , for example , trolling around North Korea in the hope of procuring the fabled 25 kilograms of enriched uranium , or going from factory to factory in Uzbekistan on a quest for better toxins and asphyxiants .
In Known Knowns , the brothers are plagued by fires and gas - leaks and almost daily explosions ; the brothers in Known Unknowns are racked by headaches and sore throats , and their breath , tellingly , is rich with the aroma of potent coughdrops , moving about as they do among vats of acids and bathtubs of raw pesticides .
Everyone wants to work where Ayed works , which is in sector three , or Unknown Unknowns .
Sector three is devoted to conceptual breakthroughs - to shifts in the paradigm .
Shifts in the paradigm like the attack of 11 September 2001 .
Paradigm shifts open a window ; and , once opened , the window will close .
Ayed observes that 11 September was instantly unrepeatable ; indeed , the tactic was obsolete by 10 am the same morning .
Its efficacy lasted for 71 minutes , from 8.46 , when American 11 hit the North Tower , to 9.57 , and the start of the rebellion on United 93 .
On United 93 , the passengers were told about the new reality by their mobile phones , and they did n't linger long in the old paradigm - the four - day siege on the equatorial tarmac , the diminishing supplies of food and water , the festering toilets , the conditions and demands , the phased release of the children and the women ; then the surrender , or the clambering commandos .
No , they knew that they were n't on a commercial aircraft , not any longer ; they were on a missile .
So they rose up .
And at 10.03 United 93 came down on its back at 580 mph , in Shanksville , Pennsylvania , 20 minutes from the Capitol .
I found it reassuringly difficult , dreaming up paradigm shifts .
And Ayed and his friends in sector three find it difficult too .
Synergy , maximalisation - these are the kinds of concept that are tossed from cushion to floormat in Unknown Unknowns .
Here , a comrade argues for the dynamiting of the San Andreas Fault ; there , another envisages the large - scale introduction of rabies ( admixed with smallpox , methamphetamine and steroids ) to the fauna of Central Park .
A pensive silence follows .
And very often these silences last for days on end .
All you can hear , in Unknown Unknowns , is the occasional swatting palm - clap , or the crackle of a beetle being ground underfoot .
Ayed feels , or used to feel , superior to his colleagues , because he has already had his eureka moment .
He had it in the spring of 2001 , and his project - his ' baby ' , if you will - was launched in the summer of that year , and is still in progress .
It has a codename : UU : CRs / G,C .
Ayed 's conceptual breakthrough did not go down at all well in Sector Three , as it was then called ; in fact , it was widely mocked .
But Ayed used a family connection , and gained an audience with Mullah Omar , the one - eyed Islamist cleric who briefly ruled Afghanistan - an imposing figure , in his dishdash and flipflops .
Ayed submitted his presentation , and , to his astonishment , Mullah Omar smiled on his plan .
This was a necessary condition , because Ayed 's paradigm shift could only be realised with the full resources of a nation state .
UU : CRs / G , C went ahead .
The idea was , as Ayed would say , deceptively simple .
The idea was to scour all the prisons and madhouses for every compulsive rapist in the country , and then unleash them on Greeley , Colorado .
As the story opens , the CRs have been en route to G , C for almost five years , crossing central Africa , in minibuses and on foot , and suffering many a sanguinary reverse ( a host of some 30,000 Janjaweed in Sudan , a ' child militia ' , armed with pangas , in Congo ) .
On top of all this , as if he did n't have enough to worry about , Ayed is not getting on very well with his wives .
Those who know the field will be undismayed by the singling out of Greeley , Colorado .
For it was in Greeley , Colorado , in 1949 , that Islamism , as we now know it , was decisively shaped .
The story is grotesque and incredible - but then so are its consequences .
And let us keep on telling ourselves how grotesque and incredible it is , our current reality , so unforeseeable , so altogether unknowable , even from the vantage of the late Nineties .
At that time , if you recall , America had so much leisure on its hands , politically and culturally , that it could dedicate an entire year to Monica Lewinsky .
Even Monica , it now seems , even Bill , were living in innocent times .
Since then the world has undergone a moral crash - the spiritual equivalent , in its global depth and reach , of the Great Depression of the Thirties .
On our side , extraordinary rendition , coercive psychological procedures , enhanced interrogation techniques , Guantanamo , Abu Ghraib , Haditha , Mahmudiya , two wars , and tens of thousands of dead bodies .
All this should of course be soberly compared to the feats of the opposed ideology , an ideology which , in its most millennial form , conjures up the image of an abattoir within a madhouse .
I will spell this out , because it has not been broadly assimilated .
The most extreme Islamists want to kill everyone on earth except the most extreme Islamists ; but every jihadi sees the need for eliminating all non-Muslims , either by conversion or by execution .
And we now know what happens when Islamism gets its hands on an army ( Algeria ) or on something resembling a nation state ( Sudan ) .
In the first case , the result was fratricide , with 100,000 dead ; in the second , following the Islamist coup in 1989 , the result has been a kind of rolling genocide , and the figure is perhaps two million .
And it all goes back to Greeley , Colorado , and to Sayyid Qutb .
Things started to go wrong for poor Sayyid during the Atlantic crossing from Alexandria , when , allegedly , ' a drunken , semi- naked woman ' tried to storm his cabin .
But before we come to that , some background .
Sayyid Qutb , in 1949 , had just turned 43 .
His childhood was provincial and devout .
When , as a young man , he went to study in Cairo , his leanings became literary and Europhone and even mildly cosmopolitan .
Despite an early - and routinely baffling - admiration for naturism , he was already finding Cairene women ' dishonourable ' , and confessed to unhappiness about ' their current level of freedom ' .
A short story recorded his first disappointment in matters of the heart ; its title , plangently , was Thorns .
Well , we 've all had that ; and most of us then adhere to the arc described in Peter Porter 's poem , ' Once Bitten , Twice Bitten ' .
But Sayyid did n't need much discouragement .
Promptly giving up all hope of coming across a woman of ' sufficient ' moral cleanliness , he resolved to stick to virginity .
Established in a modest way as a writer , Sayyid took a job at the Ministry of Education .
This radicalised him .
He felt oppressed by the vestiges of the British protectorate in Egypt , and was alarmist about the growing weight of the Jewish presence in Palestine - another British crime , in Sayyid 's view .
He became an activist , and ran some risk of imprisonment ( at the hands of the saturnalian King Farouk ) , before the ministry packed him off to America to do a couple of years of educational research .
Prison , by the way , would claim him soon after his return .
He was one of the dozens of Muslim Brothers jailed ( and tortured ) after the failed attempt on the life of the moderniser and secularist , Nasser , in October 1954 .
There was a short reprieve in 1964 , but Sayyid was soon rearrested - and retortured .
Steelily dismissing a clemency deal brokered by none other than the young Anwar Sadat , he was hanged in August 1966 ; and this was a strategic martyrdom that now lies deep in the Islamist soul .
His most influential book , like the book with which it is often compared , was written behind bars .
Milestones is known as the Mein Kampf of Islamism .
Sayyid was presumably still sorely shaken by the birth of Israel ( after the defeat of Egypt and five other Arab armies ) , but at first , on the Atlantic crossing , he felt a spiritual expansion .
His encyclopedic commentary ,
In the Shade of the Koran , would fondly and ramblingly recall the renewal of his sense of purpose and destiny .
Early on , he got into a minor sectarian battle with a proselytising Christian ; Sayyid retaliated by doing a bit of proselytising himself , and made some progress with a contingent of Nubian sailors .
Then came the traumatic incident with the drunken , semi-naked woman .
Sayyid thought she was an American agent hired to seduce him , or so he later told his biographer , who wrote that ' the encounter successfully tested his resolve to resist experiences damaging to his identity as an Egyptian and a Muslim ' .
God knows what the episode actually amounted to .
It seems probable that the liquored - up Mata Hari , the dipsomaniacal nudist , was simply a woman in a cocktail dress who , perhaps , had recently drunk a cocktail .
Still , we can continue to imagine Sayyid barricading himself into his cabin while , beyond the door , the siren sings her song .
He did n't like New York : materialistic , mechanistic , trivial , idolatrous , wanton , depraved , and so on and so forth .
Washington was a little better .
But here , sickly Sayyid ( lungs ) was hospitalised , introducing him to another dire hazard that he would n't have faced at home : female nurses .
One of them , tricked out with ' thirsty lips , bulging breasts , smooth legs ' and a coquettish manner ( ' the calling eye , the provocative laugh ' ) , regaled him with her wish - list of endowments for the ideal lover .
But ' the father of Islamism ' , as he is often called , remained calm , later developing the incident into a diatribe against Arab men who succumb to the allure of American women .
In an extraordinary burst of mendacity or delusion , Sayyid claimed that the medical staff heartlessly exulted at the news of the assassination , back in Egypt , of Hasan al - Banna .
We may wonder how likely it is that any American would have heard of al - Banna , or indeed of the Muslim Brotherhood , which he founded .
When Sayyid was discharged from George Washington University Hospital , he probably thought the worst was behind him .
But now he proceeded to the cauldron - to the pullulating hellhouse - of Greeley , Colorado .
During his six months at the Colorado State College of Education ( and thereafter in California ) , Sayyid 's hungry disapproval found a variety of targets .
American lawns ( a distressing example of selfishness and atomism ) , American conversation ( ' money , movie stars and models of cars ' ) , American jazz ( 'a type of music invented by Blacks to please their primitive tendencies - their desire for noise and their appetite for sexual arousal ' ) , and , of course , American women : here another one pops up , telling Sayyid that sex is merely a physical function , untrammelled by morality .
American places of worship he also detests ( they are like cinemas or amusement arcades ) , but by now he is pining for Cairo , and for company , and he does something rash .
Qutb joins a club - where an epiphany awaits him .
' The dance is inflamed by the notes of the gramophone , ' he wrote ; ' the dance - hall becomes a whirl of heels and thighs , arms enfold hips , lips and breasts meet , and the air is full of lust . '
You'd think that the father of Islamism had exposed himself to an early version of Studio 54 or even Plato 's Retreat .
But no : the club he joined was run by the church , and what he is describing , here , is a chapel hop in Greeley , Colorado .
And Greeley , Colorado , in 1949 , was dry
' And the air is full of lust . ' ' Lust ' is Bernard Lewis 's translation , but several other writers prefer the word ' love ' .
And while lust has greater immediate impact , love may in the end be more resonant .
Why should Qutb mind if the air is full of love ?
We are forced to wonder whether love can be said to exist , as we understand it , in the ferocious patriarchy of Islamism .
If death and hate are the twin opposites of love , then it may not be merely whimsical and mawkish to suggest that the terrorist , the bringer of death and hate , the death - hate cultist , is in essence the enemy of love .
Qutb :
' A girl looks at you , appearing as if she were an enchanting nymph or an escaped mermaid , but as she approaches , you sense only the screaming instinct inside her , and you can smell her burning body , not the scent of perfume but flesh , only flesh . '
In his excellent book , Terror and Liberalism , Paul Berman has many sharp things to say about the corpus of Sayyid Qutb ; but he manages to goad himself into receptivity , and ends up , in my view , sounding almost absurdly respectful - ' rich , nuanced , deep , soulful , and heartfelt ' .
Qutb , who would go on to write a 30 - volume gloss on it , spent his childhood memorising the Koran .
He was 10 by the time he was done .
Now , given that , it seems idle to expect much sense from him ; and so it proves .
On the last of the 46 pages he devotes to Qutb , Berman wraps things up with a long quotation .
This is its repetitive first paragraph :
' The Surah [ the sayings of the Prophet ] tells the Muslims that , in the fight to uphold God 's universal Truth , lives will have to be sacrificed .
Those who risk their lives and go out to fight , and who are prepared to lay down their lives for the cause of God , are honourable people , pure of heart and blessed of soul .
But the great surprise is that those among them who are killed in the struggle must not be considered or described as dead .
They continue to live , as God Himself clearly states . '
Savouring that last phrase , we realise that any voyage taken with Sayyid Qutb is doomed to a leaden - witted circularity .
The emptiness , the mere iteration , at the heart of his philosophy is steadily colonised by a vast entanglement of bitternesses ; and here , too , we detect the presence of that peculiarly Islamist triumvirate ( codified early on by Christopher Hitchens ) of self - righteousness , self - pity , and self - hatred - the self - righteousness dating from the seventh century , the self - pity from the 13th ( when the ' last ' Caliph was kicked to death in Baghdad by the Mongol warlord Hulagu ) , and the self - hatred from the 20th .
And most astounding of all , in Qutb , is the level of self - awareness , which is less than zero .
It is as if the very act of self - examination were something unmanly or profane : something unrighteous , in a word .
Still , one way or the other , Qutb is the father of Islamism .
Here are the chief tenets he inspired : that America , and its clients , are jahiliyya ( the word classically applied to pre-Muhammadan Arabia - barbarous and benighted ) ; that America is controlled by Jews ; that Americans are infidels , that they are animals , and , worse , arrogant animals , and are unworthy of life ; that America promotes pride and promiscuity in the service of human degradation ; that America seeks to ' exterminate ' Islam - and that it will accomplish this not by conquest , not by colonial annexation , but by example .
As Bernard Lewis puts it in The Crisis of Islam
' This is what is meant by the term the Great Satan , applied to the United States by the late Ayatollah Khomeini .
Satan as depicted in the Qur'an is neither an imperialist nor an exploiter .
He is a seducer , ' the insidious tempter who whispers in the hearts of men ' ( Qur'an , CXIV , 4 , 5 ) .
Lewis might have added that these are the closing words of the Koran .
So they echo .
The West is n't being seductive , of course ; all the West is being is attractive .
But the Islamist 's paranoia extends to a kind of thwarted narcissism .
We think again of Qutb 's buxom , smooth - legged nurse , supposedly smacking her thirsty lips at the news of the death of Hasan al - Banna .
Far from wanting or trying to exterminate it , the West had no views whatever about Islam per se before 11 September 2001 .
Of course , views were then formulated , and very soon the bestseller list was a column of primers on Islam .
Some things take longer to sink in than others , true ; but now we know .
In the West we had brought into being a society whose main purpose , whose raison d'etre , was the tantalisation of good Muslims .
The theme of the ' tempter ' can be taken a little further , in the case of Qutb .
When the tempter is a temptress , and really wants you to sin , she needs to be both available and willing .
And it is almost inconceivable that poor Sayyid , the frail , humourless civil servant , and turgid anti-semite ( salting his talk with quotes from that long - exploded fabrication , The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ) , ever encountered anything that resembled an offer .
It is more pitiful than that .
Seduction did not come his way , but it was coming the way of others , he sensed , and a part of him wanted it too .
That desire made him very afraid , and also shamed him and dishonoured him , and turned his thoughts to murder .
Then the thinkers of Islam took his books and did what they did to them ; and Sayyid Qutb is now a part of our daily reality .
We should understand that the Islamists ' hatred of America is as much abstract as historical , and irrationally abstract , too ; none of the usual things can be expected to appease it .
The hatred contains much historical emotion , but it is their history , and not ours , that haunts them .
Qutb has perhaps a single parallel in world history .
Another shambling invert , another sexual truant ( not a virgin but a career cuckold ) , another marginal quack and dabbler ( talentless but not philistine ) , he too wrote a book , in prison , that fell into the worst possible hands .
His name was Nikolai Chernyshevsky ; and his novel ( What Is To Be Done ? ) was read five times by Vladimir Lenin in the course of a single summer .
It was Chernyshevsky who determined , not the content , but the emotional dynamic of the Soviet experiment .
The centennial of his birth was celebrated with much pomp in the USSR .
That was in 1928 .
But Russia was too sad , and too busy , to do much about the centennial of his death , which passed quietly in 1989 .

« It 's All the Liberals ' Fault , or Maybe George Soros 's | Main | Nothing to See Here »
Of Coups , Their Plotters , and the Next Era of Politics
At moments like these , as I watch the civil war among the Republican congressional leadership , I ’m glad that a long time ago I worked my way through all three volumes of John Julius Norwich ’s history of the Byzantine Empire .
When was the last bloodless , orderly transition in the Republican leadership ?
Like the Byzantines ( and apparently , according to an e-mailer , like the Klingons , but that ’s never been my thing ) it ’s been all coups , beheadings , indictments and instant resignations , as far as I can tell , going back at least to Newt Gingrich ’s victory in the race for Republican whip in 1989 .
There was the failed coup of 1997 , which resulted in at least one coup - plotter , Bill Paxon of New York , being exiled ( opening the seat now held by the equally ambitious Tom Reynolds . )
There was the successful defenestration of Gingrich in 1998 , followed within days by the elimination of his successor , Bob Livingston , by Tom DeLay , who replaced him with the more malleable Denny Hastert .
While Hastert recently became the longest - serving Republican Speaker in history , he was also by all accounts the most impotent .
When DeLay ’s inevitable fall came , it was followed by the unlikely victory of John Boehner -- a throwback to the original Gingrichites -- over a DeLay protege , and an actual ideologue , both of whom remain ready to pounce .
Without DeLay , Hastert could not lead on his own , and in the months since DeLay ’s resignation , the House has been basically paralyzed ( thankfully ! ) except to pass legislation permitting their president to torture people .
As my wife points out -- and she gets out more than I do -- when Republican members of Congress go out to campaign over the next month , they inevitably are asked some version of , " So , you Republicans control both houses of Congress ?
Why could n’t you pass something on immigration reform ? "
And they hate not having an answer to that .
So who knows what happened now ?
Robert Novak wrote this morning that there has always been " distance " between Reynolds and Hastert .
As of last week , Reynolds was perhaps scheming to depose Hastert , by pulling victory in the House races from the jaws of defeat and being " heralded as asavior " -- in Novak ’s words .
Last week for a moment that seemed possible .
Today , Reynolds and his ( former ) aide Kirk Fordham are succeeding all too well in bringing down Hastert , but will destroy themselves as well .
Leaving the Republican campaign committee rudderless , and a leadership election in the spring that has no easy answers .
If the Republicans lose , will they let Boehner -- their leader during the annus horribilus -- become minority leader ?
Will they let whip Roy Blunt , rejected in the last showdown and as shamelessly corrupt as DeLay , remain ?
What other potential leaders -- such as Conference Chair Deborah Pryce of Ohio -- will themselves lose reelection ?
If they go outside of leadership , usually it ’s with a committee leader , as they tried to do with Livingston , who chaired Appropriations .
Oh , too bad -- all their major committee leaders are at risk of indictment at any moment : Jerry Lewis , Duncan Hunter -- or already indicted : Ney , or generally disagreeable : Bill Thomas .
( Rules Committee chair David Dreier is still available , but they are still homophobes after all . )
The Mike Pence wing of so - called fiscal conservatives could take power , which would only further alienate voters who expect government to do something besides cut taxes .
The big question in my my mind is whether the revelations about Foley were merely the spark that ignited the war within leadership , or whether they were actually a tactical move on the part of some faction .
There ’s no obvious beneficiary -- certainly not Fordham / Reynolds -- so I ca n’t flesh out this theory , but maybe when we know more it will make sense .
Much more interesting to me about this leadership crisis is not what it heralds for the election , but what it means for the next era of American politics .
I ’ve generally operated under the assumption that if the Dems win the House , they actually do n’t win much besides subpoena power .
( Not that there ’s anything trivial about subpoena power , except why would an administration that believes in absolute presidential power obey a subpoena ? )
I ’ve assumed that the narrow Democratic House majority would face off against an extraordinarily disciplined and fierce opposition party , working with the Republicans in the Senate whether minority or not , that would continue to frame the agenda and define the fights much as they did in the early Clinton years .
In many ways the modern Republicans are a machine constructed for opposition , and far less effective as a governing party that has to make choices based on consequences .
I want the Democrats to win , but I ’m terrified of it at the same time .
I ’m worried that to win they will promise things they intend to " do , " but they will not have the power to do anything .
But what happens if the Republican structure is not capable of discipline , if it ’s riven by infighting and finger - pointing ??
That ’s going to be a very different story .
If the White House ca n’t count on loyal and effective allies in the House , even in the minority , they are even more stuck than they already are .
Tony
Snow ’s comments yesterday on the scandal attracted a lot of attention for his dismissal of Foley ’s abuse as " naughty e-mails . "
But there was more to the statement than that .
He also basically dismissed Congress entirely , saying " there are a lot of scandals up there , " and basically treating Congress as if it was already controlled by another party .
Members of Congress think Bush is dragging them down ; Bush thinks its Congress dragging him down , and he ’s got numbers on his side .
If Bush rejects " Congress " altogether , without regard to party , at some point he has to come back and deal .
And if the GOP does n’t get its act together to form the fierce opposition that protects Bush , then I think there ’s a real possibility that Bush and the Senate Republicans have to think about a different approach , a kind end - of - life turn to " triangulation , " actually working with the congressional Democratic majority to find some common ground and get things done .
That ’s still a long - shot , but I ’m more optimistic not just about the election , but about the possibility that we do n’t have to wait until 2009 for this whole Byzantine approach to politics to come to an end .

Perhaps Bush will try to rule by decree , or the equivalent ?
Under the " National Emergency " he will be forced to declare ?
What does he need Congress for ?
Appropriations ?
He 'll just spend money , and a Republican court will let him do so in violation of the Constitution .

@RtheR
If that happens maybe we 'll need a real coup .
I want a Governor to call her / is Guard troops back , and when they are n't allowed to signal that s/he is going to start building their own .
Posted by : crack | Oct 5 , 2006 10:22:41 AM
It could always have been a tactical move made by a bonehead .
Remember when Boehner claimed to be a mole during the first Gingrich coup ?
If he was an idiot then , he 's not likely to be less so now .
Posted by : pjcamp | Oct 5 , 2006 10:48:47 PM
" Terrified " of the Democrats regaining some power ?
Surely that 's overkill .
" Worried " maybe , " concerned " maybe , " apprehensive " maybe , but " terrified " ?
If we win one of the houses of Congress , of course that will bring problems , but they will be good problems .

People in the field ( like my wife ) nowadays kind of snicker at good ol ' JJ Norwich , but he 's a good read and the general point holds
Posted by : David | Oct 16 , 2006 10:11:44 AM
What about the deputy whip Eric Cantor in a leadership role ?
I think he is clearer of scandals ... but would the Rs let a non-Christian lead ?

This is one of the best site I came across .
My name is Mark Johnson , and I 've been an avid reader of your website for fast six months .
I ’m a recent UC Berkeley Political science grad and I along with some fellow Princeton alums have been working hard to launch our own internet startup called Rizzleweb.com .
Rizzleweb is basically an online political community where people can log on and write performance reviews \comments for congressmen , senators , the president , and various other local and state officials across the country .
I was hoping that if it would not be too much trouble you could place a link of our site on your blog .
If this is not possible ( which we completely understand ) , we still hope you will check out our site , and post some reviews .
Your contribution will encourage us to put more effort in improving our website .

Blacks should vote for the Party of Condi-Rice and for the Party of Lincoln not for the Pro-Slavery Democratic Party .
If you want America where Church rules then vote Democratic Medievalism .
If you want modern expansionist PetroPax Americana then vote Republican Petro- Modernism .
Choice is yours .
When American voters go to polling booths on November 7 , 2006 , they can vote either for Democratic Medievalism or for Republican Pax Americana .
It is a clear choice .
Democratic Party represents Religious Medievalism .
Republican Party represents secular Machiavellian Modernism .
The Two Party System no longer represents the same wine in differently colored bottles .
Jimmy Carter , Henry Kissinger , Zbigniew Brzezinski , Samuel P. Huntington , Madeleine Albright represent the pro-China patriarchal iconoclast fundamentalist intolerant Axis of Medieval in American Politics that seeks to implement the End of Time eschatology of Prophetic Christians that conducted foreign policy to implement the religious agenda through an alliance with genocidal Islamic terrorism and Communist extremism .
George Bush and Condoleezza Rice represent the morally right secular axis of modernity that seeks to implement the Oil agenda through an alliance with nuclear India and via War on Islamic terrorism .
The elections of November 2006 and 2006 present to American Voters an opportunity to choose between Medievalism and Modernity .
The Congressional Cox Report Jan 1999 , details how Democrats allowed the theft of American nuclear technology to China and other countries ?
Global Axis of Medieval engineered the transfer of nuclear weapon technology to Pakistan , Iran , Malaysia and North Korea to ignite Christian - Islamic Armageddon to fulfill End of Time Eschatology .
Democratic Party of 2006 resembles the Civil War era pro-Slavery Party , where Blacks play no significant role in corridors of power .
Blacks , Latinos and Immigrants should vote for Party of Black woman secretary Condi Rice .
Bill Clinton has kicked out Blacks and Latinos and Immigrants from corridors of power of the Democratic Party in all big States , namely , New York , California and Illinois .
APOCALYPTIC END OF TIME AGENDA OF JIMMY CARTER IS PURE EVIL CORE OF AXIS OF MEDIEVAL : The Reverend Jim Jones of Jonestown fame that caused mass murders in Guyana on November 18 , 1978 , represents the True face of Democratic President Jimmy Carter ( 1976-1980 ) .
The Axis of Medieval that Jimmy Carter seeks to create the Jamestown Guyana type mayhem in Burma and Nepal .
Jimmy Carter represents the smiling face of Evil that lurched in Rev. Jim James of Jamestown Guyana .
As a Democratic President Jimmy Carter made United States a laughing stock of the world and he betrayed United States by refusing to attack Iran to liberate American embassy prisoners and now he is conspiring to sabotage Republican President George Bush ’s determined effort to tame Iran .
Jimmy Carter is the patron - Saint Father of Ayatollahs , Islamic theocracy and Islamic Terrorism .
Jimmy Carter was also responsible for the genocide of Buddhists under Catholic Communist Pol Pot of Cambodia .
President John F. Kennedy overthrew the democratically elected government of Cheddi Jagan in Guyana , who was of Indian origin .
Kennedy - Carter - Clinton Administration belonged to Christian Religious Right Conservative Conspiracy and sought to promote religious interests of monotheism fundamentalism even at the cost of national interests of the United States .
PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER FATHER OF ISLAMIC TERRORISM : President Jimmy created Islamic terrorism and Iranian Shiite Theocracy .
President Jimmy carter organized the overthrow of enlightened Shah of Iran and engineered the enthronement of Ayatollah Khomenini .
Jimmy Carter sabotaged democratically elected government of Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar and ruled out the transfer of power to Military generals in Iran .
The pro-Islamic fundamentalism and anti-Islamic modernization policies put into place by President Jimmy Carter , while he was in office , at behest of Christian Religious Right Conservative Conspiracy laid the Islamic terrorist forces in motion that resulted in Islamic terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001 .
President Carter has been the patron saint of Osama Ben Laden and al Qaeda .
President carter could be held responsible for 9/11 terrorist attacks .
Novice President Clinton appointed the officials of the Carter Secretary of State to first Clinton administration , who conspired to legitimize Islamic terrorism , al Qaeda and Osama Ben Laden .
President Carter should be worshipped at Mecca as American Father of Islamic Terrorism , Islamic Theocracy , Al Qaeda and Osama Ben Laden and his likes .
The religious right conspiracy that Jimmy Carter presides over could cause more harm to the secular United States than that of his protégé Islamic terrorism .
Ideas of Jimmy Carter present greater threat to secular USA than Islamic terrorism .
JIMMY CARTER CREATED ISLAMIC & NORTH KOREAN ATOM BOMB : Ex -President Jimmy Carter is responsible for the North Korean Nuclear explosion by his negotiations with North Korea during Clinton Administration .
President Carter cemented the Mecca - Vatican ties that united the forces of extremism and fundamentalism .
President Carter was very friendly with the Jones of Guyana that resulted in the massacre of American Christians in Guyana and murder of American lawmaker in the jungles of Guyana .
As the leader of Christian religious right conservative conspiracy and patron of Islamic extremism , Islamic fundamentalism , Islamic terrorism and Islamic theocracy , President carter is engaged in implementing the agenda of Apocalyptic End of Time Eschatology Teleology now .
If white Western Christian Civilization continue to accept Jimmy Carter as responsible American politician by virtue of his being ex-President then the fate of the Apocalyptic White Christian world would be doomed to the delight of Prophetic Christians as the advice of President Jimmy Carter can only lead to the death of the Christian Civilization as we know it .
More than Osama Ben Laden , Christians like Jimmy Carter would cause the Apocalyptic End of White Christian Civilization in not so distant a future .
Just as Pope conspired with barbarian invaders to Rome in 415 AD , similarly Democrats like Jimmy Carter conspiring with Islamic terrorism to engineer the descent of New Global Dark Age in Western hemisphere in 21st Century .
Secular USA can also fall in 21st Century , just as Roman Empire fell in 415 AD , once religious extremism got control over Roman Empire .
Now , the Islamic terrorism and Christian fundamentalism presents the threat to USA , similar to that presented by barbarian invasions of Roman Empire in 415 AD .
Christian Fundamentalism might have provided logistic and ideological support to Wahhabi terrorists for 9/11 attacks on secular United States , especially in the ensuing Anthrax attacks .
Patriotic WASPs need to be vigilant in ongoing War on Terrorism to ward off dangers of sabotage for Axis of Medievalism .
Next time Islamic terrorists will attack United States with Islamic Nukes , to fulfill the Apocalyptic Fatima Prophesy of Armageddon .
Prophetic Christians might foolishly join the War of Religions on the side of nuke - armed Islamic terrorism .
Patriotic WASPs must take preventive measures to break the emerging Nexus of Islamic terrorism and Apocalyptic Prophetic Christianity .
CARTER AGAINST USA-INDIA NUKE DEAL : President Jimmy Carter is against Indo - US Nuke Deal reported HindustanTimes.com
Friday , October 27 , 2006 .
On a visit to India after 28 years , former American President Jimmy Carter saw no threat to Asian peace or world peace from India ’s intentions to acquire atomic energy sources to generate power , but is firm that New Delhi ought to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
Though he has no authority in government to thwart the deal , Carter does not favor the Indo - US civil nuclear deal because , he said , there is need to discourage testing and development of nuclear weapons and the spread of fissile material .
Hastening to add that his concerns were global , not India - specific , Carter said , " any nation with nuclear weapons should be under the NPT .
It is my hope that the NPT becomes universally acceptable , " said the 82 - year - old Nobel laureate , who was severely critical of the US administration ’s handling of the North Korean nuclear issue .
Carter said he hoped other aspects of the bilateral relationship would not be affected if the Indo - US civil nuclear deal fails to go through the US Congressional process .
JIMMY CARTER IS THE PURE EVIL CORE OF GLOBAL AXIS OF MEDIEVAL IN AMERICAN POLITICS : Jimmy Carter represents the Evil Core of Axis of Medieval Fundamentalism .
Wahhabi Al Qaeda represent the Core of Islamic Medievalism .
Beijing China represents the Evil Core of Axis of Communist Medievalism .
The Pure Evil resides at the Core of the Global Axis of Medievalism that conspiring to descend New Global Dark Age on the world in 21st Century to implement the End of Time Apocalyptic agenda .
What one can expect from Jimmy carter who is the Father of Islamic Theocracy , Islamic Terrorism , Islamic fundamentalism ?
Jimmy Carter is so ludicrous that it is not worth wasting time on him , as he is determined to bring White Christian Civilization to an Apocalyptic
End in alliance with his buddies in Iran to cause Christian - Islamic Armageddon , by his evil design to sabotage USA - India Nuclear deal that President George Bush signed with India , as President Bush is 100 times more competent than President Jimmy Carter .
The people and Capitol Hill have a choice to make , whether they support the morally Good George Bush or morally Evil Jimmy Carter .
The choice that the people of the United States would make , shall determine the fate of the Christian World and would determine whether likes of Jimmy carter would succeed in causing Apocalyptic damage to Christian civilization , with their determined pursuit of End of Time agenda .
Apocalyptic teleology of ex-President Democratic Jimmy Carter presents greater threat to the secular WASP Protestant United States than al Qaeda or Osama Ben Laden .
It is high time that Republican Neocons should grab the horns of the Evil directly rather than let is cause Armageddon by stealth to establish theocracy in USA .
As President , Jimmy carter made United States the laughing stock of the world by his failure to attack Iran to free American embassy staff imprisoned by Ayatollah Khomeini .
Was President carter on the payroll of Ayatollah Khomeini that Pentagon did nothing to invade Iran ?
Many patriotic WASPs consider President Jimmy Carter a traitor for his failure to use force to liberate American embassy officials held prisoners in Tehran .
As a diplomat and Commander in Chief president Jimmy carter holds the greatest distinction of formulating most stupid foreign policy during his tenure as the President of USA .
With Jimmy Carter as leader and a friend the United States does not need any enemy .
So far as foreign policy is considered Jimmy Carter can only be called a Traitor to USA when compared to the patriotic George Bush and Condi Rice .
In the eyes of patriotic WASPs in American politics Democrat Jimmy Carter represents the Core of Axis of Evil and on other hand Republican Bush - Condi Rice represent Core of Axis of Virtue .
Axis of Evil caused 9/11 Terrorism and Axis of Virtue waged war on Terrorism .
The Election of November 2006 and forthcoming November 2008 Elections , provide American Voters a Clear Choice , whether to Vote for Axis of Evil or vote for Axis of Virtue .
Remember the 9/11 attacks would not have taken place without the active involvement of Core of Axis of Medieval .
Remember the Pure Evil core of Axis of Medieval wants to destroy secular WASP United States just as in 415 AD it destroyed secular Roman Empire to cause European Medieval Dark Age , to engineer in the 21st Century the descent of Looming Global Dark Age on the White Christian Western World , to fulfill the End of Time eschatology of Prophetic Christians .
To secular WASPs and patriotic Neocons Jimmy Carter and Osama Ben Laden represents the two sides of same Coin of Evil .
Hindu , Buddhist and Pagan Civilizations representing more than 3.5 Billion people denounce the Evil represented by likes of Jimmy Carter as well as Osama Ben Laden .
Dear American Voters , please prudently think before you vote on November 7 , 2006 , it is a vote for or against Evil .
ANTI - BLACK DEMOCRATIC PARTY : From Civil War up to 1964 Democrats were anti-Blacks , anti-Latinos and anti-immigrants .
Party of Lincoln , the Republican Party had been pro-Blacks from the Civil war up to 1964 .
President Carter ( 1977 - 1981 ) and President Clinton ( 1992-2000 ) engineered to kick out Blacks and Latinos our of leadership position in the Democratic corridors of power and replaced them by fundamentalist religious leaders and Wall Street donors .
In American Elections 2006 , the Republican Party is the preferred party of choice for Blacks and Latinos .
The Democrat ’s Ideology of Medievalism seeks to break the Constitutional Wall that separates the State and the Church in the United States .
The Republican Modernism seeks to empower American Blacks vis-à- vis East European immigrants and secures Energy Security of Industrial America by controlling Oil and Gas reserves of the Middle East .
If you want to vote for the Party of Church , then vote Democrats .
If you want to vote for Pax Americana then vote for Republicans .
The choice that you would make shall determine the 21st Century .

President Carter ( 1977 - 1981 ) and President Clinton ( 1992-2000 ) engineered to kick out Blacks and Latinos our of leadership position in the Democratic corridors of power and replaced them by fundamentalist religious leaders and Wall Street donors .
In American Elections 2006 , the Republican Party is the preferred party of choice for Blacks and Latinos .
The Democrat ’s Ideology of Medievalism seeks to break the Constitutional Wall that separates the State and the Church in the United States .
The Republican Modernism seeks to empower American Blacks vis-à- vis East European immigrants and secures Energy Security of Industrial America by controlling Oil and Gas reserves of the Middle East .
If you want to vote for the Party of Church , then vote Democrats .
If you want to vote for Pax Americana then vote for Republicans .
The choice that you would make shall determine the 21st Century .

The real question , now that the Democrats have gained control of Congress by focusing on foreign policy , is " what now ? "
And that 's going to be tough , because opinion surveys show the public does n't have a lot of confidence in any of the strategies on the table .
This Public Agenda survey found only two options , better intelligence gathering and reducing dependence on foreign energy , get any real support from the public . , http://www.publicagenda.org/foreignpolicy/foreignpolicy_energy.htm
Posted by : William Hallowell | Nov 10 , 2006 2:34:28 PM
Now that our side has a majority in both houses they should actually USE the subpoena power and launch a REAL independent investigation into 9/11 .
One thing that struck me as odd in the days after 9/11 was Bush saying " We will not tolerate conspiracy theories [ regarding 9/11 ] " .
Sure enough there have been some wacky conspiracy theories surrounding the events of that day .
The most far - fetched and patently ridiculous one that I 've ever heard goes like this :
Nineteen hijackers who claimed to be devout Muslims but yet were so un-Muslim as to be getting drunk all the time , doing cocaine and frequenting strip clubs decided to hijack four airliners and fly them into buildings in the northeastern U.S. , the area of the country that is the most thick with fighter bases .
After leaving a Koran on a barstool at a strip bar after getting shitfaced drunk on the night before , then writing a suicide note / inspirational letter that sounded like it was written by someone with next to no knowledge of Islam , they went to bed and got up the next morning hung over and carried out their devious plan .
Nevermind the fact that of the four " pilots " among them there was not a one that could handle a Cessna or a Piper Cub let alone fly a jumbo jet , and the one assigned the most difficult task of all , Hani Hanjour , was so laughably incompetent that he was the worst fake " pilot " of the bunch .
Nevermind the fact that they received very rudimentary flight training at Pensacola Naval Air Station , making them more likely to have been C.I.A. assets than Islamic fundamentalist terrorists .
So on to the airports .
These " hijackers " somehow managed to board all four airliners with their tickets , yet not even ONE got his name on any of the flight manifests .
So they hijack all four airliners and at this time passengers on United 93 start making a bunch of cell phone calls from 35,000 feet in the air to tell people what was going on .
Nevermind the fact that cell phones would n't work very well above 4,000 feet , and would n't work at ALL above 8,000 feet .
But the conspiracy theorists wo n't let that fact get in the way of a good fantasy .
That is one of the little things you " are n't supposed to think about " .
Nevermind that one of the callers called his mom and said his first and last name , more like he was reading from a list than calling his own mom .
Anyway , when these airliners each deviated from their flight plan and did n't respond to ground control , NORAD would any other time have followed standard operating procedure ( and did NOT have to be told by F.A.A. that there were hijackings because they were watching the same events unfold on their own radar ) which means fighter jets would be scrambled from the nearest base where they were available on standby within a few minutes , just like every other time when airliners stray off course .
But of course on 9/11 this did n't happen , not even close .
Somehow these " hijackers " must have used magical powers to cause NORAD to stand down , as ridiculous as this sounds because total inaction from the most high - tech and professional Air Force in the world would be necessary to carry out their tasks .
So on the most important day in its history the Air Force was totally worthless .
Then they had to make one of the airliners look like a smaller plane , because unknown to them the Naudet brothers had a videocamera to capture the only known footage of the North Tower crash , and this footage shows something that is not at all like a jumbo jet , but did n't have to bother with the South Tower jet disguising itself because that was the one we were " supposed to see " .
Anyway , as for the Pentagon they had to have Hani Hanjour fly his airliner like it was a fighter plane , making a high G - force corkscrew turn that no real airliner can do , in making its descent to strike the Pentagon .
But these " hijackers " wanted to make sure Rumsfeld survived so they went out of their way to hit the farthest point in the building from where Rumsfeld and the top brass are located .
And this worked out rather well for the military personnel in the Pentagon , since the side that was hit was the part that was under renovation at the time with few military personnel present compared to construction workers .
Still more fortuitous for the Pentagon , the side that was hit had just before 9/11 been structurally reinforced to prevent a large fire there from spreading elsewhere in the building .
Awful nice of them to pick that part to hit , huh ?
Then the airliner vaporized itself into nothing but tiny unidentifiable pieces most no bigger than a fist , unlike the crash of a real airliner when you will be able to see at least some identifiable parts , like crumpled wings , broken tail section etc .
Why , Hani Hanjour the terrible pilot flew that airliner so good that even though he hit the Pentagon on the ground floor the engines did n't even drag the ground !!
Imagine that !!
Though the airliner vaporized itself on impact it only made a tiny 16 foot hole in the building .
Amazing .
Meanwhile , though the planes hitting the Twin Towers caused fires small enough for the firefighters to be heard on their radios saying " We just need 2 hoses and we can knock this fire down " attesting to the small size of it , somehow they must have used magical powers from beyond the grave to make this morph into a raging inferno capable of making the steel on all forty - seven main support columns ( not to mention the over 100 smaller support columns ) soften and buckle , then all fail at once .
Hmmm .
Then still more magic was used to make the building totally defy physics as well as common sense in having the uppermost floors pass through the remainder of the building as quickly , meaning as effortlessly , as falling through air , a feat that without magic could only be done with explosives .
Then exactly 30 minutes later the North Tower collapses in precisely the same freefall physics - defying manner .
Incredible .
Not to mention the fact that both collapsed at a uniform rate too , not slowing down , which also defies physics because as the uppermost floors crash into and through each successive floor beneath them they would shed more and more energy each time , thus slowing itself down .
Common sense tells you this is not possible without either the hijackers ' magical powers or explosives .
To emphasize their telekinetic prowess , later in the day they made a third building , WTC # 7 , collapse also at freefall rate though no plane or any major debris hit it .
Amazing guys these magical hijackers .
But we know it had to be " Muslim hijackers " the conspiracy theorist will tell you because ( now do n't laugh ) one of their passports was " found " a couple days later near Ground Zero , miraculously " surviving " the fire that we were told incinerated planes , passengers and black boxes , and also " survived " the collapse of the building it was in .
When common sense tells you if that were true then they should start making buildings and airliners out of heavy paper and plastic so as to be " indestructable " like that magic passport .
The hijackers even used their magical powers to bring at least seven of their number back to life , to appear at american embassies outraged at being blamed for 9/11 !!
BBC reported on that and it is still online .
Nevertheless , they also used magical powers to make the american government look like it was covering something up in the aftermath of this , what with the hasty removal of the steel debris and having it driven to ports in trucks with GPS locators on them , to be shipped overseas to China and India to be melted down .
When common sense again tells you that this is paradoxical in that if the steel was so unimportant that they did n't bother saving some for analysis but so important as to require GPS locators on the trucks with one driver losing his job because he stopped to get lunch .
Hmmmm .
Further making themselves look guilty , the Bush administration steadfastly refused for over a year to allow a commission to investigate 9/11 to even be formed , only agreeing to it on the conditions that they get to dictate its scope , meaning it was based on the false pretense of the " official story " being true with no other alternatives allowed to be considered , handpicked all its members making sure the ones picked had vested interests in the truth remaining buried , and with Bush and Cheney only " testifying " together , only for an hour , behind closed doors , with their attorneys present and with their " testimonies " not being recorded by tape or even written down in notes .
Yes , this whole story smacks of the utmost idiocy and fantastic far - fetched lying , but it is amazingly enough what some people believe .
Even now , five years later , the provably false fairy tale of the " nineteen hijackers " is heard repeated again and again , and is accepted without question by so many Americans .
Which is itself a testament to the innate psychological cowardice of the American sheeple , i mean people , and their abject willingness to believe something , ANYTHING , no matter how ridiculous in order to avoid facing a scary uncomfortable truth .
Time to wake up America .

Bush Secretly Lifted Some Limits on Spying in U.S. After 9/11 , Officials Say
An Ethiopian student who lived in London claims that he was brutally tortured with the involvement of British and US intelligence agencies .
Binyam Mohammed , 27 , says he spent nearly three years in the CIA 's network of ' black sites ' .
In Morocco he claims he underwent the strappado torture of being hung for hours from his wrists , and scalpel cuts to his chest and penis and that a CIA officer was a regular interrogator .
After his capture in Pakistan , Mohammed says British officials warned him that he would be sent to a country where torture was used .
Moroccans also asked him detailed questions about his seven years in London , which his lawyers believe came from British sources .
Western agencies believed that he was part of a plot to buy uranium in Asia , bring it to the US and build a ' dirty bomb ' in league with Jose Padilla , a US citizen .
Mohammed signed a confession but told his lawyer , Clive Stafford Smith , he had never met Padilla , or anyone in al - Qaeda .
Padilla spent almost four years in American custody , accused of the plot .
Last month , after allegations of the torture used against Mohammed emerged , the claims against Padilla were dropped .
He now faces a civil charge of supporting al - Qaeda financially .
A senior US intelligence official told The Observer that the CIA is now in ' deep crisis ' following last week 's international political storm over the agency 's practice of ' extraordinary rendition ' - transporting suspects to countries where they face torture .
' The smarter people in the Directorate of Operations [ the CIA 's clandestine operational arm ] know that one day , if they do this stuff , they are going to face indictment , ' he said .
' They are simply refusing to participate in these operations , and if they do n't have big mortgage or tuition fees to pay they 're thinking about trying to resign altogether . '
Already 22 CIA officers have been charged in absentia in Italy for alleged roles in the rendition of a radical cleric , Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr , seized - without the knowledge of the Italian government - on a Milan street in February 2003 .
The intense pressure on US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice last week , coupled with Friday 's condemnation of the use of evidence extracted under torture by the House of Lords , has intensified concerns within the CIA .
The official said : ' Renditions and torture are n't just wrong , they also expose CIA personnel and diplomats abroad to enormous future risk . '
Mohammed arrived in Britain in 1994 .
He lived in Wornington Road , North Kensington , and studied at Paddington Green College .
For most of this time , said his brother , he rarely went to a mosque .
However , in early 2001 he became more religious .
The Observer has obtained fresh details of his case which was first publicised last summer .
He went to Pakistan in June 2001 because , he says , he had a drug problem and wanted to kick the habit .
He was arrested on 10 April at the airport on his way back to England because of an alleged passport irregularity .
Initially interrogated by Pakistani and British officials , he told Stafford Smith : ' The British checked out my story and said they knew I was a nobody .
They said they would tell the Americans . '
He was questioned by the FBI and began to hear accusations of terror involvement .
He says he also met two MI6 officers .
One told him he would be tortured in an Arab country .
The interrogations intensified and he says he was taken to Islamabad ; then , in July 2002 , on a CIA flight to Morocco .
His description of the process matches independent reports .
Masked officers wore black .
They stripped him , subjected him to a full body search and shackled him to his seat wearing a nappy .
In Morocco he was told he had plotted with Padilla and had dinner in Pakistan with Khalid Sheik Mohammed , the planner of 9/11 , and other al - Qaeda chiefs .
' I 've never met anyone like these people , ' Mohammed told Stafford Smith .
' How could I ? I speak no Arabic ...
I never heard Padilla 's name until they told me .'
During almost 18 months of regular beatings in Morocco , Mohammed says he frequently met a blonde woman in her thirties who told him she was Canadian .
The US intelligence officer told The Observer this was an ' amateurish ' CIA cover .
' The only Americans who historically pretended to be Canadian were backpackers travelling in Europe during the Vietnam war .
Apart from the moral issues , what disturbs me is that , as an attempt to create plausible deniability , this is so damn transparent . '
According to Mohammed , he was threatened with electrocution and rape .
On one occasion , he was handcuffed when three men entered his cell wearing black masks .
' That day I ceased really knowing I was alive .
One stood on each of my shoulders and a third punched me in the stomach .
It seemed to go on for hours .
I was meant to stand , but I was in so much pain I 'd fall to my knees .
They 'd pull me back up and hit me again .
They 'd kick me in the thighs as I got up .
I could see the hands that were hitting me ... like the hands of someone who'd worked as a mechanic or chopped with an axe . '
Later he was confronted with details of his London life - such as the name of his kickboxing teacher - and met a Moroccan calling himself Marwan , who ordered him to be hung by his wrists .
' They hit me in the chest , the stomach , and they knocked my feet from under me .
I have a shoulder pain to this day from the wrenching as my arms were almost pulled out of their sockets . '
Another time , he told Stafford Smith : ' They took a scalpel to my right chest .
It was only a small cut .
Then they cut my left chest .
One of them took my penis in his hand and began to make cuts .
He did it once , and they stood still for maybe a minute watching .
I was in agony , crying , trying desperately to suppress myself , but I was screaming ...
They must have done this 20 to 30 times in maybe two hours .
There was blood all over .'
In September he was taken to Guantanamo Bay where he has been charged with involvement in al - Qaeda plots and faces trial there by military commission .
Stafford Smith said : ' I am unaware of any evidence against him other than that extracted under torture . '
The Foreign Office , the Moroccan Embassy and the CIA refused to comment yesterday .

But this goes without saying .
President Bush and his top advisors fanned out across the troubled Middle East over the last week to showcase their diplomatic initiatives to restore strained relationships with traditional allies and forge new ones with leaders in Iraq .
But instead of flaunting stronger ties and steadfast American influence , the president ’s journey found friends both old and new near a state of panic .
Mideast leaders expressed soaring concern over upheavals across the region that the United States helped ignite through its invasion of Iraq and push for democracy -- and fear that the Bush administration may make things worse .
President Bush ’s summit in Jordan with the Iraqi prime minister proved an awkward encounter that deepened doubts about the relationship .
Vice President Dick Cheney ’s stop in Riyadh , the Saudi capital , yielded a blunt warning from the kingdom ’s leaders .
And Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ’s swing through the West Bank and Israel , intended to build Arab support by showing a new U.S. push for peace , found little to work with .
In all , visits designed to show the American team in charge ended instead in diplomatic embarrassment and disappointment , with U.S. leaders rebuked and lectured by Arab counterparts .
The trips demonstrated that U.S. allies in the region were struggling to understand what to make of the difficult relationship , and to figure whether , with a new Democratic majority taking over Congress , Bush even had control over his nation ’s Mideast policy .

Arabs are “ trying to figure out what the Americans are going to do , and trying develop their own plans , ” said Sen. Jack Reed ( D - R.I. ) , one of his party ’s point men on Iraq .
“ They ’re trying to figure out their Plan B . ”
The allies ’ predicament was described by Jordan ’s King Abdullah II last week , before Bush arrived in Amman , the capital .
Abdullah , one of America ’s steadiest friends in the region , warned that the Mideast faced the threat of three simultaneous civil wars -- in Iraq , Lebanon and the Palestinian territories .
And he made clear that the burden of dealing with it rested largely with the United States .
“ Something dramatic ” needed to come out of Bush ’s meetings with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki to defuse the three - way threat , Abdullah said , because “ I do n’t think we ’re in a position where we can come back and visit the problem in early 2007 . ”
The only regional leader to voice unqualified support for the Bush administration has been Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , who has gone so far as to say that the Iraq invasion contributed to regional stability .

To Middle East observers , Bush can no longer speak for the United States as he did before because of the domestic pressure for a change of course in Iraq , said Nathan Brown , a specialist on Arab politics at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .
“ He can talk all he wants about ‘ staying until the job is done , ’ but these leaders can read about the American political scene and see that he may not be able to deliver that , ” Brown said .
The Bush - Maliki meeting Thursday , closely watched around the world in anticipation of a possible change in U.S. strategy , produced no shift in declared aims .
Rather , it resulted in diplomatic stumbles that seemed to belie the leaders ’ claims that their relationship was intact .
On the eve of the summit , a leaked memo written by Bush ’s national security advisor , Stephen Hadley , showed that U.S. officials questioned Maliki ’s abilities .
But the memo also was a reminder of dwindling U.S. influence over Iraq .
Some of the steps that Hadley said the Iraqis should take , such as providing public services to Sunni Arabs as well as Shiites , were moves that the Americans had demanded for many months , without success .

The leak of the memo cast a shadow over the summit , and Maliki abruptly canceled the first scheduled meeting , a conversation among Bush , Maliki and Abdullah .
White House aides insisted that the cancellation was not a snub .
One Middle East diplomat said later in an interview that Maliki had canceled the meeting to put distance between him and Bush at a time when Iraq ’s Shiite lawmakers and Cabinet ministers with ties to militant cleric Muqtada Sadr had halted their participation in the government to protest the summit .
On Saturday , in his regular radio address , Bush said that his relationship with Maliki was , in fact , improving .
“ With each meeting , I ’m coming to know him better , and I ’m becoming more impressed by his desire to make the difficult choices that will put his country on a better path , ” Bush said .

During the trip , Bush was unable to distance himself from the fierce debate about Iraq policy back home .
The president felt the need to respond to news accounts saying that an advisory panel on Iraq would urge a gradual withdrawal of combat troops from the region .
He insisted that suggestions for such a “ graceful exit ” were not realistic .
Despite this , Bush repeated in his radio address that he intended to look for a bipartisan solution to the war , and would listen to the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group , which is scheduled to present its findings Wednesday .
He also said that his own internal review , coming from Pentagon and White House officials , among others , was near completion , suggesting that he may be discussing the options before him over the next several days .
“ I want to hear all advice before I make any decisions about adjustments to our strategy in Iraq , ” Bush said .

Cheney ’s trip to talk to Saudi King Abdullah was far less visible than Bush ’s mission , but helped to make painfully clear the gap between U.S. goals and those of its Arab allies .
U.S. officials said Cheney initiated the trip .
But foreign diplomats said that Saudi leaders sought the visit to express their concern about the region , including fears of a U.S. departure and what they see as excessive American support for the Shiite faction in Iraq .
After the meeting with Cheney , Saudi officials released an unusual statement pointedly highlighting American responsibility for deterioration of stability in the region .
The Saudi officials cited “ the direct influence of ... the United States on the issues of the region ” and said it was important for U.S. influence “ to be in accord with the region ’s actual condition and its historical equilibrium , ” an apparent reference to the Sunni - Shiite balance .
Advertisement
The Saudi statement also said the U.S. in the Middle East should “ pursue equitable means that contribute to ending its conflicts , ” pointing to the Israeli - Palestinian situation .
The statement “ came pretty close to a rebuke , by Saudi standards , ” said Charles W. Freeman Jr. , a former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia .
“ It said , in effect , that the United States needs to behave responsibly . ”
There have been other signals of Saudi anxiety recently .
On Wednesday , an advisor to the Saudi government wrote in the Washington Post that if the United States pulled out of Iraq , “ massive Saudi intervention ” would ensue to protect Sunnis from Shiite militias .
Advertisement
The Saudi ambassador to the United States , Prince Turki al Faisal , warned in a speech in October against an American withdrawal , saying that “ since the United States came into Iraq uninvited , it should not leave Iraq uninvited . ”
Rice encountered the limits of U.S. influence when she visited Jerusalem and the West Bank town of Jericho last week , trying to entice Arab confidence by displaying a renewed interest in Israeli - Palestinian peace .
But Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was gloomy about the prospects for a deal between his Fatah party and the militant group Hamas that would allow formation of a nonsectarian government and open the way for increased aid and , potentially , peace talks with Israel .
Rice said afterward that the administration “ cannot create the circumstances ” for peace .
Advertisement
“ This is the kind of thing that takes time , ” she said .
“ You do n’t expect great leaps forward . ”
Expressing deeper unhappiness with the United States , leaders from Jordan , Egypt and Persian Gulf countries told Rice during her trip to an economic development conference in Jordan on Friday that the U.S. had a responsibility to solve the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , which they and many analysts viewed as the key to regional stability .
Amr Moussa , secretary - general of the Arab League , urged greater U.S. action , warning that the Middle East was becoming “ an abyss ....
The region is facing real failure . ”

Zudeo users will be able to download copies of Red Dwarf
The move follows a deal between the commercial arm of the organisation , BBC Worldwide , and technology firm Azureus .
The agreement means that users of Azureus ' Zudeo software in the US can download titles such as Little Britain .
Until now , most BBC programmes found on peer - to - peer file - sharing networks have been illegal copies .
Beth Clearfield , vice president of programme management and digital media at BBC Worldwide , said that the agreement was part of a drive to reach the largest audience possible .
" We are very excited to partner with Azureus and make our content available through this revolutionary distribution model , " she said .
High definition
Azureus is best known for developing a BitTorrent client , or program , that allows large media files to be easily shared over the internet .
The program has been downloaded more than 130 million times .
Once you have watched a show , you can rate it , comment on it and recommend it to a friend
Gilles BianRosa , Azureus
Earlier this month the company launched a video sharing site similar to YouTube , codenamed Zudeo .
The site allows users to upload and view content .
However , in contrast to most video sharing sites , Zudeo offers high definition videos .
Users must also download a program to access and upload content .
The new deal means that users of the software will be able to download high - quality versions of BBC programmes , including Red Dwarf , Doctor Who and the League of Gentleman .
Classic series such as Fawlty Towers will also be available through a BBC " channel " .
The titles will be protected by digital rights management software to prevent the programmes being traded illegally on the internet .
" This will be a very different experience from traditional file - sharing networks , " said Gilles BianRosa , CEO of Azureus .
Users will also be able to link to programmes from blogs , social networks and fansites .
" If you have Zudeo running it will take you to that programme ; and if you do n't , it will suggest you install it , like the first time you download a flash movie , " said Mr BianRosa .
" Once you have watched a show , you can rate it , comment on it and recommend it to a friend . "
Mr BianRosa believes the cult status of many BBC programmes will make these features appealing to Zudeo users .
Legal services
File - sharing is often associated with illegal distribution of copyrighted content .
But in recent months a number of networks have tried to shake off this old image .
BitTorrent , the company behind the original file - sharing software of the same name , has recently signed a number of deals with content providers , such as 20th Century Fox , in a bid to become a legitimate download service .
Earlier this year , Sharman Networks , the owners of Kazaa , did similar deals .
Kazaa uses advertising to provide content for free .
No pricing structure for the BBC content on Zudeo has been revealed .
Azureus is expected to announce other partnerships in the New Year .
The net should be like a canal and not care about what travels on it
The Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation is considering making changes to the 1996 Telecommunications Act , and one of the ideas being floated is that network providers should be allowed to offer preferential service to some of their customers instead of providing a neutral data carrier service .
Back in 2004 , Michael Powell , at the time chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , said that net service firms should support " network freedom " and ensure that their users could access all lawful content and attach whatever devices they want to their network connection without any discrimination .
Now some of the big telecoms companies want to be able to sell premium services for things like streaming video or voice over IP , and some people are worried that this will eventually lead to a segregated internet .
They include Lawrence Lessig , law professor at Stanford University , founder of the Creative Commons and one of the most significant and influential thinkers about the future of the network we have been building for the past 30 years .
It 's a big issue .
After all , once we get away from the idea that the pipes just move bits around without really caring what data is being transmitted , it 's a small step to discriminating against some forms of content and then targeting specific sites , services or users .
Instead of an " end - to - end " network , we would end up with something more like the phone network , along with a complicated array of charging schemes for " 0800 " , " 0845 " and " 0871 " sites .
Those in favour of " network neutrality " and keeping the current model of the internet as just a data conduit include big hitters such as Google , eBay , Amazon and even Microsoft .
They know it will cost them more if they have to pay to get their video delivered to users .
The phone and cable companies want to be free to charge for new services and make more money , and they argue that it 's not up to the government what they do with their networks .
Policy echo
This might not seem to matter to the rest of us , since the US no longer has the majority of network users , but of course business practices , technologies and even laws made over there tend to have a disproportionate impact on the rest of the world so we should pay attention .
Social justice is best served by ensuring that public utilities , of which the network is surely one , are regulated in the public interest .
Bill Thompson
This debate is happening now largely thanks to the internet 's astonishing success .
The earliest packet - switched network connections , the ones that made up the early Arpanet back in the late 1960s , used telephone lines to transmit data between university campuses in California and Ohio .
But they used the network in the way that canal boats use water .
A canal has no idea what is being carried in the narrow boats , and it does n't really care .
Until the 1990's the phone companies did n't really know or care what data was going over the leased lines they sold .
When dial - up access started to take off , there was a flurry of activity and attempts at control , all of which failed .
However , now all the telcos run their own networks using internet technologies and internet protocols and they want a piece of the action .
Charging differently for different content is not the same as turning the net into a toll road , open to all for a fee .
We already have that : if you choose to pay more you can have a fast broadband connection to your home ; if you choose to pay vast amounts of money you can stream large amounts of data like Google or the BBC does .
Justice call
What is being proposed is more like building two roads into every town and up to every house , one smooth and well - maintained tarmac and the other a dirt track , and then letting Tesco and Waitrose bid for the right to use the good road .
Previous attempts to set up a two - tier net have failed
Some , mostly libertarian conservative thinkers like those at the Cato Institute , instinctively oppose any and all regulation and want the free market to determine what services are offered , at what price and to whom .
Even those who remember that the net emerged from a publicly - funded attempt to build a high - speed data network choose to claim that the days of subsidy are now over and that only deregulation can offer real benefits , both to companies and to the wider society .
For them , any attempt to restrict the telephone companies ' freedom to offer preferential service is tantamount to state socialism and one step away from a communist revolution .
Of course they are wrong , and badly so .
I 'm a market socialist , and I believe that regulated markets are the best way to create social value .
I have also been using the net since 1985 and I have seen it evolve and grow thanks to the balance between regulation and market forces .
That balance has to be maintained .
Social justice is best served by ensuring that public utilities , of which the network is surely one , are regulated in the public interest .
Markets fail , and they do so in ways that any humane society must address .
Ensuring that network access is available to all and that the network itself carries all lawful traffic is the only way forward .
We must just hope that the US government recognises that this is the case , and sets a good example to the rest of the world .

NASA 's Columbia orbiter launches skyward on April 12 , 1981 on NASA 's first - ever shuttle flight , STS - 1 .
Commanding the 54 - hour mission was astronaut veteran John Young with then - rookie flyer Robert Crippen as pilot .
Two astronauts , one space plane and NASA 's shuttle era began today in 1981 as the Columbia orbiter launched into the morning skies above Cape Canaveral , Florida .
NASA TV will present a series to STS - 1 anniversary events beginning with Young and Crippen 's reflections at 10:00 a.m. EDT .
Click here .
Columbia , NASA 's first spaceworthy shuttle , launched into orbit on its maiden STS - 1 flight at 7:00 a.m. EDT ( 1100 GMT ) with veteran Apollo and Gemini astronaut John Young at the helm and first - time spaceflyer Robert Crippen as pilot .
" To fly on the first one was a test pilot 's dream , " Crippen told SPACE.com 25 years after his spaceflight debut .
" It was an exciting ride . "
Today , NASA 's shuttle fleet is headed towards a 2010 retirement without ever attaining its goal of quick and affordable space access .
The fleet 's technical accomplishments as the world 's first reusable spacecraft are marred by two fatal accidents that claimed the lives of 14 astronauts and two orbiters ; Challenger in 1986 and Columbia herself in 2003 .
" We 've learned a great deal , " Young told SPACE.com .
" And that 's why you fly a test flight , so you can learn . "
54 Hours of firsts
Young and Crippen spent more than 54 hours in Earth orbit shaking down Columbia .
They opened its payload bay doors , checked its reaction control thrusters and put the orbiter through its paces before landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California .
" Everything worked , " Young told a crowd of 1,000 shuttle workers at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida last week .
" I was really surprised . "
Unlike today , when NASA flight controllers are in near - constant contact with orbiter crews via satellites , STS - 1 depended on ground communications systems to speak with mission control .
That dependency led to some tense moments as the STS - 1 crew made their plunge through the Earth 's atmosphere with only Columbia 's heat - resistant ceramic tiles and blankets for protection .
Back on Earth , Wayne Hale - then a propulsion systems support flight controller at NASA 's Johnson Space Center ( JSC ) in Houston - waited anxiously for Columbia to radio in .
" We had talked to them from the Guam relay station and gave them their last weather report and then we had about 30 minutes before they came over the horizon at Edwards , " said Hale , who is now NASA 's space shuttle program manager at JSC .
" That was maybe the longest 30 minutes of my life . "
Tiles and other surprises

There were some unexpected glitches on Columbia 's first flight .
A pressure shockwave from the orbiter 's solid rocket boosters damaged a strut that supports its forward thruster assembly on the launch pad .
Water dampers were later installed to mute the shockwave 's effects in future launches .
Columbia also had a track record for losing bits of the 30,000 - tile heat shield during assembly , Crippen said .
Some of those tiles - 16 in all - popped free from the orbiter during STS - 1 with 148 others sustaining damage .
The disastrous consequences of heat shield damage were made clear on Columbia 's last flight , STS - 107 in early 2003 , when fuel tank foam breached the orbiter 's wing at launch and led to its loss during reentry .
" I think if we knew then what we know now , we'd have probably been a lot more nervous , " Young said of the risks he and Crippen accepted for their test flight .
Even strapping the astronauts into the orbiter prompted some unexpected hitches , explained Loren Shriver , who helped secure Young and Crippen into their seats .
" The oxygen hoses to their masks had to be hooked up just right , " Shriver said , adding that he ended up using pliers to wedge Crippen 's hose into place to give him air .
" That was , hopefully , my contribution to the success of that mission . "
A matter of cost
NASA 's space shuttles have never realized the space agency 's initial hopes of frequent flights - up to 50 flights a year at first - and relatively low - cost launches .
The shuttle transportation system ( STS ) cost about $ 10 billion in 1981 dollars to develop for Columbia 's first flight , with the orbiter alone priced at $ 1 billion , NASA officials said .
Prior to the Columbia accident , when NASA flew an average of five missions per year , shuttle launches cost about $ 900 million from end - to - end , the space agency said .
" When it came to cost effectiveness , we did n't do as well , " said Bo Bejmuk , the orbiter program director at Boeing .
" Unfortunately the shuttle fell short this dream of bringing to America and the world of bringing access to space . "
NASA 's hopes for two - week turnarounds between shuttle missions also evaporated once it became clear that Columbia and its orbiter brethren required much more tile work and other maintenance between flights .
" Certainly , when you 're essentially taking apart a vehicle and putting it back together again , you lose a lot of features that reusability would give you , " said former NASA historian Roger Launius , now chair of the Division of Space History at the Smithsonian Institution 's National Air and Space Museum in Washington , D.C. , in an interview .
" But it 's really served as an exceptional spaceflight platform . "
With a capability of hauling 40,000 pounds ( 18,143 kilograms ) of cargo to orbit and back , the shuttle boasted a performance still unmatched today , Launius added .
' A fantastic flying machine '
Despite its unrealized ambitions , Columbia and NASA 's subsequent shuttles racked up an amazing number of accomplishments , the shining jewels of which are the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope and the initial assembly of the International Space Station .
" We 've learned a lot about the shuttle and it's a fantastic flying machine , " Crippen said .
" But we 've proven that it also requires a lot of tender loving care . "
A total of 294 astronauts and cosmonauts have flown aboard NASA 's space shuttles - Atlantis , Discovery and Endeavour are those three that remain - during launch and landing , continuing a chain of human spaceflight that began 45 years ago today with cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin 's historic 1961 space shot .
" They were all great , but that first one will always stand out , " Crippen said of his four shuttle flights .
" I 'd go do it again tomorrow if they would n't make me train for a year . "
Forget squeezing millions from a few megahits at the top of the charts .
The future of entertainment is in the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of the bitstream .
This is the world of scarcity .
Now , with online distribution and retail , we are entering a world of abundance .
And the differences are profound .
Hit - driven economics is a creation of an age without enough room to carry everything for everybody .
Not enough shelf space for all the CDs , DVDs , and games produced .
Not enough screens to show all the available movies .
Not enough channels to broadcast all the TV programs , not enough radio waves to play all the music created , and not enough hours in the day to squeeze everything out through either of those sets of slots .
But most of us want more than just hits .
Everyone 's taste departs from the mainstream somewhere , and the more we explore alternatives , the more we 're drawn to them .
Unfortunately , in recent decades such alternatives have been pushed to the fringes by pumped - up marketing vehicles built to order by industries that desperately need them .
The past century of entertainment has offered an easy solution to these constraints .
Hits fill theaters , fly off shelves , and keep listeners and viewers from touching their dials and remotes .
Nothing wrong with that ; indeed , sociologists will tell you that hits are hardwired into human psychology , the combinatorial effect of conformity and word of mouth .
And to be sure , a healthy share of hits earn their place : Great songs , movies , and books attract big , broad audiences .
The other constraint of the physical world is physics itself .
The radio spectrum can carry only so many stations , and a coaxial cable so many TV channels .
And , of course , there are only 24 hours a day of programming .
The curse of broadcast technologies is that they are profligate users of limited resources .
The result is yet another instance of having to aggregate large audiences in one geographic area — another high bar , above which only a fraction of potential content rises .
There is plenty of great entertainment with potentially large , even rapturous , national audiences that cannot clear that bar .
For instance , The Triplets of Belleville , a critically acclaimed film that was nominated for the best animated feature Oscar this year , opened on just six screens nationwide .
An even more striking example is the plight of Bollywood in America .
Each year , India 's film industry puts out more than 800 feature films .
There are an estimated 1.7 million Indians in the US .
Yet the top-rated ( according to Amazon 's Internet Movie Database ) Hindi- language film , Lagaan : Once Upon a Time in India , opened on just two screens , and it was one of only a handful of Indian films to get any US distribution at all .
In the tyranny of physical space , an audience too thinly spread is the same as no audience at all .
In each case , retailers will carry only content that can generate sufficient demand to earn its keep .
But each can pull only from a limited local population — perhaps a 10 - mile radius for a typical movie theater , less than that for music and bookstores , and even less ( just a mile or two ) for video rental shops .
It 's not enough for a great documentary to have a potential national audience of half a million ; what matters is how many it has in the northern part of Rockville , Maryland , and among the mall shoppers of Walnut Creek , California .
The first is the need to find local audiences .
An average movie theater will not show a film unless it can attract at least 1,500 people over a two - week run ; that 's essentially the rent for a screen .
An average record store needs to sell at least two copies of a CD per year to make it worth carrying ; that 's the rent for a half inch of shelf space .
And so on for DVD rental shops , videogame stores , booksellers , and newsstands .
The main problem , if that 's the word , is that we live in the physical world and , until recently , most of our entertainment media did , too .
But that world puts two dramatic limitations on our entertainment .
For too long we 've been suffering the tyranny of lowest - common - denominator fare , subjected to brain - dead summer blockbusters and manufactured pop .
Why ?
Economics .
Many of our assumptions about popular taste are actually artifacts of poor supply - and - demand matching — a market response to inefficient distribution .
An analysis of the sales data and trends from these services and others like them shows that the emerging digital entertainment economy is going to be radically different from today 's mass market .
If the 20th - century entertainment industry was about hits , the 21st will be equally about misses .
This is not just a virtue of online booksellers ; it is an example of an entirely new economic model for the media and entertainment industries , one that is just beginning to show its power .
Unlimited selection is revealing truths about what consumers want and how they want to get it in service after service , from DVDs at Netflix to music videos on Yahoo !
Launch to songs in the iTunes Music Store and Rhapsody .
People are going deep into the catalog , down the long , long list of available titles , far past what 's available at Blockbuster Video , Tower Records , and Barnes & Noble .
And the more they find , the more they like .
As they wander further from the beaten path , they discover their taste is not as mainstream as they thought ( or as they had been led to believe by marketing , a lack of alternatives , and a hit - driven culture ) .
Particularly notable is that when Krakauer 's book hit shelves , Simpson 's was nearly out of print .
A few years ago , readers of Krakauer would never even have learned about Simpson 's book — and if they had , they would n't have been able to find it .
Amazon changed that .
It created the Touching the Void phenomenon by combining infinite shelf space with real - time information about buying trends and public opinion .
The result : rising demand for an obscure book .
What happened ?
In short , Amazon.com recommendations .
The online bookseller 's software noted patterns in buying behavior and suggested that readers who liked Into Thin Air would also like Touching the Void .
People took the suggestion , agreed wholeheartedly , wrote rhapsodic reviews .
More sales , more algorithm - fueled recommendations , and the positive feedback loop kicked in .
Random
House rushed out a new edition to keep up with demand .
Booksellers began to promote it next to their Into Thin Air displays , and sales rose further .
A revised paperback edition , which came out in January , spent 14 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list .
That same month , IFC Films released a docudrama of the story to critical acclaim .
Now Touching the Void outsells Into Thin Air more than two to one .
In 1988 , a British mountain climber named Joe Simpson wrote a book called Touching the Void , a harrowing account of near death in the Peruvian Andes .
It got good reviews but , only a modest success , it was soon forgotten .
Then , a decade later , a strange thing happened .
Jon Krakauer wrote Into Thin Air , another book about a mountain - climbing tragedy , which became a publishing sensation .
Suddenly Touching the Void started to sell again .
But as egalitarian as Wal - Mart may seem , it is actually extraordinarily elitist .
Wal - Mart must sell at least 100,000 copies of a CD to cover its retail overhead and make a sufficient profit ; less than 1 percent of CDs do that kind of volume .
What about the 60,000 people who would like to buy the latest Fountains of Wayne or Crystal Method album , or any other nonmainstream fare ?
They have to go somewhere else .
Bookstores , the megaplex , radio , and network TV can be equally demanding .
We equate mass market with quality and demand , when in fact it often just represents familiarity , savvy advertising , and broad if somewhat shallow appeal .
What do we really want ?
We 're only just discovering , but it clearly starts with more .
The second reason for the wrong answer is that the industry has a poor sense of what people want .
Indeed , we have a poor sense of what we want .
We assume , for instance , that there is little demand for the stuff that is n't carried by Wal - Mart and other major retailers ; if people wanted it , surely it would be sold .
The rest , the bottom 80 percent , must be subcommercial at best .
With no shelf space to pay for and , in the case of purely digital services like iTunes , no manufacturing costs and hardly any distribution fees , a miss sold is just another sale , with the same margins as a hit .
A hit and a miss are on equal economic footing , both just entries in a database called up on demand , both equally worthy of being carried .
Suddenly , popularity no longer has a monopoly on profitability .
People get Vann - Adibe 's question wrong because the answer is counterintuitive in two ways .
The first is we forget that the 20 percent rule in the entertainment industry is about hits , not sales of any sort .
We 're stuck in a hit - driven mindset — we think that if something is n't a hit , it wo n't make money and so wo n't return the cost of its production .
We assume , in other words , that only hits deserve to exist .
But Vann - Adibe , like executives at iTunes , Amazon , and Netflix , has discovered that the " misses " usually make money , too .
And because there are so many more of them , that money can add up quickly to a huge new market .
But the right answer , says Vann - Adibe , is 99 percent .
There is demand for nearly every one of those top 10,000 tracks .
He sees it in his own jukebox statistics ; each month , thousands of people put in their dollars for songs that no traditional jukebox anywhere has ever carried .
Most people guess 20 percent , and for good reason :
We 've been trained to think that way .
The 80 - 20 rule , also known as Pareto 's principle ( after Vilfredo Pareto , an Italian economist who devised the concept in 1906 ) , is all around us .
Only 20 percent of major studio films will be hits .
Same for TV shows , games , and mass - market books — 20 percent all .
The odds are even worse for major - label CDs , where fewer than 10 percent are profitable , according to the Recording Industry Association of America .
To see how , meet Robbie Vann - Adibe , the CEO of Ecast , a digital jukebox company whose barroom players offer more than 150,000 tracks — and some surprising usage statistics .
He hints at them with a question that visitors invariably get wrong : " What percentage of the top 10,000 titles in any online media store ( Netflix , iTunes , Amazon , or any other ) will rent or sell at least once a month ? "
To get a sense of our true taste , unfiltered by the economics of scarcity , look at Rhapsody , a subscription - based streaming music service ( owned by RealNetworks ) that currently offers more than 735,000 tracks .
Chart Rhapsody 's monthly statistics and you get a " power law " demand curve that looks much like any record store 's , with huge appeal for the top tracks , tailing off quickly for less popular ones .
But a really interesting thing happens once you dig below the top 40,000 tracks , which is about the amount of the fluid inventory ( the albums carried that will eventually be sold ) of the average real - world record store .
Here , the Wal - Marts of the world go to zero — either they do n't carry any more CDs , or the few potential local takers for such fringy fare never find it or never even enter the store .
The Rhapsody demand , however , keeps going .
Not only is every one of Rhapsody 's top 100,000 tracks streamed at least once each month , the same is true for its top 200,000 , top 300,000 , and top 400,000 .
As fast as Rhapsody adds tracks to its library , those songs find an audience , even if it 's just a few people a month , somewhere in the country .
This is the Long Tail .
You can find everything out there on the Long Tail .
There 's the back catalog , older albums still fondly remembered by longtime fans or rediscovered by new ones .
There are live tracks , B - sides , remixes , even ( gasp ) covers .
There are niches by the thousands , genre within genre within genre : Imagine an entire Tower Records devoted to ' 80s hair bands or ambient dub .
There are foreign bands , once priced out of reach in the Import aisle , and obscure bands on even more obscure labels , many of which do n't have the distribution clout to get into Tower at all .
Oh sure , there 's also a lot of crap .
But there 's a lot of crap hiding between the radio tracks on hit albums , too .
People have to skip over it on CDs , but they can more easily avoid it online , since the collaborative filters typically wo n't steer you to it .
Unlike the CD , where each crap track costs perhaps one - twelfth of a $ 15 album price , online it just sits harmlessly on some server , ignored in a market that sells by the song and evaluates tracks on their own merit .
What 's really amazing about the Long Tail is the sheer size of it .
Combine enough nonhits on the Long Tail and you 've got a market bigger than the hits .
Take books :
The average Barnes & Noble carries 130,000 titles .
Yet more than half of Amazon 's book sales come from outside its top 130,000 titles .
Consider the implication :
If the Amazon statistics are any guide , the market for books that are not even sold in the average bookstore is larger than the market for those that are ( see Anatomy of the Long Tail ) .
In other words , the potential book market may be twice as big as it appears to be , if only we can get over the economics of scarcity .
Venture capitalist and former music industry consultant Kevin Laws puts it this way : " The biggest money is in the smallest sales . "
The same is true for all other aspects of the entertainment business , to one degree or another .
Just compare online and offline businesses :
The average Blockbuster carries fewer than 3,000 DVDs .
Yet a fifth of Netflix rentals are outside its top 3,000 titles .
Rhapsody streams more songs each month beyond its top 10,000 than it does its top 10,000 .
In each case , the market that lies outside the reach of the physical retailer is big and getting bigger .
When you think about it , most successful businesses on the Internet are about aggregating the Long Tail in one way or another .
Google , for instance , makes most of its money off small advertisers ( the long tail of advertising ) , and eBay is mostly tail as well — niche and one - off products .
By overcoming the limitations of geography and scale , just as Rhapsody and Amazon have , Google and eBay have discovered new markets and expanded existing ones .
This is the power of the Long Tail .
The companies at the vanguard of it are showing the way with three big lessons .
Call them the new rules for the new entertainment economy .
Rule 1 : Make everything available
If you love documentaries , Blockbuster is not for you .
Nor is any other video store — there are too many documentaries , and they sell too poorly to justify stocking more than a few dozen of them on physical shelves .
Instead , you 'll want to join Netflix , which offers more than a thousand documentaries — because it can .
Such profligacy is giving a boost to the documentary business ; last year , Netflix accounted for half of all US rental revenue for Capturing the Friedmans , a documentary about a family destroyed by allegations of pedophilia .
Netflix CEO Reed Hastings , who 's something of a documentary buff , took this newfound clout to PBS , which had produced Daughter From Danang , a documentary about the children of US soldiers and Vietnamese women .
In 2002 , the film was nominated for an Oscar and was named best documentary at Sundance , but PBS had no plans to release it on DVD .
Hastings offered to handle the manufacturing and distribution if PBS would make it available as a Netflix exclusive .
Now Daughter From Danang consistently ranks in the top 15 on Netflix documentary charts .
That amounts to a market of tens of thousands of documentary renters that did not otherwise exist .
There are any number of equally attractive genres and subgenres neglected by the traditional DVD channels : foreign films , anime , independent movies , British television dramas , old American TV sitcoms .
These underserved markets make up a big chunk of Netflix rentals .
Bollywood alone accounts for nearly 100,000 rentals each month .
The availability of offbeat content drives new customers to Netflix — and anything that cuts the cost of customer acquisition is gold for a subscription business .
Thus the company 's first lesson : Embrace niches .
Netflix has made a good business out of what 's unprofitable fare in movie theaters and video rental shops because it can aggregate dispersed audiences .
It does n't matter if the several thousand people who rent Doctor Who episodes each month are in one city or spread , one per town , across the country — the economics are the same to Netflix .
It has , in short , broken the tyranny of physical space .
What matters is not where customers are , or even how many of them are seeking a particular title , but only that some number of them exist , anywhere .
As a result , almost anything is worth offering on the off chance it will find a buyer .
This is the opposite of the way the entertainment industry now thinks .
Today , the decision about whether or when to release an old film on DVD is based on estimates of demand , availability of extras such as commentary and additional material , and marketing opportunities such as anniversaries , awards , and generational windows ( Disney briefly rereleases its classics every 10 years or so as a new wave of kids come of age ) .
It 's a high bar , which is why only a fraction of movies ever made are available on DVD .
That model may make sense for the true classics , but it 's way too much fuss for everything else .
The Long Tail approach , by contrast , is to simply dump huge chunks of the archive onto bare - bones DVDs , without any extras or marketing .
Call it the Silver Series and charge half the price .
Same for independent films .
This year , nearly 6,000 movies were submitted to the Sundance Film Festival .
Of those , 255 were accepted , and just two dozen have been picked up for distribution ; to see the others , you had to be there .
Why not release all 255 on DVD each year as part of a discount Sundance Series ?
In a Long Tail economy , it 's more expensive to evaluate than to release .
Just do it !
The same is true for the music industry .
It should be securing the rights to release all the titles in all the back catalogs as quickly as it can — thoughtlessly , automatically , and at industrial scale .
( This is one of those rare moments where the world needs more lawyers , not fewer . )
So too for videogames .
Retro gaming , including simulators of classic game consoles that run on modern PCs , is a growing phenomenon driven by the nostalgia of the first joystick generation .
Game publishers could release every title as a 99 - cent download three years after its release — no support , no guarantees , no packaging .
All this , of course , applies equally to books .
Already , we 're seeing a blurring of the line between in and out of print .
Amazon and other networks of used booksellers have made it almost as easy to find and buy a second - hand book as it is a new one .
By divorcing bookselling from geography , these networks create a liquid market at low volume , dramatically increasing both their own business and the overall demand for used books .
Combine that with the rapidly dropping costs of print - on - demand technologies and it's clear why any book should always be available .
Indeed , it is a fair bet that children today will grow up never knowing the meaning of out of print .
Rule 2 : Cut the price in half .
Now lower it .
Thanks to the success of Apple 's iTunes , we now have a standard price for a downloaded track : 99 cents .
But is it the right one ?
Ask the labels and they 'll tell you it 's too low :
Even though 99 cents per track works out to about the same price as a CD , most consumers just buy a track or two from an album online , rather than the full CD .
In effect , online music has seen a return to the singles - driven business of the 1950s .
So from a label perspective , consumers should pay more for the privilege of purchasing à la carte to compensate for the lost album revenue .
Ask consumers , on the other hand , and they 'll tell you that 99 cents is too high .
It is , for starters , 99 cents more than Kazaa .
But piracy aside , 99 cents violates our innate sense of economic justice :
If it clearly costs less for a record label to deliver a song online , with no packaging , manufacturing , distribution , or shelf space overheads , why should n't the price be less , too ?
Surprisingly enough , there 's been little good economic analysis on what the right price for online music should be .
The main reason for this is that pricing is n't set by the market today but by the record label demi-cartel .
Record companies charge a wholesale price of around 65 cents per track , leaving little room for price experimentation by the retailers .
That wholesale price is set to roughly match the price of CDs , to avoid dreaded " channel conflict . "
The labels fear that if they price online music lower , their CD retailers ( still the vast majority of the business ) will revolt or , more likely , go out of business even more quickly than they already are .
In either case , it would be a serious disruption of the status quo , which terrifies the already spooked record companies .
No wonder they 're doing price calculations with an eye on the downsides in their traditional CD business rather than the upside in their new online business .
But what if the record labels stopped playing defense ?
A brave new look at the economics of music would calculate what it really costs to simply put a song on an iTunes server and adjust pricing accordingly .
The results are surprising .
Take away the unnecessary costs of the retail channel — CD manufacturing , distribution , and retail overheads .
That leaves the costs of finding , making , and marketing music .
Keep them as they are , to ensure that the people on the creative and label side of the business make as much as they currently do .
For a popular album that sells 300,000 copies , the creative costs work out to about $ 7.50 per disc , or around 60 cents a track .
Add to that the actual cost of delivering music online , which is mostly the cost of building and maintaining the online service rather than the negligible storage and bandwidth costs .
Current price tag : around 17 cents a track .
By this calculation , hit music is overpriced by 25 percent online — it should cost just 79 cents a track , reflecting the savings of digital delivery .
Putting channel conflict aside for the moment , if the incremental cost of making content that was originally produced for physical distribution available online is low , the price should be , too .
Price according to digital costs , not physical ones .
All this good news for consumers does n't have to hurt the industry .
When you lower prices , people tend to buy more .
Last year , Rhapsody did an experiment in elastic demand that suggested it could be a lot more .
For a brief period , the service offered tracks at 99 cents , 79 cents , and 49 cents .
Although the 49 - cent tracks were only half the price of the 99 - cent tracks , Rhapsody sold three times as many of them .
Since the record companies still charged 65 cents a track — and Rhapsody paid another 8 cents per track to the copyright - holding publishers —
Rhapsody lost money on that experiment ( but , as the old joke goes , made it up in volume ) .
Yet much of the content on the Long Tail is older material that has already made back its money ( or been written off for failing to do so ) : music from bands that had little record company investment and was thus cheap to make , or live recordings , remixes , and other material that came at low cost .
Such " misses " cost less to make available than hits , so why not charge even less for them ?
Imagine if prices declined the further you went down the Tail , with popularity ( the market ) effectively dictating pricing .
All it would take is for the labels to lower the wholesale price for the vast majority of their content not in heavy rotation ; even a two - or three - tiered pricing structure could work wonders .
And because so much of that content is not available in record stores , the risk of channel conflict is greatly diminished .
The lesson : Pull consumers down the tail with lower prices .
How low should the labels go ?
The answer comes by examining the psychology of the music consumer .
The choice facing fans is not how many songs to buy from iTunes and Rhapsody , but how many songs to buy rather than download for free from Kazaa and other peer - to - peer networks .
Intuitively , consumers know that free music is not really free : Aside from any legal risks , it 's a time - consuming hassle to build a collection that way .
Labeling is inconsistent , quality varies , and an estimated 30 percent of tracks are defective in one way or another .
As Steve Jobs put it at the iTunes Music Store launch , you may save a little money downloading from Kazaa , but " you 're working for under minimum wage . "
And what 's true for music is doubly true for movies and games , where the quality of pirated products can be even more dismal , viruses are a risk , and downloads take so much longer .
So free has a cost : the psychological value of convenience .
This is the " not worth it " moment where the wallet opens .
The exact amount is an impossible calculus involving the bank balance of the average college student multiplied by their available free time .
But imagine that for music , at least , it 's around 20 cents a track .
That , in effect , is the dividing line between the commercial world of the Long Tail and the underground .
Both worlds will continue to exist in parallel , but it 's crucial for Long Tail thinkers to exploit the opportunities between 20 and 99 cents to maximize their share .
By offering fair pricing , ease of use , and consistent quality , you can compete with free .
Perhaps the best way to do that is to stop charging for individual tracks at all .
Danny Stein , whose private equity firm owns eMusic , thinks the future of the business is to move away from the ownership model entirely .
With ubiquitous broadband , both wired and wireless , more consumers will turn to the celestial jukebox of music services that offer every track ever made , playable on demand .
Some of those tracks will be free to listeners and advertising - supported , like radio .
Others , like eMusic and Rhapsody , will be subscription services .
Today , digital music economics are dominated by the iPod , with its notion of a paid - up library of personal tracks .
But as the networks improve , the comparative economic advantages of unlimited streamed music , either financed by advertising or a flat fee ( infinite choice for $ 9.99 a month ) , may shift the market that way .
And drive another nail in the coffin of the retail music model .
Rule 3 : Help me find it
In 1997 , an entrepreneur named Michael Robertson started what looked like a classic Long Tail business .
Called MP3.com , it let anyone upload music files that would be available to all .
The idea was the service would bypass the record labels , allowing artists to connect directly to listeners .
MP3.com would make its money in fees paid by bands to have their music promoted on the site .
The tyranny of the labels would be broken , and a thousand flowers would bloom .
Putting aside the fact that many people actually used the service to illegally upload and share commercial tracks , leading the labels to sue MP3.com , the model failed at its intended purpose , too .
Struggling bands did not , as a rule , find new audiences , and independent music was not transformed .
Indeed , MP3.com got a reputation for being exactly what it was : an undifferentiated mass of mostly bad music that deserved its obscurity .
The problem with MP3.com was that it was only Long Tail .
It did n't have license agreements with the labels to offer mainstream fare or much popular commercial music at all .
Therefore , there was no familiar point of entry for consumers , no known quantity from which further exploring could begin .
Offering only hits is no better .
Think of the struggling video - on - demand services of the cable companies .
Or think of Movielink , the feeble video download service run by the studios .
Due to overcontrolling providers and high costs , they suffer from limited content : in most cases just a few hundred recent releases .
There 's not enough choice to change consumer behavior , to become a real force in the entertainment economy .
By contrast , the success of Netflix , Amazon , and the commercial music services shows that you need both ends of the curve .
Their huge libraries of less - mainstream fare set them apart , but hits still matter in attracting consumers in the first place .
Great Long
Tail businesses can then guide consumers further afield by following the contours of their likes and dislikes , easing their exploration of the unknown .
For instance , the front screen of Rhapsody features Britney Spears , unsurprisingly .
Next to the listings of her work is a box of " similar artists . "
Among them is Pink .
If you click on that and are pleased with what you hear , you may do the same for Pink 's similar artists , which include No Doubt .
And on No Doubt 's page , the list includes a few " followers " and " influencers , " the last of which includes the Selecter , a 1980s ska band from Coventry , England .
In three clicks , Rhapsody may have enticed a Britney Spears fan to try an album that can hardly be found in a record store .
Rhapsody does this with a combination of human editors and genre guides .
But Netflix , where 60 percent of rentals come from recommendations , and Amazon do this with collaborative filtering , which uses the browsing and purchasing patterns of users to guide those who follow them ( " Customers who bought this also bought ... " ) .
In each , the aim is the same : Use recommendations to drive demand down the Long Tail .
This is the difference between push and pull , between broadcast and personalized taste .
Long
Tail business can treat consumers as individuals , offering mass customization as an alternative to mass - market fare .
The advantages are spread widely .
For the entertainment industry itself , recommendations are a remarkably efficient form of marketing , allowing smaller films and less - mainstream music to find an audience .
For consumers , the improved signal - to - noise ratio that comes from following a good recommendation encourages exploration and can reawaken a passion for music and film , potentially creating a far larger entertainment market overall .
( The average Netflix customer rents seven DVDs a month , three times the rate at brick - and - mortar stores . )
And the cultural benefit of all of this is much more diversity , reversing the blanding effects of a century of distribution scarcity and ending the tyranny of the hit .
Such is the power of the Long Tail .
Its time has come .

The Long Tail .
With all the success stories about Expat Software and Blogabond that I 've been telling lately , you might get the impression that it 's all blue skies every day here .
I thought it would be good for balance if I told the story of one of our spectacular failures .
Back in 2004 , Waifmail was positioned to be the great Outlook killer .
A web based mail client from which you could read all your email from all your myriad accounts , all in one place .
All on one screen .
It was pretty cool .
Waifmail died before it got off the ground for a number of reasons that are too complex to go into here but …
Nah , screw that .
it died for 6 specific reasons that I 'll outline below .
In actuality , it died for one single reason : GMail .
But it sounds more interesting if I break it up into a bunch of bullet points instead .
6. Small target audience
As you might know if you 've been reading this blog , I travel a lot .
As a result , I often find myself in some sweaty little internet café in rural Laos , waiting 20 minutes for Hotmail to load up the " Hey , you have some mail " screen .
Followed by another 20 minutes to load the screen where it actually shows you that mail .
I have 4 email addresses that I like to keep up with , so every visit to the internet café involves a dozen Internet Explorer sessions open at any given time , all fighting for bandwidth over the single shared AOL connection that the café is using .
My first big mistake was assuming that there was at least one other human being on the planet with my same problem .
To be fair , there were probably a few .
But they were stuck in some dingy Cambodian internet café , and not likely to find this thing .
Especially true due to our ...
5 . Really sad marketing
To be honest , I can't even remember what our marketing strategy was for this thing .
Something along the lines of " Put a link on the Expat Software site and let Google find it . "
I might have mentioned the site in a few posts to the Usenet , but we never really seriously marketed the thing and certainly never paid for any advertisement .
I think it was the classic case of the geek in the basement ( or jungle as the case may be ) writing his perfect app and then sitting back waiting for the world to find it .
Nobody did .
4 . Poor technology choice
I know it 's lame to blame your crappy software product on a crappy development platform , but I think we were really hampered by our decision to go with the LAMP stack for this thing .
Specifically , PHP .
I 'd done a fair amount of PHP development by this point , and had built a set of tools that let me work pretty well from a public internet terminal .
My little DHTML IDE and file management utilities worked so well that when I took off on my 9 month road trip , I left the laptop at home .
I did some research before starting development on Waifmail , and it seemed like PHP had a pretty decent mail library built in , and another beefier one waiting to go in PEAR .
I come from a Microsoft background , and you can say what you want about Microsoft , but their development tools and libraries are rock solid .
If they have a library called System .
Web .
Mail , you can rest assured that it will actually send emails when you ask it to .
Unfortunately , this is not the case with PHP .
First off , the IMAP_ whatever functions in PHP simply do not work .
It 's incredible that there are four separate ways of opening a mailbox and none of them will actually open a mailbox .
Check out the documentation over at php.net .
It 's unmitigated comedy , as dozens of developers hand out advice in an attempt to get the library to function at all .
Next up was PEAR , which is at least capable of sending an email message .
Too bad it does n't offer much help in connecting to a mail server and reading your mail .
Looking around the PEAR site today , it seems that people have at least been adding to it , so it 's possible that there is a functional library in there somewhere .
Though in standard PHP fashion , you get multiple semi-redundant libraries piled on top of one - another with no naming standards .
So , as a last resort , I wrote my own IMAP and POP clients in PHP .
Not any fun to do , and certainly an unwelcome piece of work since it was the one thing I figured I 'd get for free from the platform .
3. Reliance on shared hosting
This was another visionary move that turned disastrous in a hurry .
The plan was to rely on constellations of cheap $ 5 / month shared boxes , easily adding more capacity as demand increased .
Seeing as how we 've gotten about 40 signups in 3 years , we never needed to put this grand scaling vision into place , but it woulda ' been cool I tells ya !
The problem with this scheme is that we lost control of the environment .
MySql would put out a release , our host would upgrade the servers , and something at Waifmail would randomly break .
New versions of PHP would come and go , with different global settings in place , and suddenly we'd be living in the world of " Magic_Quotes_Runtime " and everybody 's mail would have slashes all over the place .
We 'd wake up to find the site on another box that did n't have the PEAR libraries installed , and suddenly mail would stop sending .
It became a lot of work just keeping track of this stuff .
Eventually , the whole hosting company got sold and the site ended up on another box with a different configuration .
That 's about when I gave up paying attention .
I 'd be surprised it Waifmail were even functional today .
2. Impossible to gain users ' trust
This one stopped us dead in our tracks .
Try it out some time .
Put up a new website and ask people to type in their email address and password !
That 's really the only way we can log into your mail server to show you your email , but really , who in their right mind would give out this information ?
Maybe if you 're Google you could pull this off , but for an unknown site just starting out , this simply killed us .
I knew it was n't gonna work the day I tried to demo the site to my sister .
I showed here the signup page and told her to put in her email address and password .
Lisa : " My Email address ?
My company does n't really like me to give that out . "
Me : " But you 're not giving it out .
You 're just using it to read your mail . "
Lisa : " Yeah , but still …
If they found out I think they'd be mad . "
There you have it .
We 're fucked .
1. GMAIL
This all happened in the winter of 2004 .
Now sometime around April of that year , this company Google put out their own email service called Gmail .
Perhaps you 've heard of it .
Gmail did roughly everything that Waifmail had set out to do with the sole exception of letting you read your Yahoo , Hotmail , and work accounts through their reader .
But you knew that was coming soon .
And when it did , any little company trying to do the same thing would be out of luck .
Fortunately for us , we had already thrown in the towel .
WITH his leg injured in a recent skiing accident , Arnold Schwarzenegger , California 's governor , this week announced a plan that could change the terms of America 's health - care debate .
The Republican in charge of the country 's most populous state , where 6.5 m people , almost one resident in five , lack medical insurance , said he wants to introduce universal health - care coverage .
His recipe is a combination of insurance - market reform , government subsidies and — most important — compulsion .
“ Everyone in California must have insurance , ” Mr Schwarzenegger argued .
“ If you can't afford it , the state will help you buy it , but you must be insured . ”
Although the details are still sketchy , Mr Schwarzenegger 's plan is very like another pioneering health - care reform that was successfully championed by another Republican governor in a strongly Democratic state .
In April 2006 Mitt Romney , then the governor of Massachusetts and now a leading Republican presidential candidate , agreed on a plan for universal health - care coverage with the state 's Democratic legislature .
It too made health insurance mandatory , and it also included insurance reform and subsidies .
Massachusetts , and now California , have the boldest plans .
But they are not the only states concerned with reducing the ranks of the uninsured .
Illinois , Tennessee and Pennsylvania have pledged to insure all children .
Half a dozen other states have official commissions charged with producing comprehensive reform plans this year .
Could the states jump - start American health - care reform ?
America has 47 m people without medical insurance , around one sixth of its population .
No one doubts that this is both morally vexing and economically inefficient .
The uninsured get too little preventive medicine , but hospitals are , by law , obliged to offer them ( expensive ) emergency care , thus raising costs for everyone else .
And as health - care costs have risen , and premiums with them , the ranks of the uninsured have grown ( see chart ) .
Unfortunately , America 's national debate about health - care reform has been stalled for more than a decade by a combination of ideology and political cowardice .
The left argues that the solution is more government intervention ; the right espouses deregulation and consumer choice to slow cost increases and so make insurance more affordable .
Both sides are cowed by the memory of Hillary Clinton 's disastrous failure to rewrite the rules of American medicine in 1994 .
State governors have less ideological baggage .
States have often been America 's policy laboratories , pioneering changes that become national models .
In the late 1980s and early 1990s , for instance , Wisconsin led the revolution in welfare , the system of government handouts aimed mostly at poor single mothers .
But health care has proved trickier .
Massachusetts tried and failed to force employers to provide health insurance two decades ago .
One problem is that the federal government controls most of the money .
Medicare , the giant health scheme for the elderly , is federally financed and run .
Medicaid , the scheme for the poor , is organised at the state level but co-financed with Uncle Sam .
All told , state governments pay for only about 13 % of America 's medical spending .
If you include the huge tax subsidies for employer - provided insurance , the federal government 's share is almost 40 % .
Nonetheless , three things suggest that state - led innovation has greater promise now than in the past .
The first is the Schwarzenegger - Romney effect .
Now that America 's biggest state has put universal coverage at the top of its political agenda , the feds will have to take notice .
Mr Romney will also ensure that health - care reform looms large in the presidential race that is already under way .
Second , the big federally - funded State Children 's Health Insurance Programme ( SCHIP ) is up for renewal this year .
Introduced a decade ago , it gives the states $ 5 billion in grants a year to help children whose families are just above the poverty line ( and hence ineligible for Medicaid ) get access to health care .
The money comes from Washington , DC , but states can spend it as they wish .
Many Democrats want to expand SCHIP .
And third , several congressmen are now pushing laws that would explicitly encourage state experimentation by making it easier for states to innovate using federal money and , in some cases , by offering more money .
Bay State experimenting
A lot depends on whether the states ' reforms actually appear to work .
All eyes are on Massachusetts , since it is the first state actually to enact ( rather than merely propose ) comprehensive reform , particularly the mandatory purchase of insurance .
From July 2007 every resident must have health insurance , or face a $ 1,000 fine .
People with incomes up to three times the federal poverty threshold ( almost $ 60,000 for a family of four ) will get subsidies to buy insurance .
Firms with more than ten workers must offer employees a health plan or pay the state a “ contribution ” of up to $ 295 per employee .
Massachusetts has also revamped the insurance market for individuals and small businesses .
A new clearing house , the “ Commonwealth Connector ” , is designed to offer more choice and cheaper plans for those outside big firms .
People in this “ Connector ” will be able to offset their health insurance against tax , a perk until now available only to employers .
Forcing everyone to buy insurance is probably the only way to avoid the “ adverse selection ” problem that plagues health - insurance markets .
Younger workers in good health avoid buying coverage , leaving higher - risk people in the insurance pool , thus driving up premiums .
And if the uninsured workers fall really ill , they become free - riders on the others , since hospitals are required to treat them at public expense : had they been treated earlier , they might have been cured more cheaply .
Massachusetts 's success will depend on whether its mandate actually prompts people to buy insurance .
To avoid political uproar when the law kicks in , the state has left itself plenty of wriggle room .
The individual mandate will not apply unless “ affordable ” insurance is available .
But the greater the wriggle room , the less effective the mandates will be .
Experiments elsewhere in New England suggest that the voluntary route to universal health - care coverage is costly and difficult .
Maine and Vermont are both trying to insure all their citizens .
Both have rejigged their insurance market for individuals and small businesses .
Both are offering subsidies to poorer people .
But neither compels anyone to buy insurance .
Vermont 's plan was introduced less than a year ago .
But Maine 's plan has been up and running since January 2005 , and its results have been disappointing .
According to Cristy Gallagher of the New America Foundation , a Washington , DC , think - tank , only 15,000 people have enrolled so far .
The state is a long way from covering its 130,000 uninsured citizens , while the subsidies are proving costlier than expected .
Besides , although obliging everyone to have health insurance can compensate for some of the extra cost of covering the uninsured , it does not offset it entirely .
Massachusetts could push for universal coverage in part because only 10 % of its citizens lack health coverage .
The state was also blessed with lots of money to fund its reforms : an annual $ 385 m pot of federal Medicaid funds , as well as $ 600 m a year that was already being used to help reimburse hospitals for treating the uninsured .
Most other states have less money and greater need .
Covering California 's 6.5 m uninsured , for instance , will cost the public purse around $ 12 billion a year .
Mr Schwarzenegger expects $ 5 billion of that money to come from the federal government .
He plans to raise the rest from a mish - mash of taxes on employers , doctors and hospitals .
Going for kids
The cost of expanding health coverage explains why many states have set themselves less ambitious goals than universal insurance .
One popular and attainable one is to insure all children .
Only about 3 % of children are both uninsured and ineligible for help under either SCHIP or Medicaid .
Several states are simply expanding their SCHIP schemes to cover children higher up the income scale .
Illinois allows any parents to buy into SCHIP if their children have been without health insurance for more than a year .
Pennsylvania offers free coverage to families who earn up to twice the official poverty rate .
Other states , however , are concentrating on the much larger problem : low - paid workers in small firms .
Only 50 % of small businesses now offer health insurance , down almost 10 percentage points since 2000 .
Several governors are trying to stem this decline by subsidising bare - bones health insurance for these people .
Arkansas , for instance , has launched a scheme in which the state subsidises the premiums of poor workers in small firms provided every worker is enrolled .
To control costs , the coverage is limited to six doctor visits and seven days in hospital a year , and two prescriptions a month .
New Mexico has a similar subsidised deal for small employers with a $ 100,000 annual limit on coverage .
Tennessee has set the premium rather than the coverage , creating an insurance plan that costs $ 150 a month , of which it will pay $ 50 , though just what the plan will cover is not yet clear .
The hope is that people will prefer cheap , if limited , health care to none at all .
It is tempting to pour cold water on all this state activity .
The most radical innovation — forcing people to buy health insurance — may prove unenforceable .
Will Massachusetts 's new Democratic governor , Deval Patrick , really risk levying heavy fines on low - paid workers without health insurance ?
And even if the idea works at first , the model will surely collapse unless the ever - growing cost of treatment can be brought under control .
As the plan 's architects admit , that was not the main priority .
For now , however , such cynicism is misplaced .
America 's governors are focusing on an important issue that Washington has ducked for too long , and , in several cases , are tackling it with bold new ideas .
Now it is up to President Bush and the new Democratic Congress to respond .
Artist 's impression of how Type Ia supernovae may look like as revealed by the spectr - polarimetry observations .
The outer regions of the blast cloud is asymmetric , with different materials found in ' clumps ' , while the inner regions are smooth .
Credit : ESO
Astronomers are reporting remarkable new findings that shed light on a decade - long debate about one kind of supernovae , the explosions that mark a star 's final demise : does the star die in a slow burn or with a fast bang "
From their observations , the scientists find that the matter ejected by the explosion shows significant peripheral asymmetry but a nearly spherical interior , most likely implying that the explosion finally propagates at supersonic speed .
These results are reported today in Science Express , the online version of the research journal Science , by Lifan Wang , Texas A&M University ( USA ) , and colleagues Dietrich Baade and Ferdinando Patat from ESO .
" Our results strongly suggest a two - stage explosion process in this type of supernova , " comments Wang .
" This is an important finding with potential implications in cosmology . "
Using observations of 17 supernovae made over more than 10 years with ESO 's Very Large Telescope and the McDonald Observatory 's Otto Struve Telescope , astronomers inferred the shape and structure of the debris cloud thrown out from Type Ia supernovae .
Such supernovae are thought to be the result of the explosion of a small and dense star - a white dwarf - inside a binary system .
As its companion continuously spills matter onto the white dwarf , the white dwarf reaches a critical mass , leading to a fatal instability and the supernova .
But what sparks the initial explosion , and how the blast travels through the star have long been thorny issues .
The supernovae Wang and his colleagues observed occurred in distant galaxies , and because of the vast cosmic distances could not be studied in detail using conventional imaging techniques , including interferometry .
Instead , the team determined the shape of the exploding cocoons by recording the polarisation of the light from the dying stars .
Polarimetry relies on the fact that light is composed of electromagnetic waves that oscillate in certain directions .
Reflection or scattering of light favours certain orientations of the electric and magnetic fields over others .
This is why polarising sunglasses can filter out the glint of sunlight reflected off a pond .
When light scatters through the expanding debris of a supernova , it retains information about the orientation of the scattering layers .
If the supernova is spherically symmetric , all orientations will be present equally and will average out , so there will be no net polarisation .
If , however , the gas shell is not round , a slight net polarisation will be imprinted on the light .
" This study was possible because polarimetry could unfold its full strength thanks to the light - collecting power of the Very Large Telescope and the very precise calibration of the FORS instrument , " says Dietrich Baade .
" Our study reveals that explosions of Type Ia supernovae are really three - dimensional phenomena , " he adds .
" The outer regions of the blast cloud is asymmetric , with different materials found in ' clumps ' , while the inner regions are smooth . "
The research team first spotted this asymmetry in 2003 , as part of the same observational campaign .
The new , more extensive results show that the degree of polarisation and , hence , the asphericity , correlates with the intrinsic brightness of the explosion .
The brighter the supernova , the smoother , or less clumpy , it is .
" This has some impact on the use of Type Ia supernovae as standard candles , " says Ferdinando Patat .
" This kind of supernovae is used to measure the rate of acceleration of the expansion of the Universe , assuming these objects behave in a uniform way .
But asymmetries can introduce dispersions in the quantities observed . "
" Our discovery puts strong constraints on any successful models of thermonuclear supernova explosions , " adds Wang .
Models have suggested that the clumpiness is caused by a slow - burn process , called ' deflagration ' , and leaves an irregular trail of ashes .
The smoothness of the inner regions of the exploding star implies that at a given stage , the deflagration gives way to a more violent process , a ' detonation ' , which travels at supersonic speeds - so fast that it erases all the asymmetries in the ashes left behind by the slower burning of the first stage , resulting in a smoother , more homogeneous residue .
The results presented here are reported in " Spectropolarimetric diagnostics of thermonuclear explosions " , by Lifan Wang , Dietrich Baade and Ferdinando Patat , Science Express , 30 November 2006 .

It 's Undeniable Friday !
Every Friday , in addition to an odd little factoid , UndeniableFacts.com gives you a fun puzzle , illusion , or activity to enjoy and share .
Today : The Sands of ChimeThe effect : A sound is played below a drum with musician 's sand on it , and within 30 seconds , strange patterns and shapes appear on the surface of the sand .
The setup : This experiment requires musician 's sand , which is a carefully regulated mixture of consistently sized granules of quartz and graphite .
It is used primarily by soft - shoe dancers and for rain sticks .
It is also , to a scale factor , extremely similar in specific density to the outer crust of the earth .
Musician 's sand can be found at most music stores , and occasionally at nurseries .
You 'll also need a snare drum and a guitar or bass amplifier .
The set up for this experiment is fairly simple : place the snare drum on the amplifier , pour the sand evenly over the snare drum , and play different frequencies through the amplifier .
Make sure to disengage the snare .
Many different sound waves will work for this experiment , but here are a few ( the ones used in the video ) to get you started .
Keep in mind that sound volume is not the only important factor .
If the sound hurts your ears , it 's too loud .
Also realize that if the sand is uneven , there will be distortions in the patterns .
The explanation : Because of its specific density , musician 's sand carries sound adiabatically ; it rearranges itself to absorb the energy from a sound wave , rather than emitting the energy as heat .
The result of this is that specific frequencies of sound can be used to create patterns in the sand .

The viral message below , that is circulating online , purports to give practical tips on how to tell a two - way mirror from an ordinary one .
This viral message has been circulating since May 1999 and is considered partly true .
The following example of the forwarded email was contributed in the same year and follows cases of people who have installed these two - way mirrors in female changing rooms and more .
Read the message , " How to Detect a Two - way Mirror " below , consider Peter Kohler 's analysis that follows , and learn more about how two - way mirrors actually function in real life .
Example of the Forwarded Email
HOW TO DETECT A 2 - WAY MIRROR
When we visit bathrooms , hotel rooms , changing rooms , etc. , how many of you know for sure that the seemingly ordinary mirror hanging on the wall is a real mirror , or actually a 2 - way mirror ( i.e. they can see you , but you can't see them ) ?
There have been many cases of people installing 2 - way mirrors in female changing rooms .
It is very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it .
It 's time to get paranoid .
So , how do we determine with any amount of certainty ?
Just conduct this simple test :
Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail , then it is a GENUINE mirror .
However , if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail , then BEWARE , for it is a 2 - way mirror !
So if not at home and changing before a mirror , do the " fingernail test " .
It does n't cost you anything .
It is simple to do , and it might save you from getting " visually raped " !
Share this with your girlfriends .
Analysis by Peter Kohler
Despite the overemphatic tone used in the above text , which is of course what keeps it in circulation , the fingernail test does work as described in most situations .
Below , a few fuzzy points involved will be cleared , as well as a suggestion of several other possible ways to identify a two - way mirror .
For the Sticklers Among Us
Some companies in the window glass and mirror trade call them " two - way mirrors " and some call them " one - way mirrors " though there seems to be no distinction between the two names .
Both names refer to a product known as Mirropane .
Promotional literature from the LOF Architectural Specialty Glass company states that the product registered under the name " Mirropane E.P. Transparent Mirror " is " formed using LOF 's patented chemical vapor deposition process on 1 / 4 Grey tint glass . "
As to exactly how that works or what reflective metal is involved , it seems to be a trade secret , although the good folks at Morehouse Glass in Portland , Oregon suggest that tin or nickel are the likeliest choices .
It 's probably not silver , as suggested in the missive under scrutiny .
The product can be heat - treated for maximum strength and can also be laminated to make it scratch resistant .
For example , if someone decided to use the product for a mirror in a changing room , it would not be easily scratched by a belt buckle or other light brushings - up - against .
The product can also be made considerably bullet - proof .
More Information About How Two - way Mirrors Work
Mirropane is treated on the subject or first surface of the glass , and the recommended lighting ratio for surveillance purposes is 10:1 , with the subject side being ten times brighter than the observer side .
The fingernail test described above works for the very reason stated , namely that there is no glass between an object and the reflective surface if the mirror is touched .
There are other first - surface mirrors as well that are not two - way , but these are used primarily in precision optical instruments or in scientific experiments using lasers , where the refraction from the glass would be an interference .
Mirropane is commonly used in prisons and police stations , in psychological observation rooms , and in security situations which can include many types of businesses where viewing customers or employees is deemed necessary or desirable .
Additional Ways to Identify Mirropane
Below are some other ways to identify Mirropane from an ordinary , second - surface mirror .
William Beaty , an electrical engineer in Seattle , says to
" Simply turn the lights off in [ the ] room , then place a bright flashlight against the mirror surface .
If there is a hidden chamber behind the mirror , the flashlight will illuminate it , and since you 're in a darkened room , you 'll see the hidden chamber . "
A deputy from the Washington County Police Department in Oregon concurs and suggests that even a penlight will work for this test , though not nearly as well .
He further suggests that , if you are in a room , such as a changing room , where you cannot turn off the lights on your side , hold your eyes near to the glass surface and cup your hands around them on either side to eliminate most of the light from your visual field .
Then , you ought to be able to see through the treated glass , as Mirropane will permit about a 12 percent passage of light from the lit side to the hidden chamber , if there is one .
Douglas Brown , a part - time field researcher , and writer who works for Powell 's Books , Inc. in Portland , Oregon , has some clever advice to share .
He makes the point that there is a clear auditory difference between Mirropane and regular mirrors , because of how they are installed .
Scratch on the surface with your knuckle or fingernail , he says .
In most situations , you 'll be able to hear the difference in the sound produced .
Ordinary mirrors have backing material which will dull the sound , while windows have open air behind them and will reverberate more .
Employees of Morehouse Glass make the point that any mirror hung in front of a wall will be a mirror , plain and simple .
This is because Mirropane will be a pane of glass installed into the wall , like any other window , and will have window framing evident , not mirror glass molding around it .
Lately I ’ve heard a lot on technical podcasts about the public outrage over “ Microsoft Genuine Advantage ” and the fact that it “ phones home ” every day .
Apple released Mac OS X 10.4.7 last week , and ever since I installed it , I ’ve been noticing Apple ’s own modest home phoning behavior .
In this case it ’s ostensibly to provide users with the opportunity to check whether the Dashboard Widgets you download are identical to ones featured on Apple ’s site .
Sort of a security debriefing , I guess .
From the 10.4.7 release notes :
You can now verify whether or not a Dashboard widget you downloaded is the same version as a widget featured on ( www.apple.com) before installing it .
The problem is this feature popped up without my permission , and there ’s no obvious way for me to turn it off .
This is how companies , even fairly trustable ones ( IMHO ) like Apple , make users paranoid and suspicious of them .
This phoning home is done by a new process called “ dashboardadvisoryd . ”
I do n’t know the exact schedule , but it appears to be very frequent : twice today in a seven hour period .
If I did n’t run Little Snitch I would n’t have any idea this was going on , because Apple made no point of informing me of the new feature and what it would entail .
One of the nice things about Little Snitch is it gives you a chance to “ perk up your ears ” to what ’s being said between the client and server .
When I see an unusual connection being requested , I often allow it to take place , but not before switching to the Terminal and starting up tcpdump so I can scrutinize the traffic .
I figure if anybody is going to be chatting behind my back I at least want to know the gist of what they ’re saying .
So far as I can tell , the activity from Apple is in this case pretty tame .
At least so far .
Every time it phones home , it requests the following two URLs :
http://www.apple.com/widgets/widgetadvisory
http://www.apple.com/widgets/parser.info
The first appears to be a public key or something .
The second appears to be empty but its header values may convey something of interest to Apple ’s client .
I ca n’t see that anything at all is being sent back to Apple , but that ’s sort of not the point .
The mere act of “ checking in ” lets Apple know that I ’m here and I ’m running 10.4.7 .
They did n’t ask my permission to start making this regular checkin , and I ’m not even sure what benefit I ’m going to be getting out of allowing it .
In an era when consumers are being encouraged to take responsibility for their own safety in the interconnected world , Apple and others should respect the boundaries of our “ digital house ” by at least keeping us in the loop about what is being done on our behalf .
I can find no documentation about what Apple is choosing to send and receive on a regular basis from my Mac .
Keep me in the loop , Apple .
And if I ’m not comfortable with it , give me an option ( short of Little Snitch ) for turning it off .
It ’s my computer , after all .
The rather inflammatory title of this post is in response to a question I have been asked many times over the years and , indeed , I have asked it myself on many occasions .
Why is it so often the case that companies that are either all about IT or heavily dependent on IT are not run by IT people ?
Folk in the IT trenches see IT decisions being made or directed by suits who clearly have a limited understanding of IT issues .
By many , many measures the suits are less intelligent that the IT workers .
In many cases the suits have less industry experience than the IT workers .
So what logical reason could there be for the business not being run by IT ?
First , it ’s worthwhile to note that not all IT workers have the same view of this question .
There are some who do in fact want to run the company .
I think the sensible majority have no significant interest in management roles .
They did n’t start working in IT to become managers , they ’d much prefer to stay in the area of work that interests them .
But even this group tends to ask the question , “ Why do n’t I get to make all the decisions about my work ? ”
Why do all these damn business analysts , designers , project managers and goddam USERS get in the way ?
Let ’s get one unpleasant fact out of the way : most IT people simply are n’t suited to make strategic decisions about the development of IT projects or applications .
Good IT people are very good at executing IT applications or developing innovative and useful programs but these are very different skills to the strategic aspects of making a business work as a profitable venture .
The fact that many IT people ca n’t see this is the central problem .
How do you solve a problem if you ca n’t clearly see or articulate what the problem is ?
I have lost count of the times that a programmer has coded something that executed perfectly but did not come close to serving the needs of the business .
The programmer ca n’t see the problem because the application “ works ” and the business has yet another ( unfair and inaccurate ) story to tell about how useless the IT department is .
A couple of anecdotes from my past to illustrate this concept :
One day , someone decided to organise an office pool for a high - value Lotto draw .
A conversation developed around whether it was better value to get a lot of standard tickets or one expensive “ systems ” ticket .
I analysed the problem with a typical business analyst approach : what is the problem and how do we measure success ?
It proved fairly easy to do a cost / benefit analysis – work out the relative probability of winning with each ticket type and compare that to the relative costs .
To win this particular Lotto variant you had to pick all 6 numbers that would be drawn out of 40 numbers in total .
A standard ticket let you pick 6 numbers so you had to get all 6 right .
The probability of this is 6/40 x 5/39 x 4/38 x 3/37 x 2/36 x 1/35 ( if you ’re not a maths nerd , this translates as close enough to no fucking chance at all . )
The Systems 9 ticket lets you pick 9 numbers which gives a winning probability of 9/40 x 8/39 x 7/38 x 6/37 x 5/36 x 4/35 .
This is a much higher probability than a standard ticket but it still aint gonna happen .
But on strict cost / benefit analysis the System 9 gave you more chances for your money .
This should have ended the discussions but one of the programmers who was a hardcore maths nerd and not very good with people skills got involved .
He went into some really complex mathematics that was meant to prove I do n’t know what .
It was something along the lines of calculating the number of variations in numbers possible .
His conclusion was that the standard tickets were better because you could select a wider variation of numbers .
The thing is , I ’m pretty certain his equation was absolutely right – it simply was n’t answering the question being asked .
And he really did n’t cope well with having this pointed out .
Me :
That is n’t relevant to what we are talking about Kim .
Kim : But I just proved … ( long technical explanation I did n’t understand at the time and do n’t remember now . )
Me :
That may well be true but it was n’t what we were asking .
Kim :
But I just proved … ( same theorem but stated in a louder voice . )
Me : Kim , saying the exact same thing in a louder voice does n’t make it suddenly right .
To which Kim responded by repeating the same points over again except this time ( you guessed it ) louder still .
Kim had maths skills at the post - graduate level and interpersonal skills at the kindergarten level .
Another , shorter anecdote :
On my first day in a new role I was sitting down with a project manager to discuss the project I would be working on .
This was a pure IT company , it even had bona fide Internet millionaires ( a rarity in Australia ) .
This particular PM was a programmer in the early days of the company and a friend of the founder .
He had been promoted to management because he had been there longer than most , not because he had any management skills .
His first line to me was :
“ No offence , but I ’ve never seen the point of Business Analysts . ”
Why is it that when someone starts a sentence with “ no offence , but … ” the sentence is always going to end with something really offensive ?
You may not be surprised to learn that this company burned through many millions of dollars over the next year before being acquired by a service company that replaced the entire management team .
For my part , I worked with the development team over a period of 3 months to take an eCommerce application that had been lingering in limbo for 2 years to a working beta release including all system and user documentation .
That , my friend , is the point of Business Analysts .
So at the end of the day , companies are rarely run by IT people because very few IT people are suited to the job .
Most simply do n’t want to do it and most of those who want to are n’t very good at it .
Fortunately , there are signs this is getting better .
The trend towards keeping IT companies small ( known as Micro Independent Software Vendors – Micros ISVs ) is keeping the development of both the company and the products in the hands of people with a real passion to get quality results .
This would be my ultimate advice to IT people who think they are the grown - ups and are the best ones to run the company .
Do n’t waste your time trying to climb to the top of Megacorp .
Get out there and do it yourself – start your own company .
Prove the bastards wrong .

Cuptertino , CA - Apple has released a new version of the iPod nano , which addresses the growing problem of people being mugged for their digital music player .
" It seems like every time we release a new version of iPod , these stories about people being mugged for them come out of the woodwork , " Apple CEO Steve Jobs said onstage at a special event Tuesday .
" We 're out to change that . "
Jobs then held up an iPod nano with brass knuckles attached .
" We noticed the iPod nano was big enough to lay across the hand .
So the iPod 's legendary durability combined with some knuckle rings and a new brass finish was just the perfect combination for personal defense , " said Jobs .
Like the iTunes Phone introduced by Motorola last week , the iSmack nano will temporarily pause the playing song when it senses an impact .
Jobs demonstrated this feature on Apple Vice President Phil Schiller .
" Now Phil here is going to pretend he 's mugging me for my iPod because he sees the trademark white headphones , " Jobs said .
" But I 've got my new iSmack nano with me . "
Jobs then threw a right hook , slamming his iSmack - laden fist into Mr. Schiller 's face .
" The attacker is down , and best of all , iSmack nano is totally unharmed , " Jobs said , holding the small device up to the camera to reveal an untarnished finish .
" And it 's back to playing Coldplay . "
A host of celebrity spokespeople attended the event , mostly musicians from the " gangsta rap " genre , including 50 - cent and Ice - T . " Yo Steve , this [ product ] is [ of high quality ] .
Ain't no [ fellow African - Americans ] gonna want no [ comparably inferior ]
Dell DJ with ' dis [ product ] tearin ' up da streets ! " 50 - cent commented from an iChat AV videoconference .
" Our product literally beats the crap out of the competition , " says Jobs .

The 14 Defining Characteristics of Fascism ~ Excellent Video from Eric Blumrich
Fascism Anyone ? ~ by Lawrence W. Britt as published in Free Inquiry magazine .
Interview with Mr. Britt
More of Mr. Britt ’s Commentaries
Mr. Britt ’s Novel : “ June , 2004 ” as sold on Amazon .
Lawrence Britt , Author and former corporate executive with Allied Chemical , Mobil and Xerox Corp , has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler ( Germany ) , Mussolini ( Italy ) , Franco ( Spain ) , Suharto ( Indonesia ) and several Latin American regimes .
Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each .
The following appears to be a paraphrase of Mr. Britt ’s treatise that has been circulating the net , drawing much controversy and attention ( pictures and links added ) :
1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism – Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos , slogans , symbols , songs , and other paraphernalia .
Flags are seen everywhere , as are flag symbols on clothing …
… and in public displays .
2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights – Because of fear of enemies and the need for security , the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of “ need . ”
The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture , summary executions , assassinations , long incarcerations of prisoners , etc .
3. Identification of Enemies / Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause –
The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe : racial , ethnic or religious minorities ;
liberals ;
communists ; socialists ,
terrorists , etc .
4. Supremacy of the Military – Even when there are widespread domestic problems , the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding ,
and the domestic agenda is neglected .
Soldiers and military service are glamorized .
5. Rampant Sexism –
The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male - dominated .
Under fascist regimes , traditional gender roles are made more rigid .
Divorce , abortion and homosexuality are suppressed …
… and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution .
6. Controlled Mass Media – Sometimes the media is directly controlled by the government …
… but in other cases , the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation …
Gingrich Says Government May Have To Limit Free Speech In Terror War
… or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives .
Censorship , especially in war time , is very common .
7. Obsession with National Security – Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses .
8. Religion and Government are Intertwined – Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion .
Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders …
…even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government ’s policies or actions .
9. Corporate Power is Protected –
The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power , creating a mutually beneficial business / government relationship and power elite .
10 . Labor Power is Suppressed – Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government , labor unions are either eliminated entirely , or are severely suppressed .
Professor arrested , students continue protest
11 . Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts – Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education , and academia .
It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested .
UMass - Boston professor arrested supporting students anti-war actions
Free expression in the arts …
… and letters is openly attacked .
12 . Obsession with Crime and Punishment
Under fascist regimes , the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws .
The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism .
There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations .
13 . Rampant Cronyism and Corruption – Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates …
… who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability .
It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders .
14 . Fraudulent Elections – Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham .
Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against …
… or even assassination of opposition candidates …
… use of legislation to control voting numbers …
… or political district boundaries …
… and manipulation of the media .
Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate …
… or control elections .
The Number
When Johns Hopkins epidemiologists set out to study the war in Iraq , they did not anticipate that their findings would be so disturbing , or so controversial .
By Dale Keiger
I n April of last year , Gilbert H. Burnham and Leslie F. Roberts , A&S ' 92 ( PhD ) , began finalizing plans for some new epidemiology .
There was nothing notable in that ; Burnham and Roberts , at the time both researchers at Johns Hopkins ' Bloomberg School of Public Health , were epidemiologists .
What was notable was the subject .
They would not be studying the spread of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa , or incidence of cholera in Bangladeshi villages .
They meant to conduct epidemiological research on the war in Iraq .
They would treat the war as a public health catastrophe , and apply epidemiological methods to answer a question essential to an occupying power with the legal obligation to protect the occupied :
What had happened to the Iraqi people after the 2003 U.S. - led invasion ?
Their efforts produced a mortality study , their second in two years , published last October in The Lancet , Britain 's premier medical journal .
The study produced a number : 654,965 .
This was the researchers ' estimate of probable " excess mortality " since the 2003 invasion —
Iraqis now dead who would not be dead were it not for the war .
The number was a product of the study , not its central point .
But it commanded attention because it was appallingly , stupefyingly large .
It was beyond anyone 's previous worst imagining .
It was just plain hard to believe , and in the weeks following its publication , it became an oddity of science : a single number so loud , in effect , it overwhelmed the conclusions of the research that produced it .
Newspapers the world over put the number in their headlines .
Reporters tried to explain it , often bungling the job .
To dismiss the research , critics seized on its implausibility , in the process frequently distorting its meaning .
Political leaders dodged its implications by brushing it aside as the meaningless product of a discredited methodology .
In a leading scientific journal , other scientists challenged how the study had been done .
Burnham , who is professor of epidemiology and co-director of Johns Hopkins ' Center for Refugee and Disaster Response ( CRDR ) , tried to keep attention focused on what he thought the public needed to understand .
" I have one central message , " he says .
" That central message is that local populations , people caught up in conflict , do badly .
This is not a study that says , Ain't it awful .
This is a study that says , We need to do something about this . "
A message lost in a number .
P ublic health researchers frequently quote research , done by Christer Ahlström for the Department of Peace and Conflict Research at Uppsala University in Sweden , estimating that up to 90 percent of casualties in late - 20 - century wars were not fighters but civilians .
Until recently , estimating these losses has been far from scientific .
Conventional armies record the deaths of their own soldiers , but rarely count dead civilians .
A country ravaged by war faces huge difficulties compiling its own tally .
Research has demonstrated that what epidemiologists call " passive surveillance " — monitoring reports from hospitals , morgues , and government ministries — never produces an accurate , comprehensive summary of how violence affects a population .
Burnham reports that with the exception of Bosnia , he and his colleagues have found no recent wars in which passive surveillance recorded more than 20 percent of the deaths later revealed by population - based studies .
Roberts began active measurement of war - zone mortality in 1992 .
Now a lecturer at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University , he remains an adjunct faculty member at the Bloomberg School .
When he decided to work on Iraq in 2004 , he approached Burnham , who recalls , " He came looking for money and ideas .
I had both of them . "
The pair of scientists devised a study in collaboration with faculty members at Al Mustansiriya University 's College of Medicine in Baghdad , and Richard Garfield of the School of Nursing at Columbia University .
In September 2004 , Roberts packed $ 20,000 in his shoes and a money belt and , lying on the floor of an SUV , slipped into Iraq from Jordan to coordinate the data gathering .
Over three weeks , six trained Iraqi volunteers surveyed 7,868 people in 33 locations throughout the country .
They asked each person several questions .
From January 1 , 2002 , up to the day of the interview , how many people in your household were born ?
How many died ?
What did they die from , and when ?
Based on the data , Burnham and Roberts estimated that prior to the invasion , the crude mortality rate in Iraq had been 5.0 per 1,000 persons .
After the war commenced , the rate jumped to 12.3 per 1,000 .
Counting the sample 's post - invasion deaths in excess of the deaths that would be expected given the pre-invasion mortality rate , then calculating figures for the whole population based on their statistical sample , they produced an estimate of how many Iraqis had died up to that point as a result of the war : 98,000 .
The Lancet released the study on October 29 , days before the 2004 U.S. presidential election .
American newspapers took note of the unexpectedly large estimated mortality , but devoted little space to any more discussion as the last days of the campaign consumed public attention .
There was some hostile press reaction .
For example , Fred Kaplan , writing for the online publication Slate , which is owned by The Washington Post , called it " a useless study . "
There was some sniping at the authors and The Lancet for publishing it so close to the election , especially after the Associated Press quoted Roberts : " I e-mailed it on September 30 under the condition that it came out [ in the journal ] before the election .
My motive was that if this came out during the campaign , both candidates would be forced to pledge to protect civilian lives in Iraq .
I was opposed to the war and I still think that the war was a bad idea , but I think that our science has transcended our perspectives . "
Burnham says that when he and his co-authors completed that first study , its estimate of post - invasion deaths startled them by its magnitude .
He had no idea what was coming two years later .
B urnham and Roberts began pondering a second survey as soon as they had published the first .
Roberts hoped someone else would do it and , as an independent source , verify their results .
But in late 2005 , a group from the Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology approached them .
They had $ 90,000 for research in conflict areas of the Middle East and sought advice on how to apply it .
Burnham says , " We started discussing with them what you had to do .
Within five minutes of starting that conversation , the MIT people said , ' Would you guys like to do it ? ' "
The CRDR contributed additional funds , and Burnham , Roberts , and other Bloomberg School faculty set to work on a new mortality survey .
All statistical surveys attempt the same thing : to gather data from a representative subset of a population , then interpret that data to produce meaningful information about the population as a whole .
The larger and more random the sample , the more confident the researchers can be that what they find in the subset holds true for the entire population .
In an ideal situation , surveyors would assemble a random sample of sufficient size from a list of everyone in the country , then interview each person in the sample .
Such a survey was impossible in Iraq .
Burnham and Roberts did not have enough money ; there was no adequate census from which to randomly draw the sample ; and travel anywhere but relatively peaceful Kurdistan , in the north of the country , had become extraordinarily dangerous .
The researchers needed a less costly methodology that would produce a sufficiently large and random sample but minimize travel by the Iraqi surveyors .
In a typical cluster survey , researchers randomly assign clusters to populated areas and randomly select a start house .
They then go door to door surveying a predetermined number of homes .
That dictated the same method used in the first study , a cluster survey .
Designed to estimate vaccination coverage in undeveloped countries , a cluster survey is cheaper , faster , and more flexible , and does not require a detailed local population list .
Researchers first randomly assign clusters to populated areas .
Interviewers then randomly select a start house in each assigned area and survey a cluster of surrounding households .
For the Iraq study , interviewers could slip into a village or neighborhood , go door to door efficiently gathering data from houses that were all near each other , then leave before they attracted too much attention .
There are problems inherent in this methodology , what epidemiologists speak of as " design effects . "
For example , the experiences of people within a cluster — say , incidence of contagion , or of violence in a violent neighborhood — may have been similar to an unrepresentative degree because the people in the cluster all live near each other .
One way to compensate for these problems is to increase the number of clusters .
But more clusters means more interviews , more time in the field , more risk of getting killed .
How much could Burnham and Roberts ask of the volunteers ?
They decided they could ask them to cover 50 clusters this time , up from the first study 's 33 .
Each cluster would be 40 households instead of 30 , making the sample upward of 12,000 Iraqis versus the 7,868 of the first survey .
The Hopkins scientists again would have assistance from Al Mustansiriya University in Iraq , plus three Bloomberg School researchers who had helped with the first study : Scott Zeger , Shannon Doocy , and Elizabeth Johnson .
Zeger , a professor of biostatistics , worried about " recall bias . "
The interviewers would be asking people to remember when a member of their household had died , and people tend to recall events as more recent than they actually were .
Zeger made sure that the second survey would cover not just the months elapsed since the conclusion of the first one , but go back over the period of the first study as well .
If a new sample of people produced results closely corresponding to the earlier findings , that would go a long way toward validating both studies .
He also advised taking a subset of 10 clusters from the first survey and sampling them again ; not the same households , but the same neighborhoods .
Again , if the new survey produced similar results for those clusters , that would strengthen confidence in the data .
Burnham and Roberts planned more detailed interviews and requested an additional corroborating element :
This time , interviewers would ask every household reporting a death to produce a death certificate .
( In the first survey , interviewers asked that of only a subset of households . )
Concern for the safety of interviewers and respondents alike produced two more decisions .
First , they would not record identifiers like the names and addresses of people interviewed .
Burnham feared retribution if a hostile militia at a checkpoint found a record of households visited by the Iraqi survey teams .
The second decision was how to choose each cluster 's starting point .
In the first survey , the researchers had used randomly selected GPS coordinates .
Burnham and Roberts wanted to use GPS again , but interviewers from the first survey who had volunteered for the second one said no .
Iraqis believe that GPS is used to direct U.S. precision bombing : Simply being caught at a checkpoint with a GPS unit in one 's possession could be fatal .
So the Hopkins team devised a different sampling methodology — one that would be at the center of a scientific debate once the study was published .
F rom May 20 to July 10 , 2006 , eight Iraqi physicians — four men , four women , all trained in health surveys and community medicine , all fluent in English and Arabic — braved dangerous conditions throughout Iraq to gather the data .
" During the survey , we were all holding our breath and crossing our fingers hoping that something bad would n't happen to the survey teams , " Burnham says .
" It was a great relief to hear they were all back safely . "
He and Roberts stayed out of Iraq , judging the risks to be too great for them and anyone working with them .
In 2004 , Roberts had learned the futility of trying to disguise himself .
He had dyed his hair black , donned Iraqi clothing , and avoided speaking to anyone in public .
Then one day during the survey , police detained a team of interviewers .
They did n't know Roberts was waiting in the car , pretending to sleep so no one would notice his blue eyes .
As he waited , hoping the interviewers would be released ( they were ) , two young boys approached the car , took one look at Roberts , and said , in good English , " Hello , mister ! "
So much for disguise .
Burnham and Doocy , a research associate from the Bloomberg School , flew to Jordan last August to analyze the results .
They pored over every interview and double - checked every report of a death , to be sure the report had been properly translated and the data correctly entered into the database .
Says Doocy , " We made a very conscious effort to take the most conservative approach .
We made as few assumptions as possible , and if we made an assumption , it was an assumption that was going to lower the overall violent - death rate .
So for example , if there was a death that had no cause reported , we categorized it as a non-violent death because that was the most conservative thing to do . "
On detailed examination , three clusters had to be dropped because their locations had been misattributed .
The data from the remaining 47 clusters looked solid .
The new estimate of pre-invasion mortality , 5.5 per 1,000 , corresponded to the estimate from the first survey ( 5.0 per 1,000 ) .
Furthermore , it was consistent with the same statistic for Syria and Jordan , nearby countries with similar demographics , and with the rate for Iraq listed by the CIA 's World Factbook .
Clusters sampled by both studies yielded corresponding data .
The researchers analyzed the survey with a variety of statistical tools , obtaining close to the same results each time , another indication that the methodology had been sound and the data were good .
But the findings were stunning .
If the estimates were correct , throughout the Allied occupation Iraqis had been dying at an appalling rate , upward of 1,000 per day during the last year of the survey period .
The crude mortality rate had progressed year by year , rising from the pre-invasion 5.5 per 1,000 to 7.5 , then to 10.9 , and finally to 19.8 between June 2005 and June 2006 .
Of the post - invasion deaths , 92 percent were by violence .
The data indicated that gunshots had killed more people than air strikes , car bombs , and improvised explosive devices combined .
Only 31 percent of violent deaths were attributed to coalition armed forces , which revealed the level of sectarian violence and lawlessness .
Interviewers had remembered to ask for death certificates in 87 percent of all cases of reported mortality , and respondents had produced them for 92 percent of those deaths , a good check against recall bias .
On October 11 , 2006 , The Lancet released " Mortality After the 2003 Invasion of Iraq : A Survey . "
The authors noted in the article the potential for bias inherent in the sampling methodology , in the conduct of the interviews , from migrations of population within and out of Iraq , and from the possibility that entire families had been wiped out , leaving no one to report their deaths .
But they believed the study had documented what they had feared they would find — that the civilian population of Iraq was suffering a public health disaster .
There were eight pages in the Lancet article , with maps , charts , tables , and many numbers .
But one number stopped every reader : 654,965 Iraqi dead .
P olitical reaction to the study was swift and negative .
U.S. President George W. Bush told reporters at a news conference , " I do n't consider it a credible report , " and described the research methodology as " pretty well discredited . "
In Britain , a spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said , " The problem is they 're using an extrapolation technique from a relatively small sample from an area of Iraq which is n't representative of the country as a whole .
We have questioned that technique right from the beginning and we continue to do so . "
Journalists around the world reported the study , and the focus was all on the number , which many could not get right .
For example , the first story to appear in The New York Times bore the misleading headline , " Iraqi Dead May Total 600,000 , Study Says . "
That number was , of course , 54,965 too low and in the study approximated only violent deaths .
Nowhere in that first Times story does the total number of excess deaths appear .
Misleading headlines appeared in The Wall Street Journal , The Los Angeles Times , and The Times of London .
The latter also reported that the deaths were civilian , though the Lancet article makes clear the surveyors did not attempt to ascertain if the dead had been civilians or combatants .
Robert Lichter and Rebecca Goldin , faculty members at George Mason University , are president and director of research , respectively , of the nonprofit Statistical Assessment Service ( STATS ) , which studies the use of statistics in news media .
Lichter was surprised by the sort of errors he found : " The study was complicated , and you would expect journalists to have problems with it .
But the coverage got the simple things wrong .
You do n't need to be a statistician to read plain English . "
" We were all holding our breath and crossing our fingers hoping something bad would n't happen to the survey teams , " says Gil Burnham .
Commentators struggled with , or perhaps in some cases preferred to ignore , an important aspect of the data : what statisticians refer to as the " confidence interval . "
Sampling a population is inherently inexact .
Statistical analysis recognizes this by producing not a single number , like the attendance figure recorded by a stadium 's turnstile , but a range of figures , the confidence interval .
Thus the study in The Lancet stated that the authors were 95 percent sure that the true figure was within a range of estimated mortality : 392,979 to 942,636 above what would have been expected had the war not occurred .
Many people mistakenly assumed that any number within that range was equally likely to be the actual count .
Not true .
The range was a bell - curve distribution , with the now - famous figure of 654,965 at the top of the curve , statistically the most likely accurate count .
Every other number in the range was less and less likely as one approached the extremes .
So 400,000 or 900,000 deaths were possible but highly improbable .
The reporting on the first Iraq survey had generally failed to grasp this , too .
Says Lichter , " I have found that ' second time around ' coverage rarely improves on the first time .
That 's because so many reporters treat the LexisNexis [ journalism database ] files on the previous story as a template for the next one .
In journalism , practice does n't make perfect , practice makes permanent . "
In The Wall Street Journal , Steven E. Moore wrote an op - ed column titled , " 655,000 War Dead ?
A Bogus Study on Iraq Casualties . "
Moore , a political consultant who had worked in Iraq for Paul Bremer and the Coalition Provisional Authority , was derisive about the survey 's methodology .
Of the survey 's 47 clusters , he wrote , " This is astonishing : I would n't survey a junior high school , no less an entire country , using only 47 cluster points . "
With so few clusters , he added , " it is highly unlikely the Johns Hopkins survey is representative of the population . "
Moore was wrong about methodology .
As Goldin of STATS points out , the number of clusters has nothing to do with whether a sample is representative ; it affects only the size of the confidence interval .
And the Bloomberg School 's Doocy notes that given the total population of Iraq , the study 's sample size was significantly larger than is customary for public health surveys .
Burnham and Roberts defended their study as they were asked the same questions in one interview after another .
The Iraqi government , and President Bush , had been citing 30,000 Iraqi deaths .
The volunteer organization Iraq Body Count , which from Britain had been monitoring media reports of casualties , had tallied fewer than 50,000 .
An Iraqi non-governmental organization Iraqiyun , which had not relied on passive reporting but done some field surveys of its own , had estimated 128,000 deaths from the start of the war through July 2005 .
How could all these numbers be so far off ?
Where were all the bodies ?
The Hopkins researchers reminded everyone that data produced by the same methodology for the Darfur region of Sudan and for Congo had never been discredited , and was routinely quoted by both the United Nations and the U.S. government .
They pointed out the historical inadequacies of passive surveillance and official statistics .
They reminded people that even without the war , Iraqis should have been dying at the rate of at least 120,000 per year from natural causes , yet in 2002 , before the invasion , the Iraqi government had reported only 40,000 .
They noted the extreme violence throughout Iraq , and the great difficulties journalists faced reporting anything outside Baghdad .
They stressed the scrutiny their paper had received from The Lancet 's peer reviewers and editors .
Burnham says he received 15 pages of comments , concerns about methodology , suggestions for better graphics and data tables , and questions the reviewers felt needed to be addressed before publication .
" This was one of the most reviewed and edited papers I 've ever done , " he says .
On the Internet , Iraqis debated the study 's merits .
Some thought it was ridiculous ; they were as incredulous at the figures as everyone else had been .
Others seized on the mortality estimate as one more example of the wrong inflicted on their country ; for them , the number was politically useful .
A dentist in Baghdad , writing under the name Zeyad A. , contributed a more reasoned perspective : " I have personally witnessed dozens of people killed in my neighborhood over the last few months ( 15 people in the nearby vicinity of our house alone , over four months ) , and virtually none of them were mentioned in any media report while I was there .
And that was in Baghdad , where there is the highest density of journalists and media agencies .
Do n't you think this is a common situation all over the country ? "
Raed Jarrar , a contributor to Foreign Policy and director of the Iraq Project at Global Exchange , an international human rights organization , grew up in Iraq .
He was country director of a 2003 door - to - door casualty survey , sponsored by the Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict ( CIVIC ) , that counted 2,000 civilian deaths in Baghdad in roughly the first 100 days of the war .
" I know how hard that [ sort of survey is ] , " he says , and notes that his limited study recorded twice as many casualties as that period 's official figure .
Now based in Washington , D.C. , Jarrar says , " I did n't think [ the mortality figure ] was exaggerated at all .
I do not know of any Iraqis who did not lose relatives .
I know so many people who died , and I do n't know hundreds of people in Iraq , you know ? "
Roberts and Burnham got some nasty mail , which they took in stride along with the political invective directed at them .
Some critics dismissed them as leftist academics disguising politics as science ; adding to their conviction was the fact that Roberts had made a brief , unsuccessful run at New York 's 24th Congressional District seat as a Democrat who favored withdrawal from Iraq and Congress rescinding the president 's authority to conduct the war .
Burnham praises press reports by reporters who made an effort to understand the epidemiology .
But he was annoyed by a story that appeared in Science , one of the world 's foremost research journals .
The Lancet had sent a press release announcing the study to John Bohannon .
Bohannon is a Vienna - based contributing correspondent for Science who happened to be writing about a pair of Oxford University physicists , Neil Johnson and Sean Gourley , who were studying statistical patterns in casualty figures from more than 10 wars .
Bohannon asked Gourley what he thought of the Lancet article .
Gourley , Johnson , and Michael Spagat , an economist at Royal Holloway , University of London , who is working on a book about conflict analysis , all read the article .
Says Johnson , " I got hold of the Lancet paper , and as I read it , I began to feel uneasy about the Hopkins group 's particular implementation of the methodology . "
According to the summary that appeared in The Lancet , the Hopkins researchers had randomly selected a section from each of the study 's 50 population areas .
Next they randomly picked a main commercial street , then randomly selected residential streets that crossed it .
In one more random process , they picked a single house from one of those cross streets as the starting point for the cluster .
Johnson and his colleagues believe that violence in Iraq is concentrated on just the sort of commercial streets that were near the start points of the survey 's clusters .
By having repeatedly sampled too near where the most violence occurred , they reasoned , the study might be fatally skewed .
Johnson labeled the sampling problem " main - street bias , " and the three Brits wrote an article about it .
( At press time , Johnson , Gourley , and Spagat 's paper , titled " Bias in Epidemiological Studies of Conflict Mortality , " had yet to be published , but Johnson made a draft copy available to Johns Hopkins Magazine . )
In the October 20 , 2006 , edition of Science , Bohannon published a story headlined " Iraqi Death Estimates Called Too High ; Methods Faulted , " in which he cited the main - street bias argument and quoted Johnson as saying , " It is almost a crime to let [ the survey 's procedures ] go unchallenged . "
Bohannon 's story said of Burnham : " He also told Science he does not know exactly how the Iraqi team conducted its survey ; the details about neighborhoods surveyed were destroyed ' in case they fell into the wrong hands and could increase the risks to residents . ' "
Burnham replies that in none of his e-mail exchanges with Bohannon did he say he did n't know how the Iraqi surveyors conducted their interviews .
Nor did he say details of each household 's location had been destroyed .
Burnham notes that as a security precaution those details were never recorded in the first place .
( In e-mail exchanges with Johns Hopkins Magazine , Bohannon responded that he was referring to addresses on scraps of paper that were used to randomly choose start - point households ; those were destroyed . )
He and Roberts also maintain that their British critics made false assumptions because , due to space limitations , the methodology section of the Lancet article was only a summary of the methods used .
Burnham says a fuller explanation would have made plain that the researchers did sample away from main streets and cross streets , and that since every household in Iraq had an equal chance of being selected , there was no bias .
" The basic problem is that we did not have the space [ in The Lancet ] to go into all the details on the sampling method , " Burnham says .
" In retrospect , since it raised questions , we probably should have done that . "
Johnson does not buy that explanation .
In an e-mail to Johns Hopkins Magazine , he wrote , " I 'm sorry , but this is totally unconvincing . "
He also said , " It is crucial to understand that saying ' every household had an equal chance of being selected ' is a desired outcome , not a sampling methodology .
With this goal in mind , the JH team must state exactly what methods they employed to guarantee this desired outcome , and correct for any inherent bias if this desired outcome is not 100 percent achieved .
We object to the claim that we made false assumptions .
The only assumption we made is to assume that the authors were telling the truth about their methodology in the Lancet article .
We believe the correct thing for them to do is to publish an erratum in The Lancet ASAP since scientists obviously should not leave misleading methodology lying around in published papers . "
House Republicans yesterday declared “ something fishy ” about the major tuna company in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s San Francisco district being exempted from the minimum - wage increase that Democrats approved this week .
“ I am shocked , ” said Rep. Eric Cantor , Virginia Republican and his party ’s chief deputy whip , noting that Mrs. Pelosi campaigned heavily on promises of honest government .
“ Now we find out that she is exempting hometown companies from minimum wage .
This is exactly the hypocrisy and double talk that we have come to expect from the Democrats . ”
On Wednesday , the House voted to raise the minimum wage from $ 5.15 to $ 7.25 per hour .
The bill also extends for the first time the federal minimum wage to the U.S. territory of the Northern Mariana Islands .
However , it exempts American Samoa , another Pacific island territory that would become the only U.S. territory not subject to federal minimum - wage laws .
One of the biggest opponents of the federal minimum wage in Samoa is StarKist Tuna , which owns one of the two packing plants that together employ more than 5,000 Samoans , or nearly 75 percent of the island ’s work force .
StarKist ’s parent company , Del Monte Corp. , has headquarters in San Francisco , which is represented by Mrs. Pelosi .
The other plant belongs to California - based Chicken of the Sea .
“ There ’s something fishy going on here , ” said Rep. Patrick T. McHenry , North Carolina Republican .
During the House debate yesterday on stem - cell research , Mr. McHenry raised a parliamentary inquiry as to whether an amendment could be offered that would exempt American Samoa from stem - cell research , “ just as it was for the minimum - wage bill . ”
A clearly perturbed Rep. Barney Frank , the Massachusetts Democrat who was presiding , cut off Mr. McHenry and shouted , “ No , it would not be . ”
“ So , the chair is saying I may not offer an amendment exempting American Samoa ? ” Mr. McHenry pressed .
“ The gentleman is making a speech and will sustain , ” Mr. Frank shouted as he slammed his large wooden gavel against the rostrum .
Some Republicans who voted in favor of the minimum - wage bill were particularly irritated to learn yesterday — after their vote — that the legislation did not include American Samoa .
“ I was troubled to learn of this exemption , ” said Rep. Mark Steven Kirk , Illinois Republican .
“ My intention was to raise the minimum wage for everyone .
We should n’t permit any special favors or exemptions that are not widely discussed in Congress .
This is the problem with rushing legislation through without full debate . ”
A spokeswoman for Mrs. Pelosi said Wednesday that the speaker has not been lobbied in any way by StarKist or Del Monte .

Köpeğinizin güvenliği açısından tasmalar oldukça önemlidir .
Köpeklerin beden yapıs ı ve eğitim düzeyine göre tasma seçimi de farklılık gösterecektir .
Her köpek cinsine göre farklı şekilde ve kalınlıkta tasmalar üretilmektedir .
Kısa boynu olan köpeklere takılan kalın tasmalar yanlış olacak ve köpeğinizin nefes almasını zorlaşt ıracaktır .
Bu sebeple kalın boyunlu ve kısa boyunlu bir köpek ırkından olan köpeğiniz var ise ince bir tasma tercih etmeniz gerekecektir .
İnce ve uzun boyunlu bir ırktan gelen köpeğiniz var ise tasma tercihinizi kalın olanlardan yapmanız gerekecektir .
Bu tipte bir köpeğiniz varsa köpek tasması alırken dikkat etmeniz gerekenler arasında gövde destekli bir tasma olması vardır .
Köpeğinize zarar verecek , tüylerini ve derisini tahriş edecek malzemelerden üretilen köpek tasmalarını tercih etmekten uzak durmalısınız .
Bazı köpeklerde gezme esnasında çekme huyu vardır .
Eğer sizin can dostunuzda da böyle bir huy var ise köpek tasmanızı seçerken boyun tasmalarından uzak durmak gerekir .
Göğüs tasmaları , her köpek cinsi için en sağlıklı olan seçim olacaktır .
Köpeğinizin boynundan geçirerek ön bacakların arkasından gövdeyi destekleyecek şekilde olan tasmalar , can dostunuzun fizyolojik açıdan zarar görmesini engelleyecektir .
Özellikle atlama huyu olan ince boyuna sahip bir köpeğiniz varsa , gez esnasından ani hareketler boynuna zarar verecektir .
Bu sebeple her boyut ve her ırk için çeşitli boyutlarda olan göğüs tasmalarını tercih etmek yerinde bir karar olacaktır .
Boyun tasmaları sadece evde ve bahçedeyken köpeğinizin ismini asacağınız türden tasmalardır .
Yürüyüş için uygun değildir .
Yeni doğan bir köpek sahiplendiyseniz veya köpeğiniz yeni doğum yapt ı ise yavru köpeğinizin boynunda devamlı olarak isminin yazılı olduğu bir tasma bulundurun .
Ev ortamında kullan ılan kayı şsız köpek tasmaları zamanla yavru köpeğinizin boynunu sıkmaya başlar .
Bu sebeple hemen her gün yavru köpeğinizin boynu ile tasma arasındaki mesafe ölçülmelidir .
Küçük geldiği anlaşılan tasma değiştirilmelidir .
Yavru veya yetişkin bütün köpeklerde isim etiketi bulunan köpek tasması kullanılması gerekir .
Özellikle yeni sahiplenilen yavru köpekler alı şana kadar sık sık ortadan kaybolur .
Büyük köpeklerde ise oyun oynamak sebebiyle ortadan kaybolma ihtimali bulunur .
Kaybolan veya gözden kaybolan köpeklerin kolaylıkla bulunması için çeşitli şekillerde üretilen köpek taşmalarına mutlaka isimlerinin yazılması gerekir .
Ev içerisinde kaybolan küçük dostunuzun kolay bulmak için de tasmasının ucuna küçük ziller takılabilir .
Böylece hareket ettiği taktirde köpeğinizi saklandığı yerden kolaylıkla çıkarabilirsiniz .
Tasmalar köpeğinizin kimliği anlamına gelir .
Köpeğiniz daha küçücük bir yavruyken tasma eğitimine başlamak gerekir .
Köpekler yavru iken tasma eğitimini almaları birkaç gün sürer .
Ancak yaşları büyüdükçe tasmayı kabul etmeleri daha uzun zaman almaktadır .
Tasma eğitimini erken başlatmanız , köpeğinizi eğittiğiniz diğer konularda da size yardımcı olacaktır .
Örneğin yürüyüş ve tuvalet eğitimi esnasında da tasma eğitimi kullanılabilir .
Tasmaya alıştırma aşamasında tasma kayışı kullanmak doğru olmaz .
Çünkü köpeğiniz hareket edip sağa sola atıldıkça kayışı fark eder ve onu tehdit olarak algılar .
Bu sebeple tasma eğitimine başlarken kayış kullanılmaz .
Köpeklerin eğitimi için kullanılan tasmalar , normal köpek tasmalarından farklıdır .
Dikenli veya çivili olan eğitim tasmaları köpeklerin eğitimi için kullan ılan bir çeşit tasmadır .
Bu özel tasmalar sadece özel köpekler için kullanılır .
Köpeğin canını yakmamak için dikenli veya çivili tasmaların dikenleri dış tarafa doğru olacak şekilde köpe ğin boynuna takılmalıdır .
Eğitim tasmaları kullan ılırken zincir kullanmak kaçınmalı , normal tasma kayışı tercih edilmelidir .
Köpeğiniz belirli bir yaşa geldiği zaman dışarıya çıkmak için uygun hale gelir .
Bu esnada dışarı için uygun tasma eğitimini köpeğinize vermeniz gerekir .
Bunun için öncelikle kayışsız boyun tasması kullanmak gerekir .
Gezinti süresince köpeğinizin yanınızdan ayrılmasını engellemek için köpeğinizin sevdiği mamaları ödül olarak kullanabilirsiniz .

Catfish show how the first tetrapods might have caught dinner .
Credit : Sam Van Wassenbergh
Click here to see a video .
Zoologists have found a remarkable fish that can wriggle from Africa 's tropical swamps to snaffle a snack on land .
The eel catfish , Channallabes apus , catches unsuspecting victims by arching upwards and descending upon prey , trapping an insect against the ground before sucking it up .
It performs this trick thanks to a bendy neck supported by specialized vertebrae , which allows it to hover over prey without needing fins or arms to hold up its head .
The same trick may have been used by the very first vertebrates to venture onto land , the researchers speculate .
Tropical snapper
“ It lives in a very inhospitable environment - where not many biologists pass by . ”
Sam Van Wassenbergh
University of Antwerp
Sam Van Wassenbergh of the University of Antwerp in Belgium and his team present the observation , complete with video evidence , in this week 's Nature1 .
The trick has never been recorded before , says Van Wassenbergh .
" This catfish lives in a very inhospitable environment in the tropical swamps of Africa , where not many biologists pass by . "
Most fish capture dinner by opening wide and expanding their mouth cavity : this pulls in extra water and sucks up prey .
But this only works below the surface ; animals cannot create the same amount of suction by opening their mouths in air , which is 800 times less dense than water .
Animals have evolved various strategies to capture insects on land , from sticky tongues to lightning - fast lunges and snapping jaws .
For C. apus , the solution consists of being able to loom over its target with its mouth in a position to engulf it from directly from above .
Skipping dinner

Other fish known to hunt on land , called mudskippers , also have extremely flexible necks , Van Wassenbergh points out .
He suspects that this trick might be the best way for a fish to catch a meal on dry land .
" I do n't think there are any other options , " he reflects .
And the eel catfish , although a modern species , may demonstrate just how the first vertebrates graduating to land caught their dinner .
Palaeontologists last week unveiled fossils of Tiktaalik roseae , a creature that had limb - like bones encased in fleshy fins ( see ' The fish that crawled out of the water ' ) .
Tiktaalik roseae certainly seems to have had a fairly versatile neck , notes Van Wassenbergh .

Writing in an accompanying commentary in the journal , Dr. Goebel said , “ Here is the first skull of an adult modern human from sub -Saharan Africa that dates to the critical period , and one that can speak to the relationship of early moderns from Africa and Europe . ”
The new findings pivoted on fixing the skull ’s age .
When it was uncovered in 1952 near the town of Hofmeyr , South Africa , the cranium was almost complete but the bone degraded .
Not enough carbon remained for scientists at the time to extract a radiocarbon date .
Using new technology , Richard Bailey and other researchers at the University of Oxford , England , measured the amount of radiation that had been absorbed by sand grains that filled the braincase since its burial .
They calculated the yearly rate at which radiation had collected in the sand and checked this with data from a CT scan of the bone .
In this way , they determined that the Hofmeyr skull belonged to a human who lived 36,000 years ago , plus or minus 3,000 years .
Another member of the team , Katerina Harvati of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , made a detailed examination of the shapes , sizes and contours of all parts of the skull .
She compared these three - dimensional measurements with those of early human skulls from Europe and with skulls of living humans in Eurasia and southern Africa , including the Khoe - San , commonly known as the Bushmen .
Because the Bushmen are well represented in the more recent archaeological record , Dr. Harvati said , they were expected to bear a close resemblance to the Hofmeyr skull .
Instead , the skull was found to be quite distinct from all recent Africans , including the Bushmen , she said , and it has “ a very close affinity ” with fossil specimens of Europeans living in the Upper Paleolithic , the period best known for advanced stone tools and cave art .
“ Much to my amazement , ” Dr. Grine said in an interview , “ the skull linked very closely with those from Europe at the time and not with South African remains 15,000 years on . ”
Dr. Grine said these modern humans probably originated in East Africa , which is rich in fossils of ancestors of the species , and had then moved into Eurasia and also south to the tip of Africa .
America ’s middle class families are caught in an unprecedented crunch , according to a recent report by the left - leaning Center for American Progress .
Despite a growing economy , their incomes have remained stagnant or flat .
And because prices for big ticket items such as housing and health care have gone through the roof , families are not able to put away a rainy day fund .
Instead , middle class families have had to take on more debt to maintain their basic needs and , as a consequence , have been unable to save .
Taken together , these trends have left families increasingly vulnerable to the impact of an economic emergency , such as unemployment or a medical emergency .
According to the report , more families are more vulnerable today to unexpected events such as a layoff or a medical emergency .
A few stark indicators of the precarious financial position of America ’s middle class provide a much - needed reality check , highlighting why so many families feel economically insecure today .
Over the past five years , the number of families with enough resources to weather a layoff or a medical emergency has declined dramatically , wiping out the gains in financial security that many families experienced in the 1990s .
The study found that five years into an economic recovery , average job growth is one - fifth that of previous business cycles and wages are flat when inflation is factored into the equation .
At the same time , the cost of families ’ top five expenditures — medical care , housing , food , household operations and cars — have risen more than twice as fast as the cost of the bottom five items .
To maintain their day - to - day consumption , families took on a record amount of debt equivalent to 126.4 percent of disposable income in the first quarter of 2006 .
• GM and Ford can't design vehicles that Americans want to pay " Toyota money " for .
And this is not a matter of bad bets on product concepts or dumb engineers .
It 's a matter of Toyota 's better engineering system , using simple concepts like chief engineers with real responsibility for products , concurrent and simultaneous engineering practices , and sophisticated knowledge capture methods .
The Prius is ... the likely result of a development system that tries out many approaches to every problem , then gets the winning concept to the customer very quickly with low engineering cost , low manufacturing cost , and near perfect quality .
( That 's not to say that Toyota can't produce a dud ... but the likelihood of producing winners is higher ... )
• GM and Ford are clueless as to how to work with their suppliers .
Sometimes they try to crush their bones -- which only works when the suppliers have any profits to squeeze , and few currently do .
Then they embrace contentless cooperation that ... fails to produce lower costs , higher quality , or new and better technology .
Toyota , by contrast , is getting brilliant results and lower prices from American suppliers like Delphi while also giving suppliers adequate profit margins .
How ?
By relentlessly analyzing every step in their shared design and production process to take out the waste and put in the quality .
• GM and Ford have miasmic management cultures .
These turn competent people into Dilberts .
By contrast , Toyota does a brilliant job of making one person responsible for every key business process ...
A Dilbert - free environment naturally emerges , but not because everyone has received cultural training to spur teamwork .
Rather , if ordinary people -- Dilberts even -- are put in a great business process they become great team players .
• GM and Ford cling to their wide range of brands : Chevy , Pontiac , Buick , Cadillac , Saab , GMC , and Hummer at GM ; Ford , Mercury , Lincoln , Mazda , Jaguar , Volvo , Aston Martin , and Range Rover at Ford .
And they still talk about brand revitalization as the way ahead .
Yet the most successful car companies in the world -- Toyota and BMW -- have only two or three brands .
And this is not an accident .
Indeed , it 's hard to see how any modern - day car maker can support more than three truly distinctive brands ...
A plethora of brands that can't pull their weight drains management energy and company coffers .
• GM and Ford still treat customers as strangers engaged in one - time transactions .
Toyota 's Lexus , by contrast , has created a new and better customer experience .
Customers cheerfully pay more for the car and the service and then come back for more cars because they love the treatment .
...
But note : I have n't mentioned the creaky factories , vast pension obligations , and cranky unions that commentators ... seem obsessed with .
In fact , Ford and GM 's factories are now good enough to compete in terms of labor productivity and quality .
They just can't support ... pension and healthcare benefits for retirees as the companies continue to shrink .
Union and management both know this , yet ... their conversation has broken down .
With zero confidence that management knows what it is doing , a union will try to get what it can now rather than look at the long term .
In consequence , unless GM and Ford soon present a plausible path to a brighter future ... there may be no long term .
There is no mystery about the lean business model .
All of the elements are operating in this country every day at Toyota and at many other American companies in a range of industries .
What is mysterious is why GM and Ford can't embrace it .
And what is dismaying is how many of their employees are likely to suffer if they do n't .
But finally , what is reassuring for the country is that if GM and Ford can't fix their problems , they will simply be replaced by new players in America , led by Toyota , who can .

L' intelligence économique - comme activité de collecte , de traitement et de diffusion de l'information - et le lobbying - comme pratique de l'influence auprès des décideurs publiques - sont deux activités qui se recoupent autour de la notion d' influence et de réseau .
Ce blog se veut donc le trait d'union entre ces deux disciplines .
I am perennially embarrassed to admit that I enjoy watching Fox TV's 24 .
It unintentionally reveals both subtle and overt problems for lovers of liberty .
Its major theme is an ongoing struggle between terrorists with evil machinations and federal agents ( also , presumably , with evil machinations ) .
Now , terrorists are apparently difficult to catch and government has little or no recourse in accomplishing this goal except through violating personal freedoms .
One of the major problems experienced by the show 's gaggle of bureaucrats is whether or not to ignore liberty in exchange for the capture of terrorists .
" The common good " is a phrase constantly invoked ( as it is in America today ) by these characters , whose violations of personal liberty include , but are certainly not limited to , illegal searches , theft , kidnapping , destruction of property , and torture .
Naturally , these actions are deemed justified because they tend to lead to the capture of terrorists .
However , even when the show makes it unambiguously clear that innocent people have been harassed and in some cases even tortured , due to the frenetic pace of the show , these atrocities are forgotten by both the characters and the viewing audience almost as soon as they are committed .
This is reminiscent of the torture scandals in Guantanamo and other US - run prisons , which were a major focus of the media for at least two or three days before being largely forgotten .
Indeed , it only drives home the prophetic nature of Orwell and his concept of the " memory hole " into which is thrown all information that contradicts the official line of the state .
24 also pushes the absurd dichotomy of " state vs. terrorist " — the " You are either with us or against us " mentality .
No room is left for anyone who genuinely cares about the preservation of personal liberty .
Indeed there is no room for " ordinary " people at all , only the superheroes of the state and their archrivals the terrorists .
Even when civilians do appear on the show , their actions are perceived and understood by the audience only vis á vis the struggle against terrorism , and never in light of other concerns .
Civilians also tend to die off rather quickly , and some innocents are actually tortured , but , as mentioned above , these atrocities are instantaneously forgotten in the wake of what is " really important , " i.e. , what the state 's agents are doing .
This is a critical , if unintentional , commentary on the American public : the means used to combat terrorism are speedily forgotten in the wake of the realization of the ends , but , as in 24 , the ends of the state are ( at best ) in constant flux between various vaguely defined objectives .
Again , one recollects how in 1984 the war enemy of the state is changed in mid-speech , similar to 24 , where friends become enemies and enemies become friends in the span of mere seconds .
Another principal problem of the program is that it of course glamorizes the illegal actions of the state and convinces the viewer first , that Americans are always at risk from all manner of terrorists , and second , that the only thing preventing these potential disasters are the adrenaline - fueled adventures of federal agents .
Both of these claims are of course patently false , but they are useful to the state when it attempts to subvert or reinforce public opinion .
The show calls to mind the brilliant propaganda films of Leni Riefenstahl , who managed to sway the opinions of many Germans prior to World War II , convincing them of the righteousness and glory of the Nazi Party ( although 24 does not even begin to approach the impact and genius of a film like The Triumph of the Will ) .
Another , more subtle ( and therefore dangerous ) , aspect of the program is that it does actually discuss the issues of liberty and security .
What makes this so potentially harmful is that the issues are presented in abstract or " macro " terms : there is talk of internment camps and conjecture on how great a price must be paid in order to ensure liberty , however the more " micro " aspects of the issue are ignored .
What I mean is that violations of liberty are expressed in exaggerated terms , and only then as sort of abstract concepts regarding a future that will ( implicitly ) never really come into existence .
In one memorable scene , bureaucrats debate the security issue while at the same time federal agents prepare to search property illegally , and FBI agents make illegal arrests .
So while lip service is paid to preserving liberty , " debate " is merely one of the state 's panoply of euphemisms that mean not " Should we eliminate personal liberties ? " but rather " When will we eliminate those liberties ? "
The show provides the veneer of discussion , while completely ignoring the fact that the argument is moot when the discussants themselves are already violating the rights in question .
Discussion occurs , but only whiles the systematic violation of property rights continues apace .
The show is probably trying to be topical here but it reveals , perhaps unintentionally , a major tendency of the state .
In short , the state publicly deplores extreme stages of totalitarianism , while quietly creeping towards those same stages , and at the same time redefining what those stages are , so that a policy that would have been deemed totalitarian only a decade or two ago is today almost demanded by an increasingly deluded ( and self - deluded ) public .
A final observation has to be made regarding the intended impact of 24 on its audience .
There is a new marketing tie - in for the current season : as the show cuts to commercial , a new cell phone ( one used by the characters in the show ) is displayed , and a rather cool and savvy voice asks , " Do you want to cruise the streets like a government agent ? "
Just think , if only we could all be as hip as people employed by the government !
This would be humorous if it were n't so pathetic , but there are surely those watching who are influenced by this nonsense .
As enjoyable as 24 is on the surface , a more than cursory glance makes it obvious that the show is attempting to justify and even celebrate an ever - expanding Orwellian state .
It almost makes me want to root for the bad guys .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Google Inc. and News Corp. could be heading for a legal showdown after News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox served Google 's YouTube online video site with a subpoena demanding the identity of a person who uploaded pirated episodes of the Fox televsion network shows " 24 " and " The Simpsons . "
A subpoena filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California demanded that YouTube give up the names of the person or persons who posted the season premiere of " 24 " online prior to its debut on Fox , as well as 12 episodes from " The Simpsons . "
The subpoena was filed by Jane Sunderland , vice president of content production for News Corp .'s NWS , - 3.57 % Twentieth Century Fox .
In a statement , YouTube said it was cooperating with Fox 's request .
" Fox alerted us to the videos and per our policies on copyrighted material , we removed them promptly , " said the YouTube statement .
" Subsequently , we received a subpoena and will comply with valid U.S. legal process .
As a matter of policy we do not publicly discuss legal matters . "
As the popularity of YouTube has grown , the site has come under growing scrutiny over the matter of pirated and copyrighted video posted online without proper permission from media companies .
YouTube has a history of cooperation with a similar request in the past .
Last year , YouTube turned over to Viacom Inc.'s VIA , - 9.09 % Paramount Pictures details of about a person who uploaded content from the studio's move " Twin Towers " to the YouTube site .
See full story .
YouTube has also made deals with companies such as CBS Corp. CBS , - 4.76 % and NBC Universal GE , - 1.21 % in order to avoid lawsuits over material posted to its site .
News Corp. spotted the episodes on Google 's YouTube Web site on Jan. 8 , more than a week before " 24 's " two - night , four - hour season opener was scheduled to air on Fox TV .
A YouTube spokeswoman said the videos were removed that day .
Ten days later , the situation escalated dramatically .
On Jan. 18 , News Corp. asked that a U.S. District Court judge command YouTube , which is owned by Google Inc. GOOG , +0.32 % to take down the videos , and turn over information to identify the YouTube subscriber .
News Corp. is seeking the YouTube subscriber 's name , home address , telephone number , email address and information about the Internet connection used to upload the videos , according to the filings .
The subscriber goes by the screen name ECOtotal , News Corp. alleges .
The company wants to " stop the infringing activity , " and the information " will only be used for the purpose of protecting ( our ) rights , " according to a letter sent to the court signed by Karen Thorland , of the law firm Loeb & Loeb LLP in Los Angeles .
Michael Graham , an intellectual property lawyer and partner with Chicago - based law firm Marshall Gerstein & Borun , said it should come as no surprise that Fox would use legal means to get the content removed from the YouTube site .
But , Graham said that taking down a video and giving up the identity of the person who posted that video represent entirely different legal issues .
Graham said that under the notice and takedown provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , YouTube needed to remove the videos in question as soon as it received a notice of infringement from Fox .
However , without a subpoena , YouTube was n't required to divulge the identities of the video posters .
And even with a subpoena , Graham said that finding out the name of the poster is n't that simple .
" Even with the information and server tracking which they can provide to Fox , it may be difficult or impossible to track down posters of illegal videos if those individuals use any of the various redirect or anonymizer programs which are available , " Graham said .
" In these cases , some solution needs to be arrived at which prevents users hiding behind such systems from repeat postings . "
Google has become an Opteron convert despite having Intel CEO Paul Otellini on its board , according to an analyst report .
Mark Edelstone at Morgan Stanley has Google shifting into Opteron or bust mode .
The server hungry ad broker , like many , has turned to AMD 's speedy 64 - bit chip for performance and power saving gains , he said in a research report .
If true , such a shift away from Intel 's Xeon would be a huge boost for AMD and the server vendor or vendors Google has picked .
" Based on our various research efforts , we believe that most of Google 's near - term server purchases will use AMD's Opteron for the first time , " the analyst wrote .
" We believe that Google currently has an installed base of more than 200,000 servers , and we believe that they will help AMD to enjoy a significant sequential increase in their server business in the first quarter . "
The analyst backs what AMD has long claimed and proven in various tests - that it has a serious performance per watt advantage over Intel .
Power savings have risen to priority number one at Google as energy costs and energy supply have become constraints .
A source also in the financial analyst community said , " I heard ( about the switch ) a long time ago .
Word is finally leaking out .
I heard that Google was in the process of switching to AMD , while Google was on stage at the last Intel Developer Forum . "
The analyst added that Sun was the likely supplier of the Opteron gear .
Sun might appear as Google 's most likely Opteron partner given the companies ' close ties .
Google CEO Eric Schmidt was once a top executive at Sun , and the two vendors announced a toolbar deal a few months back .
A vendor like Supermicro , however , would seem more in keeping with Google 's style of buying basic , no frills boxes and steering clear of the Tier I crowd .
A Google embrace of Opteron would have to send some interesting signals to Intel and Dell .
Intel 's Otellini , who sits on Google 's board , has presided over one of the worst runs in recent history for the chip giant .
Intel remains years away from matching AMD on basic server chip technology .
Intel - only shop Dell has watched its server revenue growth slow in the wake of the Opteron rush .
Prized high performance computing customers have looked at Opteron as their first choice for many months now , and - with Google - it seems a broader shift away from Xeon is happening .
We dare not even ask Google for comment on the story given the secretive nature of the beast .
The crazy kids at Google have refused repeated requests for us to come look at their colored balls in person . ®
The transcript of the conversation between two US pilots whose planes attacked a British convoy in southern Iraq in March 2003
' I 'm going to be sick '
According to The Sun , which printed the transcript from a cockpit video taken from one of the planes and obtained by the newspaper , this was the attack in which Lance Corporal Matty Hull was killed .
The transcript identifies the pilots of the A - 10 planes only as POPOV36 - who fired at the convoy , and who the Sun said was a lieutenant colonel -- and POPOV35 , a major .
Also speaking are Manila Hotel , Manila34 and Lightning34 , US Marine Corps forward air controllers on the ground and attached to British units .
Later , Sky Chief , a US AWAC jet controlling the air battle and COSTA58 , a British pilot nearby , also speak .
The times given , from the digital clock on the pilot 's display , are in GMT .

1336.30 MANILA HOTEL : POPOV from MANILA HOTEL .
Can you confirm you engaged that tube and those vehicles ?
1336.36 POPOV35 : Affirm Sir. Looks like I 've got multiple vehicles in reverts at about 800 metres to the north of your arty ( artillery ) rounds .
Can you switch fire , and shift fire , and get some arty rounds on those ?
1336.47 MANILA HOTEL : Roger , I understand that those are the impacts you observed earlier on my timing ?
1336.51 POPOV35 : Affirmative .
1336.52 MANILA HOTEL : Roger , standby .
Let me make sure they 're not on another mission .
1336.57 POPOV36 : Hey , I got a four ship .

Do we have any friendlies up in this area ?
1337.03 MANILA HOTEL : I understand that was north 800 metres .
1337.12 MANILA HOTEL : POPOV , understand that was north 800 metres ?
1337.16 POPOV35 : Confirm , north 800 metres .
Confirm there are no friendlies this far north on the ground .
1337.21 MANILA HOTEL :
That is an affirm .
You are well clear of friendlies .
1337.25 POPOV35 : Copy .
I see multiple riveted vehicles .
Some look like flatbed trucks and others are green vehicles .
Ca n't quite make out the type .
Look like may be ZIL157s [ Russian made trucks used by Iraqi army ] .
1337.36 MANILA HOTEL : Roger .
That matches our intel up there .
And understand you also have the other fixed wing up this push ?
For terminal control , if you can .
1337.44 POPOV35 : I 'd love to .
I did n't talk to him yet .
1337.46 MANILA HOTEL : Roger , I believe CASPER is up this push too .
Two Super Tomcats .
1337.54 POPOV35 : Hey dude .
1337.56 POPOV36 : I got a four ship of vehicles that are evenly spaced along a road going north .
1338.04 POPOV36 : Look down at your right , 2 o'clock , at 10 o'clock low , there is a , left 10 o'clock low , look down there north along that canal , right there .
Coming up just south of the village .
1338.21 POPOV35 : Evenly spaced ?
Where we strafed ?
1338.23 POPOV36 : No . No .
Further east , further west , right now .
And there 's four or five of them right now heading up there .
1338.29 POPOV35 : No , I do n't have you visual .
1338.30 POPOV36 : I 'm back at your 6 - no factor .
1338.31 POPOV35 : OK , now where 's this canal ?
1338.35 POPOV35 : Do n't hit those F18s that are out there .
1338.38 POPOV36 : OK .
Right underneath you .
Right now , there 's a canal that runs north / south .
There 's a small village , and there are vehicles that are spaced evenly there .
1338.49 POPOV36 : They look like they have orange panels on though .
1338.51 POPOV35 : He told me , he told me there 's nobody north of here .
1338.52 POPOV36 : I know .
There , right on the river .
1338.53 POPOV35 : I see vehicles though , might be our original dudes .
1339.09 POPOV36 : They 've got something orange on top of them .
1339.10 POPOV35 : POPOV for MANILA 3 , is MANILA 34 in this area ?
1339.14 MANILA HOTEL : Say again ?
1339.15 POPOV35 : MANILA HOTEL , is MANILA 34 in this area ?
1339.19 MANILA HOTEL : Negative .
Understand they are well clear of that now .
1339.23 POPOV35 : OK , copy .
Like I said , multiple riveted vehicles .
They look like flatbed trucks .
Are those your targets ?

1340.17 POPOV35 : Orange rockets ?
1340.17 POPOV36 : Yeah , I think so .
1340.18 POPOV35 : Let me look .
1340.26 POPOV35 : We need to think about getting home .
1340.29 POPOV36 : 3.6 is what it says ( a fuel measurement ) .
1340.31 POPOV35 : Yeah , I know .
I 'm talking time wise .
1340.35 POPOV36 : I think killing these damn rocket launchers , it would be great .
( The tape then becomes garbled )
1340.52 MANILA HOTEL : Yeah , POPOV36 , MANILA HOTEL .
I 've got other aircraft up this push .
Not sure they 're coming to me .
Someone else might be working this freak .
1341.00 POPOV35 : Yeah , MANILA34 is working them , break , break .
1340.12 POPOV36 : Yeah , I see that , you see I 'm going to roll down .

1341.24 POPOV36 : OK , do you see the orange things on top of them ?
1341.32 MANILA HOTEL : POPOV 36 from MANILA HOTEL .
Are you able to switch to Crimson ?
1341.37 POPOV36 : POPOV 36 is rolling in .
1341.40 MANILA HOTEL : Tell you what .
1341.41 POPOV35 : I 'm coming off west .
You roll in .
It looks like they are exactly what we 're talking about .
1341.49 POPOV36 : We got visual .
1341.50 POPOV36 : OK .
I want to get that first one before he gets into town then .
1341.53 POPOV35 : Get him - get him .
1341.55 POPOV36 : All right , we got rocket launchers , it looks like .
Number 2 is rolling in from the south to the north , and 2's in .
1342.04 POPOV35 : Get it .
According to The Sun , POPOV36 , then puts his A - 10 into a dive to strafe the British column , destroying two Scimitar armoured vehicles and killing L / Cpl Hull .
1342.09 - GUNFIRE -
1342.18 POPOV35 : I 'm off your west .

You 're at your high 10 .
1342.31 POPOV36 : Gotcha .
1342.30 POPOV36 : That 's what you think they are , right ?
1342.39 POPOV35 : It looks like it to me , and I got my goggles on them now .
1342.59 POPOV35 : OK , I 'm looking at getting down low at this .
1343.13 MANILA HOTEL : POPOV 36 from MANILA HOTEL , guns . . .
1343.17 MANILA HOTEL :
To engage those targets in the revetts [ slopes ] .
1343.24 POPOV36 : It looks like he is hauling ass .
Ha ha .
Is that what you think they are ?
1343.34 POPOV36 : 1 - 2
1343.35 POPOV35 : It does n't look friendly .
1343.38 POPOV36 : OK , I 'm in again from the south .

Lab experiments with primitive microbes taken from anAntarctic lake have shown that the hardy single - celled organisms can tolerateat least the warmest of the frigid temperatures found on Mars .
And they found that these species of microorganisms " huddled " together in colder temperatures to form a chemically linkedunit called a biofilm .
The finding marks the first time this phenomenon hasbeen detected in the Antarctic species of so - called extremophiles .
The findings provide more evidence for the ideas that liquidfound beneath Mars ' surface could harbor microbial life and that life could exist elsewhere in the solar system and galaxy , which is generally incrediblycold .
Hardy creatures
Scientists with the Maryland Astrobiology Consortium focusedon two species of cold - adapted microbes .
One , called Halorubrum lacusprofundi , is highly salt - tolerant .
The other , Methanococcoides burtonii , canlive without oxygen and thrives on methane .
( H. lacusprofundi is a typeof microbe that was discovered first in spoiled foods that had been salted forpreservation ) .
Both microbes are types of Archaea , one of the three major types of life along with Bacteria ( another class ofmicrobes ) and Eukaryotes ( a group that includes animals , plants , fungi and Protists , e.g. paramecium , algae , protozoa and slime molds ) .
Archaea might be able tosurvive in many places in the universe beyond Earth , including some of the morethan 180 extrasolarplanets detected in the past decade , or on their terrestrial moons .
The team , led by Shiladitya DasSarmaof the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute , part of the consortium , grew the microbes and found they survived and reproduced at 30 and 28 degrees Fahrenheit ( about - 1 and - 2 degrees Celsius ) , respectively , just below thefreezing point of water .
" We have extended the lowertemperature limits for these species by several degrees , " DasSarma said .
" We had a limited amount of time to grow the organisms in culture , on theorder of months .
If we could extend the growth time , I think we could lower thetemperatures at which they can survive even more . "
Slow it down
The cold temperatures of spacecould result in very slow growth , with generation times possibly longer thanthe average humanlifespan , DasSarma said , and this forces a reconsideration of the durationof astrobiology laboratory experiments .
" For example , is it living if onetakes a century to replicate or divide ? " he said .
H. lacusprofundi was chosenfor the experiments because they could possibly thrive in the salty waterthought to exist below Mars ' surface , which can remain liquid at temperatureswell below 32 degrees Fahrenheit .
M. burtonnii was chosen because itcould survive on a planet lacking oxygen , such as Mars .
The lab - grown archaea alsoadapted to the cold by aggregating to form biofilms or microbial mats , like theslimy plaque that accumulates on your teeth .
Aggregating to form a mat or biofilmallows microbes to share nutrients and genetic material .
" The cold - adaptedmicroorganisms studied in this investigation have not been observed to form biofilmsin the past , and so the observation of biofilmsin the cold was a surprise , " DasSarma told SPACE.com .
The genomes for these twospecies of archaea have already been partially sequenced .
Their full sequenceswill soon be available , allowing scientists to learn which genes generateproteins , such as cold - shock proteins , that help the microbes adapt to extremecold .
The findings were publishedonline in the International Journal of Astrobiology .

Imagine having no internet for a day .
It ca n’t be that difficult , can it ?
You can find things to do , offline work to get finished , people to talk to , books to read , TV shows to watch , etc .
Now try to imagine a business without internet – obviously one that makes of the internet normally .
Again , they might be behind on the day ’s news , miss out on a couple of stock changes , and lose touch with some contacts and / or offices – but they ’ll live through it .
But what if it was n’t just one person or business , and not even two , but an entire country without internet for a week !
What would happen !?
Today , we were unlucky enough to find out .
Actually , it turns out we were the “ lucky ” ones , at least according to the Jordan Telecom customer service manager we spoke to .
In a nutshell , we ’ve been having internet problems for the last week or so , and we did n’t have internet at all for most of today .
The conversation went something along these lines :
NST : Hi , we just spoke to our ISP , and they told us to check with Jordan Telecom with regards to whether any maintenance is taking place on our phone line ?
JTCom : What error are you getting ?
NST : Something about a total ATM - Encapsulation failure .
JTCom : Hold on a moment , let me put the manager through .
JTCom : Hi , I hear you have a problem ?
NST : Yeah , we do n’t have internet , and it ’s been acting really fuzzy for the past week or so .
JTCom : Oh yeah , we ’re in the middle of an upgrade .
Most of the country ’s been without internet for the past week , you see .
NST : Oh really ?!
I knew there was something wrong , but this …
JTCom : Do n’t worry , it ’ll be over today .
All I can promise you is , you wo n’t be waking me up tomorrow telling me ‘ I do n’t have internet !’ < chuckles >
NST : Ha ha .
What time will the maintenace be over ?
JTCom : I really ca n’t say .
You ’re very lucky you know .
You say your ISP is TE Data ?
You guys only experienced short outages throughout the day .
Most others did n’t have internet at all !
You know , this is all to get you guys better service and relieve some of the ADSL pressure …
It ’s quite sad .
In a country where – no matter who your ISP is – you have to go through the state - sponsored telecom company in the middle ( so they can make money , provide you with “ useful ” outages , and monitor all your traffic ) , we were only saved from a week without internet because of the fact that we get our ADSL pipeline straight from neighoring Egypt ; allowing us to bypass the government “ proxy ” filter , and getting a ( slow ) line without a bandwidth - cap at a rate 6 times that of modernized countries – and with just about the highest latency ever .
If we were – God Forbid – using JTCom as our ISP as well , we ’d have been without internet for an entire week , as most other companies , organizations , and individuals found out to their disadvantage .
Even worse , no one was informed , at least , not that we can tell .
It was n’t in the state - censored newspapers , radio channels , or TV stations ; and JTCom did n’t even bother sending an email , SMS , fax , or automated phone message to its subscribers .
Instead , you had to live for a week without internet , like it or not ; and you have no right to complain , ask for refunds , or get compensation for lost opportunites and / or revenue .
Seeing as ADSL is the only internet option available ( ignoring dial - up , and the outrageously - expensive satellite internet ) , the entire country was marooned for a week , and the sad thing is , no one even knows !

XML is a bouncing thriving five - year - old now , and yet I 've been feeling unsatisfied with it , particularly in recent times .
In particular in my capacity as a programmer .
During the process of setting up ongoing , for the first time in a year or more I wrote a bunch of code to process arbitrary incoming XML , and I found it irritating , time - consuming , and error - prone .
Some other recent data points :
The programmers here at Antarctica had to write Flash code to use the MX built - in parser to read the XML that Visual Net generates , and found it sufficiently slow and irritating that we forked the XML output format , and there 's another version designed for the Flash client .
Adam Bosworth , a programming titan ( his resumÃ© includes Quattro Pro , Access , and IE4 ) recently wrote convincingly about the undue hardship programmers face in dealing with XML .
At about the time I was setting up ongoing , Joe Gregorio posted a lengthy and compelling rant on the same subject which got me thinking about writing this .
Programming Baskets · Some more background .
Serious programming these days more or less all falls into three baskets :
The scripting tribe : Perl , Python and their friends , beloved of input - data wranglers and website gluers everywhere .
The O - O factory , now chiefly represented by Java and C# , where the Big Company Programmers building Big Systems on Big Iron live .
The close - to - the - metal gang , which is still mostly C and some C++.
This is where you live if you write Apache models or Linux infrastructure or Perl / Python extensions .
I think all of these communities are having more trouble than they really ought to with XML .
Oddly enough , the problem is n't in writing the XML processor , which is n't that hard , look at the number that are out there .
The difficulty is in using one .
An XML - Oriented Programing Language ? ·
One response has been a suggestion that we need a language whose semantics and native data model are optimized for XML .
That premise is silly on the face of it : here are two reasons why :
Some decades after the advent of the relational database , we have not seen programming languages center themselves around normalized data models ; in fact , the movement away from the C struct - centered worldview to O - O code +data encapsulation is really a move away from the tabular paradigm .
You can embed SQL in most languages now , but normally you do n't implement any serious business logic in it .
If this has n't happened after decades in the relational world , why would we expect it to happen in the XML world ?
- centered worldview to O - O code+data encapsulation is really a move away from the tabular paradigm .
You can embed SQL in most languages now , but normally you do n't implement any serious business logic in it .
If this has n't happened after decades in the relational world , why would we expect it to happen in the XML world ?
The notion that there is an " XML data model " is silly and unsupported by real - world evidence .
The definition of XML is syntactic : the " Infoset " is an afterthought and in any case is far indeed from being a data model specification that a programmer could work with .
Empirical evidence : I can point to a handful of different popular XML - in - Java APIs each of which has its own data model and each of which works .
So why would you think that there 's a data model there to build a language around ?
Life in the Scripting Basket · As regards XML , I 've been living in the land of scripting generally and Perl specifically in recent times ; the internals of the Antarctica runtime codebase are all C , the back end has Java and C++ , but these all build and manage internal data structures that look nothing like XML , and the XML we generate is via the venerable printf ( ) - plus - markup - escaping approach .
That leaves input data munging , which I do a lot of , and a lot of input data these days is XML .
Now here 's the dirty secret ; most of it is machine - generated XML , and in most cases , I use the perl regexp engine to read and process it .
I 've even gone to the length of writing a prefilter to glue together tags that got split across multiple lines , just so I could do the regexp trick .
The reasons are not complicated :
If I use any of the perl +XML machinery , it wants me either to let it read the whole thing and build a structure in memory , or go to a callback interface .
Since we 're typically reading very large datasets , and typically looking at the vast majority of it , preloading it into a data structure would be impractical not to say stupid .
Thus we'd be forced to use parser callbacks of one kind or another , which is sufficiently non-idiomatic and awkward that I 'd rather just live in regexp - land .
When I came to do ongoing , I decided as a matter of principle that the input had to be XML and had to be read with a real XML processor .
Since , once again , I was going to be using every byte of every file , I decided that loading it all into an in - memory data structure so I could run through it inorder was egregiously stupid , and went with callbacks .
Which are irritating .
The program that writes ongoing sets up for processing an entry by initializing a bunch of global state variables , unleashes the XML parser , and stands back .
I 've been writing Perl since 1993 or so and this just feels awkward and unnecessary .
The canonical Perl program , in my idiom anyhow , looks something like :
my ( $ state_var1 , $ state_var2 ) = ( 0 , '' ) ; my ( % collector1 , $ collector2 ) ; while ( < STDIN > ) { next if ( / rexexp - for - something - I - ignore / ) ; if ( / something - I'm interested - in / ) { $ state_var1 = & foo ( $ 1 , $ 4 , \ % collector1 ) ; } elsif ( / something - else / ) { $ state_var2 = & bar ( $_ , $ state_var1 ) ; } elsif ( / yet another / ) { $ state_var_1 = $ state_var2 + $ collector1 {baz} ; } else { print ; } }
This may feel primitive to the O - O heavies out there , but it 's the way a lot of the Net is stitched together .
I 'm not sure what the right solution to the XML awkwardness is in O - O land or close - to - the - metal - ville , but I 'm pretty damn sure what I 'd like to see in Scripting Village .
By example :
while ( < STDIN > ) { next if ( X < meta > X ) ; if ( X < h1 > | < h2 > | < h3 > | < h4>X ) { $ divert = ' head ' ; } elsif ( X<img src= " / ^(.*\. jpg ) $ / i>X ) { & proc_jpeg ( $ 1 ) ; } # and so on ... }
The idea is that the element - ish and attribute -y syntax in regexps abstracts away all the XML syntax weirdness , igoring line - breaks , attribute orders , choice of quotemakrs and so on .
I 've invented some Perl syntax off the top of my head which is a highly dangerous thing to do , particularly in the fraught land of regexps , particularly since the Perloids are re-inventing all that right now in the Perl6 project ; so let 's be clear that the above is not a serious syntax proposal .
But essentially , I want to have my idiomatic regexp cake and eat my well - formed XML goodness too .
Too much to ask ?
Out of the Scripting Basket · I suspect there are parallel proposals to be made for the people who live in the O - O and close - to - the - metal worlds , but they do n't leap to the front of my mind .
I will make one slightly - brave prediction though : I think that the stream - processing mode of reading and using XML is going to occupy a substantial part of the landscape no matter which basket you 're living in ; the costs of the alternatives are frequently going to be just too high .
So I think the key first step is to make XML stream processing idiomatic in as many programming languages as possible .
Rumor has it that the .NET CLR is going the right way on this one , but I have n't been there .
I guess I ought to say in closing that even given the irritation which programmers encounter in dealing with XML , the benefits are sufficient that the current trend toward using it as the interchange format for more or less everything still seems sound .
But we can make people 's lives easier I think .
Stature and Status : Height , Ability , and Labor Market Outcomes
NBER Working Paper No. 12466
Issued in August 2006
NBER Program(s ) : Economics of Aging , Children , Health Care , Health Economics , Labor Studies
It has long been recognized that taller adults hold jobs of higher status and , on average , earn more than other workers .
A large number of hypotheses have been put forward to explain the association between height and earnings .
In developed countries , researchers have emphasized factors such as self esteem , social dominance , and discrimination .
In this paper , we offer a simpler explanation :
On average , taller people earn more because they are smarter .
As early as age 3 — before schooling has had a chance to play a role — and throughout childhood , taller children perform significantly better on cognitive tests .
The correlation between height in childhood and adulthood is approximately 0.7 for both men and women , so that tall children are much more likely to become tall adults .
As adults , taller individuals are more likely to select into higher paying occupations that require more advanced verbal and numerical skills and greater intelligence , for which they earn handsome returns .
Using four data sets from the US and the UK , we find that the height premium in adult earnings can be explained by childhood scores on cognitive tests .
Furthermore , we show that taller adults select into occupations that have higher cognitive skill requirements and lower physical skill demands .

Why do " Aha ! " moments sometimes come easily and sometimes not at all ?
A new study reveals that patterns of brain activity before people even see a problem predict whether they will solve it with or without a sudden insight .
If you ’ve experienced the highs and lows of creative thinking , you know that sometimes the creative well is dry , while at other times creativity is free flowing .
It is during the latter times that problem solvers often experience so - called “ Aha ! ” moments – those moments of clarity when the solution to a vexing problem falls into place with a sudden insight and one sees connections that previously eluded you .
But why do “ Aha ! ” moments sometimes come easily and sometimes not at all ?
A new study reveals that patterns of brain activity before people even see a problem predict whether they will solve it with or without a sudden insight , and these brain activity patterns are likely linked to distinct types of mental preparation .
John Kounios , a professor of psychology at Drexel University , Mark Jung - Beeman of Northwestern University , and their research team report their findings in a new paper published in the journal Psychological Science .
“ Our previous work showed that the ‘ Aha !
Moment ’ is associated with a specific and unique brain mechanism , ” said Kounios .
“ The new study shows that this ‘ Aha !
Moment ’ is the culmination of a process that begins even before one starts working on a specific problem .
People can prepare to solve an upcoming problem with a flash of insight by adopting a particular frame of mind for doing so . ”
The research suggests subjects can mentally prepare to have an “ Aha ! ” solution even before a problem is presented .
Specifically , as they prepare for problems that they solve with insight , their pattern of brain activity suggests that they are focusing attention inwardly , are ready to switch to new trains of thought , and perhaps are actively silencing irrelevant thoughts .
This shows its possible to prepare mentally to solve problems with different thinking styles and that these different forms of preparation can be identified with specific patterns of brain activity .
This study may eventually lead to an understanding of how to attain the optimal “ frame of mind ” to deal with particular types of problems .
This research team ’s previous study revealed that just prior to an “ Aha ! ” solution , after there has been work on solving a problem , the brain momentarily reduces visual inputs , with an effect similar to shutting of the eyes or looking away to facilitate the emergence into consciousness of the solution .
The new study extends these findings by suggesting that mental preparation involving inward focus of attention promotes insight even prior to the presentation of a problem .
Participants in the new study were presented with a series of word puzzles .
Each problem consisted of three words ( for example , tank , hill , secret ) , and participants had to think of a single word that could form a compound or common phrase with each of the three words .
Sometimes the problem was solved with a sudden flash of insight – the solution suddenly pops into consciousness and seems obviously correct .
At other times , solving such problems is more methodically , and involves “ trying out ” possible solutions until on the correct one is found ( in this case , top : tank top , hilltop , top secret ) .
In two parallel experiments , participants solved these problems while brain activity was monitored either with electroencephalograms ( EEG ) , which provide precise timing information and approximate anatomical information , or with functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , which gives a more precise location of active brain areas , but with less precise timing .
The researchers focused on neural activity that occurred during the period just before each problem was displayed .
The two brain imaging techniques yielded highly similar results and showed a different pattern of brain activity prior to problems that were subsequently solved with an “ Aha ! , ” compared to the pattern of brain activity prior to problems solved more methodically .
Mental preparation that led to insight solutions was generally characterized by increased brain activity in temporal lobe areas associated with conceptual processing , and with frontal lobe areas associated with cognitive control or “ top - down ” processing .
Jung - Beeman noted that “ Problem solvers could use cognitive control to switch their train of thought when stuck on a problem , or possibly to suppress irrelevant thoughts , such as those related to the previous problem . ”
In contrast , preparation that led to more methodical solutions involved increased neural activity in the visual cortex at the back of the brain — suggesting that preparation for deliberate problem solving simply involved external focus of attention on the video monitor on which the problem would be displayed .
More than a century ago , Louis Pasteur said “ Chance favors only the prepared mind . ”
By this , he meant that sudden flashes of insight do n’t just happen , but are the product of preparation .
According to Kounios , “ We have begun to understand how the brain prepares for creative insight .
This will hopefully lead to techniques for facilitating it . ”

The Python 2.5 Goodie Bag : Language Enhancements and Modules The 2.5 version of Python offered lots of useful enhancements .
In this article , you 'll learn about some specific modules , as well as performance improvements , that are likely to bring big smiles to the faces of many Python developers .
by Gigi Sayfan Jan 5 , 2007
Page 1 of 5 n my last article , " n my last article , " Drill - down on Three Major New Modules in Python 2.5 Standard Library , " I discussed how the ctypes , pysqlite , and ElementTree language modules can save you time and aggravation .
In this , my third and final , article on the new 2.5 version of Python , I 'll go over some additional language enhancements and modules that each , individually , adds an important ingredient to some of the smaller subsets of the Python community .
I will also cover performance improvements , porting your code from previous versions of Python , and some other odds and ends that will be important to anyone who is ready to adopt the latest release of Python .
Absolute and Relative Imports
To get started , I 'll run through some of the basics of Python language organization .
Python software is organized in modules ( . py files ) stored in packages .
The modules may be pre-compiled ( .pyc ) or could be extension modules .
Python packages are usually just directories that appear in sys.path .
Sub - packages are sub-directories of a package directory ( or other sub- package ) that contain an __init__.py .
If the __init__.py does n't exist then the sub - directory is ignored by Python 's import mechanism .
Python locates modules that you import by searching a list of directories ( or zip files ) stored in sys.path .
This list is initialized with the directory of the running program , the contents of the PYTHONPATH environment variable , and a list of platform - dependent directories .
Programs may modify sys.path at runtime to control the import behavior .
Prior to Python 2.5 imports were always relative to your sys.path .
The algorithm was very simple :
When importing ' aaa.a ' scan through sys.path .
Try to import aaa .a. py from each entry in sys.path .
There were two problems with this algorithm : Local modules might shadow library modules with identical names .
This becomes more of a problem as the standard library grows .
Modules inside nested packages had to use the full path to import modules from a sibling package or parent package .
Python 2.5 added a __future__ option to change the import behavior in order to address these problems .
I created a little package and a couple of helper modules to demonstrate the import behavior in Python 2.5 : aaa ( package ) |-- __init__.py |-- a.py |-- aa.py
Here is the content of the modules : __init__.py
----------- print ' aaa / __init__ here ' a.py ---- from __future__ import absolute_import print ' aaa / a here ' import aa aa.py ----- print r'aaa\aa here ' I " installed " the package by copying it to Lib / site - packages ( the location of third - party Python packages ) .
Python 2.5 added aoption to change the import behavior in order to address these problems .
I created a little package and a couple of helper modules to demonstrate the import behavior in Python 2.5 :
Here is the content of the modules : I " installed " the package by copying it to Lib / site - packages ( the location of third - party Python packages ) .
In addition I created two modules in the site - packages directory .
import_test.py
----------- print ' import_test here ' import aaa . a aa.py ----- print ' aa here '
Each module just prints its package ( if in a package ) and its name .
It all starts with import_test .py that imports aaa .a .
This results in the automatic import of aaa / __init__.py and then aaa / a.py .
The latter , aaa / a.py , is the interesting piece .
It uses the new absolute_import feature .
It imports aa .
A module named aa.py exists in the a.py 's directory ( aaa ) and in the site - packages directory .
Without absolute_import the local aa.py would have been imported ( aaa / a.py ) , but the " absolute " aa.py in site - packages is imported instead .
Here is the output of running import_test.py : aaa / __init__ here aaa / a here aa here
If I comment out the __future__ line the local aaa / aa . py module will be imported from aaa .a. py : aaa / __init__ here aaa / a here aaa / aa here
What if you want to import both the local aa and the absolute aa ?
Prior to Python 2.5 you would have had to play tricks and dynamically modify your sys.path ( and hopefully remember to restore it afterwards ) .
With Python 2.5 you can use the new dot notation : aaa / a.py --------- from __future__ import absolute_import print r'aaa / a here ' import aa from .
import aa Output ( of import_test.py ) : import_test here aaa / __init__ here aaa / a here aa here aaa / aa here The '. ' allows you to import from the current directory .
Double dot '..' can be used to import from a parent package in a relative path notation .

With Python 2.5 you can use the new dot notation : Output ( of ) : The '. ' allows you to import from the current directory .
Double dot '..' can be used to import from a parent package in a relative path notation .
There is one caveat .
The relative import syntax works inside packages only .
If you try to use it in a main module you will get the following exception : ValueError : Attempted relative import in non-package

Science reporter , BBC News
The claims are based on observations of the Bullet Cluster
Dark matter - which does not emit or reflect enough light to be " seen " - is thought to make up 25 % of the Universe .
By contrast , the ordinary matter we can see is believed to make up no more than about 5 % of our Universe .
Until now , astronomers have only been able to infer the existence of this dark material through the gravitational effects it has on ordinary matter .
What the researchers have done is , in effect , to identify the gravitational " signature " of dark matter .
This signature was created by dark matter and ordinary matter being wrenched apart by the immense collision of two large galaxy clusters .
" The kinetic energy of this collision is ... enough to completely evaporate and pulverise planet Earth ten trillion , trillion times over , " said team member Maxim Markevitch , of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , US .
Study leader Doug Clowe , from the University of Arizona , said : " This provides the first direct proof that dark matter must exist and that it must make up the majority of the matter in the Universe . "
Gravity puzzle
Astronomers have known since the 1930s that these galaxy clusters have far too much gravity to be explained by the amount of visible matter in them alone .
This extra gravity has two possible explanations .
One is that most matter in the clusters is in a form we cannot see , because it does not absorb or emit light .
A second explanation is that gravity does not behave the same way in galaxy clusters light - years in size as it does on Earth .
WHAT THE UNIVERSE IS MADE OF 70 % - dark energy 25 % - dark matter 5 % - ordinary matter
But in the cosmic smash - up ( the colliding feature is known to astronomers as the Bullet Cluster ) , these components have been pulled apart .
The astronomers were lucky enough to catch the collision just 100 million years after it occurred - the blink of an eye in cosmic time .
The researchers could see that the hot gas in the collision had been slowed down by a drag force , similar to air resistance .
Meanwhile , the galaxies themselves continued speeding through space , leaving the gas behind .
Dark matter particles should not slow down in the same way as the gas ; they do not interact directly with themselves or the gas except through gravity .
Instead , dark matter should behave in a similar way to the galaxies .
More mass in gas
If dark matter did exist , the astronomers expected to find the majority of mass in clusters residing around the galaxies .
But if dark matter did not exist , most of the galaxy clusters ' mass would be in its diffuse hot gas .
This is because galaxy clusters typically contain 10 times as much ordinary mass in gas as in stars .
The researchers found most of the mass was located near the galaxies - ahead of the gas clouds - showing the dark matter really was there .
The majority of the Universe - some 70 % - is composed of dark energy , an equally mysterious quantity which exerts negative pressure .
" Dark matter and dark energy are not what anyone would have expected starting from the perspective of what the Universe should be like , " said Sean Carroll , a cosmologist at the University of Chicago , who was not involved with the study , " but we 're trying to understand why it 's like that and this result puts us on that path . "
Marusa Bradac , at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center ( Slac ) in California , added : " We had predicted the existence of dark matter for decades , but now we 've seen it in action .
This is groundbreaking . "
In order to locate the mass in the clusters , researchers used the Chandra and Hubble space telescopes , along with the Very Large Telescope and Magellan optical telescopes in Chile .
This was done by measuring the effect of gravitational lensing , where gravity from the clusters distorts light from background galaxies , as predicted by Einstein 's theory of general relativity .
' This sucks , ' says the American pilot of an A10 Thunderbolt tank buster when he realises that he has just unleashed a devastating cannon burst on a British armoured patrol .
' We 're in jail dude , ' chokes his wingman as they return to base , streaming expletives about their deadly mistake .
Jail is not where these dudes landed after they fatally strafed their British allies in Iraq in a tragic case of blue - on - blue just after the invasion .
The senior officer was subsequently promoted to colonel , awarded the bronze star and now trains other American pilots in ground - attack .
The recording is chilling .
Gung - ho American reservists on their first combat mission are misled into thinking that there are no ' friendlies ' in the area .
Eager for action , they talk themselves into thinking that the orange panels marking the tanks as their British allies are enemy rocket launchers .
They retch and curse when they are told that they have made a horrific blunder .
The incident itself was terrible enough , but this is not what has done most damage to Anglo - American relations .
The Pentagon obstructed the inquest into the death of Lance Corporal Matty Hull .
His widow has had to wait four years until someone leaked the cockpit recording to find out how her husband was killed .
The Ministry of Defence appeared unwilling to stand up to its American counterparts and dissembled about whether video footage of the attack existed .
Not for the first time , Britain is made to look like a subservient satellite taken wretchedly for granted by the country that is supposed to be its closest ally .
Opponents of the war in Iraq get daily vindication that the invasion was a terrible mistake .
Supporters of the removal of Saddam feel betrayed by the appalling mess the divided and incompetent Bush administration has made of the aftermath .
Tony Blair is an increasingly lonely voice when he pleads that Britain and America must remain each other 's indispensable allies .
' We should n't give that up in any set of circumstances , ' the Prime Minister declared when he appeared before senior MPs last week .
' The relationship with America is what opens lots of doors everywhere . '
He did not make his case more persuasive when he selected climate change as an example of what he had got out of his closeness to George W Bush .
When he leaves Number 10 , his successors will have to fashion a new foreign policy for Britain which recasts its relationship with America and reorients its approach to the rest of the world .
The United Kingdom and the United States will remain firm friends .
Their histories , economies and cultures are too entwined for it to be otherwise .
They will continue to co-operate in the struggle against Islamist terrorism .
Often , they will have mutual interests which will put them on the same side in global arguments .
That said , the relationship will never be the same again .
And Tony Blair is one of the reasons why it will change .
He has not been the Prime Minister he expected to be .
He entered Downing Street as an instinctively pro-European leader who thought it was his destiny to settle Britain 's relationship with Europe .
He ends his premiership with it most defined by his relationship with the United States .
The guiding principle of Mr Blair 's foreign policy has been to get as close as he could to the American President , whoever he was .
He was Bill Clinton 's closest chum , then George W Bush 's best buddy .
As Mr Blair acknowledges , he has paid a high ' political penalty ' for that .
What he or Britain got in return is not clear , even to some of his closest colleagues .
' Iraq has been a total disaster , ' says one minister who can be normally counted as a great Blair loyalist .
One of the unintended consequences of his adherence to America is to make it more likely that his successors will put some distance between themselves and Washington .
Gordon Brown talks coolly , if imprecisely , about adopting a stance which puts ' Britain 's interests first ' .
David Cameron has described himself as ' a liberal conservative rather than a neoconservative ' who would be ' solid but not slavish in our friendship with America ' .
A Conservative government would not join those who believe in ' recklessly poking the United States in the eye ' , but nor would it be ' America 's unconditional associate in every endeavour ' .
Mr Cameron is not anti-American .
Neither is Gordon Brown .
But they do sense the demand in Britain for our own declaration of independence from America .
Globescan regularly conducts a massive poll of attitudes towards the United States by sampling the opinion of 26,000 people across 25 countries .
The latest survey finds antagonism towards America at an intense pitch .
Even in countries such as Poland which are traditionally warm towards the US , public opinion has turned very sour .
Britain is becoming almost as anti-American as France has historically been .
Just a third of Britons now regard the United States as a force for good .
Even if a future Prime Minister could convince himself that it would be sensible to do another Iraq , he would have huge difficulty persuading his colleagues or the public that he had not gone mad .
Tony Blair has been fixated with Washington because his guiding belief is that Britain maximises its global influence by flying as wingman to America .
That role will seem less attractive to his successors for several reasons .
One is that American power is going into decline .
Sure , for the foreseeable future , the United States will remain a colossal military force , but its relative global clout will diminish as this century gets older .
Iraq has already made the United States look much weaker in the eyes of the world .
It has been a sanguinary lesson in the limitations of ' hard ' power .
Even some of the architects of the ' surge ' plan do n't believe that George W Bush 's last throw is going to pacify Baghdad .
Even under Tony Blair , American and British priorities are diverging .
As the United States pours more troops into Iraq , Britain is desperate to get its soldiers home .
Immense damage has also been done to America 's ' soft ' power - the capacity to influence the world by example and persuasion .
Uncouth Nation is a new book which explores rising anti-Americanism .
Its author , Andrei Markovits , a professor at the University of Michigan , deplores the phenomenon , but that does n't inhibit him from detailing its increase and its consquences .
' It matters that teenagers in Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , South Korea , Mexico , China , Taiwan , Lebanon , Pakistan , Nigeria and Argentina have come to despise America and the American people despite - or precisely because of - their being eager consumers of American culture . '
The greatest antipathy is directed at the American President .
As Markovits has it : ' Bush represents to Europeans the quintessential ugly American : arrogant , uncouth , uncultured , ignorant , inconsiderate , and aggressive . '
The departure of George W Bush may soften some of the hostility towards America .
What it wo n't do is change the deeper , underlying trends which will demand a British foreign policy that is less exclusively concentrated on the relationship with the White House .
Masked by the narrow and furious focus on the Middle East of the last few years , the tectonic plates of geopolitics are shifting .
For a brief period after the fall of the Berlin Wall , American was an unchallenged hegemon , the only superpower - ' the hyperpuissance , ' in the phrase of a French Foreign Minister .
The world is becoming increasingly multipolar and more reminiscent of the competing Great Powers of the 19th century .
Russia has just announced that it is going to exploit its economic revival to rebuild its military strength .
China is constructing a blue - water navy , demonstrating the capacity to shoot satellites out of space and buying up vast tracts of Africa in order to use the continent 's oil and minerals to feed Chinese economic growth .
Brazil and India are also achieving the growth to enable them to become the world powers that their geographical and population size say they should be .
In this new world order , America will be less focused on its old friends across the Atlantic and more geared towards making alliances and confronting threats in the Pacific and Asia .
The world 's most powerful economic group has been the G7 : America , Japan , Germany , Britain , France , Italy and Canada .
Sometime around the middle of this century , it is very probable that the G7 will be surpassed by the combined economic power of the BRICs - Brazil , Russia , India and China .
That will be a decisive shift of global clout from the old West to the new powers of the South and the East .
Gordon Brown talks readily about the challenge of India and China , but he has yet to provide details of how he would recast British foreign policy to deal with it .
All the effort he has put into debt relief and good governance in Africa is undermined when China is supplying huge loans with no human rights strings attached .
Both he and David Cameron will have to think about how to re-energise Europe as a world player and reinvigorate Britain 's relationship with her closest neighbours .
On the Chancellor 's recent trip to India , there was a telling moment when the Indian Prime Minister greeted him as a ' leader of the EU ' .
That is not how Mr Brown , who has a reputation as a grudging European , is accustomed to thinking of himself .
The Tory leader 's attempts to build relationships in the EU is handicapped by his party 's atavistic hostility to everything European .
Global institutions which reflect the balance of world power as it was in 1945 will have to be radically overhauled .
It will become ever harder to justify Britain 's possession of a permanent seat on the UN Security Council when Brazil and India do not have one .
The big issues of this century - none of them more important than climate change - cannot be addressed by a foreign policy obsessed only with hugging Washington .
The challenge for Tony Blair 's successors will be to embrace the whole of a rapidly changing world .

Startling new evidence found by archaeologists working on the southern outskirts of Moscow proves that human immigration from Western Asia into the European Continent began over 45,000 years ago .
Its not clear what prompted the move but some have hypothesised that it was the attractiveness of the benefit system and availability of wattle and daub housing that caused the influx .
“ These early immigrants brough with them their own distinct type of artefacts which suggest that integration and multiculturalism have had a long history of failure and the sooner they are sent back to where they came from the better ’ ” said Dr RW Bollox of The Institute of Kneejerk Nimbyism and Classical Dance whilst wiping froth from the corner of his mouth .
Other academics ( with real qualifications from real universities and not made up ones for the sake of easy point scoring ) have said that this is an exciting discovery which throws into doubt the previously held belief that early modern humans entered the continent via Bulgaria and Greece around 44,000 years ago .
Professor John Hoffecker of the University of Colorado said that the finds “ suggest at the very least that we have an alternate route for modern humans into Europe - perhaps this being the earliest one . ”
Fossil records - the bane of creationists life - show that modern humans first emerged in Sub Saharan Africa around 200,000 years ago with migration to other land masses beginning around 50 - 60,000 years ago .
The theory that they were after our jobs , schools , housing and benefits is easily disproven as none of those things existed at the time .

noun- refers to nationalism contaminated by bigotry .
A hatriot defines himself by his nationality , and by how much he dislikes any who disagree with his nation 's agenda .
Thus , his / her / its ( the nations ) nationality becomes defined by all that he / she / it do not oppose .
Oftentimes , it is considered acceptable to take cheap shots , racial or otherwise , at individuals / institutions that represent oppositional ideas etc.
Similar in nature to branding opposition w/ i one 's own nation as anti their own nation and its ideals .

One is the surprise , “ surgical ” air operation against Iranian nuclear facilities to take them out before they cause too much trouble .
This option is beloved of the kind of tough - guy op - ed writers who earlier cheered on a war with Iraq .
It is not at all beloved within the U.S. military .
That is because military officials know what would happen roughly five minutes after the attacks were over : a short - term effort to make things really difficult for Americans in Iraq ( where Iran obviously has huge leverage ) , in world energy markets , and everywhere else — plus a long - term , renewed effort to build Iran ’s own bomb .
More than two years ago , this exercise in the Atlantic indicated that it was simply too late for the United States ( much less Israel ) to deny Iran a nuclear option via surprise attack .
Since then — well , it ’s even later .
The second option would be land war .
Please .
Iran is nearly four times as large and has nearly three times as many people as Iraq .
With what army will the U.S. attack and occupy such a state ?

And the third would be some kind of drift into war , Cuban Missile Crisis - style .
Threats and bombast on both sides , hair - trigger preparations , each side hurrying to strike because it thinks it ’s too dangerous to wait for the other side to strike first .
( Come to think of it , was n’t this the essence of the “ National Security Strategy ” the Bush administration laid out in 2002 , with its concept of “ preventive ” war ? )
For the likely consequences , see Option One .
Would it be better if Iran did not acquire nuclear weapons ?
Of course .
But there are certain important goals that cannot realistically be attained by war .
This is one of them .
Analogy : it would be far better if North Korea did not build a full nuclear arsenal .
The United States should do all it can to keep that from happening — but no sane person thinks that attacking North Korea , and provoking an instant assault on Seoul and neighboring cities , is the way to go .
If we could trust the Administration ’s ability to judge America ’s rational self - interest , there would be no need to constrain its threatening gestures toward Iran .
Everyone would understand that this was part of the negotiation process ; no one would worry that the Administration would finally take a step as self - destructive as beginning or inviting a war .
But no one can any longer trust the Administration to recognize and defend America ’s rational self - interest — not when the President says he will carry out a policy even if opposed by everyone except his wife and dog , not when the Vice President refuses to concede any mistake or misjudgment in the handling of Iraq .
According to the constitutional chain of command , those two men literally have the power to order a strike that would be disastrous for their nation .
The Congress has no official way to prevent them from doing so — it is interesting , and alarming , to think that in practice the safety valve might be the professional military , trained to revere the chain of command but faced with what its members would recognize as ruinous instructions .
What the Congress can do is draw the line .
It can say that war with Iran is anathema to the interests of the United States and contrary to the will of its elected representatives .
And it should do that now .
UNIX Style , or cat -v Considered Harmful
Rob Pike
Bell Laboratories

It seems that UNIX has become the victim of cancerous growth at the hands of organizations such as UCB .
4.2BSD is an order of magnitude larger than Version 5 , but , Pike claims , not ten times better .
The talk reviews reasons for UNIX 's popularity and shows , using UCB cat as a primary example , how UNIX has grown fat .
cat is n't for printing files with line numbers , it is n't for compressing multiple blank lines , it 's not for looking at non-printing ASCII characters , it 's for concatenating files .
We are reminded that ls is n't the place for code to break a single column into multiple ones , and that mailnews should n't have its own more processing or joke encryption code .
Rob carried the standard well for the " spirit of UNIX , " and you can look forward to a deeper look at the philosophy of UNIX in his forthcoming book .
From USENIX Summer Conference Proceedings , 1983
The companion paper to this talk is Program Design Design in the UNIX Environment .
The forthcoming book referred to is The UNIX Programming Environment , co-written with Brian Kernighan .
We all know that whenever there is a new technology , the adult industry is the first to take advantage of it .
I was n't exactly surprised to get this e-mail , but , like the sender , I was impressed by how quickly it happened .
So shortly after getting the trial version of opera on the Wii I went to a free adult site http://www.tiava.com to look at some photos .
Yesterday I went back and ... well apparently either the site maintainers are Wii enthusiasts or I 'm not the only one .
The site has added a " Wii friendly " interface for browsing their content .
I guess I should n't be too surprised the adult industry seems to always know where technology is going , but I 'm surprised to see it so quick .
The browser has n't been available but for a week now .
For obvious reasons , the sender of said e-mail wished be anonymous .
How long will it take for other sites to offer the same thing ?
I 'm not just thinking of adult sites ; I already have a list of sites on my favorites that are Wii-friendly such as the Wiicade and Orisinal , and I can't be the only one that uses the Opera browser on the Wii to play games .
Are we getting close a world of porn accessed through our game consoles ?
Scary thought , but look at how quickly it happened with the PSP .
If you can put nudity on something , Lord knows it will be done almost instantly .
Kart Racing games .
Everybody has played them , and everybody has probably cursed them .
It 's a genre of racing where innovation is not an issue ( just stick a bunch of funny characters into those karts , preferably licensed characters , and watch them ( and your sales figures ) go ! ) and that seems to have been milked so utterly that even the mention of new kart racing games is enough to make people want to throw their consoles out of the window .
Still , when you sit back and look at it , it 's also one of the most fun genres to play with friends , as these games are easy to pick up and enjoy , making them perfect for any multi player evening .
Yes , a lot of crap has been released in this genre , but also these ten gems .
10 . Muppet Race Mania ( PS1 )
On the surface , it seems like a title that could n't possibly be any good .
Sure , we all love the Muppets , but to have them feature in their own kart title brings back memories of games like Walt Disney World Racing and South Park Rally , where the potential was squandered with lazy racing engines and boring track design .
It 's a surprise then that Muppet Race Mania is so much fun .
The game is large , both in amount of tracks and characters , and really fun to play .
The PS
One played host to many a good kart game , and this one was a nice surprise .
9. Speed Freaks / Punks ( PS1 )
Released in Europe , where it originated , as Speed Freaks , and then later turned into Speed Punks for the American market , this is a racer does everything right .
Colourful graphics , good track design , interesting characters ...
Many PS
One players touted it as better than SUper Mario Kart , but it does not quite reach those dazzling heights .
Still , if you find this game somewhere for a nice budget price and you still use your PS One / Two , then give it a whirl .
8. Motor Toon Grand Prix ( PS1 )
Motor Toon Grand Prix was released already quite early on in the PS One 's lifespan , and , correct me if I 'm wrong , was actually the first funny racer for this system .
It 's one of the first games I bought for the PS One and I had a lot of fun with it .
I can still recall the music , which was extremely catchy , and can even remember some of the tracks , which were designed well and not as derivative as those in many other games in this genre .
And here 's the stinger : this game was made by the people behind Gran Turismo ...
7. Wacky Races ( DC )
This game was released on many different platforms , but it was the Dreamcast version that stole the title of best version .
The game was incredibly frustrating in single player , but the track design and cool characters almost made you forgive the designers for this .
The game had a cool , cel shaded graphic style ( which was n;t done to death yet then ) and played smoothly .
6. Mario Kart Double Dash ( GC )
This game was touted as the Mario Kart to end all Mario Kart's , but when it was released some people were let down a bit .
Sure , it 's great fun , looks beautiful and has some interesting new features ( like the two people on one kart innovation ) , but the tracks and characters were not much more than updated versions of the tracks we saw in earlier Mario Kart - games .
Still , that did n't stop us from playing the multiplayer mode to death .
5. Mario Kart DS ( DS )
The definitive version of Mario Kart , with many tracks from all the different versions in one tight package .
It looks and plays like the best this genre has to offer , and is by far the best handheld kart racer ( though Mario on the GBA was n;t half bad either ) .
4. Looney Tunes Space Race ( DC )
The Dreamcast saw some really shitty kart racers , but both this and Wacky Races really stood out .
Looney Tunes was always the favorite during our multiplayer nights , however , mostly because of the wonderfully inventive weapons you could stall your opponents with .
I can still remember losing races where I had been in the lead almost the whole time , only because one of my ' friends ' decided to drop a piano on my head .
Everything was straight out of the Looney Tunes cartoons , and there have n't been many games with licensed characters that were this successful .
3. Crash Team Racing ( PS1 )
After the release of Crash Team Racing there have been three more racing games with Crash in them , and although these were fun , none of them can come close to the first one .
The game does not feature any special innovations that make it stand out , the classic status that this game deserves comes straight from the fact that it 's so brilliantly designed .
Graphics , music , track design and character design in this game are all completely flawless .
I can remember a day spent in bed sick , where I started up the ol ' PS1 , with a stack of games next to it .
I started with Crash Team Racing and did n't put a single other game in after that , since I was completely hooked on it .
2. Super Mario Kart ( SNES )
Okay , now you are probably thinking : something 's wrong .
Why does it say ' 2 ' in front of this classic , the game that started the genre and is looked back upon as one of the greatest games ever ?
While I love this game , and have played it for many , many times , I just do n't see it as the best example of the genre .
Still , let that not stop you to find this game and play it till your controller gives out , like so many other people did before you .
It truly is a classic , maybe the best SNES - game ever released , and if it was n't for the number one in this list , it would have left the other games in this top ten far behind it .
1. Diddy Kong Racing ( N64 )
I can imagine some controversy brewing now : how on earth can this be number one ?
Easy : it 's the most fun kart racing game I have ever played , the one I played the most , and the one that I still dig out to play even now .
It was the first game I ever played on the N64 , and I was stunned at how brilliant it looked .
The levels where you raced through the water looked fresh , you could almost smell the water , while the flying levels gave an extra adrenaline boost to proceedings .
It 's this attention to detail and the diversity of the game , combined with the lovely atmosphere of the tracks , that make it the stand out kart racing game , or at least in my opinion .
In addition , a gene ’s owner can in some instances also own the mutations of that gene , and these mutations can be markers for disease .
Countries that do n’t have gene patents actually offer better gene testing than we do , because when multiple labs are allowed to do testing , more mutations are discovered , leading to higher - quality tests .
Apologists for gene patents argue that the issue is a tempest in a teapot , that patent licenses are readily available at minimal cost .
That ’s simply untrue .
The owner of the genome for Hepatitis C is paid millions by researchers to study this disease .
Not surprisingly , many other researchers choose to study something less expensive .
But forget the costs : why should people or companies own a disease in the first place ?
They did n’t invent it .
Yet today , more than 20 human pathogens are privately owned , including haemophilus influenza and Hepatitis C .
And we ’ve already mentioned that tests for the BRCA genes for breast cancer cost $ 3,000 .
Oh , one more thing : if you undergo the test , the company that owns the patent on the gene can keep your tissue and do research on it without asking your permission .
Do n’t like it ?
Too bad .
The plain truth is that gene patents are n’t benign and never will be .
When SARS was spreading across the globe , medical researchers hesitated to study it — because of patent concerns .
There is no clearer indication that gene patents block innovation , inhibit research and put us all at risk .
Even your doctor ca n’t get relevant information .
An asthma medication only works in certain patients .
Yet its manufacturer has squelched efforts by others to develop genetic tests that would determine on whom it will and will not work .
Such commercial considerations interfere with a great dream .
For years we ’ve been promised the coming era of personalized medicine — medicine suited to our particular body makeup .
Gene patents destroy that dream .
Fortunately , two congressmen want to make the full benefit of the decoded genome available to us all .
Last Friday , Xavier Becerra , a Democrat of California , and Dave Weldon , a Republican of Florida , sponsored the Genomic Research and Accessibility Act , to ban the practice of patenting genes found in nature .
Mr. Becerra has been careful to say the bill does not hamper invention , but rather promotes it .
He ’s right .
This bill will fuel innovation , and return our common genetic heritage to us .
It deserves our support .
Mr Cardenas can be heard saying he cannot breathe
The video shows two officers punching William Cardenas in the face and pinning him to the ground with a knee to the neck , while he struggles .
The incident in Hollywood occurred in August and was filmed by a local .
A report by the two officers said Mr Cardenas resisted arrest and they feared he would try to grab their guns .
' Disturbing ' footage
Los Angeles police chief William Bratton described the footage as disturbing but said an investigation had to be carried out to decide whether or not the use of force was appropriate .
" There 's no denying that the video is disturbing , " Mr Bratton said .
" But as to whether the actions of the officers were appropriate in light of what they were experiencing and the totality of the circumstances is what the investigation will determine . "
Police say they feared Mr Cardenas would grab a gun
In the footage , the struggling Mr Cardenas can be heard complaining that he cannot breathe as one of the officers presses down on his throat with his leg .
According to an arrest report obtained by the Associated Press , the officers said Mr Cardenas had tried to resist arrest and they had been concerned that he would grab one of their guns as they were trying to handcuff him .
" The suspect 's hand covered my partner 's gun holster so I yelled at my partner to watch his gun .
My partner responded by capping his gun and delivering a left elbow to the suspect 's face causing the suspect to let go of him , " the report said .
Mr Cardenas suffered cuts and bruises on his arms , leg and face , and received stitches on an eyelid .
In 1992 the acquittal of police accused of the video - taped beating Rodney King prompted riots in Los Angeles .

In this Saturday morning post , I explain HDR photography with the help of some articles .
This post includes step by step ways to create your own HDR images .
Be advised that they can be quite hard for beginners to get interesting results .
But where there is a will , there is a way !
And by experimenting , you will get some good pictures .
Also , remember that to see the end result , you have to get through some initial steps .
I have received some questions about certain photographs , so I ’ve decided to include three articles that explains HDR photography in detail .
I had added this to the comments , but I felt this deserved to be included in a post by its own .
I have found a few different articles to explain this to everyone .
The first one dwelves in the theory behind .
The second one is an easy way to to HDR and the third one goes in to more detail on the process of HDR photography .
The source of the first article is from cybergrain .
The second article is from HDR 101 .
And the third is from Cambridgeincolour .
This post also include step by step ways to create your own HDR images .
If you want anymore information , research the sites that I have mentioned or ask questions in the HDR Pool on flickr .
Update @ 17:54 EST , Saturday the 15th of July 2006
This is by no means the only pool on flickr for this type of photography .
Check out here for more groups .
To begin using HDR photography , you need a few simple things .
A digital camera , preferably a DSLR but a good point and shoot will do the job .
Remember , you need to be able to change the shutter speed manually .
The focus can stay auto but if you can set it on manual do so A tripod ; to function correctly , HDR needs to take different pictures of the same scene .
If you do not want any motion flow , take pictures of stationary objects .
Latest edition of Photoshop Photomatix , available free here through their new beta release for Windows .
A Mac version is also available on their website .
For simple step by step instructions , scroll down to the second article and follow the steps .

The Future of Digital Imaging – High Dynamic Range Photography
Introduction
Today ’s digital cameras match or slightly exceed the performance of silver halide film .
Computer graphics has achieved the goal of photorealism .
Now the goal is to go beyond simply matching paper and silver halide – to create display technologies which can present any visual stimuli our eyes are capable of seeing .
One area of rapid development is in dynamic range .
A new crop of technologies using High Dynamic Range imaging ( HDR or HDRI ) aim to extend the dynamic range of digital imaging technologies way beyond traditional media .
In this article , I ’ll look at recent advances in the field of high dynamic range imaging .
I will cover the basic concepts of dynamic range , and talk about new HDR technologies .
The Problem
Here ’s the problem in a nutshell :
Real - world scenes contain light ranges that exceed a 50,000:1 dynamic range .
For over a thousand years , media has been limited to around a 300:1 dynamic range .
So you have a mapping issue : how do you represent light values in a scene using a much more limited set of light values for a particular media ?
If you are not careful , you end up with results like this :
You can see the chair but nothing out of the window .
Old Solutions
Master painters were very clever about mapping scene intensities to canvas .
They used a large number of tricks .
Look at El Greco ’s La Agoria en el Jardin from 1590 :
El Greco used saturated colors of opposing hues to increase the apparent dynamic range of the scene .
He also painted black or white lines around the edges of contours .
Our eyes determine contrast locally , so increasing the contrast at local edges increases the overall perceived contrast of the scene .
( Generally , the phrase “ dynamic range ” in imaging refers to the measured ratio between high and low extremes in a set of intensity values .
The word “ contrast ” is often used interchangeably with dynamic range , though I prefer to use “ contrast ” to refer to the perceived contrast of a scene , which may be different from the measured dynamic range .
For example , El Greco ’s edge contours increase perceived contrast but do n’t change the actual dynamic range of canvas ) .
Here is an example from Monet .
The red sun in his famous Impressions at Sunrise really leaps off the canvas ( maybe not on your web browser ! ) .
The sun is actually the same brightness value as the surrounding clouds .
However , since the sun is a saturated red placed over a saturated blue cloud , it creates a color vibration , and the sun looks much brighter than it is :
Check out webexhibits way - cool Flash illustration of this .
Dynamic Range in Photography
Photography involves a capture device ( the camera ) , a storage medium ( e.g. film ) , and a display or output device ( e.g. paper ) .
The dynamic range of each stage ( capture , storage and output ) plays a crucial role in the quality of the results .
In general , technologies with greater dynamic range produce more realistic results .
But photography is a compound process , and the dynamic range of each stage must be considered .
When the dynamic range of the source scene is too great for any one stage of the process , something must be sacrified : you must either give up detail in the shadows or the highlights .
Photographers have to know and work withing the limitations of their camera , storage and output devices .
W. Eugene Smith spent five days in the darkroom until he came up with a print of Albert Schweitzer that he was happy with :
Smith was dealing with the issue that silver halide negatives have a greater dynamic range than photographic paper – so he had to “ dodge and burn ” different areas of the image to get a result where both the lamp and sitter are visible .
Perhaps the greatest master of dynamic range in photography was Ansel Adams .
He was the first to systematically measure the sensitivity range of all of the equipment he used .
His “ zone system ” let him predict precisely what details he could capture on film and paper , so he could make decisions before pressing the shutter :
Color Photography
Color negative films have less dynamic range ( or “ latitude ” ) than black and white films .
My understanding is that the multiple layers and dies in color film result in reduced sensitivity .
The first color films had very poor latitude , so film manufacturers added more layers – each color layer was split in two , a high - sensitivity and a low - sensitivity layer , using different crystal formations :
( I ’m not an expert , but maybe color positive film does n’t use this trick , hence the difference in latitude between positive and negative film ? )
One way to get really great dynamic range with color film photography is to use black - and - white film together with color filters .
You have to take three exposures on separate sheets of black and white film : one with a red filter , one with a green , and one with a blue – and then composite the three images together .
If you use glass plate negatives , you end up with images that have incredible colors and resolution .
See below :
The most amazing thing about this image is that it was taken in around 1915 by Prokudin Gorskii .
While it is true that this image was digitally enhanced in Photoshop , in my own experiments with a 4×5 and red / green / blue filters I achieved an extended non-kodachrome tonal scale .
The Next Horizon : Digital HDR
Over the next decade , the imaging industry will inevitably transition to high dynamic range ( HDR ) imaging , creating devices that provide a latitude range far greater than traditional silver halide film .
This change will affect all aspects of image making .
Each of the systems in the image workflow will be modified , including capture , storage , editing and output .
Let ’s look at each of these workflow stages in turn .
Capture
Today ’s cameras have ample resolution .
So the next area of product differentiation for camera manufacturers will be the quality of the pixels , rather than the number of pixels .
This shift is starting to happen already .
For example , Fuji ’s SuperCCD S3 Pro camera has a chip with high and low sensitivity sensors per pixel location to increase dynamic range ( the same trick as used in color film to achieve broader latitude ) .
Although the resulting chip has lower overall resolution , it captures greater dynamic range .
This tradeoff of resolution for dynamic range is the beginning of an important trend .
A second alternative is to merge multiple images to increase dynamic range .
Paul Debevec at SIGGRAPH 97 showed how to take multiple photographs at different exposures and merge them together to create a single high - dynamic range image .
This technique is now incorporated in products such as Photogenics and Photoshop .
For now , the technique works best if the camera is mounted on a tripod .
But researchers have already built HDR image “ stitchers ” which merge multiple images and automatically account for camera motion between snaps .
For most consumers , “ HDR ” will simply mean that the camera records more details in shadows and in highlights .
Just as RAW images extended the detail held in digital images , HDR will further increase the available tonal range .
Consumers will benefit from the true point - and - shoot ability that broader latitude offers , because HDR cameras will produce usable images from a much wider range of lighting situations .
Eventually point - and - shoot cameras will lose their built - in flash .
Anyone who uses a camera with a cheap flash soon learns that the pictures generally look better if you turn the flash off .
Sensors are becoming more sensitive , cameras are getting smaller , and light metering is getting smarter .
Add three or four stops of dynamic range , and the flash becomes a creative ad - on rather than a requirement .
Professional photographers will also benefit from HDR .
With HDR technologies , photographers can really push the creative envelope , exploring the extremes of high - key and low - key effects .
Professional cameras will offer a multitude of HDR image - taking modes .
For example , they will automatically blend multiple images taken with different exposures , with and without flash , possibly using multiple light sources , to produce a single and extremely maliable master image .
Storage
All image file formats have range limitations .
Formats such as JPEG and GIF provide eight bits per color channel ( often referred to as 24 bit color ) .
Using 8 bits , you can represent 256 different intensities per channel .
Most 8 bit formats use a “ perceptual ” mapping , meaning that they use a gamma ( exponential ) curve rather than a linear map of intensities .
See Human vision and tonal levels or the venerable Gamma FAQ for an explanation of this .
While JPEG and GIF are great for moderate dynamic range images , banding becomes apparent if you edit the image extensively , and the formats cannot store high - dynamic - range scenes .
Newer formats including JPEG2000 , RAW and PNG offer up to 16 bits per color channel , which is plenty for most purposes .
However , there is no support for “ underage ” or “ overage ” – these image formats state that “ 0 ” should be mapped to the darkest black of the display , and “ 65536 ” ( or the equivalent ) should be mapped to the whitest white .
If you want to represent images that contain brightnesses beyond what your monitor can currently display ( e.g. as produced by HDRShop ) , you need to look elsewhere .
The most exciting HDR image format today is OpenEXR , developed by Industrial Light & Magic .
I say this partly because their documentation includes photos from Star Wars ( see above ) .
But it also supports both 16 - bit and 32 - bit float representations , lossy and lossless codecs , and has a great definition for underage and overage .
Other examples of High Dynamic Range formats include SGI ’s TIFF LogLuv format , Floating Point TIFF format , Radiance ’s RGBE format , and Portable Float Maps ( PFMs ) .
HDR image formats are especially significant for archival and stock uses , since they store data with enough precision to record what we can see , rather than what our displays can show .
There are a range of proprietary formats that offer medium or high dynamic range .
The various RAW formats support whatever dynamic range the underlying device associated with the RAW file uses .
Personally , I am not a fan of RAW formats for long term image stoage , since they are too device and vendor specific .
However , that ’s a whole other debate .
I do n’t yet know if OpenEXR will become a consumer standard , or if it will remain a file format used only by Hollywood .
Microsoft , Apple , Adobe , Canon and others will no doubt have a big hand in shaping that decision .
Editing
Of all imaging tasks , editing is the one that demands the highest dynamic range .
Editing operations need high precision to avoid aliasing artifacts such as banding and jaggies .
Audio professionals know this .
Editing tools like ProTools already use 48 bits per sample internally , even though the common CD output format only supports 16 .
Why should we image makers accept anything less ?
Recently , Adobe announced supports for 32 - bit - per - channel HDR images in Photoshop CS2 , a great step forward .
Idruna Software is another company doing interesting HDR software .
I played with their PhotogenicsHDR when it first came out , but I found it a little hard to use .
Perhaps the newest PocketPC version is different …
Photoshop users are familiar with the issues of low dynamic range today .
With 8 bit channels , if you brighten an image , information is lost irretrievably : darkening the image after brightening does not restore the original appearance .
Instead , all of the highlights appear flat and washed out .
To avoid this problem , you must work in a carefully planned workflow .
With a true HDR tool , if you brighten an image and then darken it , you should see something very close to the original image .
True HDR editing tools will enable image workers to follow a much more flexible and simplified workflow , using fewer adjustment layers , with fewer aliasing artifacts .
I expect HDR software will lead to increases in productivity and greater expressiveness .
It will take the imaging software industry some time to retool and retrain .
There are plenty of unsolved issues .
With HDR , for example , you run into the issue of representing brightness values present in the image but beyond what your current monitor can show .
Do you clamp to the monitor ’s gamut , show zembra stripes , map the colors some other way ?
Another issue is how to create graphical user interfaces for HDR editing .
Many designers are familiar with the RGB 0 - 255 color values , and can type in RGB color numbers directly using this system .
e.g. 128,128,128 is a mid gray .
But what happens when intensities go from 0 to several million ?
Where is mid gray ?
And how do you represent that in a graphical interface ?
If the tonal range goes from 0 to something close to the brightness of the sun , where is “ white ” on that scale ?
Do you mean monitor white , paper white , 3200 k white , 5600 k white …?
A third unsolved issue is image size :
If each channel of an image is 32 instead of 8 bits , the image becomes four times larger .
Switching to HDR therefore makes a 100 mb image take up 400 mb .
Not surprisingly , editing operations take about four times longer .
Software will need to become smarter about scheduling work .
Live Picture , an early image compositing tool , did a good job of this , but is no longer available .
I expect to see a revival of these techniques as people grapple with 10 GB images .
Tone Mapping
Most LCD / CRT displays ( and of course printed paper ) have low dynamic range .
So if you want to output an HDR image on paper or on a display , you must somehow convert the wide intensity range in the image to the lower range supported by the display .
This process is called tone mapping .
One old tone - mapping method is the manual dodge - and - burn technique familiar to photographers – where you manually select different tonal ranges for different regions of the image , using a dodging or a burning tool .
HDR software will of course support manual dodge and burn .
Another solution is to use an automated tone mapping filter to reduce the dynamic range of an HDR image .
There are already several filters to choose from .
The left image above shows what you get if you display Paul Debevec ’s HDR photo of Stanford Memorial Church using a very basic tone mapping technique ( simply clamping to the nearest available color on the monitor ) .
Some areas of the image are “ blown out ” , and the shadow areas are muddy and lack detail .
The right image show ’s Fattal , Lischinkski , and Werman ’s tone mapping algorithm , which uses a more sophisticated adaptive approach – you see more details in the shadows and the highlights ( look at the stained glass windows ) , though the image also has a somewhat “ flat ” or “ computerish ” quality .
Tone mapping is a hot area of research in computer graphics .
As with HDR file formats , there is currently no clear winner .
Several techniques are listed in the resource section .
I expect the major companies to each champion their own tone - mapping technologies in service bureaus and print finishing .
Output
Over the past decade , display companies have steadily improved the dynamic range of LCD and DLP displays .
Today many digital displays have a 2000: 1 dynamic range , unheard of ten years ago .
This trend of increasing dynamic range will continue .
A few displays available today indicate where the market is going .
The most astonishing is the BrightSide HDR display with a claimed contrast ratio of 60,000:1 , good enough to reproduce the effect of a sunlit scene .
They achieve this using high - power white LEDs .
The only bad thing about the BrightSide display is that once you look at it for a few minutes you just assume that this is how images are supposed to look – it is such a transparently great technology that until you see a normal image on a normal display you do n’t really think of the HDR display as that exciting .
The display is still in the very - expensive bracket , but this will change quickly .
Of course , HDR displays work best if you have lots of HDR images .
I anticipate a huge market for stock HDR imagery .
See the Flickr HDR group for starters .
Applications
Today , the main users of HDR imaging devices are specialized professionals working in the film , animation and VR industries .
Some applications are listed below ( see the Resources page for links ) .
Film – Tools such as HDRShop by Paul Debevec enable you to convert a series of photographs into a light probe – a special image that represents the lighting environment in a room .
You can then use the light probe to light virtual objects , so that the virtual objects actually appear to be lit by the light from the room .
This technique is especially useful for compositing computer graphic objects into images of real scenes .
Hollywood films use light maps extensively to blend CGI into a scene .
Panoramas – Another use for HDR is in panoramic images .
Panoramas often have a wide dynamic range , e.g. one part of the panorama may contain the sun , another part may be in deep shadow .
Online web panoramas constructed from HDR images look much better than non-HDR equivalents .
Games – A third use for HDR is in computer games .
Recent computer graphics cards support HDR texture maps .
With HDR texture maps , you can render objects using light probes , in real time , yielding much more dynamic and interesting lighting effects .
“ High Dynamic Range Lighting Effects ” are now all the range in high - end games .
As more consumer - oriented HDR products arrive , I believe the largest application of HDR will be in consumer photography , though the term HDR is unlikely to be seen – instead you will see branding terminology , e.g. companies will make up words like “ DynaChrome ” , “ MaxBright ” , “ SuperColor ” etc .
Do we really need HDR ?
I recently read this comment from Sam Berry :
… the whole article has no mention of the fact that the reason most controlled lighting is almost always done to ratio of less than 8:1 even with neg film / modern digital capable of much more is because that ’s what looks good .
HDR technology now means you can reproduce your harsh midday sunlit scene perfectly , and it will look identically awful compared to the original .
The debate boils down to this :
Does an image with a 300:1 dynamic range look good because it represents a physical sweetspot — something to do with our perceptual system that works well at that ratio ?
Or is it that all we ’ve had access to for hundreds of years are reflective images with a roughly 300:1 dynamic range , so we are accustomed to that ?
I had a similar question in my mind before seeing the BrightSide HDR display .
Now , after looking at a HDR image on a 50,000:1 HDR display , I am no longer concerned about over - brightness , 50,000: 1 is still way less than the brightness of looking directly at the sun .
It was n’t blinding .
It is n’t a question of harsh .
Images simply looks better when they look more real .
In the coming decade , HDR digital imaging technology will arrive , and change how we take , manipulate , store , use and display images forever .

HDR Tutorial ( Photomatix ) ( English )
This is a basic , standard , step by step tutorial of how to make an HDR Image .
( Note : this tutorial is based on building an HDR image from 7 differents shots .
My camara does n’t shoot RAW .
More on building an HDR image from a single RAW file , soon ! )
The materials for this process are as follows :
Hardware :
* Digital Camera ( Obvius , but hey you never know )
* Tripod
Software :
* Photomatix ( used for Generating HDR and Tone Mapping )
* Photoshop CS2 .
( But for this tutorial any version of Photoshop will do .
We ’ll be using it for retouching only )
Ok , let ’s get going !
Taking the pictures :
Put your camera in the tripod .
Place it firmly because you ’ll have to touch the camera to change the speed and this can make you move it , and then , well you wont be able to get the HDR you were hoping for .
After selecting the subject you wish to shoot , prepare everything as if you were only going to take one picture .
Prepare it to your taste or what ever is you want to acomplish .
Set your primary exposure and speed .
We are going to call this master setting 0 .
After this is complete and you have everything set up you are going to take let ’s say 7 pictures :
3 pictures up from 0 and 3 pictures down .
Dude what do you mean ??
Do n’t panic is quite easy :
If the settings for picture 0 is : 1/125 and f/4.5
The settings for the remaining pictures are as follows :
* Picture +3 : 1/250 f/4.5
* Picture +2 : 1/200 f/4.5
* Picture +1 : 1/160 f/4.5
* Picture 0 : 1/125 f/4.5 ( YOUR MASTER SETTING )
* Picture - 1 : 1/100 f/4.5
* Picture - 2 : 1/80 f/4.5
* Picture - 3 : 1/60 f/4.5
You ’ve may noticed that the F/ stays the same .
This is quite simple : if that value changes also will you Depth of Field which will cause you focus to change also .
Now that you have taken all your pictures is time to go and kick some Photomatix but !
Ok , so you got to your computer , opened up Photomatix , and oh well you have no idea what to do .
No problem becouse this part of the process has litle pictures in it , so you wont have any excuse not to make HDR pictures !!
Photomatix :
Open Photomatix and look for the HDRI tab .
Click on it .
After you will see GENERATE HDR .
Go ahead click some more .
When you do that something like this comes up :
Now you click on the BROWSE button and select the pictures you want :
After you you click the SELECT button a screen like this come along :
Ok .
Now your pictures are selected and you click OK .
Now you have to choices : to Align Input Images or not to let the software do it .
I personally always let the software do it .
Is up to you :
Now you ’ll get this screen .
Depending on you computer memory this may take a while , but not to long .
I ’ve notice that when one of the picture is to dark or to bright , in Auto Align , Photomatix has a hard time aligning the images .
I usually cancel and deselect the image I think is causing the problem :
If everything is ok , this should come up :
After Photomatix is done , it shows you your new Generated HDR Image :
But you want it like does cool ones out there !
Wait , there ’s more : ToneMapping !
Now you go to the HDRI tab and select Tone Mapping .
Here is where the fun begins !
The first thing you may notice is the difference in the picture .
Here you have 7 important options :
Luminosity
Strength
Color Saturation
White Clip
Black Clip
Smoothing
MicroContrast
I could go on and explain what all those sliders and buttons do , but we ’ll do something better :
You try !
Move them up , down , put some more here , take some less there .
The idea is for you to experience it for yourself .
Trust me , is really fun that way !
So after moving around the sliders i get to a point where i like the results :
I go click on OK , and we go back to the first screen but with the final version of the photo :
Now i want to take it to Photoshop for aditional retouching but first i have to save it .
I preffer TIFF format :
Choose your name , location and format :
Now go open Photoshop , and open the TIFF you just saved :
Now go to the IMAGE tab , ADJUSTMENTS .
Now you have to play and have fun with each and every other option in there .
Try everything and if you do something you do n’t like , do n’t worry UNDO !
( Also play with some filters , they can help to ! )
After playing a litle bit , i got to this point which i like :
Now save it again in any format you like .
I always save them on TIFF :
Voila !
Your first HDR Image .
Kind a cool , insn’t ?

HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE PHOTOGRAPHY
High dynamic range ( HDR ) images enable photographers to record a greater range of tonal detail than a given camera could capture in a single photo .
This opens up a whole new set of lighting possibilities which one might have previously avoided — for purely technical reasons .
The new “ merge to HDR ” feature of Photoshop CS2 allows the photographer to combine a series of bracketed exposures into a single image which encompasses the tonal detail of the entire series .
There is no free lunch however ; trying to broaden the tonal range will inevitably come at the expense of decreased contrast in some tones .
Learning to use the merge to HDR feature in Photoshop CS2 can help you make the most of your dynamic range under tricky lighting — while still balancing this trade - off with contrast .
MOTIVATION : THE DYNAMIC RANGE DILEMMA
As digital sensors attain progressively higher resolutions , and thereby successively smaller pixel sizes , the one quality of an image which does not benefit is its dynamic range .
This is particularly apparent in compact cameras with resolutions near 8 megapixels , as these are more susceptible than ever to blow highlights or noisy shadow detail .
Further , some scenes simply contain a greater brightness range than can be captured by current digital cameras– of any type .
The “ bright side ” is that nearly any camera can actually capture a vast dynamic range– just not in a single photo .
By varying the shutter speed alone , most digital cameras can change how much light they let in by a factor of 50,000 or more .
High dynamic range imaging attempts to utilize this characteristic by creating images composed of multiple exposures , which can far surpass the dynamic range of a single exposure .
WHEN TO USE HDR IMAGES
I would suggest only using HDR images when the scene ’s brightness distribution can no longer be easily blended using a graduated neutral density ( GND ) filter .
This is because GND filters extend dynamic range while still maintaining local contrast .
Scenes which are ideally suited for GND filters are those with simple lighting geometries , such as the linear blend from dark to light encountered commonly in landscape photography ( corresponding to the relatively dark land transitioning into bright sky ) .
In contrast , a scene whose brightness distribution is no longer easily blended using a GND filter is the doorway scene shown below .
Brightness Distribution Underexposure Overexposure
We note that the above scene contains roughly three tonal regions with abrupt transitions at their edges– therefore requiring a custom - made GND filter .
If we were to look at this in person , we would be able to discern detail both inside and outside the doorway , because our eyes would adjust to changing brightness .
The goal of HDR use in this article is to better approximate what we would see with our own eyes through the use of a technique called tonal mapping .
INNER WORKINGS OF AN HDR FILE
Photoshop creates an HDR file by using the EXIF information from each of your bracketed images to determine their shutter speed , aperture and ISO settings .
It then uses this information to assess how much light came from each image region .
Since this light may vary greatly in its intensity , Photoshop creates the HDR file using 32 - bits to describe each color channel ( as opposed to the usual 16 or 8 - bits , as discussed in the tutorial on “ Understanding Bit Depth “ ) .
The real benefit is that HDR files use these extra bits to create a relatively open - ended brightness scale , which can adjust to fit the needs of your image .
The important distinction is that these extra bits are used differently than the extra bits in 16 - bit images , which instead just define tones more precisely ( see tutorials on the “ RAW File Format ” and “ Posterization “ ) .
We refer to the usual 8 and 16 - bit files as being low dynamic range ( LDR ) images , relatively speaking .
The 32 - bit HDR file format describes a greater dynamic range by using its bits to specify floating point numbers , also referred to as exponential notation .
A floating point number is represented by a fractional numerical value raised to some power of 10 , such as 5.467×103 , as opposed to the usual 0 - 255 ( for 8 - bit ) or 0-65535 ( for 16 - bit ) integer color specifications .
This way , an image file can specify a brightness of 4,300,000,000 simply as 4.3x109 , which would be too large even with 32 - bit integers .
We see that the floating point notation certainly looks neater and more concise , but how does this help a computer ?
Why not just keep adding more bits to specify successively larger numbers , and therefore a larger dynamic range ?
Recall that for ordinary LDR files , far more bits are used to distinguish lighter tones than darker tones ( from the tutorial on gamma correction , tonal levels and exposure – to be added ) .
As a result , as more bits are added , an exponentially greater fraction of these bits are used to specify color more precisely , instead of extending dynamic range .
The more closely spaced bits for brighter values is a result of the fact that ordinary 8 and 16 - bit JPEG files are gamma - encoded , which can actually help increase dynamic range for low - bit files ; gamma - encoding just becomes more and more inefficient as the bit depth increases .
HDR files get around this LDR dilemma of diminishing returns by using floating point numbers which are proportional to the actual brightness values of the subject matter ( gamma equals one , or linear ) .
This ensures that bits are equally spaced throughout the dynamic range , and not just concentrated in the brighter tones– allowing for greater bit efficiency .
Further , the use of floating point numbers ensure that all tones are recorded with the same relative precision , since the base ( mantissa ) in numbers such as 2.576×103 and 8.924×109 each have the same number of significant figures ( four ) , even though the second number is more than a million times larger .
Note : just as how using high bit depth images do not necessarily mean your image contains more color , a high dynamic range file does not guarantee greater dynamic range unless this is also present in the actual subject matter .
All of these extra bits provided by the HDR format are great , and effectively allow for a nearly infinite brightness range to be described .
The problem is that your computer display ( or the final photographic print ) can only show a fixed brightness scale .
This tutorial therefore focuses on how to create and convert HDR files into an ordinary 8 or 16 - bit image , which can be displayed on a monitor , or will look great as a photographic print .
This process is also commonly referred to as tonal mapping .
IN - FIELD PREPARATION
Since creating a HDR image requires capturing a series of identically - positioned exposures , a sturdy tripod is essential .
Photoshop has a feature which attempts to align the images when the camera may have moved between shots , however best results are achieved when this is not relied upon .
Make sure to take at least three exposures , although five or more is recommended for optimum accuracy .
More exposures allow the HDR algorithm to better approximate how your camera translates light into digital values ( a.k.a. the digital sensor ’s response curve ) – creating a more even tonal distribution .
The doorway example is best - suited with several intermediate exposures , in addition to the two shown previously .
Reference - 1 Stops - 2 Stops - 3 Stops
It is essential that the darkest of these exposures includes no blown highlights in areas where you want to capture detail .
The darkest exposure should show the darkest regions of the image with enough brightness that they are relatively noise - free and clearly visible .
Each exposure should be separated by one to two stops , and these are ideally set by varying the shutter speed ( as opposed to aperture or ISO speed ) .
Recall that each “ stop ” refers to a doubling ( +1 stop ) or halving ( - 1 stop ) of the light captured from an exposure .
We also note another disadvantage of HDR images : they require relatively static subject matter , due to the necessity of several separate exposures .
Our previous ocean sunset example would therefore not be well - suited for the HDR technique , as the waves would have moved significantly between each exposure .
CREATING A 32 - BIT HDR FILE IN PHOTOSHOP CS2
Here we use Adobe Photoshop CS2 to convert the sequence of exposures into a single image , which uses tonal mapping to approximate what we would see with our eye .
Before tonal mapping can be performed , we first need to combine all exposures into a single 32 - bit HDR file .
Open the HDR tool ( File > Automate > Merge to HDR … ) , and load all photographs in the exposure sequence ; for this example it would be the four images shown in the previous section .
If your images were not taken on a stable tripod , this step may require checking “ Attempt to Automatically Align Source Images ” ( which greatly increases processing time ) .
After pressing OK , you will soon see a “ Computing Camera Response Curves ” message .
Once your computer has stopped processing , it will show a window with their combined histogram .
Photoshop has estimated the white point , but this value often clips the highlights .
You may wish to move the white point slider to the rightmost edge of the histogram peaks in order to see all highlight detail .
This value is for preview purposes only and will require setting more precisely later .
After pressing OK , this leaves you with a 32 - bit HDR image , which can now be saved if required .
Note how the image may still appear quite dark ; only once it has been converted into a 16 or 8 - bit image ( using tonal mapping ) will it begin to look more like the desired result .
At this stage , very few image processing functions can be applied to a 32 - bit HDR file , so it is of little use other than for archival purposes .
One function which is available is exposure adjustment ( Image > Adjustments > Exposure ) .
You may wish to try increasing the exposure to see any hidden shadow detail , or decreasing the exposure to see any hidden highlight detail .
USING HDR TONAL MAPPING IN PHOTOSHOP CS2
Here we use Adobe Photoshop CS2 to convert the 32 - bit HDR image into a 16 or 8 - bit LDR file using tonal mapping .
This requires interpretive decisions about the type of tonal mapping , depending on the subject matter and brightness distribution within the photograph .
Convert into a regular 16 - bit image ( Image > Mode > 16 Bits / Channel… ) and you will see the HDR Conversion tool .
The tonal mapping method can be chosen from one of four options , described below .
Exposure and Gamma
This method lets you manually adjust the exposure and gamma , which serve as the equivalent to brightness and contrast adjustment , respectively .
Highlight Compression
This method has no options and applies a custom tonal curve , which greatly reduces highlight contrast in order to brighten and restore contrast in the rest of the image .
Equalize Histogram
This method attempts to redistribute the HDR histogram into the contrast range of a normal 16 or 8 - bit image .
This uses a custom tonal curve which spreads out histogram peaks so that the histogram becomes more homogenous .
It generally works best for image histograms which have several relatively narrow peaks with no pixels in between .
Local Adaptation
This is the most flexible method and probably the one which is of most use to photographers .
Unlike the other three methods , this one changes how much it brightens or darkens regions on a per-pixel basis ( similar to local contrast enhancement ) .
This has the effect of tricking the eye into thinking that the image has more contrast , which is often critical in contrast - deprived HDR images .
This method also allows changing the tonal curve to better suit the image .
Before using any of the above methods , one may first wish to set the black and white points on the image histogram sliders ( see “ Using Levels in Photoshop ” for a background on this concept ) .
Click on the double arrow next to “ Toning Curve and Histogram ” to show the image histogram and sliders .
The remainder of this tutorial focuses on settings related to the “ local adaptation ” method , as this is likely the most-used , and provides the greatest degree of flexibility .
CONCEPT : TONAL HIERARCHY & IMAGE CONTRAST
In contrast to the other three conversion methods , the local adaptation method does not necessarily retain the overall hierarchy of tones .
It translates pixel intensities not just with a single tonal curve , but instead also based on the surrounding pixel values .
This means that unlike using a tonal curve , tones on the histogram are not just stretched and compressed , but may instead cross positions .
Visually , this would mean that some part of the subject matter which was initially darker than some other part could later acquire the same brightness or become lighter than that other part– if even by a small amount .
Underexposed Photo Overexposed Photo Final Composite that Violates Large - Scale Tonal Hierarchy
A clear example where global tonal hierarchy is not violated is the example used in the page on using a GND to extend dynamic range ( although this is not how local adaptation works ) .
In this example , even though the foreground sea foam and rock reflections are actually darker than the distant ocean surface , the final image renders the distant ocean as being darker .
The key concept here is that over larger image regions our eyes adjust to changing brightness ( such as looking up at a bright sky ) , while over smaller distances our eyes do not .
Mimicking this characteristic of vision can be thought of as a goal of the local adaptive method– particularly for brightness distributions which are more complex than the simple vertical blend in the ocean sunset above .
An example of a more complex brightness distribution is shown below for three statue images .
We refer to contrast over larger image distances as global contrast , whereas contrast changes over smaller image distances are termed local contrast .
The local adaptation method attempts to maintain local contrast , while decreasing global contrast ( similar to that performed with the ocean sunset example ) .
The above example illustrates visually how local and global contrast impact an image .
Note how the large - scale ( global ) patches of light and dark are exaggerated for the case of high global contrast .
Conversely , for the case of low global contrast the front of the statue ’s face is virtually the same brightness as it ’s side .
The original image looks fine since all tonal regions are clearly visible , and shown with sufficient contrast to give it a three - dimensional appearance .
Now imagine that we started with the middle image , which would be an ideal candidate for HDR conversion .
Tonal mapping using local adaptation would likely produce an image similar to the far right image ( although perhaps not as exaggerated ) , since it retains local contrast while still decreasing global contrast ( thereby retaining texture in the darkest and lightest regions ) .
HDR CONVERSION USING LOCAL ADAPTATION
The distance which distinguishes between local and global contrast is set using the radius value .
Radius and threshold are similar to the settings for an unsharp mask used for local contrast enhancement .
A high threshold improves local contrast , but also risks inducing halo artifacts , whereas too low of a radius can make the image appear washed out .
For any given image , it is recommended to adjust each of these to see their effect , since their ideal combination varies depending on image content .
In addition to the radius and threshold values , images almost always require adjustments to the tonal curve .
This technique is identical to that described in the Photoshop curves tutorial , where small and gradual changes in the curve ’s slope are nearly always ideal .
This curve is shown for our doorway example below , yielding the final result .
HDR images which have been converted into 8 or 16 - bit often require touching up in order to improve their color accuracy .
Subtle use of levels and saturation can drastically improve problem areas in the image .
In general , regions which have increased in contrast ( a large slope in the tonal curve ) will exhibit an increase in color saturation , whereas the opposite occurs for a decrease in contrast .
Changes in saturation may sometimes be desirable when brightening shadows , but in most other instances this should be avoided .
The main problem with the local adaptation method is that it cannot distinguish between incident and reflected light .
As a result , it may unnecessarily darken naturally white textures and brighten darker ones .
Be aware of this when choosing the radius and threshold settings so that this effect can be minimized .
TIP : USING HDR TO REDUCE SHADOW NOISE
Even if your scene does not require more dynamic range , your final photo may still improve from a side benefit : decreased shadow noise .
Ever noticed how digital images always have more noise in the shadows than in brighter tones ?
This is because the image ’s signal to noise ratio is higher where the image has collected more of a light signal .
You can take advantage of this by combining a properly exposed image with one which has been overexposed .
Photoshop always uses the most exposed image to represent a given tone — thereby collecting more light in the shadow detail ( but without overexposing ) .
RECOMMENDATIONS
Keep in mind that HDR images are extremely new– particularly in the field of digital photography .
Existing tools are therefore likely to improve significantly ; there is currently , and may never be , an automated single - step process which converts all HDR images into those which look pleasing on screen , or in a print .
Good HDR conversions therefore require significant work and experimentation in order to achieve realistic and pleasing final images .
Additionally , incorrectly converted or problematic HDR images may appear washed out after conversion .
While re-investigating the conversion settings is recommended as the first corrective step , touch - up with local contrast enhancement may also yield a more pleasing result .
As with all new tools , be careful not to overdo their use .
Use care when violating the image ’s original tonal hierarchy ; do not expect deep shadows to become nearly as light as a bright sky .
In our doorway example , the sunlit building and sky are the brightest objects , and they stayed that way in our final image .
Overdoing editing during HDR conversion easily can cause the image to lose its sense of realism .
Furthermore , HDR should only be used when necessary ; best results can always be achieved by having good lighting to begin with .

Mr Carter 's book charters Middle East peacemaking since the 1970s
In an interview broadcast on Israel Radio , Mr Carter focused on roads built exclusively for Jewish settlements .
In South Africa , blacks were not prevented from " using or even crossing " roads , as in the West Bank , he said .
Mr Carter is promoting his latest book on the Middle East conflict , which has been condemned by pro-Israeli groups .
Correspondents say the book , Palestine : Peace Not Apartheid , blames all sides for not seizing the opportunity of the Camp David peace process in the late 1970s .
But Mr Carter is most critical of Israeli policies , and the book has provoked an outcry among pro-Israeli groups in the US .
Peace broker
" Israel does occupy this territory deep within the West Bank , and connects 200 - or - so settlements ... with a road , and then prohibits the Palestinians from using that road , or in many cases even crossing the road .
The greatest commitment in my life has been trying to bring peace to Israel
Jimmy Carter
" This perpetrates even worse instances of apartness , or apartheid , than we witnessed even in South Africa , " Mr Carter said .
He added that the book was intended to stimulate debate in the US - Israel 's closest political ally - where he said Israeli policies are seldom questioned .
Jewish groups in the US have petitioned against his use of the word " apartheid " - the system which underpinned white minority rule - to describe Israel 's treatment of Palestinians .
In other interviews , Mr Carter - whose Camp David summits helped end the decades - old conflict between Egypt and Israel - has rejected accusations of anti-Semitism which some critics have levelled at him .
" The greatest commitment in my life has been trying to bring peace to Israel , " Mr Carter said last week .
But he said Israel would never have peace until it withdrew from the territories which it has occupied since the 1967 Arab - Israeli war .
As whistleblower Sibel Edmonds asks the U.S. Supreme Court to review her dismissed case against the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , the mainstream media continues to refer to the government ’s defense  the so - called state secrets privilege  as " rarely used . "
In fact , it has been used over 60 times since its creation in the 1950s .
The state secrets privilege is a series of U.S. legal precedents allowing the federal government to dismiss legal cases that it claims would threaten foreign policy , military intelligence , or national security .
A relic of the Cold War with the then - Soviet Union , it has been invoked several times since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon .
Judges have denied the privilege on only five occasions .
It was used against Sibel Edmonds , a former FBI translator , who was fired in retaliation for reporting security breaches and possible espionage within the Bureau .
Lower courts dismissed the case when former Attorney General John Ashcroft invoked the state secrets privilege .
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , which has filed a friend - of - the - court brief in the Edmonds case , says there is an " acute " need for clarification of the state secrets doctrine " because the government is increasingly using the privilege to cover up its own wrongdoing and to keep legitimate cases out of court . "
The first case in which the state secrets privilege was invoked came in 1953 .
Widows of airmen killed in the crash of a military aircraft sued the government for details .
The government claimed that disclosing a military flight accident report would jeopardize secret military equipment and harm national security .
It was not until nearly 50 years later , in 2004 , that it was revealed that the accident report contained no state secrets , but instead confirmed that the cause of the crash was faulty maintenance of the B - 29 fleet .
The state secrets privilege was used again in 2002 in the case of Notra Trulock , who launched a defamation suit against Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee , a Taiwanese - American computer scientist who had been charged with stealing nuclear secrets for China from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico .
President George W. Bush said national security would be compromised if Trulock were allowed to seek damages from Lee .
Though it resulted in the case being dismissed , another suit was launched directly attacking then - FBI Director Louis Freeh for interfering and falsely invoking the state secrets privilege .
Reluctant to go to trial , the government worked out a plea bargain with Lee , who had been imprisoned for 278 days in solitary confinement .
Lee pled guilty to improper handling of classified data and was cleared of all charges relating to espionage .
Lee was arrested in December 1999 and freed in August 2000 .
Judge James A. Parker offered an apology to Lee for what he called " abuse of power " by the federal government .
The government invoked the privilege again in the case of Maher Arar , a Canadian citizen who sought to sue then - Attorney General Ashcroft for his role in rendering Arar to Syria to face torture and extract false confessions .
Former Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey said in legal papers filed at the time that " Litigating [ the ] plaintiff ’s complaint would necessitate disclosure of classified information . "
Arar , who was born in Syria , was detained at New York John F. Kennedy Airport in 2002 , on his way back to Canada from North Africa .
He was held incommunicado by U.S. immigration authorities , and eventually " rendered " to Syria , where he was imprisoned for close to a year and claims he was tortured .
He was released without charges .
The Arar case is being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court , and is also being investigated by an independent Canadian commission , with which the U.S. has refused to cooperate .
Barbara Olshansky , the assistant legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights , which is representing Arar , said that government lawyers " are saying this case ca n’t be tried , and the classified information on which they ’re basing this argument can’t even be shared with the opposing lawyers .
It ’s the height of arrogance  they think they can do anything they want in the name of the global war on terrorism . "
Again , in August 2005 , a federal appeals court affirmed the dismissal of a racial discrimination lawsuit against the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) based on the government ’s invocation of the state secrets privilege .
Jeffrey Sterling , an operations officer with the CIA in its Near East and South Asia Division from 1993 - 2001 , claimed he was told he was " too big and black " to receive certain CIA assignments , and that CIA management placed expectations on him " far above those required of non-African - American Operations Officers . "
He also contended he was retaliated against for using the CIA ’s internal equal employment opportunity process .
However , the court noted , " There is no way for Sterling to prove employment discrimination without exposing at least some classified details of the covert employment that gives context to his claim . "
The privilege was first invoked against Sibel Edmonds to prevent her from testifying that the federal government knew that al - Qaeda intended to use airliners to attack the United States in 2001 .
The case was a $ 100 trillion action filed in 2002 by 600 victims ’ families against officials of the Saudi government and prominent Saudi citizens .
Edmonds , a former Middle Eastern language specialist hired by the FBI shortly after 9/11 , was fired in 2002 and filed a lawsuit later that year challenging the retaliatory dismissal .
An unclassified public report by the Department of Justice inspector general contains much of the information the department now seeks to block .
The report concluded that Edmonds ’ whistleblower allegations were " the most significant factor " in the FBI ’s decision to terminate her .
Steven Aftergood , who heads the Project on Government Secrecy for the American Federation of Scientists , told IPS , " Once rarely invoked , the state secrets privilege is now increasingly used by the government as a ‘ get out of jail free ’ card to block unwanted litigation . "
" The idea that courts cannot handle national security cases involving classified information is simply false , " he said .
" Classified information often figures in criminal espionage cases , and even occasionally in Freedom of Information Act cases .
There are procedures for in camera review , protective orders , nondisclosure agreements , and so on . "
He added , " In the same way , sensitive classified information could be protected in the current cases where the state secrets privilege has been invoked  without shutting down the entire proceeding .
As a society we should be seeking to expand the rule of law , not to carve out more areas where the government is immune to judicial review . "
Angelina Jolie And Brad Pitt Plan Water BirthAngelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are reportedly planning to deliver their first biological child in a giant tub of water .
The movie stars have been looking into birthing possibilities at the Welwitschia Hospital in Namibia , and are keen to go aquatic when Jolie goes into labour .
Iris Wabuto , a nurse at the clinic , says , " It will be natural and beautiful .
" Instead of a man like Brad being pushed into the corner of a labour ward , he will be part of the birth process . "
And the expectant couple have allegedly wasted no time in picking a name for the baby - they have settled on Africa in a tribute to the child 's birthplace .
A friend of Jolie tells British newspaper the Sunday Express , " They know the sex of their baby , though they 're trying to keep that a secret .
But they both think Africa would suit a boy or a girl .
"
It 's exotic and mysterious - just like the continent where the baby will be born " .

In 1999 I flew to the edge of space with the Russian air force , with Space Adventures .
I made it to an altitude of just under 100,000 feet and flew at Mach 3 in a Mig - 25 piloted by one of Russia 's best test - pilots .
These pics were taken by Space Adventures from similar flights to mine .
I did n't take digital stills -- I got the whole flight on digital video , which was featured on the Discovery Channel .
The company website states : " If we receive a letter of order from your government to purchase electricity for 20 years , we will raise all the necessary funds to build the power plant .
Our power plants produce electricity at a cost of 2 cents per kW and cost from $ 650000 / MW to build . "
SDE describes their system as follows : a method of using sea wave motion to generate hydraulic pressure , which is then transformed into electricity .
The system takes advantage of the wave 's speed , height , depth , rise and fall , and the flow beneath the approaching wave , thus producing energy more efficiently and cheaper than both other sea-wave and conventional technologies which require vast amounts of land space .
The system has a potential to produce a net of 38kWh per meter of beachfront occupied ( worldwide average ) .
Manufacturing cost for a 1MW system is from US $ 650 K and production cost is the lowest in the market .
The erection cost of a 1MW S.D.E. station is from $ 650,000 while a comparable station costs $ 1,500,000 from coal , $ 900,000 from natural gas , $ 1,500,000 from solar sources , and $ 3,000,000 from wind .
Using S.D.E. technology , production of electricity is 2 cents , compared to 3 cents from coal , 3.5 cents from natural gas , 12 cents from solar energy ( when is that without subsidies ? ) , and 3.6 cents from wind .
S.D.E. Energy Ltd. is a Tel Aviv , Israel manufacturer and marketer of Sea Wave Power Plants - utilizing sea wave energy to produce electricity economically , and in an environmentally - friendly manner claiming that their system an generate electricity for 2 cents .
Commenting , Shmuel Ovadia , Managing Director of SDE Energy , said : " Our system is built on one side of wave gatherers , which can also serve as breakers .
It is composed of a system of channels of hydraulic oil , whereby the rise of the pistons creates pressure on the hydraulic oil .
The hydraulic oil is accumulated in a pressurized container and is then directed toward a hydraulic motor .
This energy turns an electrical generator , which produces electricity . "
Wikepedia offers this insight as to how the system works : A buoyant metal plate is attached at one side to a concrete seawall .
Waves press the plate up ( in a cantilever action ) and drive an hydraulic ram .
The hydraulic system is connected to a hydroelectric system .
Eight energy modules have been built and tested .
A full - scale oceanfront model was operated in Israel and produced 40 kW/h for 8 months .
According to an undated presentation , available on their website , the next step in their development may be :
Constructing and Operating a Power Station in Ashdod , Israel . –
The power plant is expected to be built within 36 months .
It has been assumed that the power plant will be operated during 75 % of the year with an output of 90 % .
As agreed with the national electric company , the sale price of 1 kW/h will be 5.25 ¢ .
The expected annual revenue from a 10 MW power plant is approx .
$ 3.1 million with a net profit of $ 1.6 million .
The initial investment for a 10 MW power plant is $ 6 million ( including additional expenses ) and ROI within 3 years .
S.D.E. has been granted a license without a tender by the Israeli Ministry of Industry and Trade to build a 50 MW power plant which will operate for 20 years .
According to SDE the expected annual revenue from a 1000 MW power plant operating at 90 % , with output 75 % of the year is approx .
$ 310 Million , and net profit of around $ 160 Million .
The system is designed to return the initial investment within three years .
SDE states that its wave energy technology was developed to provide protection to marinas , beaches , and private property subject to destructive or annoying wave / wake forces together with the utilization of wave energy .
SDE wave energy proposes to use the technology as a " wave filter " in order to reduce the damaging effect of waves on the coast and convert it to energy .
The construction has hydrodynamic and practical advantages as compared to " normal " breakwaters .
Marinas and coastal shores are often subject to the damaging wave and erosionary forces associated with violent storms .
S.D.E.'s development and testing has been approved and partially financed by the Chief Scientist of Israel .
Currently , the company is in late stage negotiations for the sale of power plants , with a projected value of several billion dollars .
S.D.E. is seeking capital investments to construct the plant in Israel , to meet current demand for power plants using S.D.E.'s technology , and for current and future marketing efforts worldwide for this technology .
According to Tree Hugger , SDE is set to build the first wave energy harvesting power plant of its kind in Sri Lanka .
According to a company press release , S.D.E. recently began talks with Sri Lankan officials to construct and install a 200 MW power plant at an estimated cost of $ 130 million .
If negotiations are successful , they say , the plant will be the first of its kind to produce electricity at a commercial quantity from sea waves .
The World Energy Council estimates that 2TW of energy could be harvested from the world ’s oceans , the equivalent of twice the world ’s electricity production .
· In her first interview , Tali Fahima talks of life in jail · Activist says she refused to work for secret service
They said they wanted to teach her to be a " good Jew " as she sat with her arms handcuffed to the legs of her chair for 16 hours a day .
But if Tali Fahima was not prepared to be a good Jew then Shin Bet , the Israeli secret service , was determined to put her in jail for as long as possible regardless of what she did .
Ms Fahima , 30 , was released from jail on Wednesday after serving almost 30 months in jail for travelling to the West Bank , meeting an enemy agent and translating a simple army document .
" My first crime was that I refused to work with Shin Bet , the second was that I insisted on going to see the Palestinians and the third was that I protested against the Israeli policy of assassination , " Ms Fahima told the Guardian in her first interview since her release .
For nine months of her incarceration she was kept in isolation , without access to any distractions such as books or television .
" I used to lie on my bed and think about Jenin , the people I met and wonder how things were going there .
I never get bored on my own , " she said .
Eventually , Ms Fahima was persuaded by her lawyer to agree to a plea bargain which would mean her serving only 10 months more than the 19 she had already served .
It could take as long as a year to be found innocent , she was advised .
She is unbowed by her experience .
" I learnt about the nature of Shin Bet , how they terrorise us , both the Israelis and Palestinians .
I learnt about the nature of the government , how they do not want us to see what is going on in our name , " she said .
Ms Fahima had been an apathetic legal secretary who voted for the rightwing Likud party and carried Israeli prejudices about Palestinians until in 2003 she decided she wanted to understand why the Palestinians were attacking Israel .
She began making regular visits to Jenin , which had been devastated in an Israeli raid earlier that year .
She talked to hundreds of people including Palestinian militants and for the first time heard the Palestinian view of the intifada and the difficulty of life under Israeli occupation .
Her meetings with one militant , Zakaria Zubeidi , stood out .
Zubeidi was the leader of the al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigade in Jenin whose mother and brother had been killed by the Israelis that year .
In countless interviews with journalists , including Israelis , he described how he and his mother had been involved in an Israeli - Palestinian theatre project which was the basis of an internationally - acclaimed Israeli documentary , Arna 's Children .
A week before Ms Fahima was arrested in August 2004 she received a phone call from a Shin Bet agent who inquired how she was finding life without work before inviting her to a meeting at her local police station in Kiryat Gat in the south of Israel .
She decided not to go .
In the month - long interrogation that followed her arrest she was questioned about the people she had met and asked for information which Ms Fahima said she did not have .
During this period Shin Bet agents briefed Israeli journalists she had been having an affair with Zubeidi , who was well known to Israelis from newspaper interviews .
" It was a Shin Bet tactic to make me and him seem bad and to delegitimise us both , " she said , adding that while it was obvious to some that it was malicious , many , including friends , believed it .
When she was finally charged she was accused of translating an army document which apparently detailed an arrest operation that was due to take place .
" In the wake of the explanations of the accused , " read the charge sheet , " Zubeidi later ordered the wanted persons to hide until the conclusion of the military operation and the wanted persons , who carried out Zubeidi 's directive and hid , were not detained . "
The document contains three aerial maps of Jenin , and four photographs of wanted men , including Zubeidi , with a short description of each .
Zubeidi speaks and reads Hebrew after years of work and imprisonment in Israel .

The email from Denmark was only a few lines long .
" It basically said , ' We have an opportunity for you here , but we can't tell you anything until you sign a nondisclosure agreement , " says Steve Hassenplug , a soft - spoken software engineer from Lafayette , Indiana .
The cryptic tone of the email from Lego headquarters hinted at something more than a simple customer survey , but Hassenplug did n't know what .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .

He guessed it had something to do with Mindstorms , Lego 's programmable robotics kit .
After all , he 's a master at assembling the plastic bricks into complex robots , like his wheeled , self - balancing machine dubbed the LegWay , and he 's something of a celebrity in the Mindstorms world .
But there had n't been a Mindstorms update in nearly four years , and rumor had it Lego might abandon the product altogether .
Intrigued , Hassenplug signed the NDA , received a username and password , and was ushered to a secure online forum .
Even there , he found no official information – just an email thread between a few peers : John Barnes , David Schilling , and Ralph Hempel .
Hassenplug knew them well from Brickfest , the annual conference where Lego zealots show off their most elegant creations , from massive starships and richly detailed cathedrals to giant bipedal robots .
The four Mindstorms experts speculated as to why they 'd been tapped and sworn to secrecy .
Lego probably needed beta testers for a Mindstorms update .
After lurking for a few days , Søren Lund , the director of Mindstorms , dropped in on the conversation .
He told the crew that a revamped kit was , in fact , in the works .
But Lego did n't even have a working prototype .
It was way too early for beta testers ; Lego needed a Mindstorms User Panel , or MUP , to help with the design .
" I was surprised they were so early in their development , and I think everyone else was , too , " recalls Barnes , an electronics engineer from Holland Patent , New York .
" We realized that our input was going to be a lot more important than we had imagined . "
Over the next 11 months , right up to the January launch of Mindstorms NXT at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , the four men were de facto Lego employees .
They exchanged countless emails with Lund and his team , reeling off ideas for new sensors , redesigned input ports , and stabilized firmware .
The MUPers also met with Lund at Brickfest in the US and at Lego's Denmark headquarters to hash out specs for the computer that serves as the brain of every Mindstorms creation .
The one key difference between the four panelists and actual Lego staffers : a paycheck .
For their participation , Hassenplug and his cohorts received a few Lego crane sets and Mindstorms NXT prototypes .
They even paid their own airfares to Denmark .
That was fine by Hassenplug .
" Pretty much the comment from all four of us was ' They 're going to talk to us about Legos , and they 're going to pay us with Legos ? ' "
Hassenplug says .
" ' They actually want our opinion ? '
It does n't get much better than that . "
Such loyalty is n't unusual among the fanboys who 've swooned over Mindstorms since its 1998 debut .
Four years after its release , version 2.0 still sells 40,000 units a year at $ 199 a pop – with no advertising – and has become Lego 's all - time best - selling product .
The market is almost evenly split between parents buying the kit for their budding engineers and grown - up geeks who build Mindstorms robots that can scale walls , solve Rubik 's Cubes , or pick blue M&Ms out of a pile .
The kit , due in stores in August , looks nothing like 2.0 and is n't backward compatible .
Users still program the bots from their PCs , but everything else about the experience has been changed .
The centerpiece of a Mindstorms kit is the RCX brick , which acts as the robot 's brain .
It receives input from sensors and sends instructions to motors , breathing life into plastic - block creatures .
The new brain has a 32 - bit processor – a huge upgrade over the old 8 - bit processor – allowing NXT bots to perform more - complex tasks than their predecessors , like ambling with a near - human gait or reacting to voice commands .
The chunky yellow brick in the old kit – which looked like SpongeBob SquarePants – is gone , replaced by a gray rectangle that could be the love child of an iPod and a first - gen Gameboy .
The programming language has been revamped , as have the sensors , motors , and I /O ports .
As a result , Mindstorms NXT robots look and act far more realistic than their predecessors .
But the boldest part of the Mindstorms overhaul is Lego 's decision to outsource its innovation to a panel of citizen developers .
Relying on the MUP is a gamble that Lego hopes will lead not only to a better product but also to a tighter , more trusting bond between corporation and customer .
Let me borrow your tools there , " Lund says , reaching across the table and motioning toward my pen and notebook .
We 're talking Mindstorms over beers and bland Danish food at the Hotel Legoland , steps from the company 's modest offices in the sleepy town of Billund , Denmark .
Lund , 37 , speaks English at a lightning clip .
He 's been trying to explain how NXT pieces will differ from those in the 2.0 kit .
He 's now decided to illustrate the point .
I slide my notebook over to him , and he begins drawing the classic Lego block , the so - called two - by - four that was used in Mindstorms 2.0 .
Then he draws a piece from the new Technic line , a flattened tube pocked with holes – what enthusiasts call a " studless Lego . "
They 'll be included in the NXT kit .
Connected by tiny rods , the Technic pieces give the robots a sleeker , less boxy look .
" We wanted to create robots with more personality , " Lund says .
" We wanted them to go from being more mechanical to more human . "
Lego also wanted to create buzz with its new product , and that meant doing more than just freshening up the last version .
In early 2004 , when the company hatched the idea of a new Mindstorms , it was coming off its worst year ever – a $ 238 million loss in fiscal 2003 .
There were plenty of strategic blunders behind the dismal results : a misguided foray into making PC software games , expensive licensing arrangements ( chiefly with Disney ) , and designs that puzzled rather than entertained .
" We had started to make fire trucks that look like spaceships , building systems that no customer could truly appreciate , " says Mads Nipper , a Lego senior vice president .
" We had to clean that up . "
Cleaning up meant ditching the software division , halving development times , and slashing product lines to reduce the number of unique pieces being manufactured in Billund from 12,400 to around 7,000 .
Meanwhile , Mindstorms was in limbo .
The RCX bricks are expensive to manufacture , and Lego 's specialty is toys , not electronics .
But sales were still strong , and the company was enjoying good publicity from the First Lego League , a program in which teams of schoolchildren compete to build the best robot .
All told , Lego officials say that nearly 1 million Mindstorms units have reached the market , a figure that includes retail sales and giveaways .
So Lego asked Lund to come up with a new version that would attract as much attention as the original , which sold 80,000 in its first three months back in 1998 .
Instead of cobbling together a 3.0 version , Lund decided to make a clean break with the past .
Mindstorms ' main flaw , he believed , was its complexity ; many kids lost interest before completing their first robot .
( The complexity had another unintended effect – Lego ended up with far more adult users than it originally anticipated .
One company survey from 1999 found that 70 percent of Mindstorms users were adults . )
Lund wanted novices to be able to construct and program a robot in 20 minutes .
The biggest barrier to making that happen was the Mindstorms programming language , known as RCX - code .
Though simple by computer science standards , it was too frustrating for many programming neophytes .
The drag - and - drop commands – green shapes labeled with instructions like " Set direction " or " Set AC power 8 " – could be confusing to link together and made it hard to program a bot to do anything more than move forward or backward .
But Lego did n't have the expertise to write more intuitive software in house , so Lund turned to National Instruments , an Austin , Texas , programming firm that specializes in creating user - friendly coding tools .
Hiring outside help was a change for Lego , a family - owned company that has historically kept its own counsel .
Sometimes it takes a nine - figure loss to convince management to rethink its insularity .
National Instruments designed a programming system made up of intuitive icons ( like a microphone to represent the kit 's sound sensor ) .
" I call it Photoshop for robotics , or goofware , " says Paal Smith - Meyer , a Lego creative director .
" You just look at it and you know where to start , and you know how to goof around and have fun with it . "
The Mindstorms team tested the new language by asking the members of Lego 's executive board to play with an NXT prototype .
" We created a robot in 20 minutes , " Nipper says .
With RCX - code , he admits , " it would have taken an hour , at least . "
From combing the Mindstorms tech support logs , Lund knew that the most frequent complaint , by a wide margin , was the fickleness of the infrared tower , a black box that sends programming instructions from a PC to the robot 's RCX .
So Lund ditched infrared in favor of a USB 2.0 connection .
His team also toyed with the idea of adding a camera so robots could be programmed to snap pictures .
But they decided against it because it would mean exceeding the $ 249 price tag target for the NXT kit .
Instead , the company added Bluetooth , allowing Mindstorms bots to be linked to – and even controlled by – camera phones .
Within weeks of the original Mindstorms debut , a Stanford graduate student named Kekoa Proudfoot reverse engineered the RCX brick and posted all of his findings , including detailed information on the brick 's underlying firmware , online .
Several other engineers quickly used Proudfoot 's revelations to design their own Mindstorms tools , including an open source operating system ( LegOS ) and a C - like programming alternative to RCX - code ( Not Quite C , or NQC ) .
Lego's Danish brain trust soon realized that their proprietary code was loose on the Internet and debated how best to handle the hackers .
" We have a pretty eager legal team , and protecting our IP is very high on its agenda , " Nipper says .
Some Lego executives worried that the hackers might cannibalize the market for future Mindstorms accessories or confuse potential customers looking for authorized Lego products .
After a few months of wait - and - see , Lego concluded that limiting creativity was contrary to its mission of encouraging exploration and ingenuity .
Besides , the hackers were providing a valuable service .
" We came to understand that this is a great way to make the product more exciting , " Nipper says .
" It 's a totally different business paradigm – although they do n't get paid for it , they enhance the experience you can have with the basic Mindstorms set . "
Rather than send out cease and desist letters , Lego decided to let the modders flourish ; it even wrote a " right to hack " into the Mindstorms software license , giving hobbyists explicit permission to let their imaginations run wild .
Soon , dozens of Web sites were hosting third - party programs that helped Mindstorms users build robots that Lego had never dreamed of : soda machines , blackjack dealers , even toilet scrubbers .
Hardware mavens designed sensors that were far more sophisticated than the touch and light sensors included in the factory kit .
More than 40 Mindstorms guidebooks provided step - by - step strategies for tweaking performance out of the kit 's 727 parts .
Lego 's decision to tap this culture of innovation was a natural extension of its efforts over the past few years to connect customers to the company .
On Lego 's Web site , for example , fans can purchase online - exclusive sets and sign up for Lego 's Internet club , which offers perks like a magazine filled with DIY projects , members - only kits , and a ticket to the Legoland theme park in Southern California .
For those looking to further express their creativity , the company introduced Lego Factory , a customization program that lets users design , upload , and purchase their own unique Lego creation .
The MUP would push this cooperative model even further – giving a few stellar Mindstorms users the opportunity to help develop sets for the world .
But who should be in the inner circle ?
By trolling through online user groups and Web sites , Lund and Smith - Meyer collected 20 names .
They winnowed the list based on the candidates ' experience and their desire to have a well - rounded panel of specialists in different areas – sensors , software , building , et cetera .
Eventually , they had five names : the four pioneering MUPers , and another person who never responded .
One of the first things Lego executives discussed with the panel was the need for absolute secrecy .
Keeping NXT on the down - low was necessary because of the abundance of eager competitors .
But the company also wanted the relaunch to feel like a major event , a declaration of Lego 's intentionto battle gaming consoles , action figures , and other products that have nibbled away at its market share .
" Some companies work with a leak strategy , " Lund says .
" We decided to give it a big bang . "
Once the MUPers signed on , they sent numerous suggestions to Lund and his team .
The executives responded with appeals for feedback on planned improvements .
" We would ask them about a planned feature , " Lund says , " and within half an hour , there would be a four - page email on it . "
The Lego team was eager to piggyback on the work MUP members had already done .
Ralph Hempel , for example , is renowned for writing pbForth , a powerful , Mac / Linux - compatible version of the RCX brick 's firm - ware .
Lego was particularly wowed by the craftsmanship of John Barnes , the owner of HiTechnic , which manufactures an ultrasonic range sensor , a critical add - on that allows robots to sense when an obstacle is approaching .
" They said , ' We really like your ultrasonic sensor – would you mind if we started making this ? ' "
Barnes recalls .
" I said , ' Go ahead .
I have a whole list of sensors to get started on . ' "
Last April , Hassenplug and Schilling flew to Billund for a Mindstorms tournament .
They stayed an extra day and were ushered into Lego 's research sanctum – the high - security Global Innovation and Marketing building that 's strictly off - limits to nonemployees .
Beneath a sign reading
We will do for robotics what iPod did for music , Lund and the two MUPers examined prototypes for the NXT circuit boards , as well as the kit 's proposed assemblage of Technic pieces .
Hassenplug had a serious problem with the studless Legos .
Because they 're linked by rods , it 's tricky to make right angles .
And that makes it difficult to construct square frames .
He asked whether Lego could add a small L - shaped joint so Technic bars could be bolted at right angles .
" One of the first things S�ren told us was ' We do n't have the budget to make new pieces , ' " Hassenplug says .
" But then , after our talks , they decided it was really a good idea . "
Lego 's designers located an L - shaped mold languishing in a pile of unused prototypes and added it to the production line .
Lego was n't always so obliging , of course .
The MUPers pushed for an AC power pack , for example , but it never materialized .
They would have also liked a few additional ports and more memory for the programmable brick .
" There are certain things that we thought were going to happen , " Barnes says .
" But they 'd do a close analysis and say , ' We 'd love to do this , but we just can 't . '
And we understand that they have to work within a budget . "
The full MUP crew did n't meet face - to - face with the Mindstorms team until last August , after the annual Brickfest in Washington , DC .
During the conference , which was attended by several thousand Lego hobbyists , the four panel members acted as if they knew nothing about the top - secret NXT project .
" They did n't even say hello to me , " Lund recalls .
" They were so afraid someone might ask , ' How do you know that guy ? '
They were even more cautious than we were . "
The day after the conference , the four MUPers gathered with Lund at a Washington hotel , where the group hashed out final details of the pieces the NXT kit would contain – almost 200 fewer than 2.0 – as well as specs for the motors , sensors , and firmware .
The MUPers were n't getting paid .
But they were playing a vital role in shaping a product they loved .
" When I met S�ren , he said he wondered why we were all doing this , " says Barnes , laughing .
" I told him that if it had been any company other than Lego , I would n't be here . "
In January , Lego put out word that it 's looking for 100 more citizen developers .
These volunteers wo n't enjoy the exalted insider status of the MUPers , whose ranks have recently grown to 14 .
But over the next few months , they will be allowed to buy prerelease versions of the NXT kits at discounted prices and asked to test them rigorously .
Lund calls the new committee " a MUP extension " and says it 's still not open to just anyone .
" You have to argue why you should be part of this , " he explains .
" How will the community benefit from having you on board ? "
Until recently , companies were skittish about customer innovation , fearing that outsiders might leak trade secrets or that they simply lacked the necessary technical skills .
But Lego has warmed to the power of the open source ethos .
It 's clear to the Lego execs that Mindstorms NXT would be a lesser product without the MUPers ' input .
Inviting customers to innovate is n't just about building better products .
Opening the process engenders goodwill and creates a buzz among the zealots , a critical asset for products like Mindstorms that rely on word - of - mouth evangelism .
In his book Democratizing Innovation , MIT professor Eric von Hippel says that " the joy and the learning associated with membership in creative communities " drives people to generously share their time .
After his close encounter with four of the most passionate Mindstorms users , Lund wants every NXT customer to be able to have an effect on how Mindstorms is used and designed .
His plans include a Lego - hosted Web site where brickheads can upload scripts for robot behaviors or peruse blogs detailing the building of a Mindstorms typewriter or pinball machine .
" Imagine Flickr for robotics , " says Lund , who admires the photography site for how it has made image - sharing accessible and , in turn , spurred demand for digital cameras .
Because of its popularity among gearheads already familiar with the open source model , Mindstorms was a perfect candidate for Lego 's experiment with customer innovation .
But if NXT is a hit , the strategy could be extended to the full range of Lego products ; after all , who would know better how to improve the company 's building systems than the people who spend hundreds of hours preparing for Brickfest every year ?
In Billund , Denmark , not only is the customer always right , he 's also a candidate for the R&D team .
And he 'll work for small plastic blocks .

The Dream Factory
Three design whizzes test - drive Lego 's custom kit builder .
It 's a common frustration :
You set out to build a perfect replica of Babylon 5 ( or whatever ) , only to find that you do n't own enough gray plates for the twin particle arrays .
It does n't have to be this way .
Now there 's Lego Factory , a service that lets you create your very own Lego set .
Lego Factory starts with a downloadable 3 - D modeling program that lets you design your virtual toy using as many bricks as you want .
Upload your masterpiece to Lego's Web site and you – and any other Lego fan – can order the kit for your creation , complete with assembly instruction booklet .
There are some rough edges : Instructions can be confusing , and blocks come in preset packages , meaning you often have to buy a whole bag to get a single piece .
Still , it 's a brilliant move .
Customers get to make whatever they want , and Lego gets to transform its army of users into a massive product design team – 30,000 kits have been uploaded so far .
Not sure what to make ?
For inspiration we asked three creative pros to design kits for Wired .
Now go build your own at lego.com / factory .
