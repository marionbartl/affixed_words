LONDON  British scientists say they have created human embryos containing DNA from two women and a man in a procedure that researchers hope might be used one day to produce embryos free of inherited diseases .
Though the preliminary research has raised concerns about the possibility of genetically modified babies , the scientists say that the embryos are still only primarily the product of one man and one woman .
ON DEADLINE BLOG :
Do the embryos have three parents ?
Media splits
" We are not trying to alter genes , we 're just trying to swap a small proportion of the bad ones for some good ones , " said Patrick Chinnery , a professor of neurogenetics at Newcastle University involved in the research .
The research was presented at a scientific conference recently , but has not been peer - reviewed or published in a scientific journal .
The process aims to create healthy embryos for couples to avoid passing on genes carrying diseases .
The genes being replaced are the mitochondria , a cell 's energy source , which are contained outside the nucleus in a normal female egg .
Mistakes in the mitochondria 's genetic code can result in serious diseases like muscular dystrophy , epilepsy , strokes and mental retardation .
In their research , Chinnery and colleagues used normal embryos created from one man and one woman that had defective mitochondria in the woman 's egg .
They then transplanted that embryo into an emptied egg donated from a second woman who had healthy mitochondria .
The research is being funded by the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign , a British charity .
Only trace amounts of a person 's genes come from the mitochondria , and experts said it would be incorrect to say that the embryos have three parents .
" Most of the genes that make you who you are are inside the nucleus , " Chinnery said .
" We 're not going anywhere near that . "
So far , 10 such embryos have been created , though they have not been allowed to develop for more than five days .
Chinnery hoped that after further experiments in the next few years the process might be available to parents undergoing in - vitro fertilization .
" If successful , this research could give families who might otherwise have a bleak future a chance to avoid some very grave diseases , " said Francoise Shenfield , a fertility expert with the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology .
Shenfield was not connected to the Newcastle University research .
Similar experiments have been conducted in animals in Japan , and has already led to the birth of healthy mice who had their mitochondria genes corrected .
Shenfield said that further tests to assess the safety and efficacy of the process were necessary before it could be offered as a potential treatment .
A bill to allow the procedure to be regulated as a therapy for couples — once it is proven to work — is expected to be discussed in Britain 's House of Commons in March .

Obama vindicated on law - school title
As the first in a bill of particulars titled " Just Embellished Words : Senator Obama ’s Record of Exaggerations & Misstatements , " the Clinton campaign charged earlier this week : " Sen . Obama consistently and falsely claims that he was a law professor .
The Sun -Times reported that , ' Several direct - mail pieces issued for Obama 's primary [ Senate ] campaign said he was a law professor at the University of Chicago .
He is not .
He is a senior lecturer ( now on leave ) at the school .
In academia , there is a vast difference between the two titles .
Details matter . '
In academia , there 's a significant difference : professors have tenure while lecturers do not .
[ Hotline Blog , 4/9/07 ; Chicago Sun-Times , 8/8/04 ] . "
But the University of Chicago Law School has now posted a statement declaring his claims semantically sound : " The Law School has received many media requests about Barack Obama , especially about his status as ' Senior Lecturer . '
From 1992 until his election to the U.S. Senate in 2004 , Barack Obama served as a professor in the Law School .
He was a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996 .
He was a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004 , during which time he taught three courses per year .
Senior Lecturers are considered to be members of the Law School faculty and are regarded as professors , although not full - time or tenure - track .
The title of Senior Lecturer is distinct from the title of Lecturer , which signifies adjunct status .
Like Obama , each of the Law School 's Senior Lecturers have high - demand careers in politics or public service , which prevent full - time teaching .
Several times during his 12 years as a professor in the Law School , Obama was invited to join the faculty in a full - time tenure - track position , but he declined . "

Comcast has been promising that DOCSIS 3.0 goodness would be coming to its customers this year , and the cable giant is about to make good .
Starting tomorrow , Comcast 's new " extreme high - speed " Internet tier will be available to subscribers in the Minneapolis / St .
Paul metropolitan area , including Hudson , Wisconsin .
Download speeds will top out at 50 M bps while uploads will be capped at 5 M bps .
But all of that speed comes at a price : $ 149.95 per month for consumers , and $ 199.95 per month for business class service .
Comcast spokesperson Charlie Douglas characterized the price as " competitive , " saying that it 's roughly the same as what Verizon charges for similar speeds on its FiOS network .
That 's more or less accurate , but there 's a wide gap between the 50/5 tier and the next one down , 8/2 , which costs $ 52.95 per month for video customers .
Still , if you 're willing to pay for it , the superfast Internet is there .
" This announcement marks the beginning of the evolution from broadband to wideband , " said Comcast High - Speed Internet SVP Mitch Bowling .
" We believe wideband will usher - in a new era of speed and Internet innovation for today ’s digital consumers .
Wideband is the future , and it 's coming fast . "
How fast ?
Douglas said that the company intends to have DOCSIS 3.0 and the accompanying 50 M bps tier available to 20 percent of its customers by the end of 2008 .
It should be available nationwide by the middle of 2010 .
And 50 Mbps is only the beginning ; Comcast plans to up the speeds to at least 100 M bps in the next couple of years .
DOCSIS 3.0 is theoretically capable of 160 M bps speeds , which gives the company some headroom to increase speeds .
There 's something for the rest of Comcast 's Twin Cities ' subscribers as well .
Those on the lowest , 6 M bps / 384 K bps tier will see their upload speeds jump to 1 M bps .
8 Mbps Performance Plus customers will see 1 M bps upload speeds double to 2 Mbps .
Since Comcast made its DOCSIS 3.0 intentions official at CES this year , there has been a lot of speculation about where the first deployment would show up .
Some analysts believed that those with access to Verizon 's FiOS or possibly AT&T 's U - Verse networks would be first to see Comcast 's " extreme high - speed " offerings .
Instead , Comcast is rolling it out in the Twin Cities first , an area served by Qwest and with no superfast broadband competition .
" We chose the Twin Cities because they have done an excellent job operationally on other rollouts we have done , " Douglas told Ars .
When asked if Comcast would manage its DOCSIS 3.0 network any differently , Douglas reiterated the company 's decision to alter its traffic management practices that are currently under investigation by the Federal Communications Commission .
" We 're committed to changing our network management process from what they are today by the end of the year , and we just need time to work that all out , " Douglas said .
" We 're going to work not just with BitTorrent , but a lot of other P2P companies , the Internet Engineering Task Force , academics , and others to get together and come up with a better way to manage the network . "
Geeks around the country have been salivating at the thought of 50 M bps downloads , and it 's great to see such high speeds finally spreading beyond Verizon 's FiOS network .
The price is likely to be a deal - breaker for a lot of people — $ 149 is a lot to pay for broadband , even if it 's blazing fast .
It sounds as though Comcast is open to the possibility of dropping the price if the new offering is widely ignored .
" It 's too early to talk about future price drops , " said Douglas .
" A lot of this is going to be about consumer demand and the response that we see .
We 'll adjust based on consumer demand . "
The company may have to if it expects to get more than a small handful of subscribers to sign up for 50 M bps speeds .
Why carcinogens cause cancer in some people , not all ...
It has become fashionable lately to see parallels between the current financial turmoil and what happened during the Great Depression .
See , for example , Paul Krugman 's latest column
Let me remind everyone of one important difference : Deflation was a large part of the story of the 1930s , and that does not seem like a significant risk today .
Here is a relevant passage from my favorite intermediate macro textbook ( sorry , I can not post the referenced figure ) : From 1929 to 1933 the price level fell 25 percent .
Many economists blame this deflation for the severity of the Great Depression .
They argue that the deflation may have turned what in 1931 was a typical economic downturn into an unprecedented period of high unemployment and depressed income .
If correct , this argument gives new life to the money hypothesis .
Because the falling money supply was , plausibly , responsible for the falling price level , it could have been responsible for the severity of the Depression .
To evaluate this argument , we must discuss how changes in the price level affect income in the IS ‑LM model .
The Stabilizing Effects of Deflation
In the IS‑LM model we have developed so far , falling prices raise income .
For any given supply of money M , a lower price level implies higher real money balances M/P .
An increase in real money balances causes an expansionary shift in the LM curve , which leads to higher income .
Another channel through which falling prices expand income is called the Pigou effect .
Arthur Pigou , a prominent classical economist in the 1930s , pointed out that real money balances are part of households ' wealth .
As prices fall and real money balances rise , consumers should feel wealthier and spend more .
This increase in consumer spending should cause an expansionary shift in the IS curve , also leading to higher income .
These two reasons led some economists in the 1930s to believe that falling prices would help stabilize the economy .
That is , they thought that a decline in the price level would automatically push the economy back toward full employment .
Yet other economists were less confident in the economy 's ability to correct itself .
They pointed to other effects of falling prices , to which we now turn .
The Destabilizing Effects of DeflationEconomists have proposed two theories to explain how falling prices could depress income rather than raise it .
The first , called the debt‑deflation theory , describes the effects of unexpected falls in the price level .
The second explains the effects of expected deflation .
The debt ‑deflation theory begins with an observation from Chapter 4 : unanticipated changes in the price level redistribute wealth between debtors and creditors .
If a debtor owes a creditor $ 1,000 , then the real amount of this debt is $ 1,000 / P , where P is the price level .
A fall in the price level raises the real amount of this debt‑ ‑the amount of purchasing power the debtor must repay the creditor .
Therefore , an unexpected deflation enriches creditors and impoverishes debtors .
The debt ‑deflation theory then posits that this redistribution of wealth affects spending on goods and services .
In response to the redistribution from debtors to creditors , debtors spend less and creditors spend more .
If these two groups have equal spending propensities , there is no aggregate impact .
But it seems reasonable to assume that debtors have higher propensities to spend than creditors ‑‑perhaps that is why the debtors are in debt in the first place .
In this case , debtors reduce their spending by more than creditors raise theirs .
The net effect is a reduction in spending , a contractionary shift in the IS curve , and lower national income .
To understand how expected changes in prices can affect income , we need to add a new variable to the IS ‑LM model .
Our discussion of the model so far has not distinguished between the nominal and real interest rates .
Yet we know from previous chapters that investment depends on the real interest rate and that money demand depends on the nominal interest rate .
If i is the nominal interest rate and πe is expected inflation , then the ex ante real interest rate is i - πe .
We can now write the IS‑LM model asIS : Y = C( Y - T ) + I ( i - πe ) + GLM : M/P = L( i , Y ) Expected inflation enters as a variable in the IS curve .
Thus , changes in expected inflation shift the IS curve .
Let 's use this extended IS ‑LM model to examine how changes in expected inflation influence the level of income .
We begin by assuming that everyone expects the price level to remain the same .
In this case , there is no expected inflation ( πe = 0 ) , and these two equations produce the familiar IS ‑LM model .
Figure 11 - 8 depicts this initial situation with the LM curve and the IS curve labeled IS1 .
The intersection of these two curves determines the nominal and real interest rates , which for now are the same .
Now suppose that everyone suddenly expects that the price level will fall in the future , so that πe becomes negative .
The real interest rate is now higher at any given nominal interest rate .
This increase in the real interest rate depresses planned investment spending , shifting the IS curve from IS1 to IS2 .
( The vertical distance of the downward shift exactly equals the expected deflation . )
Thus , an expected deflation leads to a reduction in national income from Y1 to Y2 .
The nominal interest rate falls from i1 to i2 , while the real interest rate rises from r1 to r2 .
Here is the story behind this figure .
When firms come to expect deflation , they become reluctant to borrow to buy investment goods because they believe they will have to repay these loans later in more valuable dollars .
The fall in investment depresses planned expenditure , which in turn depresses income .
The fall in income reduces the demand for money , and this reduces the nominal interest rate that equilibrates the money market .
The nominal interest rate falls by less than the expected deflation , so the real interest rate rises .
Note that there is a common thread in these two stories of destabilizing deflation .
In both , falling prices depress national income by causing a contractionary shift in the IS curve .
Because a deflation of the size observed from 1929 to 1933 is unlikely except in the presence of a major contraction in the money supply , these two explanations give some of the responsibility for the Depression ‑‑especially its severity ‑ ‑to the Fed .
In other words , if falling prices are destabilizing , then a contraction in the money supply can lead to a fall in income , even without a decrease in real money balances or a rise in nominal interest rates .
Could the Depression Happen Again ?
Economists study the Depression both because of its intrinsic interest as a major economic event and to provide guidance to policymakers so that it will not happen again .
To state with confidence whether this event could recur , we would need to know why it happened .
Because there is not yet agreement on the causes of the Great Depression , it is impossible to rule out with certainty another depression of this magnitude .
Yet most economists believe that the mistakes that led to the Great Depression are unlikely to be repeated .
The Fed seems unlikely to allow the money supply to fall by one - fourth .
Many economists believe that the deflation of the early 1930s was responsible for the depth and length of the Depression .
And it seems likely that such a prolonged deflation was possible only in the presence of a falling money supply .
Her supervisor , who is no longer with the company , and Mr. Mercer knew of her troubles , she said , and at her annual evaluation offered to buy her a car instead of giving her a $ 3,000 raise .
They also helped her find the right car , a Diamanti , and paid $ 4,500 for it , she said .
She told them to work out an installment so she could pay the difference .
They never did .
And then she got a second pleasant surprise : her raise started showing up in her paycheck as well .
“ A company that takes care of their employees , ” Ms. Richmond said , “ it definitely is returned to them tenfold because their employees are going to take care of them and do a good job . ”
Creativity and sensitivity meshed with good business sense at Vurv , and that is a crucial aspect of problem solving , according to Glenn Okun , clinical professor of management and entrepreneurship at the Stern School of Business at New York University .
“ Entrepreneurs must remember that resources have costs that must be borne by the firm , ” he said .
Small - business owners should approach such instances analytically , Professor Okun said , examining risk and opportunity .
Act as if you are a third party interested in financing your own company , he suggested , and then decide how to proceed .
Especially now , when economic times are tough , Professor Okun said , business owners will have to weigh unexpected outlays against the knowledge there will be potentially less revenue coming in and less credit extended by lenders and investors to smooth rough patches .
In this environment , he said , “ problems get magnified , even if the firm is solid . ”
The solution at Vurv was a balancing act of trying to help employees while not hurting the bottom line .
The same was true for the Transtec Group in Austin , Tex. , which helps public and private agencies in street , highway , airfield and seaport projects .
Dan K. Rozycki , its president , recalled what happened when an employee had to get out of her apartment after a relationship broke up .
“ In a matter of days , ” Mr. Rozycki said , “ we helped her find a new apartment and we furnished the whole place from sofa to spatula . ”
Despite prevalent notion , it is n’t challenging to eliminate bugs at home provided you use the ideal techniques .
Pests will inevitably bring about some destruction , either to the person ’s overall health or even his home , so ignoring minimal signs of an infestation might not be a wise idea .
Knowing exactly what bugs exist in the house is going to be important in eliminating them totally .
You might also want to consider this element when you ’re purchasing a new house to reside in .
Signs of an infestation should not be overly hard to figure out once you know what things to look out for .
Bug excrement or coming across the bugs themselves will probably show that there ’s an infestation going on .
When you can see more than a handful of bugs spread about in your house , it is extremely probable there ’s an entire colony within the immediate area .
Getting a periodical bug wandering far from its nest to your property searching for food and water is very improbable .
Usually , the nest would be formed or is within the beginning phases of being formed inside your residence already .
The nests of such bugs are definitely not difficult to track down in the event you try looking in the right places .
Regardless of whether you ’re confident of the position of the nest , it ’s typically impossible to get to it via physical means .
Should you have an abandoned shack or even a part of the household just like the attic room that is almost never used , the likelihood is that some bug might have made that place its home already .
To effectively avoid an infestation in the first place , it is crucial that you have a nice and clean setting all around your entire property .
Ants are considered to be the most challenging as well as widespread pest in the world .
Ants breed rapidly and if you disregard them , you ’ll need to handle multiple nests later on .
Research has shown that more than 1,000 ant eggs are created on a daily basis by a single ant queen , across the span of 30 or more .
Yet another related pest that causes a massive nuisance will be termites .
Whilst they appear alike , the two of these pests belong to distinct insect types .
As scavengers , ants will frequently search for leftovers and carry them back to the nest be shared with others .
Termites will not act in a similar manner as ants since they can survive off of an increased assortment of food items .
Termites can eat grass , foliage and in many cases solid wood .
Consequently , you will see that termite infestations are generally much more dreadful as a result of its timber - consuming capacity .
Household furniture or large structures may be wrecked by these bugs totally if they ’re produced from wood .
Timber pillars , roofing beams plus more might come crashing downwards suddenly in the most severe situations .
Yet another remarkably problematic bug that so many people are afraid of would be the roaches .
Roach infestations have to be checked out with greater urgency as they are able spread ailments effortlessly .
Check out the roach killing guide on http://thebugskiller.com/ to learn how to get rid of roaches .
A variety of symptoms like diarrhea and also vomiting are the most frequent kinds that individuals are continuously subjected to .
Youngsters with asthma are especially exposed to the germs that roaches have on their bodies .
Water is an important factor for roaches to survive so you ’ll discover them continually around water sources just like the basin in the kitchen .
You will probably find that the regular pesticides for other bugs are unsuccessful against roaches due to the fact that there is a higher - level of resistance against minor poison .
Toxic baits or traps designed specifically to eliminate roaches will likely be required for effective effects .
In order to avoid the same circumstance down the road , make sure that your property is totally free of spaces and crevices in the wall structure or floor tiles .
If mistakenly ingested by way of your cookware , roach droppings will normally bring about E. coli bacterial infections that can lead to extreme tummy cramps , diarrhea or even worse , which can result in hospitalization .
Haggis , traditionally eaten on Burns night , is banned in the US
Imports of Scotland 's iconic dish were banned by the US in 1989 in the wake of the BSE scare because it contains offal ingredients such as sheep lungs .
Only an offal - free version of haggis is available in the US .
The move would be backed by renowned haggis maker Macsween , which believes the American market could be a very lucrative one .
A Scottish Government spokeswoman said it " will consider engaging the US government on its haggis export ban , if there is popular support for such a move from within our world famous haggis producers " .
Expat Scots
Jo Macsween , a co-director of family company Macsween , said she hoped to see the ban overturned .
" The market is massive because there are so many expat Scots there and once Americans try a good quality haggis , they can't get enough of it , " she added .
The dish is traditionally served with neeps and tatties on Burns night .
It usually contains ingredients such as sheeps lungs , liver and heart minced with onion .
We see no reason at all why people cannot eat haggis safely , so long as manufacturers follow hygiene legislation
Food Standards Agency
It is boiled in the animal 's stomach .
A spokesman for the US Department of Agriculture said : " We do not allow importation because of the UK's BSE status . "
" Sheep are susceptible to TSEs and thus the US takes precautions on importing those ruminants from BSE - affected countries . "
However , a spokesman for Britain 's Food Standards Agency said : " We see no reason at all why people cannot eat haggis safely , so long as manufacturers follow hygiene legislation .
" We have the strictest BSE controls in the world . "
A reader tipped me off to an issue that 's come up with crossover voters in Ohio .
It seems that some Republican voters have bragged online that they voted Democratic ballots in the Ohio March 4th primary in order to influence the outcome of the presidential election .
Essentially , they wanted to help Hillary Clinton win the Democratic nomination over Barack Obama because they think she 's the weaker candidate and would lose against Republican John McCain in November .
The so - called Republican " plot " was instigated by conservative radio talker Rush Limbaugh ( at right ) who urged Republican voters in Ohio and Texas before the election to cross over for the primary to rig the nomination for the November election .
Voters in those states could do this at the last minute because their local election laws allow voters to change party affiliation at the polls .
Here 's a post made by one voter who bragged about switching :
Lastly , they had me sign the affirmation about switching parties and supporting the principles of the Democrat party .
I said that would be easy , because they do n't have any .
Everybody got a good chuckle as there is n't a Democrat within 5 miles any direction from where I vote .
I then proceeded to cast my vote for Hillary Clinton .
Dirty as it felt at the time , I have a feeling I 'll be rewarded in the long run .
It turns out that this voter , and others in Ohio , may have broken the law .
Ohio 's revised election code includes an election falsification clause ( Revised Code 3513.20 ) , which says that if a voter who changes parties is challenged by poll workers as to the sincerity of his change of heart and also signs an affidavit stating that he supports the principles of the party to which he 's changing – when in fact he does n't support them – then he would be committing election falsification .
Election falsification is a felony that is punishable by six to twelve months in jail and a $ 2,500 fine .
It 's clear that cross -over voting occurred in large numbers in Ohio this year .
The Ohio secretary of state 's office does n't have statistics yet on how many voters crossed parties in the primary ( it 's still compiling them ) , but the Cleveland Plain Dealer is reporting that in Cuyahoga County alone , the state 's largest county , at least 16,000 Republicans switched parties for the primary .
The statewide numbers of cross -over voters could be large , since the secretary of state 's office reports that the number of Democratic ballots cast in this primary as opposed to the number cast in the 2004 presidential primary increased by nearly a million , or 76 percent .
( In comparison , the number of Republican ballots cast this year increased by only about 100,000 , or 11 percent .
These numbers do not include absentee , provisional and overseas ballots , which are still being counted . )
It 's unclear at this point how many of those million extra Democratic ballots can be attributed to cross-over Republicans , as opposed to new voters casting ballots for the first time .
It 's also unclear how many voters crossed over because they sincerely preferred the Democratic options to the Republican ones .
But what about those who did n't and broke the law ?
Would they be prosecuted and would their vote be counted ?
Dan Tokaji , a law professor at Ohio State University 's Moritz College of Law who specializes in election law , says it 's debatable whether Ohio's law is enforceable and says that even if it is enforceable the likelihood that anyone would be prosecuted under it is " infinitesimally small . "
First of all , the law pertains only to a voter who was challenged by poll workers as to his sincerity and signed an affidavit swearing to that sincerity .
The secretary of state 's office told me that poll workers are supposed to have anyone who switches parties at the polls sign such a statement .
The Cleveland Plain Dealer also reported that any voter who switches parties must sign an affidavit .
But Tokaji says it 's not clear from the law that the poll worker has an obligation to challenge the voter and have them sign such a statement , and many poll workers did not do this .
Tokaji says that under
Ohio law poll workers have the ability to challenge a voter if they believe the voter is n't affiliated with or a member of the political party he 's claiming to support in the primary .
A poll worker can challenge a voter 's membership to the party based on which party the voter voted in the two previous election cycles .
Once challenged , a voter has to sign an affidavit expressing support for the principles of his new party , which states clearly that committing election falsification is a felony of the fifth degree .
But a voter can refuse to sign the affidavit and still cast a ballot , though he must cast a provisional ballot in this case .
Either way , it 's clear from statements that some cross -over voters made online that some poll workers did not challenge voters who crossed over and did not have them sign affidavits .
But even those who did sign a statement and did so disingenuously would likely not face prosecution , Tokaji says , unless they were blatant about what they did , such as bragging online about it , and could be identified .
" If after doing this the person gets online and says ' Ha , ha ha .
I tricked them and signed this statement , ' maybe then we could imagine someone being prosecuted , " he says .
But even then , he thinks the likelihood that they would be prosecuted is close to nil .
By the way , cross over voting for purposes of affecting an election is n't limited to Republicans .
A spokesman for the Ohio secretary of state 's office said it always happens in presidential elections and also occurred during the 2006 gubernatorial primary election when Democratic voters crossed over to cast ballots in the Republican primary for Kenneth Blackwell because they thought he would more likely lose in a race against the Democratic candidate for governor .

A Way In For Indies
The ' PC Is Dead ' Static
Supporting PC Development With Steamworks
Up Against The Odds ?
New Biz Models
" We 've mostly passed the days of being a scary thing to being a staple in people 's launch plans , " Valve marketing VP Doug Lombardi tells Gamasutra .
Given the ever - broadening digital distribution space , we spoke to him to discuss the state of downloadable gaming on the PC and how Steam 's doing -- and the role it aims to play in the months ahead .
According to Lombardi , Steam has seen year - over - year growth of 150 percent , with an install base now in excess of 15 million accounts .
" We continue to announce more titles coming day and date now , which is one of the last pieces of metrics we 're using for judging the success and strength of the platform , " he says .
And a large part of that , he continues , is the growing body of independent titles available on Steam .
Valve recently announced that the IGF - winning music gamewas the number one seller for the month of February .
" I think his whole life has changed in the past 3 weeks , " Lombardi laughs .
" That 's all to his credit -- all the reviews and raves are about the game , but it 's awesome that Steam has become one of these places where folks can take an indie game and take it from having a cult following to having their life change .
" Indeed , it seems as if digital distribution is developing as a channel to strengthen independent games , from Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network to PC - based platforms like Steam .
" I think it 's providing an alternative avenue for all kinds of games , " Lombardi agrees , citing Introversion ' sand Tripwire 's " It 's good in both directions , " Lombardi says .
" Our gamers can find cool games they would n't find elsewhere at prices retail can't sustain .
There are a bunch of titles now at a place in their lifecycle where retail does n't make sense , but they 're good .
" And it 's not just indies , Lombardi says , noting that the back catalog collections from companies like Id and Rockstar perform quite well .
" At this point , you 're looking at the PC market being tougher and tougher on shelf space ... when you look at a place that has endless shelf space and 15 million targeted accounts to go after , it 's really interesting for indies as well as older and AAA debut launches .
" Alongside this rose - colored imagery , though , is a growing tide of opinion that aims to ring a death knell for the PC as a gaming platform -- at least in its current shape .
Just recently THQ's Michael Fitch railed against the challenges of the PC gaming audience on the heels ofdeveloper Iron Lore 's closing , while the NPD 's grim picture of 2007's PC retail biz is still reverberating .
Lombardi blames the retail - heavy NPD report for the anxiety wave .
" That totally ignores the money changing hands , and properties likewith their monthly subscriptions .
That totally ignores Steam sales , and any other MMOs and online distribution systems and a host of others ... it also ignores things like PopCap games .'s not in that number .
" He continues , " If you took Steam , , PopCap , and mixed it with NPD numbers , the world looks a lot different .
All of a sudden , it looks like PC 's probably the biggest one , and year over year , the fastest - growing .
" We were joined by Valve 's business development director , Jason Holtman , who also notes that the infamous NPD story focuses only on North America .
And , he notes , Steam distributes worldwide .
" Our view of where PC gaming is across the world is very different than someone looking at North America 's numbers , " says Holtman .
Holtman explains that in addition to continuing to get more titles out on Steam , another area of focus is Valve 's recently announced Steamworks tools -- a suite of publishing and development tools available for free .
Steamworks gives developers access to real - time stats , auto - updating and matchmaking utilities , in addition to a range of recently implemented social networking services , and other Steam tools -- and Lombardi and Holtman feel that making Steamworks available will be a key solution to addressing some of the PC market 's current woes -- eliminating the dreaded patch - hunt for consumers , and giving developers access to snapshots of participating users ' configurations .
Explains Holtman , " Things we work hard on for our own games , other people should be able to use .
It will strengthen the PC platform in general ; it is something that 's going to make PC gaming and Steam better .
We 've just gotta reinforce that PC gaming is the place to be .
" But in the current climate , some audiences might be tough to convince .
We asked if Valve has any plans in place to try and stem the tide of " anti - PC gaming PR , " so to speak .
But Lombardi admits it'll take more hands than Valve has on deck to counter the multimillion - dollar , multiple agency initiatives of the console giants .
" Valve is barely over 150 people -- we 've got about 8 people who are n't developers or artists , " he said , contrasting his staff with the number of people Microsoft , Sony and Nintendo have working public relations alone .
" It 'd be nice if someone wanted to play that role of being a platform holder that was championing the cause ... but I think even in the absence of that , this story is n't new .
" Recalls Lombardi , " I can remember this story coming around in the mid ' 90 s ... and then 3D accelerator came out , and Carmack released that patch for GL , and everybody shut up , because all of a sudden PlayStation looked like crap .
There 's a big shift about to come in the post - GPU space ... all of a sudden PC will leapfrog what 's going on on the consoles , in many other ways besides graphics .
" Moreover , Lombardi says , it 's not difficult to make the case that the PC is far ahead of the consoles in the connectivity arena .
" The console guys are still trying to figure out how to release DLC , and are still not selling full new games [ digitally ] , " he notes .
" I think at the end of the day there 's going to be a continued group of people -- us , Blizzard , Epic -- committed to making great apps for PC .
" He adds , " People keep innovating on the hardware to make it a more heavyweight platform ; it 's maturing more quickly than consoles .
It 's pretty hard to say they 're going to go away completely .
"
In fact , continues Lombardi , the question mark might be floating squarely in the console 's future , as their prices continue climbing and more post - purchase purchases are becoming necessary .
" How much longer will that story still have credibility ? "
He posits .
" Somebody go back and look at next - gen console install base numbers since launch time , and compare it to PSone and PS2 .
I would n't be surprised at all if we saw these guys stuttering out at 25,000 -- nobody 's going to get to 100 million , which we saw from Sony on the last 2 [ console generations ] .
I do n't think anybody 's even thinking of this .
" We also asked Lombardi and Holtman about promising alternative business models and the role they may play in PC gaming 's growth .
After all , EA is doing so with , which some have suggested bears a striking stylistic resemblance to Valve's .
The pair shrugged off the resemblance , commenting only , " How many games look like ?
How many bands wanted to be like the Beatles after the Beatles hit ?
" So does Valve ever expect to capitalize on emerging trends like microtransactions , tiered subscriptions and free - to - play ? "
I think you will definitely see that come online , " said Holtman .
" We know that 's an emerging trend , already very well established in Asia now .
We 've looked at that , we know we have a base there , and we also know there 's a model that people are exploring ... where you can play an instance for free with microtransactions [ as ] another way of lowering the barrier to entry and getting people into that game and into that franchise .
" Added Holtman , " You will see partners come on and do it , and you may see functions inside Steam come online .
it 's something we 've always approached ... you 're going to see it slowly roll out , and we 'll see how people react .
" Currently , he says , Valve is working with Nexon to experiment withunder those revenue models in Taiwan , Korea , Japan and China , incorporating a microtransactions model .
" Folks will need to make microtransactions to get different items , skins , things like that , " Lombardi explains .
" We 're working with those guys , and using different versions of our backend to administer it , and obviously our IP to headline it .
" He continues , " We feel that 's a great place for us to learn , and Nexon is a company that has done it before , and so they 're a good partner ... it 's in beta now , and over the years we 'll take the learning from that and also work with other partners who want to bring games like that to North America via Steam . "
" The world 's moving in that direction , " adds Lombardi .
" It 's tempting to say that 's the future . "
But , he says , that would be an incomplete statement .
" Folks still like just paying for their game , and not being bothered with ads or prompts to buy other stuff .
But there 's obviously a whole other crowd willing to be somewhere in between .
" All in all , Holtman says , all of these current issues require a moderate stance -- no one gaming plaform will abruptly die off to be supplanted by another , and no one business model will drive off all the others .
" Some people always think , 'is that going to be the next thing , and is everything else going to die ' ? "
Holtman notes .
" Almost every move we 've ever made on Steam has been to add something ... new stuff does n't cannibalize anything else we 're doing .
It 's always a big add . "
Songbird , the open - source music player that makes finding music easy online , has been updated with new features and bug fixes .
The latest version , released Wednesday , is called developer 's preview 0.5 , but do n't let the name fool you .
Songbird has been stable for years , although it occasionally runs a bit slowly .
If you 've been looking for a new way to listen to music on your computer , Songbird has a lot to recommend it .
Unlike iTunes , which Songbird 's developers have ridiculed as being too much like a spreadsheet , the program contains an unrestricted web browser for streaming and downloading tunes from music blogs and other sources , many of which are included as links or bookmarks within the program .
Loads of music fans listen to online content alongside music stored on their hard drives , and Songbird was designed with those users in mind .
Browse to any music blog or other site with embedded music and the program will find and list all music on the page in a simple playlist window at the bottom of the screen .
There , you can pick and choose music to stream from the blog withouthaving to hunt for the links and click on them manually .
You can download the MP3 within the main window , or chooseto purchase it from Amazon MP3 , Amie Street , eMusic or iTunes .
While you 're listening , you can also jump straight to the entry in the blog about that song ( as seen , right ) .
Songbird , which is built on Mozilla code , powers P2P service Qtrax .
This latest update adds these significant features , as described by Songbird 's developers :
MTP Device support
Windows users have a shiny new MTP Add - on that introduces MTP Device Support .
Most portable media players and cellphones integrate the MTP spec , so try plugging in your device and sharing your findings on the MTP Device Compatibility Wiki Page .
The extension requires Windows XP - SP2 or Vista , as well as WMP v11 .
Media Views
Tired of music players that look like spreadsheets ?
Media Views provide new ways of displaying , manipulating , exploring and contextualizing your media library .
Songbird ships with two default views : a traditional playlist view and a second playlist view with three filter panes .
Developers can create new Media Views and upload them to the Add - ons site .
This example Media View replaces the standard playlist filters with tag clouds .
To experience your music web 2.0 style , load your library , then select Tag Cloud from the View menu .
Click the tags to toggle the filtering on and off .
Improved Filter Picker
Genre , Artist and Album are n’t the only useful ways to filter your music collection .
We 've streamlined the filter picker list and fixed a few bugs that make it easier than ever to navigate your collection .
New List Background
After several requests from our community we ’ve made our Library and Playlist backgrounds easier on your eyes .
Keep sending us your ideas , suggestions and requests , your feedback helps us improve the ' bird !
Improved Rating UI
We 've clarified the rating widget display by showing circles for unrated items and improved usability by allowing you to more easily change or un - rate a track .
Hot Keys on the Mac
Mac users , you can now use common hot - keys to quit , hide or open Songbird preferences just like the rest of your applications .
We also fixed the issue which allowed the application to be dragged under the menu bar , yay !
Always on Top
Never lose your Rubberducky Mini Player under a stack of windows !
Now you can set it to always be on top .
Any Feather developer can expose this feature in their feather .

Every sportswriter dreams ( often in secret ) of what life would be like on the other side of the press box .

George Plimpton did it back in the 1960s .

THE
New York Times
blogs
a chart produced by Jared Bernstein , of the Economic Policy Institute , showing that real wages have declined steadily in recent months .
Felix Salmon
comments
The chart does n't mention the main reason for the fall : unusually high inflation .
Since inflation is running at a 4 % clip right now , you 'd need wages to be rising at the same rate in nominal terms just to stay at zero on this chart .
If food and energy prices stop rising at some point , real wages will start looking much healthier .
Inflation is normally a phenomenon associated with a booming economy .
During such periods , inflation is frequently exacerbated by demands for wage increases , which firms are fairly willing to grant given strong economic conditions .
Now , however , inflation is primarily being driven by increasing raw materials prices , which squeeze corporate margins .
That squeeze and a weak economy rule out significant wage increases for most workers .
As such , real wages fall with inflation .
This forces consumers to reduce their spending , further undermining the economy .
The result is substantial pain for most households and a rather large headache for Ben Bernanke .
Matthew Yglesias notes :
[ W ] hat we have is the inflation uptick , and with it falling real wages for everyone who does n't get at least a 4 percent raise this year , a problem that we hope wo n't be afflicting the all - important political blogging sector .
Energy and food prices have increased in the District of Columbia , where Mr Yglesias lives and works .
As a carless resident of a transit - friendly city , he may be suffering less than others .
But it should be pointed out that increases in grain prices have negatively impacted brewers and distillers of alcoholic beverages .
Beer being a primary input in the journalist sector , Mr Yglesias should expect expect howls of discontent to soon erupt from his media colleagues .
Recently there has been a lot of controversy over whether Michigan and Florida should be given the right to have their votes count in the hotly contested Democratic primary .
The states complain that they have been disenfranchised , and that it is their right to have their voices heard .
Their statements are based on the absurd assumption that allowing every state to have their say in national politics is a good thing , rather than the main reason why America is lagging behind just about every other developed country in just about every way except in the area of spending tons of money on new gadgets for our military to kill people with .
The truth is that not every state should be allowed to vote .
Some are too dumb to vote .
Some are too evil to vote .
Some are Florida .
In the interest of space , I 've narrowed the list down to the top three .
Three states that just should n't be allowed to vote anymore .
Here they are :
3. Ohio
Ohio is n't plagued with the repellent politics or grandiose incompetence of my other two picks , but it earns its place on this list for its consistent tendency to edge its way into a pivotal position in national politics , and then to charge enthusiastically in the wrong direction , dragging the rest of the country along with it like a four year old dragging an irritated parent to buy some stupid toy that the kid wo n't even like once he gets it .
The 2004 presidential elections came down to their working - class white asses , and we all know how that turned out .
More recently , they made the bold decision to string out an interminable primary process that has literally already been mathematically decided in favor of the other candidate .
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link .
A video game is only as entertaining as its most boring escort mission .
A country is only as strong as its ability to tell Ohio to fuck off .
Fuck off , Ohio .
2. Texas
There is a good reason why whenever foreign movies have a character that represents everything they think is wrong with America , they make it a ten - gallon hat wearing Texan yokel .
It 's because Texas is not only everything that is wrong with America , it is everything that is wrong with anything in the universe that could possibly be conceived of as wrong .
One easy point to make is that it gave both Bushs their start in national politics .
But I wo n't talk about that .
After all , I 'm from the state that introduced to the world to a certain genial monster named Reagan .
No , instead I want to talk about Texas 's deep love for killing people .
Especially mentally - handicapped people .
A single glance at the number of executions per state since 1976 should give you ample reason to deprive Texans of the right to decide anything ever outside of their dusty wasteland .
Out of a little over a thousand executions done in the last 32 years , Texas performed 405 of them .
To put this into perspective , the second highest number comes from Virginia at 98 prisoners killed since ' 76 .
To put this into a different perspective , Texans are bloodthirsty savages who long for the days when they were allowed to lynch people they suspected of crimes such as theft or not being white .
Oh , and a full nine of the executed prisoners were mentally - handicapped .
I know , I know , nine people who are absolutely incapable of understanding the world around them or of what they have been accused does n't seem like that excessive a number , but I 've always been a little nit-picky about killing mental patients through processes that are objectively unfair .
One last thing : I know I was n't going to hold Texas responsible for the idiots they elect , but do n't imagine that they learned their lesson from five years under Governor Bush .
Current Governor Rick Perry invited Ted Nugent to perform at his inauguration bash .
Surprisingly , that resulted in the following :
Using machine guns as props , Nugent , 58 , appeared onstage as the final act of the inaugural ball wearing a cutoff T - shirt emblazoned with the Confederate flag and shouting offensive remarks about non-English speakers .
Governor Perry assured the press that this was " no big deal " before excusing himself to personally shoot a few random state prisoners in the head .
Obscene Abercrombie & Fitch PHOTOS
Confiscated by Police
An Abercrombie & Fitch store in Virginia Beach , Virginia is under fire for displaying posters that featured men and women in objectionable states of undress .
The manager of the Lynnhaven Mall store was cited by police on Saturday for disregarding previous warning to remove the photos .
One of the black and white photos shows three shirtless men , one with his upper buttocks showing .
The other photo shows a woman whose breast is mostly exposed .
The photos were seized by police and a summons was issued to the store manager .
Customer complaints to the local police department prompted a warning that apparently went unheeded .
The manager faced the possibility of a $ 2,000 fine and one year in jail .
City code makes it illegal to display obscene materials in a business that is open to juveniles .
The corporate office is located in New Albany , Ohio .
The Virginia manager has referred all inquiries to corporate .
The clothing chain has a reputation for its suggestive catalogs and promo photographs featuring models in varying degrees of undress .
In 2003 , the company stopped producing their A&F Quarterly catalog because of numerous customer complaints about the sexually suggestive print ads .
A&F paid $ 50 million to settle a suit that accused the company of creating an all - white image , basically ignoring minorities in their ads .

It all started with an Aug. 14 New York Times obituary by Douglas Martin for photographer Joe O'Donnell .
Martin praised his exceptional work and took special notice of a picture made during President Kennedy 's funeral cortege : " And the O'Donnell photograph of John F. Kennedy Jr. saluting his father 's coffin became the most reproduced version of that memorable scene . "
Martin goes on to note that , because he was on the government payroll , Mr. O'Donnell got no personal credit for those photos , although he signed and sold copies of them after his retirement from the White House in 1968 .
When Gary Haynes saw the reproduction of the John - John salute alarm bells went off .
Haynes , a retired UPI photographer and author of " Picture This ! " ( Bulfinch Press , 2006 ) , a compilation of great UPI photographs , got in touch with The New York Times .
" I alerted The Times , on Aug. 15 , the morning after the obit ran , that the photo they had credited to ' O ' Donnell ' was , I was 99 % certain , the famous UPI photo shot by Stan Stearns … .
There 's no question that the photos are identical .
It is impossible for two photographers , even if they are gaffer - taped together , to come up with identical photos .
" I not only relayed this to The Times , but also the Downhold group [ a listserv for ex-UPI personnel ] , and trust me , if you want something checked out by a couple of dozen of the world 's best journalists – only some of them retired – this is your group .
" Before long , guys who were THERE or who knew people who were there they could check with , were poking holes in the obit itself … to have taken some of the photos he claimed , O'Donnell would have had to have taken them as a teenager ! "
The Times obit also ran in The Boston Globe and many other newspapers .
The Tennessean in Nashville ran a glowing account of O'Donnell 's life .
Television news also picked up the story and image .
The " O' Donnell " image was used ( as of 9/2 ) on the State of the Art blog site from editors of American Photo .
It says in part : " Joe O'Donnell was a White House photographer during the Kennedy years , and he snapped the enduring images of John Kennedy Junior saluting as his father 's casket passed during the emotional state funeral in 1963 .
The photo was widely though anonymously distributed . "
Note that the bottom of the image has been strangely cropped .
The photographer , Stan Stearns , sent this e-mail 9/2 to set the record straight : " The true story about John - John saluting … Made by me and it was a " world beater " for UPI .
I was chosen to walk with Jackie and the world leaders from the White House to St. Matthew 's for the JFK service .
When we got there I had to go behind the ropes with the other 70 - odd photographers .
All squeezed in an area for 30 .
Wow !
UPI photographer Frank Cancellare squeezed me in next to him … .
I had the longest lens , a 200 mm .
... I just watched Jackie .
She bent down and whispered in [ John - John 's ] ear .
His hand came up to a salute .
Click !
One exposure on a roll of 36 exposures .
" As the caisson was rolling out to Arlington Cemetery I asked every photographer I could if they had the salute .
Duh !
Nobody saw it .
They were concentrating on Jackie and the caisson .
At this point I made a decision to walk the film into the bureau …
When the photo was transmitted the credit was UPI / by Stan Stearns .
Back in the day that was almost unheard of . "
Stearns saw the moment happen and was ready for it .
He knew that there was another image inside the horizontal and he chose to bring the one exposure to UPI himself .
During a phone conversation he said , " It 's unbelievable what this guy did .
This guy was never , ever a White House photographer . "
Stan Stearns had friends calling him the moment they saw The New York Times and again when the picture was used on Katie Couric 's CBS news program .
Stearns ' reaction to the use of his work ?
" The main rule of Journalism 101 is check your source — no one did that . "
Joe Chapman , a retired photographer , UPI editor and manager , confirmed Stan Stearns ' ownership when he wrote , in part , on the UPI listserv : " I did an overlay of it and other images , resized so you could identify differences .
They are the same picture .
Other people shot John - John , some excellent , but they wo n't overlay on Stan's .
I can guarantee you that there is not an original negative other than Stan's ( at Corbis ) on that shot .
If there is a negative , it is a copy .
( These days , you 'd just scan it and print ) . "
The image of John - John 's salute began a deep and evolving investigation across the landscape of photojournalism .
The UPI Downhold list continues to post the latest evidence of the true photographers ' names .
It did n't take much time at all to identify many of the images O'Donnell claimed to have taken .
Web sites which have or had presented " his " pictures tell their own story ( they are disappearing or having " maintenance " work done ) .
On MindSpring the words " White House Memories " headline the cover page of a site selling what O'Donnell claimed to be his own pictures — only they are n't .
Underneath is a quote : " ' The people I met and witnessed were incredible .
The images I took with my Speed Graphic were ingrained in my heart . '
A White House photographer , Joe O'Donnell , " and then , " The images of the classic golden years taken through the eye of his camera are now available on the Internet marketing . "
Inside there are two galleries : the first , President Kennedy and his life ; the second , Presidents Roosevelt through Johnson , Vice President Nixon and V.I.P .
In the first gallery is another Stan Stearns photograph of the Kennedys – Jacqueline , Bobby and Ted walking together enroute with the casket of President Kennedy .
While O'Donnell may have had an occasional assignment at the White House he was not a " White House photographer . "
There are records , not to mention institutional memory .
" We know he was n't a White House photographer .
There are details on Roosevelt 's travel .
There is absolutely nothing that connects him to Roosevelt except that he was alive at the time , " said Joe Chapman on 9/1 .
Indeed , O'Donnell asserted that he took a picture of FDR and Eleanor after the second inauguration .
He would have been about 14 years old in 1937 .
Looking at the " White House Memories " site and other so - called O'Donnell collections , Chapman continues , " There is no difference between other photographs O'Donnell claimed and those of Mark Shaw , Elliott Erwitt , and others .
The overlays demonstrate they are identical .
[ Capt . ]
Cecil Stoughton shot the LBJ swearing - in on Air Force One without any assistance from O'Donnell .
A lot of people have worked cooperatively on this .
This is just hokum . "
Also on O'Donnell 's " White House Memories " gallery page is a link : " How To Order . "
Here one can purchase an 8 x 10 for $ 120 or the image on canvas for $ 295 and a handling cost of $ 25 .
A fairly stiff price for someone else 's work .
At his gallery 's site , The Arts Company / Nashville , his name and work has been expunged ( although his wife Kimiko Sakai 's photographic work seems to be there ) .
When we first checked the site they were announcing O'Donnell 's upcoming retrospective : " The Arts Company will be presenting a commemorative exhibit of Mr. O'Donnell 's presidential and Hiroshima photographs in the early fall .
Exact time and details to be announced in September . "
There are currently no references to that event .
Did anyone at the gallery know the provenance of the work it displayed on its Web site ?
Joe O'Donnell said he had made the portrait of President Truman after he was sworn in as president .
Going to the Truman Library site , one discovers that the same picture is used on every page .
Clicking on the portrait brings up a page with the archival record of the portrait that states : " Portrait of President Harry S. Truman , which was used as the official campaign photo for the 1948 campaign .
A favorite of the President . "
It was made c.1945 by Frank Gatteri .
In the Oral History section is an interview with Gerald Paul Pulley , Commander U.S. Navy , on June 17 , 1993 .
Pulley was the official photographer to President Truman .
Pulley traces the presidential photographers from Coolidge through Truman .
He does n't mention O'Donnell .
As information about O'Donnell came to light Cmdr. Pulley , who will be 85 in October , was contacted by the UPI group .
He had never heard of O'Donnell .
If O'Donnell was at the White House during the Kennedy years he would have worked for Capt .
Stoughton but he does n't know who O'Donnell is either .
Pulley further said , " And following the death of Franklin Roosevelt , there was a lapsed period where President Truman did n't insist on having a personal photographer .
For one thing , I think it was because he was concerned it might cost the taxpayers some money , and he was n't about to do that .
So it was n't until late in ' 47 that they decided they better get a photographer , and they convinced him that they could do like Roosevelt had done and have a Navy photographer support him . "
There are five photographs by O'Donnell on the Truman Library site : four are of Truman and his friends grouse hunting ( no more than mediocre images ) and one listing of " Margaret Truman with Connecticut dignitaries . "
One final comparison — of the many possible — is the photograph of LBJ being sworn in on Jan. 20 , 1965 .
The original picture was clearly labeled " UPI TELEPHOTO . "
O'Donnell cropped an image as he had done in the John - John photograph and presented it as his own .
Since the one he claimed has a change in the position of the person in the white coat there is speculation that this image may be the frame next to the UPI original wire photo made by the same photographer .
O'Donnell claimed other photographers ' work as his own but was careful to have " Sample " printed across the surface to prevent the photograph from being easily stolen from him .
O'Donnell originally claimed to have taken the photograph of FDR , Winston Churchill and Josef Stalin at the " Yalta " conference .
The first mistake was that the picture was made at the Tehran conference earlier .
Just sticking to his own biography , he must have been in two places at once because the occurred at the time he said he was working as an Army photographer in the Pacific .
What can we make of this ?
Apparently an unknown press photographer took it upon himself to re-present well - known pictures made by known photographers for his own benefit and glory .
He took credit for others ' photographs in writing and during interviews .
This was not a mistake of memory ; it was intentional .
The New York Times , The Tennessean , American Photo , The Boston Globe , and many other press organizations bought it hook , line and sinker .
The New York Times apparently questioned the public - relations man who fed them the story and pictures .
He reassured them twice that the print was the real thing .
The discrepancies were known by the next day yet as of today , Sunday , Sept. 2 , no correction has been published .
Many people are researching the detailed presidential diaries and travel logs as well as O'Donnell 's assertions that he took many photographs in Japan after the atomic bombs were dropped in two cities about 200 miles apart .
Some of these can be identified as taken by other photographers and others are dubious .
There were careful records of who was in Atomic Japan and when .
He traveled there many times with his wife Kimiko , also a photographer .
In the meantime , the press record needs correcting — but who 's minding the store ?
With Joe Chapman , Bernard Cleary , Tom Foty , Gary Haynes and Stanley Stearns
It ’s very clear that Apple has tremendous foresight , sometimes to their own detriment , with the design of both hardware and software .
Back in the good old days , when I was but a wee little Wirehead , Apple managed to make hardware that was much more compatible and easy to deal with than your average off - the - shelf piece of consumer hardware .
You could plug your mouse into your keyboard and the keyboard into your computer .
You could add cards and they ’d just plain work .
You did n’t need to write a separate “ Program Manager ” and “ File Manager ” because the whole system was conceptually simple enough to make do with just a directory browser .
Apple tried to license their OS in the past , but it almost killed them .
In the past few years , we ’ve finally reached a parity point where plain old Intel hardware is pretty much “ good enough ” and you can now run a PC operating system on the Mac .
Which really brings up the question of why Apple is preventing you from installing OS X on your computer at home .
The argument is made that Apple is able to restrict the available hardware for the Mac so that they do n’t have driver hell , which I do n’t quite buy .
The existing Mac hardware is all usable in a PC architecture system , easy to find , and able to be used as a “ Oh , well if it does n’t have the OS X logo , I guess I ca n’t use it in my PC - Mac ” standard .
The way I see things , Apple will not let you run OS X on your PC until the reasons why licensing MacOS did n’t work last time do n’t hold anymore .
And we ’re not there yet .
The first barrier is Office .
Apple needs to make sure that they are in a position of power with Microsoft to ensure that Office continues to be available .
Alternatively , OpenOffice or an AJAX online office package need to become the standard .
This seems awfully close , especially given Apple ’s mindshare .
The second barrier is the hardware OS - subsidy .
See , a Mac gives Apple the opportunity to collect what would be two streams of income .
Even without a price premium just for the Apple brand , if Apple were to let HP make computers and charge about what Windows costs for OS X , they ’d make less money , assuming they did n’t grow their market .
The third barrier is the expense of keeping up .
Apple needs a certain amount of effort to be able to keep developing OS X and , at the same time , give it features that are cooler and more interesting than Windows .
Right now , they are winning .
But if they make less money per OS X desktop , they might fall below the essential income point .
On the other side of the fence , there ’s the currently untapped market .
I ’m part of the way in that .
See , just about everything I want to do can be done on the Mac .
But I ’ve got a PC that I ’ve been incrementally upgrading , so if I wanted to go Mac , I ’d have to junk the whole thing .
If I could Mac - ify it without doing that , I ’d be much more likely to make the jump .
So , what it ends up being is that Apple is n’t going to jump until , by their calculations , the income from the currently - untapped market outweighs the potential downside .
Corollary : if they get Microsoft - sized , it will likely be anti-trust related .
Oh , and there ’s one more thing .
The MacBook and MacPro are chipping away at the currently - untapped market .
See , I ’ve recognized that the MacBook is head and shoulders above any available PC laptop , so any future laptops for personal use are likely to be Apple branded as well .
If I stop using my desktop computer as my primary workstation , I ’m likely to instead use it as a hefty Linux personal server .
The same goes for the MacPro — because of Intel ’s Xeon branding , it ’s easier to get a MacPro as a powerful desktop when one processor is n’t enough .

" ( The biology students ' ) assignment was to grow various herbs , vegetables , annuals and perennials , but not marijuana .

The Ann Arbor News
The University of Michigan 's Matthaei Botanical Gardens is known for its collection of diverse and exotic plants , but employees and police were surprised by what they found mixed in with a student project Monday morning .
Police confiscated 11 small green plants believed to be cannabis Monday morning after an employee responsible for monitoring a biology course 's research project found the suspicious sprouts , said U - M Police Lt. Bob Neumann .
The plants were found on the corner of a large table inside a greenhouse of the gardens off of Dixboro Road in Ann Arbor Township .
" ( The biology students ' ) assignment was to grow various herbs , vegetables , annuals and perennials , but not marijuana , " Neumann said .
" I 've never heard of this happening before and it 's definitely unusual , and gutsy . "
Neumann said samples will be taken to the Michigan State Police crime lab for evidence collection and testing .
About 80 students in a single biology course are participating in the project , which will continue , Neumann said .
He said the plants appear to have been planted at the beginning of the semester .

Berlusconi delights in the company of glamorous women
Italian opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi has claimed that right - wing female politicians are better looking than their left - wing counterparts .
Mr Berlusconi , the centre - right 's candidate in elections this weekend , was quoted as telling local media that the left had " no taste " in women .
The conservative leader has a long record of making outlandish comments .
His remarks provoked an angry reaction from the centre - left , which accused him of being sexist .
Mr Berlusconi was quoted as saying that when he looked round parliament , he found that female politicians from the right were " more beautiful " .
" The left has no taste , even when it comes to women , " the 71 - year - old was quoted as saying .
Last year , Mr Berlusconi was forced to apologise to his wife for flirting with other women after she demanded a public apology .
He has promised to name at least four women in his cabinet if he is elected as prime minister for a third time .
A seventh report from the South Waziristan Institute of Strategic Hermeneutics to the al - Qaida Strategic Planning Cell ( SPC ) on the progress of the campaign and its ultimate realisation .
Click here to read earlier reports .
Thank you for inviting us to deliver a further report on the progress of your movement .
You will recall that our work for your planning cell commenced with an initial assessment in July 2004 , a follow - up in January 2005 and further reports in February 2006 and September 2006 .
Because of your concerns over the outcome of the United States mid-sessional elections to Congress in November 2006 you asked us to present an additional report , which we did in December .
We appreciate that it is unusual for you to require a further analysis so soon after our last report in November 2007 , but we understand that the pace of events in Iraq , Pakistan and Afghanistan - amid the wider context of the United States presidential election campaign , is such that a further assessment would be useful .
We further understand that you are particularly interested in the recent developments in the US and that you require an assessment as to whether your movement should take any action in the context of its forthcoming election in November 2008 .
We will therefore review briefly the developments in the other countries before focussing on that element .
Finally , you wish us to make an initial assessment of your ultimate aim of establishing a new caliphate .
This we will do in the spirit of openness that you have sought in the past .
Our conclusions may not be expected and it is possible that this will be the last report you will commission from us .
Pakistan and Afghanistan
The benefit we have of operating in western Pakistan is one denied to most analysts .
It allows us to draw attention to one of the most important features of the 18 February elections in the country , which was missed by most foreign commentators : the exceptionally low turn - out - below 30 % overall , and below 20 % in some districts .
This alone means that too much is being made of the outcome .
Within that context , three features of the election and its aftermath are relevant .
The first is that the decline in the size of the Islamist vote is less significant than it might appear , given the decision by some parties to boycott the elections .
Some argue that such boycotts were solely aimed to avert the embarrassment of certain defeat ; but the real point is that in many parts of western Pakistan , elections are simply not relevant since politics works in other ways .
The second point is that Pervez Musharraf has been much weakened by the election outcome ; even if he survives , he will carry very little authority .
This is a concern for the United States which had hoped for a link - up between Musharraf and the Bhutto family 's Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) .
If a PPP / Nawaz Sharif coalition emerges instead ( as seems more likely ) , the result is both no guarantee of stability and greater government caution than would otherwise have been the case about supporting or endorsing US military actions in Pakistan .
The third and most important point is the revelation this week that the CIA has been operating Predator drones from a base within Pakistan .
In one incident , an armed Predator from this base which fired two Hellfire missiles at a target ( also within Pakistan ) killed a senior paramilitary leader and many other people .
Many observers had assumed that such deployments were indeed part of US policy ; this , however , is direct confirmatory evidence that will in due course lead to major problems for the evolving coalition in Islamabad .
Across the border in Afghanistan , we are aware from our local contacts that your Taliban associates are in a position to undertake major actions in spring and summer 2008 ; we also know that the leadership has excellent intelligence on the build - up of US and British forces in the south and southeast of the country .
We have good reason to doubt that a spring offensive will develop as widely predicted .
If so , then Nato commanders will hail this as a victory .
But they will be wrong .
The Taliban leadership operates with a markedly sophisticated level of military leadership that is recognised among some of the more intelligent senior officers within Nato - though not by the alliance as a whole and certainly not by the western media .
This is important enough , but an additional and even more significant development in Afghanistan is the extent to which paramilitaries are now applying the tactics and deploying the munitions developed in Iraq .
We strongly doubt that they are going to be in the business of frontal military assaults at any time in the next six months .
Instead , they will almost certainly melt away in the face of the additional US marines and Britain 's Parachute Regiment forces which will arrive in Helmand province in the coming weeks ; and rely far more on urban guerrilla warfare , especially in Kabul , making much use of martyr attacks .
The scale of the revenues now accruing from the drugs trade , especially the move towards the highly profitable refining of raw opium paste into heroin and morphine within Afghanistan , suggests to us the direction of Taliban strategy .
Its militia will opt for a slow but persistent campaign stretching over three to four years , designed to wear down the commitment of some Nato states ( Canada is the initial focus here ) .
The longer - term nature of this effort means that over the shorter term , Nato may be able to foster the impression of some success and progress .
Again , this will be a highly misleading interpretation .
Iraq
The United States military surge has had some effect , but ( as we argued in November 2007 ) this should not cause you concern .
As our report then said :
" The Bush administration , and especially its neo-conservative elements , has now focused on an overall Iraqi narrative of ' probability of victory ' .
We know this is a chimera but they do not .
The consequence of this is that the administration will aim to downgrade the Iraq war in the public consciousness in the coming months , even as the surge is forced to come to an end because of military overstretch . "
In the past three months that has proved an accurate prognosis .
There has been a recent increase in violence in Iraq , but not enough to have an impact within the United States .
Unless there are very major changes in the coming months , the US is not going to have its " Suez moment " - as Britain did when facing up to its declining imperial power and the need for decolonisation in the wake of the brief Suez war of 1956 .
We also pointed out in our last report that the oil factor remains a foundation of US security policy in the region , and that this alone makes any full - scale withdrawal from Iraq unlikely for some decades .
Although circumstances will not always be as favourable as 2006 - 07 , rest assured that your paramilitary combat - training zone in Iraq will remain viable and of great use to you for the foreseeable future .
The US election campaign
What then of US politics ?
Three months ago we , like most analysts , saw Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton as the frontrunners .
We thought Clinton was the best of the Democratic candidates for you , given her relatively hardline stance on middle - east policy , and we regarded Giuliani as even better .
Times have certainly changed ( as we did say was possible ... ) and John McCain now looks the overwhelmingly likely Republican candidate with Barack Obama emerging as the probable ( though not yet certain ) candidate on the Democratic side .
From your point of view , McCain is reasonably good news .
He is reliably hawkish on Iraq and Afghanistan , and although the political momentum of an incoming president gives a conservative president greater scope for policy reversals , we believe the power of the defence and energy lobbies may be too strong for any major changes to come in a McCain first term .
We cannot , however , be certain .
It is possible for hawkish leaders ( who have thus established their security credentials ) to become unexpectedly flexible in office - witness Charles de Gaulle and Algeria , Richard Nixon and China , Yitzhak Rabin and the Palestinians .
You should therefore entertain the possibility of McCain using his " honeymoon " period ( if you will permit us an exotic idiom ) to order a radical withdrawal from Iraq .
If he does , then your immediate response must be a very strong message hailing victory for your movement .
This could well lead to a reversal of his policy .
A new perspective is offered by Barack Obama 's progress , and we assume that this is the matter that most concerns you .
If Obama does succeed in winning the Democratic nomination , and if he then survives the very heavy pressure on him from the Republican machine , then he may be in a strong position as the election approaches .
It is at this stage that you may wish to consider your options .
These , however - we would stress - depend primarily on how you would expect Obama to perform as president in relation to how you would most like the United States to behave .
What is best for you is that the United States remains resolute in its support for Israel , Saudi Arabia and Egypt ; fully addicted to oil and therefore determined to remain dominant in the Persian Gulf ; and prepared to continue to pursue its war against you with the utmost vigour .
In other words , eight more years for George W Bush would have been ideal .
Sadly for your movement , that can not be .
What , then , of Obama ?
The candid answer is that we can not be sure .
All the rhetoric notwithstanding , we actually expect little change should he be elected .
Yet since we cannot be certain , we would recommend that any sign of his leading the polls close to the actual election date should be met by strong statements from your leader , welcoming the possibility of the election of a president with whom you can do business .
That should do much to prevent his being elected .
The long term
Finally , you ask our opinion on your long - term prospects .
We have always taken the view that this is a conflict likely to stretch over decades , and we anticipate that you will eventually take control of a country in the middle east or southwest Asia , as a prelude to establishing a new caliphate .
The most propitious time for this to happen is when your " far enemy " has had enough of its burdensome military entanglements , an event that you will no doubt see and claim as a great victory .
Yet we are obliged ( to use another exotic idiom ) to speak truth to power .
In the context of your success in winning control of an individual state , the principle enjoins us to express the conviction that only then will your problems really start .
While our institute specialises in strategic hermeneutics , we also cover other disciplines , not least political sociology ; and our belief is that your version of uncompromising Islamist rule is as unsustainable in the early 21st century as is the American notion that the US can indefinitely occupy countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan .
Your Taliban associates were initially welcomed by many Afghans in the mid-1990s as a stabilising force in the face of the horrors of warlord rule .
Even by 2000 , though , the doctrinaire rigidity of its regime was losing the movement support .
One of the great unknowns of the decade is what would have happened to the Taliban regime if the 9/11 attacks had failed .
We suspect that its regime would have been forced to moderate its style of governance , as indeed was already starting to happen in 2001 .
You invoke and celebrate the Abbasids , a thousand years ago , as the greatest Islamic caliphate in history ; and you seek to recreate that greatness .
But for much of their 250 - year history , the Abbasids oversaw a flowering of art , architecture , medicine , mathematics and the sciences ; they were also notably tolerant of Christians and Jews .
We do not see similar attitudes in the speeches and writings of your leaders .
Instead there is a dogmatism of attitude that we think would not allow you to hold power even for a decade - let alone a century .
It is said that revolutions change merely the accents of the elites , and we fear that such would be the consequence of your movement coming to power .
A lack of flexibility would lead to unbending pursuit of a false purity that would decay rapidly into a bitter autocracy , leading quite possibly to a counter - revolution .
If you really want to succeed then you have to engage in thinking that goes far beyond what appear to be the limits and flaws of your current analysis .
We would be happy to assist , but we doubt that your leadership will be willing to allow us to do so .
We therefore submit this as possibly our last report .

South Waziristan
28 February 2008
This is the tenth report openDemocracy has published from the South Waziristan Institute of Strategic Hermeneutics ( SWISH ) .
Six have advised al - Qaida , two the British governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown , and one the United States state department :
" The SWISH Report " ( 14 July 2004 ) – to al - Qaida :
" The immediate requirement …is therefore to aid , in any way within the framework of your core values , the survival of the Bush administration . "
" The SWISH Report ( 2 ) " ( 13 January 2005 ) - to al - Qaida :
" You are … in the early stages of a decades - long confrontation , and early ‘ success ' should not in any way cause you to underestimate the problems that lie ahead . "
" The SWISH Report ( 3 ) " ( 19 May 2005 ) – to the British government :
" We believe that disengagement from Iraq , more emphasis on post - conflict reconstruction in Afghanistan , and vigorous diplomacy in support of a two - state Israel / Palestine solution offer you the best short - term hope of avoiding further damage to your government 's credibility in relation to the United States - led war on terror . "
" The SWISH Report ( 4 ) " ( 1 September 2005 ) – to the United States state department :
" What we find quite extraordinary is the manner in which the full extent of your predicament in Iraq is still not appreciated by your political leadership . "
" The SWISH Report ( 5 ) " ( 2 February 2006 ) – to al - Qaida :
" The greatest risk to your movement is that the opinions of some of the sharper analysts on both sides of the Atlantic begin to transcend those of the political and religious fundamentalists that currently dominate the scene .
If that were to happen , then you could be in serious trouble within two or three years . "
" The SWISH Report ( 6 ) " ( 7 September 2006 ) – to al - Qaida :
" ( The ) influence of your movement and your leader is considerable , but you are not in control of your own strategy ; rather , you form just one part of a wider process that is as diffuse and unpredictable as it is potent .
You could point to the United States failure to control its global war on terror and you would be correct to do so .
You could then claim that it is your own movement that is setting the pace - but you would be wrong .
The truly revealing development of recent months is that we have reached a point , five years after 9/11 where no one , but no one , is in control . "
" The SWISH Report ( 7 ) " ( 7 December 2006 ) – to al - Qaida :
" In Afghanistan and Iraq , as well as across the wider middle east , it is the power and influence of the United States that is in crisis .
Your movement may not be entirely coherent and the overall circumstances may be more complex than a few months ago , but it probably has greater potential for enhancement and further development than at any time in the past five years . "
" The SWISH Report ( 8 ) " ( 16 May 2007 ) - to the British govern - ment :
" Radical changes in your policies in relation to Iraq and Israel are es-sential , together with a review of policy options for Afghanistan .
More generally , you must start the process of reorientating political and security thinking towards the real long - term global challenges . "
" The SWISH Report ( 9 ) " ( 29 November 2007 ) - to al - Qaida :
" Our broad conclusions are that your prospects are good .
Developments in Iraq should not worry you ; events in Afghanistan and Pakistan are markedly positive for you ; and the work of your associates elsewhere , including north Africa , is a bonus .
We do have to confess to one concern that may surprise you ...
In a number of western countries the issue of global climate change is rising rapidly up the political agenda and one of the effects of this is to begin to make some analysts and opinion - formers question the western addiction to oil . ”
ad hoc hypothesis
An ad hoc hypothesis is one created to explain away facts that seem to refute ones belief or theory .
Ad hoc hypotheses are common in paranormal research and in the work of pseudoscientists .
For example , ESP researchers have been known to blame the hostile thoughts of onlookers for unconsciously influencing pointer readings on sensitive instruments .
The hostile vibes , they say , made it impossible for them to duplicate a positive ESP experiment .
Being able to duplicate an experiment is essential to confirming its validity .
Of course , if this objection is taken seriously , then no experiment on ESP can ever fail .
Whatever the results , one can always say they were caused by paranormal psychic forces , either the ones being tested or others not being tested .
Martin Gardner reports on this type of ad hoc hypothesizing reaching a ludicrous peak with paraphysicist Helmut Schmidt who put cockroaches in a box where they could give themselves electric shocks .
One would assume that cockroaches do not like to be shocked and would give themselves shocks at a chance rate or less , if cockroaches can learn from experience .
The cockroaches gave themselves more electric shocks than predicted by chance .
Schmidt concluded that " because he hated cockroaches , maybe it was his pk that influenced the randomizer ! " ( Gardner , p. 59 )
Ad hoc hypotheses are common in defense of the pseudoscientific theory known as biorhythm theory .
For example , there are very many people who do not fit the predicted patterns of biorhythm theory .
Rather than accept this fact as refuting evidence of the theory , a new category of people is created : the arrhythmic .
In short , whenever the theory does not seem to work , the contrary evidence is systematically discounted .
Advocates of biorhythm theory claimed that the theory could be used to accurately predict the sex of unborn children .
However , W. S. Bainbridge , a professor of sociology at the University of Washington , demonstrated that the chance of predicting the sex of an unborn child using biorhythms was 50 / 50 , the same as flipping a coin .
An expert in biorhythms tried unsuccessfully to predict accurately the sexes of the children in Bainbridge 's study based on Bainbridge 's data .
The expert 's spouse suggested to Bainbridge an interesting ad hoc hypothesis , namely , that the cases where the theory was wrong probably included many homosexuals with indeterminate sex identities !
Astrologers are often fond of using statistical data and analysis to impress us with the scientific nature of astrology .
Of course , a scientific analysis of the statistical data does not always pan out for the astrologer .
In those cases , the astrologer can make the data fit the astrological paradigm by the ad hoc hypothesis that those who do not fit the mold have other , unknown influences that counteract the influence of the dominant planets .
Using ad hoc hypotheses is not limited to pseudoscientists .
Another type of ad hoc hypothesis occurs in science when a new scientific theory is proposed which conflicts with an established theory and which lacks an essential explanatory mechanism .
An ad hoc hypothesis is proposed to explain what the new theory cannot explain .
For example , when Wegener proposed his theory of continental drift he could not explain how continents move .
It was suggested that gravity was the force behind the movement of continents , though there was no scientific evidence for this notion .
In fact , scientists could and did show that gravity was too weak a force to account for the movement of continents .
Alexis du Toit , a defender of Wegener 's theory , argued for radioactive melting of the ocean floor at continental borders as the mechanism by which continents might move .
Stephen Jay Gould noted that " this ad hoc hypothesis added no increment of plausibility to Wegener 's speculation . "
( Gould , p. 160 )
Finally , rejecting explanations that require belief in occult , supernatural or paranormal forces in favor of simpler and more plausible explanations is called applying Occam 's razor .
It is not the same as ad hoc hypothesizing .
For example , let 's say I catch you stealing a watch from a shop .
You say you did not steal it .
I ask you to empty your pockets .
You agree and pull out a watch .
I say , " Aha ! , I was right .
You stole the watch . "
You reply that you did not steal the watch , but you admit that it was not in your pocket when we went into the store .
I ask you to explain how the watch got into your pocket and you say that you used telekinesis : you used your thoughts to transport the watch out of a glass case into your pocket .
I ask you to repeat the act with another watch and you say " ok . "
Try as you will , however , you cannot make a watch magically appear in your pocket .
You say that there is too much pressure on you to perform or that there are too many bad vibes in the air for you to work your powers .
You have offered an ad hoc hypothesis to explain away what looks like a good refutation of your claim .
My hypothesis that the watch is in your pocket because you stole it , is not an ad hoc hypothesis .
I have chosen to believe a plausible explanation rather than an implausible one .
Likewise , given the choice between believing that my headache went away of its own accord or that it went away because some nurse waved her hands over my hand while chanting a mantra , I will opt for the former every time .
It is always more reasonable to apply Occam 's razor than to offer speculative ad hoc hypotheses just to maintain the possibility of something supernatural or paranormal .

Unnatural Acts : ad hoc hypothesis
Gardner , Martin .
The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener ( New York : Quill , 1983 ) .
When a professor invents a machine that writes books , and then uses that machine to write more than 200,000 different books , there arises the question , " Why ? "
Philip M Parker , a professor of management science at Insead , the international business school based in Fontainebleau , France , patented what he calls a " method and apparatus for automated authoring and marketing " .
Turn to page 16 of his patent , and you will see him answer the " Why ? " question .
Parker quotes a 1999 complaint by the Economist that publishing " has continued essentially unchanged since Gutenberg .
Letters are still written , books bound , newspapers printed and distributed much as they ever were . "
" Therefore , " says Parker , " there is a need for a method and apparatus for authoring , marketing , and / or distributing title materials automatically by a computer . "
He explains that " further , there is a need for an automated system that eliminates or substantially reduces the costs associated with human labour , such as authors , editors , graphic artists , data analysts , translators , distributors , and marketing personnel . "
The book - writing machine works simply , at least in principle .
First , one feeds it a recipe for writing a particular genre of book - a tome about crossword puzzles , say , or a market outlook for products .
Then hook the computer up to a big database full of info about crossword puzzles or market information .
The computer uses the recipe to select data from the database and write and format it into book form .
Parker estimates that it costs him about 12 p to write a book , with , perhaps , not much difference in quality from what a competent wordsmith or an MBA might produce .
Nothing but the title need actually exist until somebody orders a copy .
At that point , a computer assembles the book 's content and prints up a single copy .
Among Parker 's bestselling books ( as ranked by Amazon.co.uk ) one finds surprises .
His fifth - best seller is Webster 's Albanian to English Crossword Puzzles : Level 1 .
No 6 : The 2007 Import and Export Market for Ferrous Metal Waste and Scrap Excluding Waste and Scrap of Cast Iron and Alloy Steel in United Kingdom .
No 21 : The 2007 Import and Export Market for Seaweeds and Other Algae in France .
No 25 : Oculocutaneous Albinism - A Bibliography and Dictionary for Physicians , Patients and Genome Researchers .
The 2007 - 2012 Outlook for Chinese Prawn Crackers in Japan ( which was mentioned in this space last week ) is Parker 's 66th - best seller .
Rounding out the list , at number 100 , is The 2007 - 2012 Outlook for Edible Tallow and Stearin Made in Slaughtering Plants in Greater China .
Parker is also enthusiastic about books authored the old - fashioned way .
He has written three of them .

People who score high on intelligence tests are also good at keeping time , new Swedish research shows .
The team that carried out the study also suspect that accuracy in timing is important to the brain processes responsible for problem solving and reasoning .
Researchers at the medical university Karolinska Institutet and Umeå University have now demonstrated a correlation between general intelligence and the ability to tap out a simple regular rhythm .
They stress that the task subjects performed had nothing to do with any musical rhythmic sense but simply measured the capacity for rhythmic accuracy .
Those who scored highest on intelligence tests also had least variation in the regular rhythm they tapped out in the experiment .
" It 's interesting as the task did n't involve any kind of problem solving , " says Fredrik Ullén at Karolinska Institutet , who led the study with Guy Madison at Umeå University .
" Irregularity of timing probably arises at a more fundamental biological level owing to a kind of noise in brain activity . "
According to Fredrik Ullén , the results suggest that the rhythmic accuracy in brain activity observable when the person just maintains a steady beat is also important to the problem - solving capacity that is measured with intelligence tests .
" We know that accuracy at millisecond level in neuronal activity is critical to information processing and learning processes , " he says .
They also demonstrated a correlation between high intelligence , a good ability to keep time , and a high volume of white matter in the parts of the brain 's frontal lobes involved in problem solving , planning and managing time .
" All in all , this suggests that a factor of what we call intelligence has a biological basis in the number of nerve fibres in the prefrontal lobe and the stability of neuronal activity that this provides , " says Fredrik Ullén .

Who knew we would be thinking of the ordinary pleasure of going to a movie in our own city with almost the same desperate longing we used to daydream ...
Martin Schoeller
He is in the backseat of a dark SUV -- coffee in hand , dressed in black , hair sharply parted -- and is , for the first time in his life , reading his own Wikipedia entry .
George Timothy Clooney ( born May 6 , 1961 ) is an American actor , director , producer , and screenwriter who gained fame as one of the lead doctors in the long - running television drama ER ( 1994-99 ) .
He pauses .
" Yes , that 's true . "
He attended St. Susanna school . . .
There he developed an interest in theater .
" Sort of . . . "
He was an average student .
" Actually , I pulled out my report cards , " says Clooney .
" I was a much better student than I thought I was .
I had all A's and a B .
So that 's not so bad . "
Clooney injured himself on Syriana 's set , during a torture scene , in 2004 .
He had some excruciating headaches and suffered short - term memory loss .
" And , " he adds , looking at me , " I suffered short - term memory loss . "
You may Google yourself from time to time , but George Clooney does n't .
How could he ?
It 's different for him .
It 's overwhelming .
Its infinite madness could disintegrate a man 's personality .
" George Clooney " pops up on nearly 11 million sites on the Internet .
Spend a day browsing these sites and you will find unfathomable rage and baffling adoration .
You will find America with all its insane colors refracted through the prism of George Clooney .
But George Clooney is also a brave man , and today he has agreed to spend a couple of hours exploring what the Internet has to say about George Clooney .
A sort of This Is Your Virtual Life .
Today he will see things that shock him , scare him , and make him shake with laughter .
He will see things so disturbing that he will walk out of the room horrified .
Also , he will see his own nipples .
But for now , a little after 9:00 a.m. , as we zip down the FDR Drive to the loft where the Esquire photo crew is waiting , he 's reading aloud his comparatively friendly user - generated biography :
He secretly financed and executive - produced a political thriller short film called The Endgame Study in 2006 .
" Never heard of that .
It was so secret , I have no idea what they 're talking about . "
It is rumored that Clooney was the one to have circulated the videotape of Jesus vs. Santa ( the video greeting card that gave birth to South Park ) around the Los Angeles area in 1995 .
" There 's truth to that . "
Michelle Pfeiffer and Nicole Kidman each bet him $ 10,000 that he would be a father before he turned forty .
" When I turn forty , I 'll let you know about that . "
Clooney stirred up controversy for his remarks about Charlton Heston , saying Charlton Heston " announced again today that he is suffering from Alzheimer 's . "
" I wrote him a letter saying I usually avoid making jokes at people 's expense , so I 'm sending you an apology , and I got a really nice letter back from his wife . "
His entry finishes with the Heston flap .
" Huh .
Nice way to end , " says Clooney with a humpf .
But overall , he has to admit , a pretty favorable assessment of his life -- if not entirely accurate .
" The hardest thing is trying not to correct everything on the Internet .
It 'd be night and day -- wrong , wrong , wrong , wrong .
So you just have to say , All right , I 'll take it , bring it on . "
The SUV pulls up to the photo studio .
Or what is supposed to be a photo studio .
It 's an unmarked brown door on a deserted street in Brooklyn .
" Where the hell are we ? " asks Clooney .
" This is a hit , is n't it ? "
Part I : clooney + career
There is no one inside packing heat , just a photo crew , along with coffee and cookies .
Clooney and I withdraw to a bare , industrial , wireless - equipped room in the back .
We sit in low - slung chairs at a long table , facing a MacBook .
I figure it 's still too early to alarm Clooney with the sordid details of his bedroom habits .
Stick to the career for now .
I click to the Internet Movie Database and scroll to his first credit : a part in a 1978 miniseries about the history of Colorado .
Andy Griffith played a professor .
Clooney distinguished himself as the Village Extra .
" They do n't even have my first gig , " he says .
He made his real debut in a horse - racing flick called And They 're Off .
" I did n't even want to be an actor , " he says .
" I was just hanging out with my cousin . "
The movie was shot in Clooney 's home state of Kentucky and starred his cousin Miguel Ferrer .
" I rented my car , a Monte Carlo , to them and got fifty bucks a day .
They gave me a part as an extra .
And Miguel said , Come to L.A. and be an actor .
I had just spent the summer cutting tobacco , which is a miserable job .
So that 's what made me move to Hollywood . "
This one looks interesting : a 1993 thriller called The Harvest .
Clooney is listed as the " lip - syncing transvestite . "
Yeah , he remembers that one .
Wishes he did n't .
He went to visit some buddies on the set in Mexico , and the director asked him to be in the background , wearing a gold lamé dress and mouthing the words to a song .
" It was n't really supposed to be credited , and suddenly this idiot director put our names on it .
It was like , Thanks , pal .
It did n't matter when nobody knew who you are , but now it 's come back to haunt me . "
I take him to YouTube , which has dozens of copyright - infringing clips of his work .
There 's a brilliant ad for Italian vermouth directed by Robert Rodriguez .
And there 's the nonlinear love scene from Out of Sight -- Clooney in white boxers , Jennifer Lopez in the sexiest grandma underwear in history .
A YouTube commentator has written :
I precisely found it pretty awful . . . . =(
" That 's funny , " Clooney says .
" Because that 's usually thought of as a pretty great love scene .
Steven Soderbergh really shot the shit out of that movie .
That one holds up .
I try to get a couple that hold up over the years .
O Brother holds up .
Three Kings [ about the first Iraq war ] will hold up .
Three Kings actually seems like it's newsworthy . "
He pauses .
" And The Peacemaker , of course .
Someday , a group of people will discover that one and give me a posthumous award for that . "
I tell him that , without a doubt , somewhere on the Internet , we can find a fan club for his 1997 belly flop about Russian nukes .
" There 's no such thing , " he insists .
After a couple of minutes , I concede the point .
The closest I can find are a handful of positive reviews of the Peacemaker DVD on Amazon .
I also find this review , which Clooney reads aloud :
George Clooney is about as entertaining to watch as Michael Jackson being raped by the Gorton 's fisherman .
" Wow , that 's an angry cat right there , " says Clooney .
One could argue that some would find that immensely entertaining -- but I agree that I think it is meant as an insult .
" If you want to see angry , look up Batman & Robin , " Clooney says .
He 's right .
The most popular review on Amazon :
I finally understand this movie .
It 's the kind of thing that Ed Wood would have directed if someone had handed him umpty - million dollars and not applied any adult supervision .
Clooney unleashes a big laugh .
" That 's hilarious . "
Because of his various battles with the tabloids , I 'd always considered Clooney to be prickly about criticism .
But I 'm not sure that 's accurate .
In some ways , he 's the most self - aware of celebrities , and he knows that getting trashed is part of the game .
He saw his aunt Rosemary go from superstar to has - been to psychiatric patient to respected elder .
He saw his dad 's career wax and wane .
He understands fame .
" You ever hear of the Hollywood Stock Exchange ? " I ask .
" They set up a stock exchange where people trade celebrities . "
" Really ?
I must be waaaay down .
It 's been a bad year . "
Clooney 's definition of a bad year , apparently , includes an Oscar nomination for Michael Clayton and a $ 311 million gross for Ocean 's Thirteen .
Not to mention the upcoming release of Leatherheads , the first movie he 's directed since his Oscar winner , Good Night , and Good Luck , in 2005 .
Clooney 's stock is trading at $ 46 , down from a career high in 2000 , the year of The Perfect Storm and O Brother , Where Art Thou ?
" What 's Damon at ? " Clooney asks .
" He should be way up .
Forbes did something recently where they said he 's the most bankable star . "
Martin Schoeller
I type in Matt Damon .
" Damon 's at $ 83 .
Damon Wayans is at $ 1.54 . "
" That hurts , " he says .
" That 's unfair to Damon Wayans . "
We play a guessing game to see who 's highest :
Hanks clocks in at $ 139 .
Cruise is $ 116 .
Depp -- $ 115 .
Will Smith wins at $ 168 .
" It 's not necessarily just payday and numbers , " he says , perhaps relieved .
" Because if it was just numbers , Johnny Depp would kill everybody . "
Part II : clooney + handsome
The fact that George Clooney is handsome is an a priori truth .
Triangles have three sides , and Clooney is handsome .
Yet the terrible thing about the Internet is that even a priori truths are called into question .
We are logged on to a Facebook group called " George Clooney is NOT the sexiest man alive . "
" Ninety - four members , " says Clooney as he looks at the photo of himself with a red X through it .
" What the fuck ? "
He reads the site 's manifesto aloud :
I for one am sick and tired of George Clooney thinking hes the sexiest man alive , like jesus hes so old !
It 's just not right .
That man is so full of himself it is n't funny .
Join this group if you totally agree with me .
" Should I defend myself in this one ? "
Clooney dictates and I type :
That 's bullshit .
He looks great for a 70 - year - old .
Clooney likes to make jokes about how he 's an alterkocker .
It helps , of course , when the visible ravages of age are confined to a few gray hairs .
It 's also easier when you 've had your eyes done .
Or at least that 's what a bunch of celebrity sites claim .
Clooney reads aloud from one :
In a bold and unprecedented move for a celebrity , George Clooney openly admitted to having cosmetic surgery .
" I love this one , " he says .
" This was everywhere .
Oprah did a show where Julia Roberts and I interviewed each other .
And Julia said , ' Would you ever consider plastic surgery ? '
And I said , ' I got my eyes done , what do you think ? ' "
Clooney opens his eyes wide , like Betty Boop .
" I was in Italy when it aired , and all of a sudden it was all over the Italian papers .
Once it switches languages and loses all sense of irony , and it 's bouncing back and forth ....
They used to say you can't make a joke in print , but you can get away with it on film .
But now you can't get away with it there . "
He pauses .
" I did get my balls done , though .
I got them unwrinkled .
It 's the new thing in Hollywood -- ball ironing . "
Clooney has also been accused of having hair plugs .
That libel came after his role in Syriana , for which -- to appear more schlubby -- he shaved back the hair on his temples .
In fact , he claims he's got the opposite problem , an advancing hairline :
He 's got a widow 's peak that he shaves .
" Right here , " he says .
" Feel . "
I 've never felt another man 's widow 's - peak stubble .
But Clooney makes the invitation with such ease and confidence , it seems impolite to turn him down .
" Nice , is n't it ? "
I decide to raise the stakes : CelebHeights.com .
It features a bizarrely impassioned debate about Clooney 's height -- with participants arguing for everything from five nine to six one and analyses of his footwear and comparisons to Javier Bardem 's stature .
Deadman15 writes :
The thing i did notice is he doesnt have the best posture ( as stated here many times before ) , and he does do the head tilt thing alot .
" Yes , I slouch , " Clooney says .
" My mother tells me that . "
So what 's the truth ?
According to the man himself , he 's five eleven and a half .
" I saw Donald Trump on Larry King , and he was saying [ here Clooney goes into a Trump impression ] , ' Clooney is a very short guy .
I mean , he 's a tiny guy ....
I do n't want to knock the guy , but he 's very small . '
I met Donald Trump once , and I was sitting at a table .
He came over , shook my hand , and walked away .
I guess I looked about three foot five sitting at the table . "
Part III : clooney +sex
Clooney 's publicist is sitting on a long couch across the room .
He 's been tapping out text messages , trying to put out a fire .
Seems an impostor has been claiming that Clooney 's coming to the Ford Models party tonight .
He 's not .
But as far as hoaxes go , this is a believable one .
I decide Clooney is ready to see a bit about his swinging single life .
We start with an article in a South African newspaper titled I WAS CLOONEY'S VIRGIN LOVE .
Clooney reads it out loud :
Sexy George Clooney gathered a trembling 18 - year - old virgin in his arms , laid her down on his bed , and made such gently passionate , non-penetrative love to her that -- 10 years later -- she still shudders when she recalls the terrific orgasm .
Actress Claudia Wells . . . told Britain's News of the World : " I know a lot of women will think I was crazy not to have had full sex with him , but I 've never regretted it .
Even without full intercourse the sex was terrific .
He stops .
" I know who Claudia Wells is .
I can't imagine she said this . "
So is he denying he gave her a shudder - inducing orgasm ?
" I do n't think that one is true .
But it was twenty years ago , so maybe I did . "
I tell Clooney that I wish I was in a position not to know whether I gave someone a terrific orgasm .
" Yeah , I know .
But twenty years ago -- I 'm having trouble remembering the penetrative love I had . "
( For the record , Wells says , " I 've been trying to get them to take that down for years , " but otherwise declines to comment . )
I click onto a site that features Clooney having penetrative love , but this one is admittedly imaginary .
It 's a fan - fiction site -- a place for Clooney admirers to write steamy short stories .
This story concerns Clooney 's ER character , Doug Ross , Julianna Margulies 's nurse , a hot tub , and words like gripped , caressed , and moan .
Her gentle sucking of his nipples became more frantic .
. . .
Their tongues darted ferociously , as if in a contest of whose could get further inside the other 's mouth .
" You know what ? " says Clooney .
" I think this was actually taken out of Bill O'Reilly 's novel . "
O'Reilly -- who has feuded with Clooney over Clooney 's charitable work -- wrote a 2004 thriller called Those Who Trespass .
" Do yourself a favor one time -- read his novel , " says Clooney .
" It 's fantastic .
It 's like , ' He cupped her small , supple breasts . ' "
( The actual O'Reilly text : " Ashley felt two large hands wrap themselves around her breasts and hot breath on the back of her neck ....
Tommy O'Malley was naked and at attention . " )
Back to real girlfriends .
I bring up a site that has a list of Clooney 's alleged exes , all with accompanying sultry photos .
You 've got a lot , I tell him .
" Well , I 'm old .
I 've been around a long time . "
Clooney fact - checks the site :
Vendela -- " No . "
Celine Balitran -- " Yes . "
Salma Hayek -- " No . "
Brooke Langton -- " Yes . "
Traylor Howard -- " Yes . "
Lucy Liu -- " No . "
Julia Roberts -- " No . "
Renee Zellweger -- " A little bit . "
Jenifer Siebel --
" For a minute . "
Hillary Rowland --
" Do n't know who that is . "
Teri Hatcher -- " No . "
Ellen Barkin --
" Never , but I love her .
She 's a great friend . "
I show him an article in a Canadian paper in which a psychic predicts 2008 is the year in which Clooney will wed .
He 's been dating former Fear Factor contestant Sarah Larson for five months -- enough to inspire jealous sniping on Clooney fan sites .
" I think that wedding one is a bit ahead of its time , " Clooney says .
Well , last year , I say , this psychic predicted the death of Steve Irwin .
He 's unimpressed .
" It 's really hard to predict the death of the Crocodile Hunter .
' I predict the death of the guy who stands under an elephant . ' "
But is there perhaps another reason he wo n't commit ?
I show him a site called " George Clooney is GAY GAY GAY . "
Clooney starts to read :
George Clooney 's life parallels Rock Hudson 's way too much to be a coincidence .
He was married once to some unknown actress --
He breaks off : " No , Talia is not unknown .
She 's actually very successful .... "
He keeps reading :
He dates beautiful women and nothing happens and they disappear into oblivion .
" That 's because I eat them . "
So . . . any truth to this ?
" No .
I 'm gay , gay .
The third gay -- that was pushing it . "
Martin Schoeller
Part IV : clooney + politics
We have just finished a discussion of how gay he is when someone asks Clooney where he 's going after his New York stay .
" I 'm actually going to Darfur . "
Clooney , who cofounded the charity Not on Our Watch , has been named a messenger of peace by the UN , and he 's off on a fifteen - day trip to Africa and Asia .
It 's his second stealth trip to Darfur but his first to Khartoum , the highly unstable capital of Sudan .
Is he nervous ?
" I 'm nervous because [ the UN ] is nervous , " he says .
" I 'm going with a woman from the UN , former U.S. Army .
She 's a badass .
But this is one of those times where you say , I have a really nice house in Italy , do I really want to ... "
He trails off .
I show Clooney a site that has eight different T - shirts urging him to run for office .
Clooney 2008 .
Obama / Clooney .
Sexiest Prez Alive .
There 's also a Facebook group with 357 members imploring him to run for Senate in Kentucky .
Could that be the next step ?
He says no , which will be a relief to the folks at celebpolitics.com , a Website that keeps a watchful eye on liberal actors .
I show Clooney that he has a conservative - friendly rating of - 14 .
He 's a " wacko liberal nutcase . "
( Though Alec Baldwin beats him with a - 21 rating . )
The site highlights a 2003 quote from Clooney :
The problem is , we elected a manager and we need a leader .
Let 's face it : Bush is just dim .
" That was 2003 ? " he says now .
" Gee , gosh , I was wrong about that .
Bush turned out to be really great at all this . "
They also rate your movies , I tell him .
" Oh , good .
I can tell you which one they 'll like the best : O Brother , Where Art Thou ?
That 's my bet .
Because when I 'm around conservative cats , they 'll go [ in a southern accent ] , ' I do like that O Brother , Where Art Thou ? movie . ' "
Nope , that one 's Toxic Liberal Waste .
As are almost all of his other movies .
We click on whitehouse.gov .
We 're in luck .
President Bush will be answering submitted questions later in the day .
" Here 's one I 've been wanting to ask the last few weeks . "
I type it in for him :
Where 's Dick Cheney ?
" There 's a couple of options , " Clooney surmises .
" They 're keeping him out because he 's the only person with a lower approval rating than Bush .
Or he 's out hunting lawyers . "
( Bush did not answer the question , opting instead for this one from Gioia : " Who picks your attire for all the important events you attend ?
Love your ties . "
Responding , " Dear Gioia , I pick my own suits and my own ties .
Thank you for the compliment about the ties , and thank you for your question . " )
Part V : clooney + fights
For such an easygoing guy , Clooney always seems to be facing off with someone , at least in Crazyland .
Even his friendships are seen as hot rivalries .
I show him a site that says he is having something called a " bromance " with Brad Pitt :
They 're both very famous and both have been voted sexiest man alive , so really they belong together .
" Well , you know , if I was a girl and he was a girl , and I was a lesbian and he was a lesbian , I 'd be all over him , " says Clooney .
So I show him something a little tougher .
Apparently his most recent battle has been with Fabio , with whom he argued at a restaurant .
Something about Fabio's fans taking photos and Clooney not wanting to be in the background of the pictures .
Fabio has just been quoted about it in GQ .
Clooney reads about it with a Schwarzeneggerian accent :
He is a dog whose noise is worse than his bite .
" Did he really say that ?
He could n't have said that . "
He ate more than he could chew .
" It 's like a Saturday Night Live sketch .
Nobody says things like that . "
I could have beaten the bleep out of him .
" Yeah , that 's probably true .
He 's a big guy .
I would n't doubt that .
There is a moment when you 're actually in the argument and you 're thinking , If I do get beaten down by Fabio , that will be far worse than the pain .
I would n't shake that . "
That seems to remind Clooney of something else .
" Someone just came after me , " he says .
" Some actor went off on a fucking rant on me , like a drunken rampage .
I wish I could remember who , because it'd be a fun one to see . "
After a few minutes , we figure out the actor in question is British actor Rupert Everett .
I call up the page and we start to read :
Clooney thinks that , provided he does films which are politically committed , he 's allowed to do Ocean 's 11 , 12 , and 13 .
But the Ocean 's movies are a cancer to world culture .
They 're destroying us , Everett told The Independent .
" You go , Where did that come from ? " he says .
" You kind of go , Dude , were n't you in Dunston Checks In ? "
Part VI : monkey + butt
Clooney 's been pretty comfortable with all this so far .
He 's not easily thrown by his own fame or by the brutal assessments of the fame obsessed .
But what about the larger dangers of the Web ?
I realize that I 've spent a couple of hours showing Clooney sites about Clooney , but I have n't asked him , Does he ever go on the Internet ?
" I go on YouTube when somebody says to look something up , " he answers .
" There was one a few years ago that killed me .
Look up ' monkey smells butt . ' "
I type it in .
Up pops a video of a chimp sticking his finger up his butt , smelling it , then promptly passing out .
Clooney roars with laughter .
" He just smells it and goes woooah and flops off the side .
That always kills me . "
At this point , I make a segue that seemed relevant at the time but in retrospect was probably a very bad idea .
" You know , " I tell him , " I asked the guy who does the Esquire Website what I should show George Clooney , and he said , ' Show him 2 Girls 1 Cup . ' "
" What 's that ? "
" It 's the most disturbing video in the history of videos . "
" Show it to me . "

THE number of veterans taking Viagra - type drugs for impotence caused by war service has skyrocketed at the cost of millions of dollars to the taxpayer .
The drugs , which are used to help men suffering from erectile dysfunction ( ED ) , cost the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme $ 2.6 million last year , an increase of $ 1 million over five years .
The cost has risen every year since subsidies were introduced in 1999 .
The tail measures a massive 13 light years in length
The appendage , which measures a colossal 13 light years in length , was spotted by Nasa 's Galaxy Evolution Explorer ( Galex ) space telescope .
The researchers said that nothing like it had ever been spotted around a star .
They believe the star , known as Mira , will help them to study what happens as stars meet their demise .
Mark Seibert , a co-author of the paper , which was published in the journal Nature , and a scientist at the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena , said : " This is an utterly new phenomenon to us , and we are still in the process of understanding the physics involved . "
Racing through space
Mira ( also called Mira A ) has captivated astronomers for more than 400 years .
It sits about 350 light - years from Earth in a constellation known as Cetus , and is accompanied in orbit by a smaller secondary star , called Mira B , forming a binary system .
Billions of years ago , Mira would have been much like our Sun , but as it now enters its death - throes it has swollen into a type of star known as a red giant .
As it races through space at 130 km /s ( 80 miles per second ) it sheds vast amounts of material .
After 400 years of study , Mira continues to astound
Research team
Yet despite centuries of study , its spectacular tail had remained undetected .
Now , ultraviolet images taken by the Galex space telescope have uncovered Mira 's unusual feature .
Barry Madore , a co-author of the paper and senior research astronomer at the Carnegie Observatories , said : " Galex is so exquisitely sensitive to ultraviolet light and it has such a wide field of view that it is uniquely poised to scan the sky for previously undiscovered ultraviolet activity .
" The fact that Mira 's tail only glows with ultraviolet light might explain why other telescopes have missed it . "
The ultraviolet images also revealed a " bow shock " - a region , in front of the star , where hot gas builds up as Mira 's stellar wind meets clouds of interstellar gas and dust .
The team believes that the hot gas in the bow shock is heating up gas that the star is shedding to create a turbulent tail trailing in its wake .
The scientists said that the tail was made up of the material that Mira has been ejecting over a period of 30,000 years .
Mark Seibert said : " We hope to be able to read Mira 's tail like a ticker tape to learn about the star 's life . "
Studying the carbon , oxygen and other elements that make up the tail , the team said , could also provide an insight into how new solar systems and possibly even life are formed .
" After 400 years of study , Mira continues to astound , " the team concluded .
GERMANY was the world 's biggest exporter in 2007 , raking in some $ 1.3 trillion from exports and accounting for 9.5 % of all merchandise exports , according to preliminary figures from the World Trade Organisation .
China and America were close behind .
Together the three account for a quarter of the world 's exports .
America was by some way the biggest importer , sucking in a staggering $ 2 trillion of merchandise from abroad , nearly twice as much as its nearest rival , Germany .
Growth in merchandise exports fell to 5.5 % from 8.5 % in 2006 as demand weakened in developed economies .

Kerry Howley writes about GM food in Africa :
In May 2002 , in the midst of a severe food shortage in sub-Saharan Africa , the government of Zimbabwe turned away 10,000 tons of corn from the World Food Program ( WFP ) .
The WFP then diverted the food to other countries , including Zambia , where 2.5 million people were in need .
The Zambian government locked away the corn , banned its distribution , and stopped another shipment on its way to the country .
“ Simply because my people are hungry , ” President Levy Mwanawasa later said , “ is no justification to give them poison . ”
The corn came from farms in the United States , where most corn produced — and consumed — comes from seeds that have been engineered to resist some pests , and thus qualifies as genetically modified .
Throughout the 90s , genetically modified foods were seen as holding promise for the farmers of Africa , so long as multinationals would invest in developing superior African crops rather than extend the technology only to the rich .
When Zambia and Zimbabwe turned away food aid , simmering controversy over the crops themselves brimmed over and seeped into almost every African state .
Cast as toxic to humans , destructive to the environment , and part of a corporate plot to immiserate the poor , cutting edge farming technology is most feared where it is most needed .
My understanding at the time was that this was even worse than ignorance :
Africans keep out relief grain because they know that farmers will hold some of it for seed .
They were afraid that if GM entered the food chain , they would that never , ever be able to export any plant products to Europe because of their stringent regulations ( these have , I believe , been somewhat relaxed ) .
So even if the president of Zambia knew GM was harmless , he could n't risk permanently impairing his country 's economic guture .
Richard Quest , a reporter and business travel specialist for CNN , is being arraigned today on a misdemeanor charge of drug possession after the authorities said he was found with methamphetamine in Central Park .
Mr. Quest was arrested early Friday morning after being escorted out of Central Park for violating the park curfew , a law enforcement official said Friday .
The park is closed from 1 a.m. to 6 a.m .
The police noticed Mr. Quest at 64th Street and West Drive at about 3:40 a.m. , the official said .
As he was being escorted out , he volunteered , “ I have meth in my pocket , ” according to an official briefed on the case .
The police searched him and recovered a small amount of methamphetamine in a Ziploc bag .
Mr. Quest is a high - profile correspondent for CNN International , known for feature reports and profiles .
CNN calls Mr. Quest , who is British , one of the network ’s “ most instantly recognizable members . ”
He hosts “ CNN Business Traveler ” and a feature program titled “ Quest ” for the news network .

Teenagers insist parents can't understand them and parents think teens ' brains are different than smaller children or adults .
A new article by Jay N. Giedd , MD , of the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) says that second part may actually be true .
Giedd 's article reviewed the results from the NIMH Longitudinal Brain Imaging Project , which indicated that gray matter increases in volume until approximately the early teens and then decreases until old age .
The NIMH Longitudinal Brain Imaging Project began in 1989 .
Participants visit the NIMH at approximately two - year intervals for brain imaging , neuropsychological and behavioral assessment and collection of DNA .
As of September 2007 , approximately 5000 scans from 2000 subjects have been acquired .
Of these , 387 subjects , aged 3 to 27 years , have remained free of any psychopathology and serve as the models for typical brain development .
Three themes have emerged from this and other studies in this new era of adolescent neuroscience .
The first is functional and structural increases in connectivity and integrative processing as distributed brain modules become more and more integrated .
Using a literary metaphor , maturation would not be the addition of new letters but rather of combining earlier formed letters into words , and then words into sentences and then sentences into paragraphs .
The second is a general pattern of childhood peaks of gray matter ( frontal lobe , parietal lobe , temporal lobe and occipital lobe ) followed by adolescent declines .
As parts of the brain are overdeveloped and then discarded , the structure of the brain becomes more refined .
The third theme is a changing balance between limbic / subcortical and frontal lobe functions that extends well into young adulthood as different cognitive and emotional systems mature at different rates .
The cognitive and behavioral changes taking place during adolescence may be understood from the perspective of increased “ executive ” functioning , a term encompassing a broad array of abilities , including attention , response inhibition , regulation of emotion , organization and long - range planning .
Pinning down these differences in a rigorous way had been elusive until MRI was developed , offering the capacity to provide extremely accurate quantifications of brain anatomy and physiology without the use of ionizing radiation .
Writing in the article , Dr. Giedd comments , “ Adolescence is a time of substantial neurobiological and behavioral change , but the teen brain is not a broken or defective adult brain .
The adaptive potential of the overproduction / selective elimination process , increased connectivity and integration of disparate brain functions , changing reward systems and frontal / limbic balance , and the accompanying behaviors of separation from family of origin , increased risk taking , and increased sensation seeking have been highly adaptive in our past and may be so in our future .
These changes and the enormous plasticity of the teen brain make adolescence a time of great risk and great opportunity . ”
In an accompanying editorial , Elizabeth R. McAnarney MD , Department of Pediatrics , University of Rochester Medical Center , comments , “ Finally neuroscientists are able to go under the ‘… leathery membrane , surrounded by a protective moat of fluid , and completely encased in bone … ’ to provide new insights into brain development .
Changes in the brain during childhood and adolescent development that are being documented through exquisite imaging by Giedd and others hold the promise for the development of hypotheses about the potential origins of behaviors that we have observed clinically for years … . ”
“ Novelty seeking / sensation seeking and risk taking , ” Dr. McAnarney continues , “ is the basis for considerable growth during adolescence , as well as for the seemingly reckless behavior of some adolescents .
Novelty seeking / sensation seeking and risk taking are topics of growing interest as adolescent brain development is defined better and as morbidity from adolescent risk taking mounts … .
The implication of our growing knowledge of brain–behavior mechanisms of adolescent conditions should provide insights into the risk of particular adolescents for morbidity and mortality .
Preliminary data are promising so that as we begin to understand the complexity of and specificity of each of these conditions , we shall be able to diagnose and treat conditions earlier . ”

The Bill Clinton who met privately with California 's superdelegates at last weekend 's state convention was a far cry from the congenial former president who afterward publicly urged fellow Democrats to " chill out " over the race between his wife , Hillary Rodham Clinton , and Barack Obama .
In fact , before his speech Clinton had one of his famous meltdowns Sunday , blasting away at former presidential contender Bill Richardson for having endorsed Obama , the media and the entire nomination process .
" It was one of the worst political meetings I have ever attended , " one superdelegate said .
According to those at the meeting , Clinton - who flew in from Chicago with bags under his eyes - was classic old Bill at first , charming and making small talk with the 15 or so delegates who gathered in a room behind the convention stage .
But as the group moved together for the perfunctory photo , Rachel Binah , a former Richardson delegate who now supports Hillary Clinton , told Bill how " sorry " she was to have heard former Clinton campaign manager JamesCarville call Richardson a " Judas " for backing Obama .
It was as if someone pulled the pin from a grenade .
" Five times to my face ( Richardson ) said that he would never do that , " a red- faced , finger - pointing Clinton erupted .
The former president then went on a tirade that ran from the media 's unfair treatment of Hillary to questions about the fairness of the votes in state caucuses that voted for Obama .
It ended with him asking delegates to imagine what the reaction would be if Obama was trailing by just 1 percent and people were telling him to drop out .
" It was very , very intense , " said one attendee .
" Not at all like the Bill of earlier campaigns . "
When he finally wound down , Bill was asked what message he wanted the delegates to take away from the meeting .
At that point , a much calmer Clinton outlined his message of party unity .
" It was kind of strange later when he took the stage and told everyone to ' chill out , ' " one delegate told us .
" We could n't help but think he was also talking to himself . "
When delegate Binah - still stunned from her encounter with Clinton - got home to Little River ( Mendocino County ) later in the day - there was a phone message waiting for her from State Party Chairman Art Torres , telling her the former president wanted him to apologize to her on his behalf for what happened .
Still , word of Clinton 's blast shot all the way back to the New Mexico state Capitol , where Richardson spokesman PahlShipley reiterated Tuesday that his boss had never " promised or guaranteed " Bill and Hillary his endorsement .
All points bulletin : Even before the Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to condemn China 's human rights record , San Francisco police were bracing for massive protests - and huge overtime - with next week 's arrival of the Olympic torch .
Two months ago , police brass issued a department - wide bulletin that canceled days off on April 9 for all 2,245 members of the force to ensure a major law enforcement presence along the torch route .
On any given day , as many as 600 patrol officers are off duty - and pulling them back on assignment could translate to upward of $ 360,000 in police overtime .
Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin said he 's been told the department 's full overtime costs on torch day could top $ 400,000 .
It 's the kind of OT that helps explain why 393 police officers - 20 percent of the force - earned more than $ 150,000 in 2007 .
Police spokesman Sgt. Neville Gittens said the OT cost for the upcoming torch run " was not that clear cut " because the department could decide to bring officers in early for shifts or keep them a little later .
He declined to provide any actual cost estimate , however , citing security concerns .
And it wo n't just be San Francisco police picking up overtime when the torch comes through .
The California Highway Patrol and federal agencies , including the FBI , are also being called in to assist with crowd control , Gittens said .
" You ca n't encourage every event - every demonstration , every All Star event - to come to San Francisco and then not understand that there is a price to pay for this in the form of police overtime to provide public safety , " said police union boss Gary Delagnes .
" But these politicians want it both ways .
They want the events , but then they complain about overtime being exorbitant . "
Delagnes ' remarks brought a quick retort from pro-Tibet resolution sponsor Supervisor Chris Daly , who shot back on his personal blog .
Daly said that despite the board 's approval this year of a $ 407 million police budget , the department " has already blown $ 7.5 million past their entire overtime budget ... ( and ) meanwhile , our city homicide rate is through the roof .
" We 've encouraged no protest that has contributed to the outrageous police overtime incurred so far , " Daly said .
" Second , it is our understanding that Police Department brass has been meeting with the Newsom administration and Chinese officials for months , discussing every detail of the proposed torch route . "
In other words , Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi said , the cops knew well in advance that this day was coming and had plenty of time to budget accordingly .
Bottom line , no matter where you stand on the torch run , the pot is getting stirred for another big political show - and a big police overtime bill to boot .
In the pocket :
The hottest ticket in San Francisco this weekend may well be the $ 2,300 - a- head reception for Democratic hopeful Barack Obama at the Pacific Heights mansion of billionaire couple Ann and Gordon Getty .
We 're told more than 400 guests are expected , but not Mayor Gavin Newsom , who - despite his close business and family ties to the Gettys - remains a big - time Hillary Clinton backer .
By the way , the gathering is being co-hosted by another Newsom business partner , Joe Cotchett , former state Controller Steve Westly ( a possible Newsom rival for governor in 2010 ) and District Attorney Kamala Harris ( who has been on the Obama bandwagon from the start . )

The lowest - mass known black hole belongs to a binary system named XTE J1650 - 500 .
The black hole has about 3.8 times the mass of our sun , and is orbited by a companion star , as depicted in this illustration .
Updated at 2:20 p.m. ET .
NASAscientists have identified the smallest , lightest black hole yet found .
The newlightweight record - holder weighs in at about 3.8 times the mass of our sun andis only 15 miles ( 24 kilometers ) in diameter .
" Thisblack hole is really pushing the limits , " said study team leader NikolaiShaposhnikov of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " Formany years astronomers have wanted to know the smallest possible size of ablack hole , and this little guy is a big step toward answering thatquestion . "
Thelow - mass blackhole sits in a binary system in our galaxy known as XTE J1650 - 500 in thesouthern hemisphere constellation Ara. NASA 's Rossi X- ray Timing Explorer ( RXTE ) satellite discovered the system in 2001 , and astronomers soon realizedthat the system harbored a relatively lightweight black hole .
But the blackhole 's mass had never been precisely measured .
Black holesca n't be seen , but they 're identified by the activity around them , which alsohelps astronomers estimate a size of the region inside the activity , and howmuch mass must be in that confined region to generate all the surroundingactivity .
More specifically , astronomers can weigh black holes by using arelationship between the apparent size of the black hole and the X - rays emittedby the torrent of gas that swirls into the black hole 's disk from its companionstar .
As the gaspiles up near the black hole , it " becomes very dense and congested , " like a traffic jam , Shaposhnikov said at a press conference announcing thefind .
" So matter has to literally squeeze into the black hole . "
As it issqueezed , the gas heats up and radiates X - rays .
The intensity of the X - raysvaries in a pattern repeated over a nearly regular interval .
Astronomers havelong suspected that the frequency of this signal , called the quasi- periodicoscillation , or QPO , depends on the mass of the black hole .
As theblack hole gets bigger , the zone of swirling gas is pushed farther out , so theQPO ticks away slowly .
But for smaller black holes , the gas sits closer in and the QPO ticks rapidly .
Shaposhnikovand his colleague Lev Titarchuk of George Mason University used this methodto " weigh " XTE J1650 - 500 and found a mass of 3.8 suns .
This valueis well below the previous record holder GRO 1655 - 40 , which tips the scales atabout 6.3 suns .
This new ?
massmeasurement could help shed light on what the smallest star that will produce ablack hole is .
Astronomers know that some unknown critical threshold , possiblybetween 1.7 and 2.7 solar masses , marks the boundary between a star that generatesa black hole upon its death and one that produces a neutron star .
" Thisnew result brings us much closer to the theoretically predicted limit , " Shaposhnikov said .
Knowingthis boundary would help scientists understand the behavior of matter when itis scrunched to extraordinarily high densities .
" Thequestion of black hole masses has concerned us for more than a decade now , " said astrophysicist Vicky Kalogera of Northwestern University , who was notinvolved with the study , during the press conference .
Scientists had predictedthat there should be more black holes at the lower end of the mass range thanastronomers had identified , so this study helps clear up some confusion as towhere these lightweight black holes were , she added .
Kalogeradid caution that the method used by Shaposhnikov and Titarchuk is not the mainway that black hole masses are measured , but noted that their measurements ofthe masses of other black holes agreed well with the results from the standardmethod .
Shaposhnikovand Titarchuk presented their findings on March 31 at the American AstronomicalSociety 's High - Energy Astrophysics Division meeting in Los Angeles .
I was going to write some thoughts about Twitter last night , but got sidetracked by a Halo 3 session at Diego 's house , only to wake up this morning and see that Howard just happened to put his thoughts about it out there today as well .
Nice , but he and everyone else seem to be missing a core - and maybe the most important - feature of Twitter :
No spam or trolls .
Think about any other online community system ever created - from Usenet to The WELL , IRC to Slashdot to Digg .
All of them have had to deal with the core problem of idiots on the Internet .
Slashdot 's extended karma system , or IRCs multiple moderation commands , Digg 's diggs , etc. are all about filtering out the assholes .
It 's a fact - anytime a virtual group gets to a certain size , the morons come and start doing their best to disrupt , defraud or degrade the audience .
Twitter , however , has almost a million members , a thriving community , lots of discussions and yet does n't have spam or troll issues .
If you step back for a second and think about it , that 's pretty amazing .
Miker actually turned me on to this concept the other day while we were talking about community features for Mowser .
The asymmetry of the friending process is n't just a convenience , it 's core to Twitter 's ability to keep conversations spam and troll free .
Of course , right ?
You only follow the people you want to listen to , just like I subscribe only to those blogs I want to read .
But the inverse of that is I only get to say stuff to the people who are following me - which means that if I am an idiot , I only get to bother those people who are stupid enough to follow me .
The effect is sort of a decentralized moderation system .
You might think that means that everyone is sort of siloed off into their own echo chambers and that no one would ever seen anything new or follow anyone outside their little cliques .
Well , if you never used Twitter ( as really had n't before a few weeks ago ) you might think that was the case .
But what really happens is that the @user replies ( added in by users after Twitter launched , and then incorporated into the system ) is not only a way to mark messages as meant for a specific person , but they also form the basis of a basic recommendation system .
If someone I 'm following responds to someone else I 'm not following , I may go check out their tweets and decide to follow them .
If I see their name from a few other people , then I know that person is probably someone I should definitely follow .
Slowly over time , as you are responded to by your contacts , others will follow you as well , and your " voice " becomes heard by wider group of people .
It 's a microcosm of how blogging works , actually ( which makes perfect sense for a microblogging service ) .
And if you think about it , it 's actually more akin to how a group of people in a town hall might act in person as well ...
Some people might think , " Shhh !
Russell is speaking ! " and others might think , " Oh , god that asshole Russell is on his soapbox again ... " but if enough other people are listening , you might still pay attention .
Anyways , I 've digressed off into the social structure of groups , to which I have little if any real understanding , but it 's still interesting to see .
What 's for sure is that I can follow and friend hundreds or even thousands of people chatting on Twitter , and I do n't have to worry about getting any suggestions that my penis size is too small ( I make a point not to follow ex- wives / girlfriends ) , get any anonymous stock tips , nor anyone telling me that now is the time to refinance my home .
Nor do I have to suffer fools or jerks for more than the time it takes me to click the " Remove " button on their home page .
Again , I do n't know about you , but I think that 's pretty astounding .
- Russ
Update 02/25 :
It looks from the comments that there * is* a way to spam via Twitter 's friend requests - with some trolls or bots adding and re-adding people over and over again .
I have to admit I turned off new friend alerts pretty much on day one , because I hate getting automated emails for just about anything , so I did n't notice .
However , my main point remains :
Unless you actually follow those malicious users , you wo n't get unwanted messages in your IM or on your phone , etc .
( Those messages that might seem like spam from the A - listers promoting this or that , are n't spam - you gave them permission ) .

When are we going to get down to the nuts and bolts of things and really see what the DOD 's ( and others ) role in all of this is ?
For all of our money ( that we used to have ) , I 'll bet odds they 'll do anything to keep the money flowing towards their future ( past , current ) employers in the private sector , and any University that tries to study this has threats to their funding thrown at them That 's the whole scam IMO .
Watch McKinney try to get them to fess up about the missing trillions and who 's involved , all she gets is the runaround and then booted from Congress .

These Advantage machines are used in many counties in New Jersey , where Cong. Rush Holt represents .
LIke Lowell Finley pointed out in his senate testimony linked at votetrustusa.org , no paper trail or audit system would detect or would have solved the problem of the 18,000 undervotes .....
It would almost for sure match up and give the election a clean bill of health ....
See the bad news for paper trails at http://www.votetrustusa....mp;id=2252&Itemid=26 with detailed discussion of Sarasota situation as well .
All such paper trail / audit solutions are a variation on a deal with the devil ; devil SAYS : YOU give ME 100 % secret electronic first counting , and I 'll give you a 3 % audit a week later that overrides my secret counts , which i can later have held unconstitutional for being just like Al Gore 's lame ass partial recount request in Florida was unconstitutional for not treating all the voters the same under Equal Protection .
Devil Continues : I like my secret vote counting , and when it really counts I 'll get it tossed in court anyway .
It 's perfect !
The only response seems to be that such compromises are the only ones that are " achievable " .
If congress TRULY INSISTS on counting their own re-eleections in secret then let 's have a roll call vote on that PLEASE .
PLEASE !!
I 'd give just about anything for a roll call vote on the approval of secret vote counting in congressional elections .
It would be for the history books .
Maybe even one channel of c-span would show .
We can only dream of the defense of democracy that might occur .

I own a bar in the mountains of California , and we are the polling place for our area .
Because of logistical considerations ( lots of precincts , one delivery contractor , huge geographic area ..... we get our Sequoia machines on Friday before the elections , and they are collected on Wednesday or Thursday after .
It was all I could do to keep my UC Santa Cruz student bartenders and cooks from hacking Frank Zappa into Governor of our fair state .
As a compromise , we dressed up our machines and took them around to the local bars to meet the voters in advance of the elections .
It is an obvious engineering problem : there are too many precincts for voting machines to be delivered in a timely manner .... anywhere in the U.S.
They are always going to be vulnerable .
And with sweetheart , no - bid contracts the security is bound to be sloppy .
The hackers will always win .
Paper is the only secure answer .

Thank you Brad Blog for helping to get this information out there .
People need to continue to work at the local level to ensure that future elections are properly counted , and that past fraud and wrongdoing is prosecuted .

Sorry SAM but the solution is not nearly that simple .
The machines were clearly set up to facilitate fraud .
Taking the machines away will reduce fraud by making it harder to get away with fraud , but that is not the complete solution .
Fraud was a problem before the machines came along and will continue to be a problem in the future unless we go on from there to publicly verifiable vote counting of some type .
The machines are not the real problem .
The real problem is many of the people involved in our elections hate democracy and will do almost anything to get the election results they desire .
Democracy will remain a sham as long as we let them have their way .
Hand counted paper ballots is not the only answer or even a correct answer to creating a true democracy right here in the USA !
One note will never be enough to take us to democracy from here Johnny .

About my above rant , I have to clarify
It 's not all about the DOD / Government or the private sector , it's in the shadowy area between the two ( aka lobbies , think tanks , and like entities ) that has to be investigated and outed
That 's where the malfunction is for pretty much all of our problems today IMO

I have some cogent observations on the displays of voting machines that took place at the Community Room of the Fire Station on February 27 , 2006 .
The Sequoia touch screen machine actually froze up , in full view of me , Klaus Proemm , and others .
“ Not a good sign , ” someone said .
The vendor explained that the machine operates on Windows XP .
Good Lord !
Every single day that I operate my computer , a window appears on my screen , once or twice , saying “ Windows has encountered a problem and needs to close . ”
The Sequoia vendor had to shut down the machine , unlock the back , and reboot , in order to get it to work properly again .
I advised him that St. Lawrence County is the largest in the state , and I asked him if Sequoia technicians would be at all the polling stations – a rhetorical question , of course .
I asked him : “ What if this happens on Election Day ? ” “ It wo n’t , it can ’t , ” he said .
“ But it just happened right now , in front of us all . ”
“ It wo n’t happen on Election Day . ”
“ But touch screen voting machines froze in Youngstown , Ohio on Election Day , 2004 . ”
http://www.vindy.com/bas...news/281829446390855.php
“ That was n’t Sequoia .
We do n’t do business in Ohio . ”
Maybe not any more , but Sequoia was the vendor in Lake County , Ohio , so his statement was misleading , though perhaps unintentionally .
http://verifiedvoting.or...ate=ohio&county=Lake
By contrast , the vendors for the Liberty touch screen voting machine were better informed and more knowledgeable .
A man from the Netherlands spent much time with me .
He showed me how to test the screen to make sure that they are not programmed to default to any candidate , as happened in Youngstown , Ohio .
He showed me that the machine was secure against physical tampering , and showed me the seal that would have to be broken .
He explained that , unlike Ohio , the company ’s source code , though considered proprietary information , would be given to the State of New York to be held in escrow .
And he said he had no problem with having the actual programming done at the county level .
In short , I do not trust the Sequoia machines .
In New Mexico , Sequoia Advantage machines produced an unacceptable 5.28 % undervote rate in the 2004 presidential election , and 32 precincts reported undervote rates above 10 % .
( Ellen Theisen and Warren Stewart , Summary Report on New Mexico State Election Data ) .
http://www.democracyforn...State%20Election%20Data'
In our case , the machines of both companies are required to provide a voter - verified paper trail , which is , on its face , an improvement over the time - tested lever machines .
But the Sequoia vendor could not verify that the vote tally produced by the machine , upon which the reported results would be based , will actually match the voter - verified paper trail .
There is no way for us to tell if the machine has been programmed otherwise , without counting the ballots by hand .
Because the machine runs on software , and utilizes Windows XP , a program known to many , the source code could be altered .
By contrast , the Liberty machines run on “ solid ware , ” which means that once the source code is established , it can not be changed by anyone .
The State of New York would test a number of machines , verify that they all are working properly , and then the same source code , on file with the State , would be burned onto each and every machine .
I do not trust electronic voting .
I have seen too many things go wrong .
Do not even think of awarding the contract to Sequoia .

NOTE TO READERS : Unfortunately omitted from my letter to the St. Lawrence County Board of Elections was the following exchange : Conceding that , in the event of voting machine failure , it might take an hour or more for Sequoia technicians to arrive at polling stations in the more remote parts of the county , the Sequoia vendor assured me that paper ballots would be on hand at all the polls , just in case .
Naturally , I asked him : " Then why do n't you just dispense with the machines and go with paper ballots in the first place ? "

I hope this has finally pushed NY over to pen and paper for abled voting and that that the DREs are properly disposed of .
You should all recall that NY is being sued by the US DOJ with failure to comply with HAVA .

OMG , people !
The corporate county that " governs " where I live -- Nevada County , California -- is considering the purchase of those damn DREs !
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO !
I am asking all of you to PLEASE send the listed folks e-mails so that they can be appraised as to the insanity of getting DREs for this county .
I will be out of town during the public - input meeting ( Tues , the 13th of Feb ... the local paper did not give much notice for the meeting , per usual ) and cannot attend the meeting , hence my SOS call out to you guys / gals .
Here 's the elections page of the county website : http://www.mynevadacounty.com/elections/
Click on " contact us " and please send them e-mails letting them know that it 's INSANE to even consider getting the DREs , much less get them .
Their reasoning is that the damn things are " free " , thanks to HAVA .
Sheeesh !
Here 's the url to the article in the local paper : http://www.theunion.com/...;SearchID=73271939111363
And here 's the e-mail addy of the Staff Writer , Jill Bauerle , who wrote the elections article : jillb@theunion.com
Please , please have at them , guys / gals .
I 'll do what I can via e-mails , but I cannot attend the meeting ; however , I will ask some local people to attend the meeting .
And in the local article , there was a mention of elections websites , like blackboxvoting , verifiedvoting ... but NO BRADBLOG ?
WTF ?
That Jill lady needs to know about BRAD BLOG , so if a bunch of you take action , she WILL know about Brad Blog before long !
I 'm sure that you 'd agree that we ALL are affected by any damn DREs in any county in America , since it is in the counties where the stolen elections , e.g. 2004 , happen , so we gotta stop them where ever we can .
Thank you for your time and consideration .

The good news for Nevada County , CA is that the elections department will choose a system ( or blending of systems paper and plastic ) and then present that to their Board of Supervisors who will vote to request the Voting Modernization Board accept the plan .
That should take some time , even in Nevada County .
Everyone is hoping the new Secretary of State will decertify systems ( or say that she will not ) prior to the next Modernization Board .
California needs a clear directive from Bowen and soon .

Hey Howdy ,
Thank you for the information .
Here 's to hop'n that Bowen can slam the door shut on the damned DREs through the decertification process .
If that does not work , then baseball bats are next .
Btw , I wonder what kind of sentencing the person who actually took a hammer to an election ( Ohio ? ) polling place and proceeded to beat the shiat out of on DRE ?
I 've thought of doing that many times , but I knew that the system would nail my arse in a jail cell for some time if I did that .

Retired FBI polygrapher Barry Colvert performing for the camera in Harsh Times
I 've reviewed the polygraph scene from Harsh Times .
It is loaded with what can only be deliberate disinformation about polygraph procedures and countermeasures .
The short answer to your question ( what exactly did Jim do wrong ? ) is that he augmented his reactions to a relevant question instead of to control questions .
The disinformation about countermeasures begins with Jim telling his best friend Mike about how he 's going to pass the lie detector test he 'll be taking the following day :
Quote :
Mike :
How you gonna pass the lie detector test , you lyin ' mother fucker ?
Jim :
Oh , easy man !
After every question , you just squeeze like you 're takin ' a dump , you know man ?
It throws the machine off !
Those who have read and understood The Lie Behind the Lie Detector know that this countermeasure approach is deeply flawed .
One should only augment reactions to the control ( also called " comparison " ) questions , not to all questions .
Jim in the hot seat .
Next , the film deliberately disinforms viewers about the nature of " control " questions .
Colvert falsely introduces a series of questions as control questions .
In fact , they are irrelevant questions , and would not be scored :
Quote :
Is your name Jim Luther Davis ?
Do you live in Los Angeles ?
Are you 26 years old ?
Are you married ?
Are you wearing shoes ?
Federal law enforcement agencies do n't use any technique that includes five consecutive irrelevant questions .
The main technique used is the
After the question about smoking marijuana " aside from the instance [ he ] mentioned in his application , " which Jim untruthfully answers " no , " Colvert intones : " Jim , knock it off . "
Jim sheepishly asks , " What , sir ? " Colvert goes on , " Son , I 've been doing polygraph examinations since you were swimming in your daddy 's balls .
So I know all the tricks .
You 've either got a tack in your shoe , or you 're clenchin ' your butt .
I 've got spikes all over this thing .
If you do it again , I 'm going to void this test , and report that you were uncooperative .
Do you understand ? "
Let 's take a look at the polygraph chart that Colvert 's character has in front of him :
Countermeasures ?
Note that there are only four channels on the polygraph tracings , from top to bottom : thoracic and abdominal breathing , electrodermal , and cardiovascular .
There is no channel for a seat pad or strain gauge such as might be used in an attempt to detect such countermeasures as a tack in the shoe or the anal sphincter contraction .
On the electrodermal channel , we see unnaturally vertical spikes that were clearly produced not by the examinee , but by the polygraph examiner himself making manual adjustments to the polygraph instrument .
And at the end of the chart , we see a massive spike on the pneumo channels , coinciding with a similarly large drop on the cardio channel .
The reactions we see on the chart are not what we would expect if the subject were " squeezing like [ he 's ] takin ' a shit " on every question -- as wrongheaded as such a countermeasure approach would be .
No polygrapher -- including Barry Colvert -- has ever demonstrated the ability to reliably detect the kinds of countermeasures described in The Lie Behind the Lie Detector .

I want to bring your attention to a disturbing little sub-number in today ’s quarterly foreclosure report from California - based RealtyTrac .
RealtyTrac reports “ foreclosure activity , ” which covers default notices , auctions sale notices and bank repossessions .
The numbers were pretty nasty nationwide , as expected , with activity up 23 percent quarter to quarter and 112 percent year over year .
When you break down the sub- categories , however , you find that the number of bank - owned properties is rising faster than ever before .
“ Typically you ’ll see about 20 percent of the foreclosure filings being bank - owned , ” Realty Trac ’s Rick Sharga told me in an interview this morning .
“ We ’re getting to a point now where it ’s well over 1/ 3 and aiming at 40 percent , so that just suggests that a lot of these homes can’t even be sold to investors at auctions – because there ’s just no equity in the properties . ”
Sharga estimates that by the end of this year there will be over a million bank - owned homes in the market .
To put that in perspective , there are about four million properties listed on the Multiple Listing Service , or MLS , so a quarter of the inventory would be bank - owned .
The National Association of Realtors noted last week that in a casual survey they found 18 percent of the homes currently on the MLS are foreclosed homes .
It ’s interesting to me that given all the programs supposedly helping folks in default and all the banks claiming that they are doing refi’s or “ work - outs ” or whatever , a growing number of homes are still going back to the bank .

When The Joel Test first appeared , one of the biggest sore points readers reported had to do with writing specs .
It seems that specs are like flossing : everybody knows they should be writing them , but nobody does .
Why wo n’t people write specs ?
People claim that it ’s because they ’re saving time by skipping the spec- writing phase .
They act as if spec-writing was a luxury reserved for NASA space shuttle engineers , or people who work for giant , established insurance companies .
Balderdash .
First of all , failing to write a spec is the single biggest unnecessary risk you take in a software project .
It ’s as stupid as setting off to cross the Mojave desert with just the clothes on your back , hoping to “ wing it . ”
Programmers and software engineers who dive into code without writing a spec tend to think they ’re cool gunslingers , shooting from the hip .
They ’re not .
They are terribly unproductive .
They write bad code and produce shoddy software , and they threaten their projects by taking giant risks which are completely uncalled for .
I believe that on any non-trivial project ( more than about 1 week of coding or more than 1 programmer ) , if you do n’t have a spec , you will always spend more time and create lower quality code .
Here ’s why .
The most important function of a spec is to design the program .
Even if you are working on code all by yourself , and you write a spec solely for your own benefit , the act of writing the spec — describing how the program works in minute detail — will force you to actually design the program .
Let ’s visit two imaginary programmers at two companies .
Speedy , at Hasty Bananas Software , never writes specs .
“ Specs ?
We do n’t need no stinkin ’ specs ! ”
At the same time , Mr. Rogers , over at The Well - Tempered Software Company , refuses to write code until the spec is completely nailed down .
These are only two of my many imaginary friends .
Speedy and Mr. Rogers have one thing in common : they are both in charge of backwards compatibility for version 2.0 of their respective products .
Speedy decides that the best way to provide backwards compatibility is to write a converter which simply converts 1.0 version files into 2.0 version files .
She starts banging that out .
Type , type , type .
Clickety clickety clack .
Hard drives spin .
Dust flies .
After about 2 weeks , she has a reasonable converter .
But Speedy ’s customers are unhappy .
Speedy ’s code will force them to upgrade everyone in the company at once to the new version .
Speedy ’s biggest customer , Nanner Splits Unlimited , refuses to buy the new software .
Nanner Splits needs to know that version 2.0 will still be able to work on version 1.0 files without converting them .
Speedy decides to write a backwards converter and then hook it into the “ save ” function .
It ’s a bit of a mess , because when you use a version 2.0 feature , it seems to work , until you go to save the file in 1.0 format .
Only then are you told that the feature you used half an hour ago does n’t work in the old file format .
So the backwards converter took another two weeks to write , and it do n’t work so nice .
Elapsed time , 4 weeks .
Now , Mr. Rogers over at Well - Tempered Software Company ( colloquially , “ WellTemperSoft ” ) is one of those nerdy organized types who refuses to write code until he ’s got a spec .
He spends about 20 minutes designing the backwards compatibility feature the same way Speedy did , and comes up with a spec that basically says :
When opening a file created with an older version of the product , the file is converted to the new format .
The spec is shown to the customer , who says “ wait a minute !
We do n’t want to switch everyone at once ! ”
So Mr. Rogers thinks some more , and amends the spec to say :
When opening a file created with an older version of the product , the file is converted to the new format in memory .
When saving this file , the user is given the option to convert it back .
Another 20 minutes have elapsed .
Mr. Rogers ’ boss , an object nut , looks at this and thinks something might be amiss .
He suggests a different architecture .
The code will be factored to use two interfaces : V1 and V2 .
V1 contains all the version one features , and V2 , which inherits from V1 , adds all the new features .
Now V1 :: Save can handle the backwards compatibility while V2 :: Save can be used to save all the new stuff .
If you ’ve opened a V1 file and try to use V2 functionality , the program can warn you right away , and you will have to either convert the file or give up the new functionality .
20 more minutes .
Mr. Rogers is grumpy .
This refactoring will take 3 weeks , instead of the 2 weeks he originally estimated !
But it does solve all the customer problems , in an elegant way , so he goes off and does it .
Total elapsed time for Mr. Rogers : 3 weeks and 1 hour .
Elapsed time for Speedy : 4 weeks , but Speedy ’s code is not as good .
The moral of the story is that with a contrived example , you can prove anything .
Oops .
No , that ’s not what I meant to say .
The moral of the story is that when you design your product in a human language , it only takes a few minutes to try thinking about several possibilities , revising , and improving your design .
Nobody feels bad when they delete a paragraph in a word processor .
But when you design your product in a programming language , it takes weeks to do iterative designs .
What ’s worse , a programmer who ’s just spend 2 weeks writing some code is going to be quite attached to that code , no matter how wrong it is .
Nothing Speedy ’s boss or customers could say would convince her to throw away her beautiful converting code , even though that did n’t represent the best architecture .
As a result , the final product tends to be a compromise between the initial , wrong design and the ideal design .
It was “ the best design we could get , given that we ’d already written all this code and we just did n’t want to throw it away . ”
Not quite as good as “ the best design we could get , period . ”
So that ’s giant reason number one to write a spec .
Giant reason number two is to save time communicating .
When you write a spec , you only have to communicate how the program is supposed to work once .
Everybody on the team can just read the spec .
The QA people read it so that they know how the program is supposed to work and they know what to test for .
The marketing people use it to write their vague vaporware white papers to throw up on the web site about products that have n’t been created yet .
The business development people misread it to spin weird fantasies about how the product will cure baldness and warts and stuff , but it gets investors , so that ’s OK .
The developers read it so that they know what code to write .
The customers read it to make sure the developers are building a product that they would want to pay for .
The technical writers read it and write a nice manual ( that gets lost or thrown away , but that ’s a different story ) .
The managers read it so that they can look like they know what ’s going on in management meetings .
And so on .
When you do n’t have a spec , all this communication still happens , because it has to , but it happens ad hoc .
The QA people fool around with the program willy - nilly , and when something looks odd , they go and interrupt the programmers yet again to ask them another stupid question about how the thing is supposed to work .
Besides the fact that this ruins the programmers ’ productivity , the programmers tend to give the answer that corresponds to what they wrote in the code , rather than the “ right answer . ”
So the QA people are really testing the program against the program rather than the program against the design , which would be , um , a little bit more useful .
When you do n’t have a spec , what happens with the poor technical writers is the funniest ( in a sad kind of way ) .
Tech writers often do n’t have the political clout to interrupt programmers .
In many companies , if tech writers get in the habit of interrupting programmers to ask how something is supposed to work , the programmers go to their managers and cry about how they ca n’t get any work done because of these [ expletive deleted ] writers , and could they please keep them away , and the managers , trying to improve productivity , forbid the tech writers to waste any more of their precious programmers ’ time .
You can always tell these companies , because the help files and the manuals do n’t give you any more information than you can figure out from the screen .
When you see a message on a screen which says
Would you like to enable LRF - 1914 support ?
… and you click “ Help ” , a tragicomic help topic comes up which says something like
Allows you to choose between LRF - 1914 support ( default ) or no LRF - 1914 support .
If you want LRF - 1914 support , choose “ Yes ” or press “ Y ” .
If you do n’t want LRF - 1914 support , choose “ No ” or press “ N ” .
Um , thanks .
It ’s pretty obvious here that the technical writer was trying to cover up the fact that they did n’t know what LRF - 1914 support is .
They could n’t ask the programmer , because ( a ) they ’re embarrassed , or ( b ) the programmer is in Hyderabad and they ’re in London , or ( c ) they have been prohibited by management from interrupting the programmer , or any other number of corporate pathologies too numerous to mention , but the fundamental problem is that there was n’t a spec .
Number three giant important reason to have a spec is that without a detailed spec , it ’s impossible to make a schedule .
Not having a schedule is OK if it ’s your PhD and you plan to spend 14 years on the thing , or if you ’re a programmer working on the next Duke Nukem and we ’ll ship when we ’re good and ready .
But for almost any kind of real business , you just have to know how long things are going to take , because developing a product costs money .
You would n’t buy a pair of jeans without knowing what the price is , so how can a responsible business decide whether to build a product without knowing how long it will take and , therefore , how much it will cost ?
For more on scheduling , read Painless Software Schedules .
A terribly common error is having a debate over how something should be designed , and then never resolving the debate .
Brian Valentine , the lead developer on Windows 2000 , was famous for his motto “ Decisions in 10 minutes or less , or the next one is free . ”
In too many programming organizations , every time there ’s a design debate , nobody ever manages to make a decision , usually for political reasons .
So the programmers only work on uncontroversial stuff .
As time goes on , all the hard decisions are pushed to the end .
These are the most likely projects to fail .
If you are starting a new company around a new technology and you notice that your company is constitutionally incapable of making decisions , you might as well close down now and return the money to the investors , because you ai n’t never gonna ship nothing .
Writing a spec is a great way to nail down all those irritating design decisions , large and small , that get covered up if you do n’t have a spec .
Even small decisions can get nailed down with a spec .
For example , if you ’re building a web site with membership , you might all agree that if the user forgets their password , you ’ll mail it to them .
Great .
But that ’s not enough to write the code .
To write the code , you need to know the actual words in that email .
At most companies , programmers are n’t trusted with words that a user might actually see ( and for good reason , much of the time ) .
So a marketing person or a PR person or some other English major is likely to be required to come up with the precise wording of the message .
“ Dear Shlub , Here ’s the password you forgot .
Try not to be so careless in the future . ”
When you force yourself to write a good , complete spec ( and I ’ll talk a lot more about that soon ) , you notice all these things and you either fix them or at least you mark them with a big red flag .
OK .
We ’re on the same page now .
Specs are motherhood and apple pie .
I suspect that most people understand this , and my rants , while amusing , are n’t teaching you anything new .
So why do n’t people write specs ?
It ’s not to save time , because it does n’t , and I think most coders recognize this .
( In most organizations , the only “ specs ” that exist are staccato , one page text documents that a programmer banged out in Notepad after writing the code and after explaining that damn feature to the three hundredth person . )
I think it ’s because so many people do n’t like to write .
Staring at a blank screen is horribly frustrating .
Personally , I overcame my fear of writing by taking a class in college that required a 3 - 5 page essay once a week .
Writing is a muscle .
The more you write , the more you ’ll be able to write .
If you need to write specs and you can’t , start a journal , create a weblog , take a creative writing class , or just write a nice letter to every relative and college roommate you ’ve blown off for the last 4 years .
Anything that involves putting words down on paper will improve your spec writing skills .
If you ’re a software development manager and the people who are supposed to be writing specs are n’t , send them off for one of those two week creative writing classes in the mountains .
If you ’ve never worked in a company that does functional specifications , you may never have seen one .
In the next part of this series , I ’ll show you a short , sample spec for you to check out , and we ’ll talk about what a good spec needs to have .

Science & Exploration Ocean may exist beneath Titan 's crust 25/03/2008 1596 views 1 likes
Cassini has discovered evidence that points to the existence of an underground ocean of water and ammonia on Saturn 's moon Titan .
The findings were made using radar measurements of Titan 's rotation .
" With its organic dunes , lakes , channels and mountains , Titan has one of the most varied , active and Earth - like surfaces in the solar system , " said Ralph Lorenz , lead author of the paper and Cassini radar scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland , USA .
" Now we see changes in the way Titan rotates , giving us a window into Titan 's interior beneath the surface . "
Members of the mission 's science team used Cassini's Synthetic Aperture Radar to collect imaging data during 19 separate passes over Titan between October 2005 and May 2007 .
The radar can see through Titan 's dense , methane - rich atmospheric haze , detailing never - before - seen surface features and establishing their locations on the moon 's surface .
Using data from the radar 's early observations , the scientists and radar engineers established the locations of 50 unique landmarks on Titan 's surface .
They then searched for these same lakes , canyons and mountains in the reams of data returned by Cassini in its later flybys of Titan .
They found that prominent surface features had shifted from their expected positions by up to 30 km .
A systematic displacement of surface features would be difficult to explain unless the moon 's icy crust was decoupled from its core by an internal ocean , making it easier for the crust to move .
Possible liquid ocean beneath Titan 's surface " We believe that about 100 km beneath the ice and organic - rich surface is an internal ocean of liquid water mixed with ammonia , " said Bryan Stiles of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , California , USA .
Stiles is a contributing author to the paper reporting the findings .
The study of Titan is a major goal of the Cassini - Huygens mission because it may preserve , in deep - freeze , many of the chemical compounds that preceded life on Earth .
Titan is the only moon in the solar system that possesses a dense atmosphere .
The moon 's atmosphere is 1.5 times denser than Earth's .
It is also the largest of Saturn 's moons , bigger than the planet Mercury .
" The combination of an organic - rich environment and liquid water is very appealing to astrobiologists , " Lorenz said .
" Further study of Titan 's rotation will let us understand the watery interior better , and because the spin of the crust and the winds in the atmosphere are linked , we might see seasonal variation in the spin in the next few years . "
Cassini scientists will not have long to wait before another go at Titan .
On March 25 , just prior to its closest approach at an altitude of 1000 km , Cassini will employ its Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer to examine Titan 's upper atmosphere .
Immediately after closest approach , the spacecraft 's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer will capture high - resolution images of Titan 's southeast quadrant .

In Washington , the Treasury secretary , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , signaled strong support for the Fed ’s role in supplying a lifeline to Bear Stearns during the crisis negotiations , saying that his priority was to stabilize the financial system and to worry less right now about the problem of avoiding a “ moral hazard ” by bailing out errant institutions .
“ We ’re very aware of moral hazard , ” Mr. Paulson said in a television interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC .
“ But our primary concern right now  my primary concern  is the stability of our financial system , the orderliness of the markets .
And that ’s where our focus is . ”
Indeed , investors are taking a grim view of the prospects for other investment banks like Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch .
Managers of hedge funds and mutual funds say the problems at Bear confirmed their worst fears about the brokerages  that they have relied too much on leverage and have done a poor job managing the risks they took on during the boom .
The price of insurance on investment banks has surged in the last few days and is exponentially higher than it was last spring .
Credit default swaps that offer protection on Bear Stearns debt traded as low as $ 35 per $ 10,000 of bonds in May .
As of last Friday , the cost was $ 830 .
Shares of investment banks in the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index are down nearly 28 percent so far this year , and stock futures on Friday showed that a few investors were betting that Bear Stearns stock could lose virtually all of its value in the next few weeks .
“ People have started to realize the risks that are there , ” said Steven Gross , a principal at Penso Capital Markets , an investment firm in Cedarhurst , N.Y .
“ The question is have we reached the bottom .
Citigroup , one of the nation ’s largest banking companies , is now trading below its book value .
Lehman Brothers , at $ 39 , is trading just below the book value it reported at the end of last year .
This year , Bear ’s stock is down 65 percent and Lehman ’s has sunk 40 percent .

As everyone has no doubt heard , John McCain stopped by the White House to pick up the president 's endorsement .
As Dan Froomkin noted , however , some were far more interested in publicizing the meeting than others .
You 'll never guess who was the most excited about yesterday 's endorsement .
As of this writing , there 's no mention of it on the home page of McCain 's Web site .
There 's no mention of it all on the Republican National Committee 's home page .
In fact , I can't find any mention whatsoever of the event on either Web site at all .
( It 's like : Bush Who ? )
But on the Democratic National Committee Web site , the lead headline blares : " Bush Endorses John McCain as His Successor . "
" Since the event was held in the middle of the afternoon we fear that some Americans may miss George Bush 's assurances that John McCain would continue the Bush Administrations failed economic and foreign policies , " the DNC explains .
" As a public service we 've posted a video of the press conference for voters to see . "
Yoo 's on First ?
Is it because John Yoo , the former Justice Department 's hired hand , is such an easy target ?
Is it because of the cheeky , in - your - face way in which Yoo argues that the president has the authority to have your eyes poked out and your sons ' testicles crushed , because we are " at war " and he is commander in chief ?
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly
Or is it because our press is STILL reluctant to go after Yoo 's guys – first and foremost his ultimate client – President George W. Bush ?
Oh , but that would be hard , you say .
Nonsense .
Available on the Web , in its original format , is a 7 Feb.
2002 action memorandum that the president signed to implement the dubious advice he was getting from Yoo and those at Justice who hired Yoo – and from the vice president 's office which guided Yoo .
Yoo did their dirty work ( and now he takes the rap ) .
Were n't
Yoo 's co-conspirators careful to keep their fingerprints off the more blatantly offensive memoranda ?
Sure they were .
But there was one problem .
Then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and then - CIA Director George Tenet could not get their people to torture folks without written , signed authorization by the president .
And we have a copy of that authorization ?
Yes , it 's been available for years .
You have to download it to believe it .
In his Feb. 7 , 2002 , memorandum , Bush wrote : " I determine that common Article 3 of Geneva does not apply to either al Qaeda or Taliban detainees . "
( Common Article 3 bans " torture [ and ] outrages upon personal dignity , in particular humiliating and degrading treatment . " )
Then , drawing on the lawyerly legerdemain , Bush did something really dumb .
Using words drafted by Vice President Dick Cheney 's lawyer , David Addington , for a memo dated Jan. 25 , 2002 , signed by then - White House counsel Alberto Gonzales , the president ordered that detainees be treated , " humanely ... to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity . "
Tacked onto the end of that sentence is a classic circumlocution : " in a manner consistent with the principles of Geneva . "
But that is not what Geneva says , and there is no way to square that circle .
This is the giant loophole through which Rumsfeld and Tenet drove the Mack truck of torture ... yes , signed by the president .
The rotten apples were – demonstrably – at the very top of the barrel .
Typical of the timid treatment accorded this issue is what initially seemed to be a straightforward article by Don Eggen in Sunday 's Washington Post .
It spotlighted scapegoat - of - the - hour Yoo , noting that he advised that in time of war the president 's ultimate authority as commander in chief trumps laws prohibiting assault , maiming and other crimes by military interrogators .
In focusing on Yoo 's legal advice , however , Eggen joined his " mainstream " journalist colleagues in omitting the smoking gun – Bush 's implementing memorandum of Feb.
7 , 2002 .
That document already had cleared the way for waterboarding , stress positions , forced nudity and other abuse of detainees – as well as for further legal musings about the unlimited powers of a wartime president , like Yoo ’s newly disclosed March 14 , 2003 , memo .
The omission was all the more conspicuous in that a listing of nine memoranda relevant to the story sits side by side with Eggen 's article .
Guess which memo did not make it onto that list ?
Again , I urge you to download the president 's Feb. 7 smoking gun from the Web and read it yourself .
The Jan. 25 , 2002 , memo bearing Gonzales 's signature is also available – in its original form .
Supreme Court Has a Problem On June 29 , 2006 , in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , the Supreme Court ruled that Geneva DOES apply to al - Qaeda and Taliban detainees .
One senior Bush administration official is reported to have gone quite pale at the time , when Justice Anthony M. Kennedy raised the ante , warning that " violations of Common Article 3 are considered ' war crimes , ' punishable as federal offenses . "
That threw a real scare into Bush as well , who pressed Congress hard to give administration officials retroactive immunity from prosecution .
That came just three months later when Congress passed the " Military Commissions Act . "
Ironically , the fact that those violating Geneva have been granted immunity within the U.S. makes it easier for foreign courts to prosecute for torture .
Remember how former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had to sneak out of Paris last October ?
He was not about to wait until a Paris prosecutor decided how to handle a fresh criminal complaint against him .
That complaint cited the failure of U.S. authorities to investigate the role of Rumsfeld and other top officials in torture , despite a documented paper trail of official memos implicating them in direct as well as command responsibility .
The complaint argued that countries like France have a legal obligation to prosecute under the 1984 Convention Against Torture , approved by 145 nations , including the United States .
The Convention states that " no exceptional circumstances whatsoever , whether a state of war or a threat of war , internal political instability or any other public emergency , may be invoked as a justification of torture . "
It also provides for “ universal jurisdiction , ” meaning that every signing country has a duty to prosecute torturers who are found in their territory or to extradite them to other countries for prosecution .
One of the Bush administration 's favorite slogans is that evildoers must be " brought to justice . "
It will be interesting to watch how this all plays out in the months and years to come .

Ringo Starr ?
Well , Ringo may be smarter than you think .
Because a new study from Stockholm shows that people who can keep a beat score the highest on intelligence tests .
The researchers asked 34 men to listen to a recording and then tap out the beat using a single drumstick .
When the music stopped , the guys kept drumming , and they were scored by how closely they were able to maintain the original rhythm .
After their drum solos , the subjects traded their sticks for pencils and took a standardized intelligence test .
The guys who had the steadiest rhythm also nailed the written exam .
What that means is hard to say .
All of our actions , whether we ’re making music or solving equations , are governed by the rhythmic activity of nerve cells in the brain .
So the scientists think that a keen sense of timing and a penchant for problem solving might come from having well coordinated brain cell activity .
While sloppy drumming and sloppy thinking come from brain cells that are slightly out of synch .
As for Ringo [ lyric : “ you know it do n’t come easy ” ] .

WASHINGTON 
As angry truckers encircled the Capitol in a horn - blaring caravan and consumers across the country agonized over $ 60 fill - ups , the issue of high fuel prices flared on the campaign trail on Monday , sharply dividing the two Democratic candidates .
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton lined up with Senator John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee for president , in endorsing a plan to suspend the federal excise tax on gasoline , 18.4 cents a gallon , for the summer travel season .
But Senator Barack Obama , Mrs. Clinton ’s Democratic rival , spoke out firmly against the proposal , saying it would save consumers little and do nothing to curtail oil consumption and imports .
While Mr. Obama ’s view is shared by environmentalists and many independent energy analysts , his position allowed Mrs. Clinton to draw a contrast with her opponent in appealing to the hard - hit middle - class families and older Americans who have proven to be the bedrock of her support .
She has accused Mr. Obama of being out of touch with ordinary Americans who are struggling to meet their mortgages and gas up their cars and trucks .
Mrs. Clinton said at a rally on Monday morning in Graham , N.C. , that she would introduce legislation to impose a windfall - profits tax on oil companies and use the revenue to suspend the gasoline tax temporarily .

( OrganicJar ) Hemp Seeds , are the most nutritionally complete food source in the world !
Hemp has been eaten for thousands of years in different parts of the world .
It 's the seed that we eat , and it 's beneficial in terms of protein and essential fatty acids .
There 's evidence that goes back thousands of years that it was beingeaten in China and in different places around the world for their health benefits .
Hemp seeds have an astonishing balanced nutritional make - up .
It is one of the plant kingdom's most concentrated , complete and balanced sources of all 10 essential amino acids ( EAA's ) and essential fatty acids ( EFA 's ) which are necessary to maintain healthy human life .
You can divide it roughly into three components .
First :
There are the essential fatty acids in the oil -- omega - 6 , omega - 3 , omega - 9 -- and also minor fatty acids like gamma linolenic acid ( GLA ) and stearidonic acid , which is biosynthesized from the alpha- linolenic acid ( ALA ) .
GLA and ALA cannot be made by the human body and must be obtained through the diet , so they are called essential fatty acids ( EFA ) .
GLA and ALA are the most important fatty acids in human nutrition and health .
They are involved in producing life energy from food and the movement of that energy throughout the body .
EFAs govern growth , vitality and state of mind .
Still , much is unknown about their functioning in the body .
This oil comprises 35 % of the total seed weight and has the lowest amount of saturated fatty acids at 8 % , and the highest amount of the polyunsaturated essential fatty acids at 80 % .
Flax seed oil comes in second at 72 % combined total essential fatty acids .
Second : 35 % consists mostly of fiber , both soluble and insoluble .
Insoluble fiber possesses passive water - attracting properties that help to increase bulk , soften stool and shorten transit time through the intestinal tract .
Soluble fiber undergoes metabolic processing via fermentation , yielding end - products with broad , significant health effects .
Thirdly : 25 % consists of a complete and highly - digestible protein , 65 % high - quality edestin protein , the most potent protein of any plant source , 35 % albumin protein and glutamic acid .
The globulin edestin in hemp seed closely resembles the globulin in blood plasma , and is compatible with the human digestive system .
It is vital to the maintance of a healthy immune system and is also used to manufacture antibodies .
Albumin is a protein manufactured by the liver that is supportive of liver and kidney health .
Its high quality amino acid composition is closer to " complete " sources of proteins ( meat , milk , eggs ) than all other oil seeds except quinoa and soy .
Hemp seeds are also high in essential nutrients including chlorophyll , magnesium , potassium , sulfur , phytosterols , ascorbic acid , beta - carotene , calcium , fiber , histidine , iron , potassium , phosphorus , riboflavin , niacin and thiamin .
A variety of studies have documented the importance of the ratio of Omega 3 to Omega 6 consumption .
Hemp seed oil is the closest to this optimum ratio of any naturally occurring oil .
Hemp seed oil has a ratio of at least one - to - three , Omega 3 to Omega 6 .
Oils with unbalanced ratios have been shown to have detrimental physiological effects .
I love hemp seeds and my favorite product is ' Organic Shelled Hemp Seeds ' from Nutiva .
Hemp seeds have a great nutty flavor with a variety of uses .
Nutiva uses the finest certified organic ingredients , their organic seeds are grown without any chemical pesticides , herbicides or chemical fertilizers and their not genetically modified -- safer for you and the planet .
Their products are certified by Quality Assurance International ( QAI ) - which is a USDA authorized organic certifier .
Nutiva Hemp Seeds Nutrition Chart
Another great way to get the health benefits of hemp seeds is to purchase , ' Cold - Pressed Hemp Seed Oil ' , which is nutritionally superior to olive or flax oil , and so , makes a great alternative in salads , smoothies , and other non-frying uses .
It should be noted that you can also purchase ' whole hemp seeds ' that are not ' hulled ' ( outer shell removed ) .
They are a bit harder to find at your local grocery store , but there are lots of places on the internet where you can buy them .
Whole hemp seeds are an excellent source of minerals and much more stable out in the air then hulled seed .
However Nutiva takes great care in processing and packaging their ' hulled ' hemp seeds creating maximum nutritional potential .
I have recently ordered ' whole hemp seeds ' from several manufactures and will be writing a future article on the best place to find them .
On a separate note : I highly recommend everyone reading this , to watch a documentary called : Emperor of Hemp by Jack Herer .
You will be amazed at how hemp fiber could revolutionize the world we live in , but as always the harvesting of hemp is outlawed to protect ' Big Corporation ' from massive profit loss .
All of which is truly at the expense of our planet .
Incorporating hemp seeds in your diet is so easy .
You can purchase whole hemp seeds , hulled hemp seeds , hemp seed protein powder , and hemp seed oil .
Simply just eat them raw , add them to a salad , replace olive oil with hemp seed oil , etc .
I add 2 tbs of Hemp Seeds everyday to my ‘ health shake ’ .
Post a comment below and tell us how you use hemp seeds !
Remember it 's best to keep hemp seeds refrigerated and air tight .
If you purchase a bulk 5 - pound bag , consider adding a pound to a container for daily use , and seal up the 5 - pound bag and place it in the freezer .
This will help protect the seed and the nourishing Omega - 3s which are sensitive to heat and oxygen .
You can buy them at Whole Foods and many grocery and health stores , there usually located in the vitamin department .
I personally buy them online at www.Nutiva.com .
Some grocery and health food stores have hemp seeds in the ' dry bin ' section .
The only reservation I have about this , is hemp seeds should be stored in a dark , sealed , air tight container and then kept at a cool temperature to preserve the nourishing Omega - 3s which are sensitive to heat and oxygen , With the ' dry bins ' you do n't know where the hemp seeds came from , how long they have been there and they ’re usually not sealed , in a cool place or certified organic .

Chavez has been keen to mobilise anti-US opinion in the region
The vehemently anti-US leader says Nicaragua , Bolivia , Cuba and Dominica should create one united force .
Mr Chavez , a long time critic of what he sees as US imperialism , made the comments after a summit of its leaders .
Despite constant US denials , Mr Chavez is convinced it poses a serious threat to South and Central America .
Venezuela 's socialist leader has long been a critic of what he sees as US imperialism .
He has recently accused the country of trying to destabilise the region by forging stronger links with Colombia .
Mr Chavez has some key allies in his fight against capitalism , globalisation and the US .
Bolivia , Cuba , Nicaragua and now the Caribbean island of Dominica are all members of a trade alliance known as the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas , a group that takes its name from South America 's independence leader , Simon Bolivar .
Mr Chavez has urged them to draw up a joint defence policy and create a united military force against US imperialism .
" If the US threatens one of us , it threatens all of us , " he said , " we will respond as one . "

Today on his website former U.S. Senator Mike Gravel of Alaska announced that he is leaving the Democratic Party for the Libertarian Party .
Gravel , who was the best thing about those early Democratic primary debates said , “ Today , I am announcing my plan to join the Libertarian Party , because the Democratic Party no longer represents my vision for our great country .
I wanted my supporters to get this news first , because you have been the ones who have kept my campaign alive since I first declared my candidacy on April 17 , 2006 . ”
He explained his reason for leaving the Democratic Party .
“ The fact is , the Democratic Party today is no longer the party of FDR .
It is a party that continues to sustain war , the military - industrial complex and imperialism — all of which I find anathema to my views .
By and large , I have been repeatedly marginalized in both national debates and in media exposure by the Democratic leadership , which works in tandem with the corporate interests that control what we read and hear in the media . ”
In today ’s terms , Gravel really is more of a Libertarian than a Democrat .
Gravel is a supporter of the flat tax , a single payer universal health care system , an opponent of not only the Iraq war , but the entire Bush Middle Eastern Policy .
Gravel supports same sex marriage and is against free trade .
Advertisements
A good way of explaining Gravel is that he is the liberal equivalent of Ron Paul .
Just as Paul is upset that Republicans have shunned their conservative roots , Gravel thinks the Democratic Party are a bunch of cowards who have banished the term liberal from their lips .
Mike Gravel is interesting person who is fun to write about .
Here is wishing him the best with his new party .

After the ruling has been declared by the Foreign Ministry of Israel , Israelis who are relatives of suicide bombings by Palestinian militants can now sue the Palestinian Authority .
There are already 55 suits filed against the Palestinian Authority ; where many more can follow afterwards .
In the span of eight years since 2000 , there have been 131 suicide bombings by Palestinian militants .
As a result , the lives of 541 people have been claimed .
Most of the suits filed are by relatives of the 21 teenagers killed during the bombing back in 2001 in Tel Aviv .
Since then , they have been trying to get the right to file a lawsuit .
The decision was left up to the Foreign Ministry back in 2007 .
The order to decide had come from the order by Israel ’s Supreme Court .
So far , the Palestinian Authority is not considered a state .
In an ironic note , the Palestinian Authority is still recognized as the government authority of Palestine .
Currently , the militant group known as Hamas dominates places such as Gaza .
Since Israel does not recognize the Palestinian Authority as a state .
As a result , the Palestinian authority is not immune from lawsuits .
Now , it is subject to the first 55 lawsuits would could be the first of many .
However , the Palestinian Authority quickly rejected the ruling from Israel .
It said that Israel does not have any jurisdiction over the Palestinian Authority .
This recent ruling by Israel ’s Foreign Ministry could hurt the peace talks going on between both Israel and Palestine .
The issue of settlements had temporarily undermined the road to peace between both states .
With the issue of Israel and Palestine as a possible issue on foreign policy in the US presidential races , the lawsuits approved by Israel ’s Foreign Ministry could elevate that one aspect .
Gargantuan galaxy NGC 1132 - a cosmic fossil ? [ heic0804 ]
6 February 2008
The elliptical galaxy NGC 1132 , seen in this latest image from Hubble , belongs to a category of galaxies called giant ellipticals .
NGC 1132 , together with the small dwarf galaxies surrounding it , are dubbed a fossil group as they are most likely the remains of a group of galaxies that merged together in the recent past .
In visible light NGC 1132 appears as a single , isolated , giant elliptical galaxy , but this is only the tip of the iceberg .
Scientists have found that NGC 1132 resides in an enormous halo of dark matter , comparable to the amount of dark matter usually found in an entire group of tens or hundreds of galaxies .
It also has a strong X - ray glow from an abundant amount of hot gas - an amount normally only found in galaxy groups .
Its X - ray glow extends over a region of space ten times larger than the 120 000 light - year radius it has in visible light .
An X - ray glow that is equal in size to that of an entire group of galaxies .
The origin of fossil group systems remains a puzzle .
The most likely explanation is that they are the end - products of a cosmic feeding frenzy in which a large cannibal galaxy devours all of its neighbours .
A less likely explanation is that they may be very rare objects that formed in a region or period of time where the growth of moderate - sized galaxies was somehow suppressed , and only one large galaxy formed .
Many galaxies reside in groups that are gravitationally bound together , including our own Milky Way , which is part of the Local Group .
Sometimes gravity makes galaxies collide and eventually merge into one single galaxy .
There is strong evidence that the Milky Way is one such cannibal that has snacked on numerous smaller galaxies during its lifetime , inheriting their stars in the process .
Scientists are keenly studying the environment surrounding galaxies such as NGC 1132 using space telescopes like Hubble , and they try to trace the history of the formation these galaxies by analysing their properties .
In this Hubble image , NGC 1132 is seen surrounded by thousands of ancient globular clusters , swarming around the galaxy like bees around a hive .
These globular clusters are likely to be the survivors of the disruption of their cannibalised parent galaxies that have been eaten by NGC 1132 and may reveal its merger history .
In the background , there is a stunning tapestry of numerous galaxies that are much further away .
Elliptical galaxies are smooth and featureless .
They contain hundreds of millions to trillions of stars , and their shapes range from nearly spherical to very elongated in shape .
Their overall yellowish colour is a telltale sign of their great age .
Because elliptical galaxies do not contain much cool gas they can no longer make new stars .
NGC 1132 is located approximately 320 million light - years away in the constellation of Eridanus , the River .
This image of NGC 1132 was taken with Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys .
Data obtained in 2005 and 2006 through green and near - infrared filters were used to produce a colour composite .

British people are maintaining steady levels of disbelief over goverment claims about ID cards , according to official Home Office research .
Lobby group No2ID picked up on the research this week , but a spokesman for the IPS said it had been published on ips.gov.uk in November .
Google has a cache from earlier this month .
The survey asked people how important proposed benefits of the ID card would be - 74 per cent chose " disrupting the activities of terrorists and organised criminals " , but 23 per cent of people thought this was " slightly believable " and 11 per cent thought it was " not at all believable " .
Seven per cent of respondents did not recognise any of the eight benefits they were offered to choose between .
Researchers from Taylor Nelson Sofres summarised views as : " Across the board , full buy - in and belief in the schemes [ sic ] ability to deliver the proposed benefits is weak . "
Phil Booth , NO2ID 's National Coordinator , said : " After five years of trying to get people to like ID cards , even the Home Office 's own research says that only one in four believe they 'll do what they 're claimed to .
And this is supposed to be positive spin .
It 's both tragedy and farce .
" Mr Brown - if he 's in control at all - should shut down the ID empire - builders before this particular legacy of Blunkett and Blair gets any more embarrassing . "
The survey also noted that : " Interestingly prevention of illegal immigration is more " top - of - mind " than it was in wave 1 which is likely to reflect media coverage at the time interviewing was being conducted . "
The Tracking Research talked to people in October , the latest update should be published in the next month - we 'll bring you more belief - beggaring government research as we get it .
It will be interesting to see what impact the recent round of data losses by the UK government has on its believability quotient .
The survey used a sample of 2,052 people weighted to reflect the UK population .
The survey report is available from this page as a pdf . ®

Samba De Amigo
Up To Two Players
Cooperative & Competitive
Get Your Friends Shakin ’
Music games are always fun at parties .
They are n’t quite as intimidating to non-gamers and music on its own is a natural party enhancer .
Unfortunately , the Dreamcast does n’t have any 4 - player music games , but Samba De Amigo is the best game of the genre and does support two - players .
While games like Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Heroes are only entertaining to watch from the sidelines if the player is highly skilled , Samba De Amigo is a riot to watch no matter the experience level .
There is just something about watching people shake their maracas like there ’s no tomorrow .

Virtua Tennis & Tennis 2K2
Up To Four Players

Deep & Realistic , But Easy To Learn
The Sega Tennis games are some of the most unassuming classics in all of party gaming .
Typically , most people would view a Tennis game as being a boring experience , but if nothing else , Wii Sports has changed that perception a bit .
However , as apposed to Wii Sports , the Sega Tennis games offer a much more realistic and deep gameplay experience .
Having the essential quality of being easy to play and difficulty to master , Virtua Tennis is perfect for getting non-gamers in on the party action .
I have personally had many parties with both guys and girls of all gaming levels having a blast on a 4 - player doubles tournament .

Make Sure To Try Battle Tage Mode
As opposed to driving full - size cars ( that tend to be a bit more complex ) , Re-Volt puts players in the driver seat of small , remote - controlled cars .
You can think of it as a three dimensional hybrid of the NES classics Super RC Pro-AM and Micro Machines with extra multiplayer modes built in .
Very few racing titles will get a group of people yelling , screaming , and laughing as much as Re- Volt ’s Battle Tag mode .
The Battle Tag multiplayer mode is an addictive mix of Hide & Seek , Tag , and Hot Potato that is obviously perfect for parties .

Up To Four Players
Competitive
The Best Multiplayer Puzzle Ever
This unique puzzle game from Sonic Team not only served as a good brain - teaser in single - player mode , but also has solid multi-player features .
Chu Chu Rocket takes a cue from Lemmings , in that you must guide hapless creatures to safety .
The goal in Chu Chu Rocket is to guide mice to your rockets and cats into your opponents ’ rockets by placing arrow throughout a maze - like course .
Of course , you also have to avoid leading them to your opponents ’ rockets and blocking incoming cats .
To make matters worse , each player can only have three arrows on - screen at a time and cannot place them on other players ’ arrows or their own arrows .
Needless to say , the blazing competition and deep strategy easily make up for Chu Chu Rocket ’s simple presentation .

Propeller Arena
Up To Four Players
Competitive
Death Match In The Air
The multiplayer air combat game is one of the most famous of the unreleased Dreamcast games as it used the September 11th attacks and an excuse for its cancellation .
While some of the canceled games deserved their fate , Propeller Arena actually had a lot of promise as it was essentially a more arcade - like Crimson Skies .
The overall goal of Propeller Arena is fairly straightforward : shoot down as many planes as you can within the time limit .
It is essentially like Unreal Tournament mixed with dog fighting .
Just like any death - match game , if you get shot down , you will automatically re-appear in a random part of the arena to battle again .
Power - ups are also available throughout the game that can give your special weapons and abilities .
They are similar to the power - ups you would find in a game like Mario Kart .
The arcade - like control scheme makes Propeller Arena a great party game that is inviting to new gamers .
Before you know it , you will have four people yelling at each other as they blow each their foes out of the air .
As long as you do n’t mind downloading an unreleased game , there is no reason you should n’t give Propeller Arena a try .

This is another one of those unique games you wo n’t find on any other console .
Toy Commander lets you pull of combat missions with toy planes , tanks , trucks , and other vehicles , much like you did when you were a kid .
Toy Commander ’s four - player multiplayer has a number of modes that really bring the game to life .
There are multiple modes to try such as Deathmatch , Capture the Flag , and Cat and Mouse which is a concept similar to Re- Volt ’s Battle Tag .
While these modes might be similar in theory to those in an FPS , they are really a fresh experience in Toy Commander .

Classic Cartoon Racing
Once Mario Kart 64 came out , there were plenty of clones to be found on every console .
My personal favorite on the Dreamcast is Looney Tunes Space Race .
It uses cell - shaded graphics to create a convincing cartoon look for both the racers and the courses .
Like in Mario Kart , you have can obtain numerous power - ups to either give you a personal boost or devastate your opponents .
The power - ups also tie in nicely with the whole Looney Tunes theme , such as dropping anvils and those guns that fire a boxing glove on a spring .
Between the power - up hijinks , the crazy courses , and the authentic character voice - overs , Space Race is a riot for players of all ages .
You may also want to look intoWacky Races , which is a very similar game .

I usually played the Worms games played on the PC , but the Dreamcast also has a respectable port of both Worms Armageddon & Worms World Party .

Plenty of Mods to Keep Things Interesting
It ’s no secret that the Dreamcast has one of the best homebrew scenes of any console .
One of the standouts of the homebrew crowd is a side - scrolling brawler by the name of Beats of Rage .
As you can probably tell by the name it is inspired by Sega ’s classic Streets of Rage franchise .
In addition to the original Beats of Rage game , you can also find an excellent assortment of Beats of Rage Mods that put a new shell on the brawler ’s engine .
Probably the optimal way to test of the best of these brawlers is to download the Beats of Rage Volume 2 .

Great For Tournament Setups
There is no shortage of top - notch fighting games on the Dreamcast , so it is one of the best platforms for fighting game tournaments .
There are even a couple of my favorites that have special modes for four - player , team - based matches .
I wo n’t feature all the good fighting games here ( check here instead ) , but will instead cover four of my favorites for party situations …
Marvel vs. Capcom Series
Unless your friends are all hardcore fighting aficionados , Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is probably your best bet for a 2D fighter .
It ’s hard to pass up the frantic action that you get with three - on - three teams of comic book and video game icons armed with dizzying combo moves .
If you would like 4 - player tag - mode , you will want the original Marvel Vs. Capcom , which is n’t quite as flashy , but still very enjoyable .

When You Need Something Unique
If you enjoy games like Power Stone or Bomberman , you might want to also take a look at Ooga Booga .
In this wacky multiplayer titles , you play as witch doctors who throw shrunken heads , ride animals , or strategically using spells on each other to battle their way to victory and , in turn , the favor of a volcano goddess .
There are a few different gameplay modes to give your party a bit of variety .
The guys over at PlanetDreamcast did a much better job than I could do describing the modes , so I ’ll let them handle it …
Smakahuna – “ Chase your enemies around the island and each time you land a hit , you ’ll be rewarded points depending on the type of attack used .
At the end of each round , the player with the highest number of points wins . ”
Boar Polo – “ Two teams play a simplified game of polo — smacking , attacking , and charging a giant boulder towards their enemies ’ goal , hoping to score .
Most of the weapons are carried over from the Smakahuna mode , and can be used to either stop your enemies from scoring , or help move the ball for your own team . ”
Rodeo – “ focuses solely on your boar - riding skills .
In this event , points are scored only by hitting an opponent while atop a boar , or by knocking another player down from one .
Although less entertaining than the other modes , it ’s good practice for beginners looking to become swine - savvy . ”

Honorable Mentions :
Unreal Tournament & Quake III Arena :
If you have a newer console with more modern FPSs , you ’ll probably want to stick with those .
But if the Dreamcast is your most modern piece of hardware , both of these games have plenty of fun packed into them .
Capture the Flag or Deathmatch in Unreal Tournament are my personal favorites .
Outrigger is also worth looking into if you want a more arcade - like FPS with a not - so - dark look and feel .

KABUL , Afghanistan  Abdul Razzaq Hekmati was regarded here as a war hero , famous for his resistance to the Russian occupation in the 1980s and later for a daring prison break he organized for three opponents of the Taliban government in 1999 .
But in 2003 , Mr. Hekmati was arrested by American forces in southern Afghanistan when , senior Afghan officials here contend , he was falsely accused by his enemies of being a Taliban commander himself .
For the next five years he was held at the American military base in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , where he died of cancer on Dec. 30 .
The fate of Mr. Hekmati , the first detainee to die of natural causes at Guantánamo , who fruitlessly recounted his story several times to American officials , demonstrates the enduring problems of the tribunals at Guantánamo , say Afghan officials and others who knew him .
Afghan officials , and some Americans , complain that detainees are effectively thwarted from calling witnesses in their defense , and that the Afghan government is never consulted on the detention cases , even when it may be able to help .
Mr. Hekmati ’s case , officials who knew him said , shows that sometimes the Americans do not seem to know whom they are holding .
Meanwhile , detainees wait for years with no resolution to their cases .
In 1997 , when Mark Walsh was an eager student graduating from a California arts college course in animation , he was dreaming of a job at Disney .
" When I applied , they said you have to work your way up – and that it would take 10 years before I 'd do any real drawing , " says Walsh , now 32 .
Fortunately for him , there was another company emerging at the time , and Walsh heard they were hiring .
The firm of just 200 was no rival to Disney 's vast set - up , but it had one success under its belt and was looking for talent .
" The company was called Pixar , " Walsh says .
" And if I took the job there , I 'd be an animator right away .
But there was a problem – Pixar only did computer animation , and I was n't a computer person .
Of course , I took the job , even though it took me about six months to figure out what a computer was . "
Ten years on , Walsh is now the chief animator at Pixar , the " small company " that Disney bought two years ago for $ 7.4bn .
Given that Pixar 's CEO at the time was Steve Jobs , the force behind Apple , it 's hardly surprising that the studio was at the cutting edge of computer animation and has remained there ever since .
As anyone who 's seen Toy Story , A Bug 's Life , Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc knows , the hi-tech revolution has revitalised the animation industry .
Not to say that there 's much wrong with Snow White , or Bambi , or The Jungle Book ; it 's just that the new ones are , well , different .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" As computers get faster , it increases what we can do , " Walsh says .
" One thing is being able to have more detailed backgrounds , which were too expensive to do in Toy Story and A Bug 's Life , but which we can now do in every scene . "
Getting into character
Computers also mean that Pixar can make its films ultra-realistic .
For Monsters
Inc , staff set themselves the task of animating each of Sully 's three million strands of fur .
And this realism will only increase as processing power does .
" Our movies still run at 24 frames per second , but now that we do n't use film we could make it 48 or 64 frames a second , and at that speed it will start to look more like reality , " Walsh says .
" In the future , films will have super - high frame rates so that they will look real . "
For most of the last century , animated films were made up of drawings that were photographed and then copied on to transparent acetate sheets called cels , which were painted and then re-photographed individually on to motion - picture film .
But since the mid-Nineties , animators ' drawings have been either scanned or drawn directly on to a computer screen .
Pixar 's first film , the Oscar - winning , $ 354 m - grossing Toy Story , released in 1995 , was the first feature - length computer - animated film .
But Walsh , who has worked on A Bug's Life , Toy Story 2 , Monsters Inc , The Incredibles and Ratatouille , explains that there 's a lot more to making a computer - animated film than simply double - clicking on the right icon .
" The phrase ' computer animation ' makes it sound as if the computer does all the work .
It does n't .
The computer is a tool – basically , a really expensive pencil .
It can animate for you if you want something to look like a robot , with everything moving very evenly and then stopping abruptly , but at Pixar , every frame is hand - finished the same way as if we were animating with clay or paper . "
Testing the preliminary animations
What computers do allow Walsh to do is explore artistic avenues that are almost impossible to create on paper .
" Computers give me the chance , as an artist , to try things that would be hard for me to draw ; small twitches in the eye or the flick of a tongue that are difficult to draw on a small scale , but on a computer are quick . "
The entire process , however , still required hundreds of specialists .
" To begin with , the story is written in script form , then it is turned into a storyboard .
After that , we 'll cut it together to make a temporary movie .
At this stage , it 's still very low - tech " .
The computer is hardly used until the second half of the animation process .
" The first half is done the same way it was in 1937 for Snow White – on paper .
The computer and virtual - reality models happen after the drawing is done , and a clay sculpture of each character is made , to ensure that it will work in three dimensions , " Walsh says .
There are two reasons for still relying on paper and clay – they 're fast and cheap .
" As soon as you get into animating on computer software , it requires technicians , it requires artists who are specifically talented on a computer – and it requires computers themselves , which are much more expensive than a block of clay or a pencil and paper . "
Once the drawings are complete , the actors who lend their voices to cartoon rats and virtual fish record their lines .
" The actors are very gracious ; they let us videotape them , and some come and meet the animators , " Walsh says .
This interaction can help the film .
" Sometimes you 'll use aspects or mannerisms of the actor .
Ellen DeGeneres played Dory in Finding Nemo and , while Ellen does n't look anything like a fish , she does have a shorter upper lip and you can see her teeth when she talks .
We used that in her character . "
Cooking up CG food
Next , a team of computer - literate people take the drawings and turn them into three - dimensional models in virtual reality .
" Technicians will put controls into each model and work out the maths needed to make sure the elbow is in the right place ; if it 's not , a character 's arm will look like it 's broken , " Walsh says .
Despite working in a creative industry , Walsh and team are careful not to let their imaginations run too wild .
" At Pixar , we try to start off everything with reference – even if we 're going to be painting a bowl of fruit in the style of Picasso , we 'll look at a real bowl of fruit so we have something to base it on .
All the movies have extensive research done on them – in the five years it generally takes to make a film , I 'd say an entire year is spent researching . "
For Ratatouille , Walsh spent a year studying the movement and behaviour of rats .
He says he now thinks the rodents are " cute .
And very intelligent . "
He is hugely enthusiastic about the speed at which technology is allowing animation to develop .
" Ratatouille is state of the art , but our next film , Wall - E , will be even better .
Five years from now , Ratatouille will look as dated to us as Toy Story does now .
I find it very inspiring . "
One downside is a problem most computer users suffer – hardware and software that 's out of date all too soon .
" To resurrect the Toy Story characters for the third Toy Story [ due in 2010 ] we had to find an old machine somebody still had , " Walsh says .
" It was being used as a coffee table .
If they had n't saved it , we 'd have lost the original Buzz and Woody animations . "
Asked about the best way for young animators to learn the craft , Walsh advises low - tech experimentation first : " I started with notebooks and a pencil , which is the cheapest way to do animation at home . "
Among programs , Animation Master is a good starting - point ; for more advanced artists , Maya is a winner .
" But even Flash gives you the experience of creating something that moves . "
However , he warns against substituting flashy software for developing your skills .
" A lot of people are really excited that so much technology makes things accessible these days .
For example , you can record your own music with Home Studio on a Mac .
But it does n't make your song any good ; you still have to know how to write a song – or , in animation , to draw a picture .
I recommend that would - be animators go out and observe people . "
Or , indeed , rats .
Pixar , it seems , is limited only by its imagination – and that works pretty fast , too .
At a lunch in 1994 , when Toy Story was almost complete , four Pixar bigwigs came up with a bunch of ideas and scrawled a few characters on napkins .
They were to become A Bug's Life , Monsters Inc , Finding Nemo and Wall - E .
The first three each earned hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office .
Wall - E looks set to be another hit for the Pixar animators .
Ratatouille is out on DVD on 11 February .
Wall - E goes on general release in July
Faux Ph.D. Michael Martin Speaking With Adam Savage
The secondary topic of the latest episode of Discovery Channel 's popular Mythbusters program (
In the episode , Mythbusters inexplicably fails to explain the truth about how a polygraph " test " actually works and ( knowingly as I shall explain ) presents a phony Ph.D. as an authority on matters of polygraph validity .
Here 's how polygraph " testing " actually works :
The examinee is not supposed to know that secretly , the examiner expects answers to the so - called " probable - lie control questions " to be less than truthful .
An example of a commonly - used control question is , " Did you ever lie to get out of trouble ? "
The examinee is steered into a denial through the suggestion , for example , that anyone who would lie to get out of trouble is the same kind of person who would commit the crime under investigation and then lie about it .
But secretly , it is expected that everyone has lied to get out of trouble -- even those innocent of the crime .
Reactions to the control questions are then compared to reactions to the relevant questions ( those directly concerning the incident under investigation ) , for example , " Did you take that money from that office ? "
If reactions to the control questions are greater , the examinee passes .
If reactions to the relevant questions are greater , the examinee fails .
This simplistic methodology has no grounding in the scientific method and is inherently biased against the truthful , because the more honestly and fully one answers the control questions , and as a result feels less anxiety when answering them , the more likely one is to wrongly fail .
The procedure also includes irrelevant questions such as , " Are the lights on in this room ? "
The polygrapher falsely expains that such questions provide a " baseline for truth " because the true answer is obvious to both examiner and examinee .
But in fact , these irrelevant questions are not scored at all , but merely serve as buffers between pairs of relevant and control questions .
Mythbusters explained none of this critically important information to the audience , although they could have easily done so in a minute or two .
Again , the key to passing or beating a polygraph test is to exhibit stronger reactions to the control questions than to the relevant questions .
Methods for doing this include the techniques of tongue - biting and mental activity ( such as thinking exciting thoughts ) that were shown on the episode .
But these must be done timely with the asking of the control questions .
Instead , the Mythbusters personnel were told to apply countermeasures " when telling the truth . "
It appears that they wrongly applied their countermeasures when answering the unscored irrelevant questions .
It is hardly surprising that such misapplied countermeasures did not result in passing scores .
The polygraph operator who appeared on the show is none other than the infamous " Dr. " Michael Martin , whom AntiPolygraph.org has previously Mythbusters staff :

One of the topics I was asked about in the course of our phone conversation was a polygraph examiner who might be suitable to appear on the show .
They were initially interested in Bruce Burgess , who appeared in the same British show as I previously had .
In a follow - up e-mail sent on 31 August 2007 , I specifically warned them , in the event they chose to seek a polygraph examiner closer to home , against three prominent polygraph operators whom AntiPolygraph.org has identified as phony Ph.D.s :
Mythbusters cannot say they were not warned about Michael Martin 's credentials .
I think they owe the public an explanation of why they knowingly chose a fraud to appear on the show and allowed him to be presented as " Dr. " Martin .
The secondary topic of the latest episode of Discovery Channel 's popularprogram ( Season 5 , Episode 24 " Confederate Steam Gun " ) , which aired on Wednesday , 5 December 2007 , is the supposed " myth " that it is possible to beat a polygraph test .

“ A vigorous debate on an issue is not ‘ hate speech ’ – it ’s free speech .
I have made clear my opposition to the agenda of homosexual activists , but I have never endorsed or supported any hateful action targeting individuals on the other side of this debate and never will .
The fact that many gay rights activists claim anyone opposing their agenda is engaging in ‘ hate speech ’ says more about them than me . "
Yea , Sally ?
Those who are loudly lashing out against your comment that homosexuality is " the death knell of this nation " are saying more about themselves than they are saying about you ?
And what is it , exactly , that they are saying about themselves : that they refuse to sit back and let someone compare their lives and loves to an atomic bomb ?
That they wo n't allow people to foster the sort of hostility that keeps us all vulnerable ?
Or simply that they have a better handle on the concept of reality than you do , Ms. Kern ?
Because all we are hearing , Mr. Kern , are people who are SICK of living in a world where comments like yours get a considerable pass !
Sally dear , you got caught when you thought nobody was listening .
And you were caught warning folks that gays will destroy this society .
Gay activist are n't claiming everyone who lashes out against gays is engaging in " hate speech . "
We are claiming that YOU , Sally , have disseminated hate - filled rhetoric !
It 's fine that you want to try and spin it in your favor .
Such in human nature .
But do n't try and pass the buck , or make it sound like the gays are being nutty by reacting unkindly to you putting a warning label on our existences !
You put your homo - hostile thoughts on record , so we are now putting our reactions on the same !!
And should the chips fall in your direction ?
Well that says more about our need to keep fighting for respect than it does the righteousness in your words !

Kern Responds to Activist Criticisms
OKLAHOMA CITY – State Rep. Sally Kern ( R - Oklahoma City ) issued the following statement today in response to the criticisms of homosexual activists who have objected to a recent speech she gave on their efforts to promote their agenda at both the federal and state level .
“ To put this simply , as a Christian I believe homosexuality is not moral .
Obviously , you have the right as an American to choose that lifestyle , but I also have the right to express my views and my fellow Oklahomans have the right to debate these issues .
“ In recent years homosexual activists have begun to aggressively promote their agenda through the political process , often providing substantial financing to candidates who agree with their views , including many running for state legislative races .
National publications such as Time , The Atlantic and USA Today have noted that trend .
That is their right , just as it is my right to voice opposition to their agenda , which I have been asked to do at several public forums in recent months .
That ’s what democracy is all about .
It appears some homosexual activists believe only one group is allowed a voice in this debate .
I disagree .
“ A vigorous debate on an issue is not ‘ hate speech ’ – it ’s free speech .
I have made clear my opposition to the agenda of homosexual activists , but I have never endorsed or supported any hateful action targeting individuals on the other side of this debate and never will .
The fact that many gay rights activists claim anyone opposing their agenda is engaging in ‘ hate speech ’ says more about them than me .
“ Most Oklahomans are socially conservative and believe marriage is a sacred institution , the union of one man and one woman , and that the traditional family is worth protecting and preserving .
When I campaigned for office , I promised my constituents to stand up for those values , and I do not apologize for keeping my word . ”
Your thoughts
I was waiting for what you would say today Jeremy .
I do not think I could say it better than fritz in his video .

I think what some of these right wings people forget is that free speech does n't equal free pass .
No one founding father ever said that people should turn a blind eye to hateful speech .
They said that the ** government * * could not censor a person and prevent them from speaking .
However , the founding fathers never said that the " people " could n't hold someone responsible for that speech .
No one is preventing Ms. Kern from making any statements .
However , if the people she serves and who she supposedly represents recognize that her speech is hateful , does n't reflect the values they hold and want to replace her that is their right .
We have the right to point out that hateful , if only in our opinion , speech to the world and let them evaluate it .
She can then use her free speech to defend her thoughts and her words .
But free speech does n't mean we have to like the speech and remain quiet .
We can challenge her on it as long as we do n't deny her the right to her own corner in the world to say what she wants .
That corner just does n't necessarily have to be in city council if the voters do n't want it to be .

Exactly , Ed .
You have no clue how many emails I receive from people asking why I feel have the right to stifle others ' free speech simply because they do n't agree with my " lifestyle . "
It never occurs to them that they have just as much right to start a mirror image website that challenges everything written on here !!

This woman was airing hate speech , plain and simple - which should n't be associated with free speech .
It 's no different than the KKK ranting about blacks , or neo -Nazi 's ranting about Jews .
For that matter , each time somebody like this vile bitch makes a speech like this , it should be loudly compared to the anti-Jew propaganda of the Nazi's .
Nobody ass - kiss the pruney old skank , because that 's exactly what it is .

Her last paragraph is a complete non sequitor , especially considering she was not " debating " SSM but making all encompassing blanklet pronouncements .
What is of further concern is that :
( a) She has a B.A. , Sociology , University of Texas , 1971 ; Teacher Certification in Social Studies with an emphasis in Government , East Texas State University , 1986 .
And that Kern is a teacher by profession .
( b) Rep. Sally Kern , District 84 Republican , serves as Chair on the Social Services Committee , and serves on the Education Committee , Common Education Committe , and Human Services Committee .

When people use the " free speech " argument , I think they are trying to intentionally distract from the issue .
Ms. Kerns has every right to say what she feels , but I would like to know where she gets her " facts . "

Might want to correct this : " Gay activist are [ n't ] claiming everyone who lashes out against gays is engaging in ' hate speech . ' "
Also , I have n't ready every LGBT organizations responses to this , but did they really use the term " hate speech " or is she just projecting that onto them ?

FWIW this creature 's career is dust even if some of her constituents agree with her bigotry .
A representative of a city that has been the victim of a terrorist attack just said gay people are worse than terrorism : I 'm sure her constituents , even those who agree with her bigoted views , remember the sight of dead children being pulled from the Murrah building .
Posted by : James Probis | Mar 10 , 2008 8:35:32 PM
I think the best solution is to remove her in the Republican Party primary .
Get a somewhat not as hostile Republican to replace her , the new Republican still may not be as friendly as a Democrat .
However the deadline to file is like 2 months from now , but its never too late to start an organization .

GayMormonBoy : " Also , I have n't ready every LGBT organizations responses to this , but did they really use the term " hate speech " or is she just projecting that onto them ? "
Local activists as quoted in Oklahoma newspapers and on Oklahoma City television stations KWTV and KSWO as well as others have referred to the speech as " hate speech " .
GLADD 's response referred to the Kern 's comments as " hateful and defamatory language . "
I cannot think of a more accurate description for the mendaciousness of her hyperbolic comments .

This says more about the phobes than anything else :

Hate speech that Silly Sally uses is exactly what causes some people ( namely young males ) to go out and bash and kill gay people , as well as those who do n't fit the traditional stereotype of heterosexuality .
Therefore , she should be tried as an accomplice to murder for any and all bashings and murders of gay people that take place in the future .
She has blood on her hands , and I guarantee that there are young males out there who have heard what she 's said and have filed it away in the back of their mixed - up minds under " Memo : Elected officials have declared that gay people must be killed in order to save society " .
Eventually some will act on this , and because of Sally 's vile little diatriabe , they have now decided that killing gay people is a moral necessity , something which must be done to save society , of no more consequence than squashing a bug , and something which officials deem to be perfectly acceptable .
I pasted a couple other comments below from a friend I thought are good :

Sally Kern technically calls for the eradication of homosexuals ??
Monday , March 10 , 2008 10:57 PM
From : " Rusty Morris " ( [ email protected ] )
View contact details To : [ email protected ]
What I find most interesting is what would happen to her based on her remarks in places like Canada or an EU country .
Do you realize that based on one particular remark she actually calls for ( technically ) the eradication of Gay people .
In her speech she sets up a scenario by which she equates the U.S. with " the body " and proceeds to equate Gay people with " toe Cancer " ... now we are n't stupid .
Everyone knows what you do with Cancer , to survive cancer you must cut it out , you must kill it , you must eradicate it from the body .
She proceeds in her analogy to discuss how , like toe cancer , if ignored will kill the body .
She states that to ignore toe cancer is stupid because although at the time it seems " nothing " , that without treatment it will spread and consume .
Well of course , this is logical and all true .
Her use of this analogy however is a lot more serious than it seems .
TO equate Gay people with toe cancer , a disease that must be stopped BEFORE it kills the body ... KNOWING what we all understand to be the proper course and treatment of cancer .
Cancer must be killed , must be purged , must be eradicated to survive .
She then hammers this subtle point home by moving on to statements and claims regarding any society that accepts homosexuality as only lasting a " couple decades " .
When taken altogether , her statements are technically a call for the extermination of Gay people .
Now of course the sheeple masses would agree that technically this is true but " could n't be what she really meant " .
In Canada such a statement by a public official would be taken as it lay .
She would be charged with Hate Speech violations and there would be no sissy codling of her words as " accidental analogies " .
The headlines would read ( and should read here ) " Rep. Sally Kern technically calls for the eradication of homosexuals ? "
Of course she did not get specific , and it is a question I would love to know , how DOES she plan to " Eradicate this cancer before it spreads " Killing ?.. isolation ?.. deportation ?
... concentration camps ?... arrest / imprisonment ?
By what method does she see an eradication of this cancer taking place in this country ?
This is something I would love to hear her respond to , I can here her now " Oh no , I did n't mean it like that " .. well sweety , it seems you should have chosen your analogies a bit more carefully ... because technically , and with all of us knowing the proper course for cancer treatment ... she DID just that .
Russ Rusty Morris wrote :
She can double talk all she wants to .
Equating Gay people with " toe cancer " as inevitable destruction of the body ( the US ) if not " treated " .
The use of words like " Terrorists " when engaging in what she calls " debate " , claiming Gay people are more of a threat than " Terrorists " is indeed the very definition of " hate speech " as it seeks to enrage , frighten , and demonize , KNOWING what those feelings drive people to do .
Further association and use of terms like " Indoctrinate 2nd graders " ( A further attempt to demonize and touch upon primal rage in the public by demonizing Gay people as a threat to children ) .
If Sally Kern expressed her opinion that according to HER interpretation of her PERSONAL religious beliefs SHE believes Homosexuality to be immoral and LEFT IT at that .
Then she would indeed have been doing nothing but expressing her " Free Speech " right to her own personal opinion .
This is not what Sally Kern did and SHE knows it .
She used every " buzz - phrase " .. every " demonization red herring " and every " incitement to riot " fear tactic she could vomit up in her " speech " to a group of , and in the company of , like minded fascist scum .
Sally Kern , like all those who skip happily down her road , RAPED the ideal of " Free Speech " by abusing it , twisting it , and codifying it as a shield for obvious hate speech .
To be a public figure and NOT know the difference between Free Speech and Hate Speech is WHY every other civilized country from Canada to Sweden laughs at us .
But like most right wing pundits , Sally Kern depends on the primal hatreds and ignorance of the public to allow her to whitewash what she said and what she is .
Sally Kern does n't like homos ?.. more power to her , revel in her hatred and bias till Jesus spits in her face and points her the other way , but when you say that my people are akin to a cancer in this country , a threat to 2nd graders , more dangerous than terrorists , blah blah same Nazi buzz tactics they used to rally people against the Jews ... then she has indeed went across the line , out from under the veil of free speech and into the nest of fascist Klu Klux Klan , Phelps soldier pickets , and Christian Identity supremacist ideals .
That is the truth of the matter .

Wow , Preston - very nice response , and spot on .
Give your friends a cyber - hug from me :)
Of course a majority of gay people are like " we need to understand her " , " maybe she 's having financial problems " , or some other ass - kissing lame excuse .
When trailer trash like this hillbilly is spreading an indirect version of Nazi propaganda , people need to call it like it really is .
And there 's some gay activists out there who will try to present her speech as a pretty decorated cake , and those tree - hugging sissies are no better than this woman .
Supposedly she has a gay son , and when presented with her own speech , she could n't listen to it .
I wonder if her son was unaware of exactly how nutty his mother is , and she 's worried he 'll soon find out ?
Of course if I were the son , I 'd be stopping by to pick up whatever belongs to me , and the nutball wingnuts can have the bitch LOL

" Homophobia is a fear of people loving , more than it is of the sexual act " " There seems to be an innate distaste for the love involved , which I find absolutely extraordinary .
The issue is love .
It 's not about sex , neither terrorists !!!
Shame on you Sally Kern
Posted by : Steven Green | Mar 12 , 2008 8:41:22 PM
I wanted to call her up and leave a message but I do not know if that is legal ...
A woman this evil could probably get me in trouble for it but i wanted to tell her she should be MORE than ashamed of herself for saying that homosexuality is more of a threat than terrorism and comparing it to cancer of the toe ?
She should be stripped of any power she holds in this " land of the free . "
Destroying our nation ?
Try school shootings or STDS that are affecting homosexuals and heteosexuals alike .
This woman does not represent anything I stand for and she should also be ashamed as a Christian - EVERYONE is loved by God .
This is the most disturbing speech I have heard in a long time and it is scary that evil people like her have power .
SHAME ON YOU if you are reading this ... millions of people heard you loud and clear .
Posted by : Shayna | Mar 13 , 2008 9:01:00 AM
I support her right to speak her mind .
And all of you gays should be ashamed of yourselves to trying to take her right away ..... Also she is spot on in her assessment that our schools no longer teach but simply indoctrinate ....
She is also correct ( for those who do not know history ) the homosexuality has taken down very powerful societies ... She is on the mark .... even though gays do not like her truth
Posted by : Tammy | Mar 14 , 2008 3:30:02 PM
Tammy :
For the one million and sixth time , nobody is denying her right to speak her mind .
We are simply employing OUR right to call her out on her words !!
The " free speech " argument is a childish distraction .
Schools do not indoctrinate .
They are trying to eliminate bias .
The bias that those of us who grew up gay knew ( and still largely know ) all too well .
Homosexuality has not ever destroyed a society .
What revisionist rubbish !!
Posted by : G - A - Y | Mar 15 , 2008 9:04:00 AM
Although I do not agree how Sally said this ; could she be telling the TRUTH ?
It seems to me the whole issue comes down to what TRUTH we believe .
Could this shift in our personal TRUTH lead to our nation ’s downfall ?
God has given us the ability to choose between TRUTH and NON TRUTH .
Most of us want to do what is right .
We all are looking for data or research that will support what we think is the TRUTH .
Sally ’s TRUTH is based on what was written and has been followed for over 4000 thousand years .
Your TRUTH is just getting out .
I can only wonder why it has taken this long to come to us after all this time .
My hope , and I ’m sure this is God ’s hope , is that we both get the TRUTH before we see our end on this Earth .
Posted by : Denis | Mar 18 , 2008 6:55:45 PM
Yes there is such a thing as free speech , which she executed , there 's also something called consequences of one 's actions .
I think that consequentially Sally Kern needs to resign .
because as an elected official it is your responsibility to represent the people of your county and your voice is their voice so you 'd better watch you what you say .
If an elected official said that African American 's or Arab Americans or insulted any race by calling them the " downfall of society " or " the death knell of this nation " the would be out of office faster than you could snap your fingers .
So why should it be any different for Sally Kern who blatantly attacked homosexuals with some serious accusations and false indoctrination .
this is the type of brainwashing that 's is confusing people into hating something harmless .
Behind every Mathew Shepperd their 's a Sally Kern spewing lies into the ears of the attackers .

Mark Dixie denies murder
Case background
Mark Dixie , accused of killing Sally Anne Bowman , said he did not realise she was dead until after he had sex with her body , the Old Bailey heard .
He said he became suspicious when the teenager did not react to bites on her face and body .
Mr Dixie , 37 , denies murdering the 18 - year - old in Croydon , south London , during a sex attack , in September 2005 .
Giving evidence , he said : " I do n't know what went through my mind .
I took full advantage of someone and I should not have done it . "
' Pair of legs '
He told the Old Bailey : " I am totally disgusted with myself . "
He said he had been biting her and there was no reaction .
" I pulled the hair away from her face , " he said .
Prosecutor Brian Altman asked : " You killed her for sex , did n't you ? "
Sally Anne Bowman was stabbed seven times
Mr Dixie replied : " No . I did not go out looking for someone to kill for sex . "
He also denied stealing Miss Bowman 's underwear as a trophy .
The court heard Miss Bowman was found in a pool of blood in the driveway of her home in Blenheim Crescent .
Prosecutors allege Mr Dixie stabbed her seven times and raped her as she was dead or lay dying .
But Mr Dixie has told jurors that he found Miss Bowman 's body after a drink and drugs binge .
He told the court : " I have gone over it during the last three years .
I do n't know what went through my mind .
I panicked .
I stood up .
I looked at her .
I did not know what to do
Mark Dixie
" All I saw was a pair of legs ... shirt put down to the waist and I took advantage of her .
Anthony Glass , QC , defending , asked if he thought she was dead or unconscious .
Mr Dixie said : " I would not have expected to see anyone dead in that street .
" I thought she might have passed out or fallen over . "
But he admitted there was no reaction during the sex attack , even when he bit Miss Bowman .
Mr Glass asked Mr Dixie , " Did you , in fact , realise she was dead ? "
To which he responded : " After a while .
I panicked .
I stood up .
I looked at her .
I did not know what to do . "
Mr Dixie described how he then placed cement dust and concrete from a nearby skip on Miss Bowman 's body to conceal his DNA .
The trial continues .
At the same time , oil consumption keeps expanding .
Global consumption is forecast to increase by 1.2 million barrels a day this year , to 87.2 million barrels a day , with much of the growth in demand coming from China , India and the Middle East , according to the International Energy Agency , a group that advises industrialized countries .
In the United States and through much of the developed world , the higher fuel prices have led drivers to reduce their consumption , and gasoline demand is expected to drop this year .
But that drop will be more than offset by the rise in energy demand from developing countries .
In the next two decades , demand is projected to jump by 35 percent , and developing countries will consume more oil than industrialized countries .
Higher oil prices mean record profits for oil companies that have , to some extent , masked the supply problems .
Exxon Mobil and Chevron are both expected to deliver knockout performances when reporting quarterly earnings this week , even as they struggle to increase production .
“ What is disturbing here is that things seem to get worse , not better , ” said David Greely , an analyst at Goldman Sachs .
“ These high prices are not attracting meaningful new supplies . ”
The outlook for oil supplies “ signals a period of unprecedented scarcity , ” Jeff Rubin , an analyst at CIBC World Markets , said last week .
Oil prices might exceed $ 200 a barrel by 2012 , he said , a level that would very likely mean $ 7 - a - gallon gasoline in the United States .
Some regions are simply running out of reserves .
Norway ’s production has slumped by 25 percent since its peak in 2001 , and in Britain , output has dropped 43 percent in eight years .
Production from the giant Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska has dropped by 65 percent from its peak two decades ago .
In many other places , the problems are not below ground , as energy executives like to put it , but above ground .
Higher petroleum taxes and more costly licensing agreements , a scarcity of workers and swelling costs , as well as political wrangling and violence , are making it harder to raise production .
For years , German submarines U - 19 , U - 20 , and U - 23 were a terrifying presence beneath the waves , preying on British and Russian shipping .
Then , 60 years ago , they suddenly vanished to the bottom of the Black Sea .
Now the hulk of one of the lost submarines has been found by divers who are confident they can pinpoint the other two boats too .
The fate of " Hitler 's lost fleet " was the talking point of a conference on international shipwrecks at Plymouth University at the weekend , when the Turkish marine engineer Selcuk Kolay described his painstaking search for the missing wrecks .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The search began along the Turkish coast near the town of Zonguldak in 1994 , after the Turkish navy complained that it was having difficulty conducting minesweeping operations .
Local people had known for years that the submarines were out there under the water somewhere , though the remarkable story of the U - boats is one of the lesser known episodes of the war .
The three submarines were originally part of a six - boat flotilla harassing Allied shipping around the North Sea .
U - 23 had patrolled the Spanish coast during the civil war , under the command of a young Sea Lieutenant , Otto Kretschmer , who was to become Germany 's top U - boat ace .
He was known as " Otto the Silent " for his mastery of silent running and his reluctance to make radio contact with Germany while he was at sea .
His career almost finished before it had properly begun when a British submarine spotted U - 23 off the Danish coast in October 1939 and fired three torpedoes at it .
All three missed .
Before he was transferred to another boat , Kretschmer scored his first hit of the war in U - 23 when he sailed into the Moray Firth and sank a 10,000 ton Danish tanker on 12 January 1940 .
The U - boats of the 30th flotilla were small by Second World War standards – only 140 feet long – which made them popular with the Kriegsmarine when it was rearming in the 1930s .
The Type II - B , nicknamed Einbaum ( dugout canoe ) , were cheap to build and could be run off an assembly line quickly .
Once war began , the smaller submarines were taken out of action in the Atlantic and North Sea as soon as larger boats could be built to replace them .
But their size was an advantage when choosing craft for their next deployment .
After the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 , the German high command decided that it needed the flotilla to attack Soviet ships in the Black Sea .
To have taken the subs by sea past Great Britain and Gibraltar would have been hazardous .
And they would then have had to go through Turkish waters , violating that country 's neutrality .
So it was decided they would go by land .
Each weighed just under 280 tons , making it easier to convey them on their 2,000 mile ( 3,300 km ) journey overland .
The submarines docked in Kiel and were taken by canal to the Elbe , then upstream to Dresden .
There they were dismantled and taken 85 miles by lorry to Ingolstadt , on the Danube .
They were then ferried hundreds of miles through Germany , Austria , Hungary and Romania , to the Black Sea port of Constanta .
Over the next three years , the flotilla sank 45,000 tons of Soviet shipping , while losing three boats .
But in September 1944 , the Red Army entered Romania , its government switched sides , and the remaining three subs were stranded .
Their crews were ordered to scuttle their boats and try to make it home by land .
They rowed to Turkey , but were interned for the rest of the war .
Mr Kolay used German divers , interviews with survivors , and sonar soundings in his search for the three sunken U - boats .
His divers have found U - 20 , which is two miles off shore and about 80 feet under water .
" It 's in wonderful condition , still fully intact , " he said .
He believes he has also pinpointed U - 23 , under 160 feet of water three miles off the coast , and thinks he knows roughly where U - 19 is , further out and more than 1,500 feet down .
Only 20 Type II - B submarines were ever built , and just one survives , making the prospect of retrieving three of them in good condition an enticing one for naval historians .
And as the 25 man crew of each ship got out alive , they are not considered to be war graves .

Cafferty : “ We ’ve got an inside look at the early days of Guantanamo Bay prison camp .
It ’s emerging and it ’s a little scary .
A confidential 2003 manual that was leaked onto the internet shows that military officials had a policy of denying some detainees access to Red Cross monitors .
…
Some experts are saying that this policy may in fact have violated international law . … ”
The Guantanamo prison camp 's 2003 field operations manual was posted on Wikileaks , a Web site that encourages posting of leaked materials .
The Pentagon claims " that the manual appeared genuine but described outdated policies and that all Guantánamo detainees could now see Red Cross monitors . "
Whew , I guess that clears that up .
I mean , they said so , so it must be true , and after all that was like 4 years ago .
It 's not like anyone could still be held accountable for apparent violations of international law from that far back , and besides , if they were in Gitmo they must have been really , really bad guys who deserved never to see the light of day anyway or they would n't have been there in the first place , right ?
So why are so many of Jack 's emailers still so worked up about it ?

He is gonna answer it like I would get a phone call at 3 in the morning : “ Yeah , who ’s this ?
This better be good or I ’m going to come down there and put somebody in a wheelchair . ”
Some things never change , Seth .
People saying he ’s not a fighter .
Let me tell you something .
He ’s a gangsta , he ’s from Chicago .
Barack is not winning because he ’s a black man .
If that was the case , I would be winning .
And I ’m way blacker than him .
I used to smoke Newports and drink Olde English .
I grew up on government cheese , I prefer it .
Now there ’s all this stuff and all this talk about the pastor .
Barack has to stay away from the pastor , ‘ cause he ’s too black .
But just because he knows the dude does n’t think … does n’t mean that he ’s gonna think like him .
Look , I have a friend who goes to strip clubs , that does n’t mean that I am gonna go to the strip club .
MEYERS : But you do go to strip clubs .
MORGAN : Yeah , but I go for the girls , not because my friend is going .
I have integrity .
Barack is qualified .
Personally , I want to know what qualifies Hillary Clinton to be the next president .
Is it because she was married to the president ?
If that were the case then Robin Givens would be the heavyweight champion of the world .
If Hillary ’s last name was n’t Clinton , she ’d be some crazy white lady with too much money and not enough lovin’ .
That ’s where I come in .
I know women like that , you do not want them on the phone at 3 in the morning .
In conclusion , three weeks ago , my girl Tina Fey went on the show , she declared that “ bitch is the new black ” .
You know I love you , Tina .
You know you ’re my girl .
But I have something to say .
Bitch may be the new black , but black is the new president , bitch .
Abstract
GRUB
The PC hard disk layout
This description details the structure at the start of a hard disk in a PC , and howfits into that structure .
The diagram below is the disk layout of my linux laptop which is very standard .
There are 4 primary partitions whose size and function are labeled , but this document is going to concentrate on the expanded area in the diagram at the start of the disk .
I will describe its structure and how GRUB fits in .
Note the structure is the same for windows systems , only the content ( grub ) is different .

The DOS compatibility region
LBA
CHS
The first sector ( 512 bytes ) is the MBR and consists of , 446 bytes bootloader , 64 bytes partition table and a 2 byte signature ( 0xAA55 ) .
It get its name because it is the firstthat is loaded , which can then load other boot records from various locations on the disk .
To give a hexdump of this first sector of the disk you can do ( changing / dev/hda as appropriate for your setup ) :
Note there is no mystery about or dissassembly required of the blue section above as GRUB is open source and one can download , inspect and modify its stage 1 source code .
This region is optional as far as linux is concerned at least , but is added by default by most partition managers .
To understand why this region was required we need to describe how disks used to be addressed .
Generally now disks are addressed inmode which allows for greater capacity disks while abstracting software away from the specifics of the disk itself .
Previously though disks were addressed inmode , which represented the physical construction of the disk as can be seen in the diagram below :
DOS had the requirement that its image did not span across cylinders , and so this region was added by partition managers so that the first partition was aligned on a cylinder boundary .
Therefore this region 's size is determined by the number of sectors ( 512 bytes ) per cylinder .
The maximum ( and usual given todays disk sizes and LBA ) sectors per track is 63 , which leaves 62 sectors free after the MBR ( 31,744 bytes ) .
GRUB uses this region to store its stage 1.5 , which is file system specific code used to find the operating system image on the " boot " file system .
Currently GRUB does not need all this space as can be seen for the copies of all the stage 1.5 files in the boot partition :
$ ls -lS / boot / grub / * stage1_5 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 9428 Mar 8 14:27 /boot/grub/reiserfs_stage1_5 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 9308 Mar 8 14:27 /boot/grub/xfs_stage1_5 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 8448 Mar 8 14:27 /boot/grub/jfs_stage1_5 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7956 Mar 8 14:27 /boot/grub/e2fs_stage1_5 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7684 Mar 8 14:27 /boot/grub/fat_stage1_5 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7272 Mar 8 14:27 /boot/grub/ufs2_stage1_5 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7188 Mar 8 14:27 /boot/grub/minix_stage1_5 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7028 Mar 8 14:27 /boot/grub/iso9660_stage1_5 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6996 Mar 8 14:27 /boot/grub/ffs_stage1_5 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6612 Mar 8 14:27 /boot/grub/vstafs_stage1_5
dd bs =512 seek=20 count=43 if=myfile of=/dev/hda
dd bs =512 skip=20 count=43 if=/dev/hda of=myfile
Therefore one could theoretically use the last 43 sectors of this region ( 22,016 bytes ) for anything .
There is no point in creating a file system in here as the overhead would be too much , but you could dd stuff in and out like :
Noteyou know what your doing before running these commands .
Note on my laptop the last sector of this region contains the first sector of a MSWIN4.1 boot record ( which I understand is 3 sectors in total ) , as it came with winxp installed ( in a FAT32 partition ) .
GRUB makes this sector redundant even in a dual boot situation , so do n't worry about overwriting it .
You can inspect this sector using : dd bs =512 skip=62 count=1 if=/dev/hda | od - Ax - tx1z -v
Note also the official grub docs on these disk areas which appeared about 7 years after I wrote the notes above .
GRUB 1 boot process
BIOS code reads MBR from a disk ( looks at last 2 bytes to verify if MBR ) .
Starts executing bootloader code ( GRUB stage 1 ) .
Bootloader jumps to location ( sector num ) of next stage .
This sector num is stored at a particular location in the bootloader " code " at GRUB install time and usually points to a stage 1.5 located in the " DOS compat space " immediately after the MBR .
Stage 1.5 knows about the boot file system so it opens the file system on the specified ( at install time ) partition .
It looks for the stage 2 executable here and executes it .
Note since stage 1.5 knows about the boot file system it gives much greater flexibility in upgrading stage 2 and the kernel etc. as their new locations do n't need to be written to the earlier GRUB stages .
Stage 2 contains most of the GRUB logic .
It loads the menu.lst file and executes the statements , usually providing a menu to the user etc .
Subsequent steps are distro specific but for completeness I 'll describe them for my fedora linux distribution :
When GRUB starts booting one of the entries , it reads the initial ramdisk and starts the kernel running telling it about the ramdisk .
In the initial ramdisk , the nash shell is run to parse the / linuxrc file .
It essentially finds the location of the file system it itself is on and passes that to the kernel as its root ( / ) file system .
This allows for greater flexibility of the devices the kernel resides on .
The kernel reads its root ( / ) file system and executes / bin / init by default .
This in turn parses / etc / inittab which usually sets up the login consoles and starts executing the scripts in /etc / init.d
These scripts start various subsystems , culminating in starting X . X in turn starts the display manager which gives a login prompt .
GRUB 2 boot process
GRUB or the GRand Unified Bootloader is the usual bootloader used on linux systems , and resides on the system as described above .
The boot process with GRUB is as follows :
Here is a good overview of the GRUB 2 boot process which was written 5 years after I wrote the following notes .
The structure of GRUB images has changed quite a bit with version 2 , ( which is still in development at the time of writing ) .
Instead of stage 1 , stage 1.5 and stage 2 images it has a collection of modules that can be combined in different ways .
To mirror the functionality the original GRUB 's stages as described above , you would have for example :
stage 1 = boot.img
stage 1.5 = diskboot.img+kernel.img+pc.mod+ext2.mod ( the core image )
stage 2 = normal.mod+_chain.mod
The boot process for GRUB 2 then would be :
BIOS code reads MBR from a disk ( looks at last 2 bytes to verify if MBR ) .
Starts executing bootloader code ( boot.img ) .
This loads the first sector of the core image ( diskboot.img ) , whose location was stored at a particular location in boot.img at GRUB install time and usually points to the core image located in the " DOS compat space " immediately after the MBR .
diskboot.img in turn loads and executes the rest of the core image .
These core image modules know about the boot file system and can open the file system on the specified ( at install time ) partition .
It looks for and loads modules there , including normal.mod
normal.mod loads the grub.cfg file and executes the statements , usually providing a menu to the user etc .
Booting GRUB 2 from GRUB legacy
title GRUB2 entries root ( hd0,0 ) kernel / grub2 / core.img boot
© Jul 28 2005
This is a more flexible mechanism .
For example one can prepend pxeboot.img to the core image instead of diskboot.img .
This will then load the whole core image from the network and then start executing kernel.img .
I hit this issue in Dec 2011 when I installed my new laptop with both Fedora 16 and RHEL 6.2 .
Each was given half the disk , with RHEL 6.2 installed last .
Hence the MBR pointed to the boot partition in RHEL 's portion of the disk ; i.e. GRUB legacy .
To get this in turn to boot GRUB2 as an option , in effect chainloading GRUB2 from GRUB1 , I added this entry to the old GRUB menu.lst
“ This was a perfect winter moms ’ group place for those of us with infants going stir- crazy , ” wrote one woman on onlytheblogknowsbrooklyn.com , wondering testily why local mothers could not at least drop in for “ a beer once a week when it ’s not crowded . ”
Of course , the practice of bringing babies and young children to bars is hardly exclusive to Park Slope .
The issue has been debated in online message boards in cities like Minneapolis , Philadelphia and Washington .
A woman in Boston , recently posting to yelp.com , a national , user - generated city - guide site , seemed appalled to see a 7 - year - old next to her at a bar .
( “ There were cubes , crayons and candy on top of the bar , ” she wrote .
“ Does anyone else think there ’s something wrong with that ? ” )
In England , the JD Wetherspoon chain of pubs recently implemented a rule making sure that parents who bring young children not only eat a meal , but stay for no more than two rounds .
After a recent smoking ban , more families have been bringing children to pubs , and a spokesman for the chain was quoted by the BBC as saying , “ Once the children have had their meal , we ca n’t see a reason why they should still be in the pub . ”
In New York , too , the smoking ban has altered the bar ’s image .
No longer a den of adult sin , the local tavern is now seen as an attractive option for afternoon gatherings among parents .
( Neither New York state nor city law forbids minors in bars , although state regulations say children under 16 must be accompanied by an adult , a State Liquor Authority spokesman said . )
Earth 's first animal was the ocean - drifting comb jelly , not the simple sponge , according to a new find that has shocked scientists who did n't imagine the earliest critter could be so complex .
The mystery of the first animal denizen of the planet can only be inferred from fossils and by studying related animals today .
To get to the bottom of that , scientists analyzed massive volumes of genetic data to define the earliest splits at the base of the animal tree of life .
The tree of life is a hierarchy of evolutionary relationships among species that shows which groups split off on their own evolutionary path first .
The new study surprisingly found that the comb jelly was the first animal to diverge from the base of the tree , not the less complex sponge , which had previously been given the honor .
" This was a complete shocker , " said study team member Casey Dunn of Brown University in Rhode Island .
" So shocking that we initially thought something had gone very wrong . "
Dunn 's team checked and re-checked their results and came up with the same result every time : the comb jelly came first .
The results are detailed in the April 10 issue of the journal Nature , a journal that , like most respected journals , requires other scientists review a paper prior to publication .
Unlike sponges , comb jellies have connective tissues and a nervous system , and so are more complex .
Though squishy and tentacled , they are not , however , true jellyfish as they lack the classic bell - shaped body and characteristic stinging cells .
The finding was unexpected because evolutionary biologists had thought that less complex animals split off and evolved separately first .
Dunn says that two evolutionary scenarios can explain why the comb jellies would actually have been first among animals .
The first is that the comb jelly evolved its complexity independent of other animals after branching off to forge its own path .
The second is that the sponge evolved its simpler form from the more complex form .
This second possibility underscores the fact that " evolution is not necessarily just a march towards increased complexity , " Dunn said .
Though scientists can say which animal branched off first , they can't date precisely when this early comb jelly diverged away .
" Unfortunately , we do n't have fossils of the oldest comb jelly , " Dunn said .
" Therefore , there is no way to date the earliest jelly and determine when it diverged . "
Though comb jellies are a common creature in the seas today , these modern specimens likely look very different from their early ancestors .
Dunn and his team hope that their approach will fill other gaps in the tree of life , including where the branches of many of today 's species belong .

The Terrorist attack you are supposed to forget ...
What do you think about that terrorist attack that occurred in the U.S. involving WMD ?
Whenever I ask somebody that they do n't know what I 'm talking about .
Which is what they are supposed to do .
It served its purpose .
I am talking about the Anthrax letters , which killed several people , and was a textbook example of state sponsored terrorism .
Anthrax is a WMD is n't it ?
Is n't that why we 've killed hundreds of thousands of people in Iraq ?
Because Saddam Hussein did n't have a stockpile of anthrax but since it was claimed he did by our government that was good enough , to go kill , invade , and stay there ?
The anthrax attacks and the terrorist attack of 9/11 are part of the same event .
The only way you can possibly separate the two is if you believe a person was watching his TV on 9/11 and suddenly realized that the anthrax he had been making in his multi million dollar bioweapons research facility and was coincidently just now being perfected for delivery can now be sent out and blamed on anti Israel anti-American Muslim fanatics .
That is a bit far fetched I think you would have to agree .
Take a look at the actual anthrax letters themselves :
" The anthrax letters attack was classic terrorism in that rather than designed to kill as many people as possible , was designed to terrorize as many people as possible .
The choice of a variety of media as targets seems to have been cleverly designed to ensure a broad spectrum of publicity about the attacks .
The choice of Senators Daschle and Leahy suggests that the perpetrator may lean to the political right and may have some specific grudge against those Senators . ”
{b}
" This is next " the letters say .
" We have this anthrax , ” another states .
The President of the United States was telling us the same thing was n't he ?
That the next wave of attacks would be wmd , by these crazy terrorists , and Saddam has this anthrax ?
But lets get real now .
These terrorists that G Bush is warning us about are NOT the ones who actually attacked us with WMD .
So who did ?
Who are the real terrorists ?
It is n't hard to figure out .
Every letter says 9-11 - 01 , which BTW is the western ( American ) style of writing dates , and is showing its link with the event .
The first letter was mailed on 9 -18 - 01 .
This is absolute proof , that the anthrax letters and 9/11 are part of the same event .
" In my opinion , there are maybe four or five people in the whole country who might be able to make this stuff , and I 'm one of them , " said Richard O. Spertzel , chief biological inspector for the U.N. Special Commission from 1994 to 1998 .
" And even with a good lab and staff to help run it , it might take me a year to come up with a product as good . " {a} I think he might be a little off , in his estimate of 4 or 5 people but not much , according to a former defense scientist the number of defense scientists with hands - on anthrax experience and the necessary access is under 50 .
{b}
That should narrow the suspects down if the evidence points in this direction and it clearly does .
There was only one week between Sept 11 and Sept 18 , when the first two letters ( and probably another letter , never found , to AMI ) were postmarked .
This suggests that the anthrax was already in hand , and the attack largely planned , before Sept 11 .
{b}
The perpetrator was ready before Sept. 11 and simply took advantage of the likelihood that Sept. 11 would throw suspicion on Muslim terrorists .
So , lets figure out who was behind the anthrax attacks .
I think you would agree that if Iraq did not have any anthrax , and had shut down their bioweapons facilities , it would be impossible to blame them right ?
Al Qaeda does n't have the means to make it .
A classified report dated February 1999 discusses responses to an anthrax attack through the mail .
The report , precipitated by a series of false anthrax mailings , was written by William Patrick , inventor of the US weaponization process , under a CIA contract to SAIC .
The report describes what the US military could do and what a terrorist might be able to achieve .
According to the NY Times ( 12 Dec. 01 ) the report predicted about 2.5g of anthrax per envelope ( the Daschle letter contained 2g ) and assumed a poorer quality of anthrax than that found in the Daschle letter .
{b}
So the intelligence agencies of the United States had already conducted a hypothesis of what a terrorist attack using anthrax mailings would be like , is n't that interesting ?
" Authorities are n't even certain the anthrax cases are connected to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- believed to be the work of Osama bin Laden 's al Qaeda network -- but the Bush administration is certainly suspicious of a link . "
" I would n't put it past him , but we do n't have hard evidence yet , " President Bush said of bin Laden .
{c} Nope no evidence , not yet and he never has and never will , because the anthrax that was sent was the most potent ever released into society and could only be made by a nation state , and guess what we found out when we invaded Iraq ?
It was n't them .
Not even close .
" Officials acknowledge that the strains of anthrax seem to be from the same source .
In the case of the letter sent to Sen . Tom Daschle ( D - S.D. ) , weapons - grade anthrax was detected .
Weapons - grade anthrax is a chemically altered form , which makes the disease able to survive in the air .
Some experts argue this type of bacteria comes from only three countries : the United States , Russia and Iraq " .
{d}
The anthrax spores that contaminated the air in Senate Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle 's office had been treated with a chemical additive so sophisticated that only three nations are thought to have been capable of making it , sources said .
" The United States , the former Soviet Union and Iraq are the only three nations known to have developed the kind of additives that enable anthrax spores to remain suspended in the air , making them more easily inhaled and therefore more deadly , experts said yesterday " .
Anthrax cannot be weaponized by terrorists , and it could probably never be used successfully as a military weapon .
It has to be converted to spores suspended in the air , which is technically very difficult ; and the lethality is nowhere near the terror that it is made out to be .
To use anthrax as a weapon , it must be converted to a powder , which can be inhaled .
Only the US and Russian militaries have succeeded in doing that .
Even Iraq used anthrax in liquid form , which is totally ineffective .
The first requirement would be to aerosolize the spores .
The spores would have to be converted to a dry powder , because a liquid would create globs , which would fall to the ground , rather than staying suspended in the air .
How do workers clean the equipment without getting spores everywhere ?
A likely procedure would be to enclose the equipment in a pressure chamber and steam sterilize it for several days .
Such an operation costs hundreds of millions of dollars , considering related facilities and development .
Only countries do that , not radical groups .
In fact , military and UN inspectors only found two Iraqi warheads with anthrax in them ( in liquid form ) .
If Iraq had anthrax in an effective form , it would have had it in hundreds of warheads , as they did with nerve gas .
So Iraq knew its anthrax was useless .
{f} Terrorists cannot weaponize anthrax .
The weaponized powder came from the US weapons labs , as demonstrated by a chemical that was on it .
Some weird loner did n't make this stuff in his basement .
But lets look at what the US Government was doing as far as bioweapons research in the time leading up to 9/11 , since it is looking more and more like it was from this source it came from , and the anthrax had to have been prepared before the 9/11 attacks .
What the US Government was doing was withdrawing from the Bioweapons Convention and refusing to go along with inspection teams to enforce the treaty .
West Wing Why Americans Never Vote for What They Really Want
American voters are a contradictory bunch :
They say they want social welfare , but do n't want to pay for it .
They claim they are left - leaning , but vote for center - right candidates .
Only candidates who can appeal to both sides stand a chance .

Here 's the bug : the smaller the amount of input text , the better the sentences are that it generates .
( Above a certain threshold -- too low , and you just get the input text back . )
I think I understand why this is .
My guess is that as the body of input text increases , the probabilities even out to normal - english - language distributions , and the end result starts behaving more like picking words at random in a vacuum .
You do n't tend to get sequences of 4 , 8 , 10 words together that all make a kind of sense ; you get 2 , then another 2 .
The distance between any two words gets smaller , and the overall probabilities become obscured .
I do n't think treating every pair of words as one ``word '' for statistical purposes will work very well ; that will be too clumpy .
I want some kind of commutative probability -- X is n % likely after A+B , but only m % likely after A+C. And A+D+E+F+G adds a correspondingly smaller amount of influence .
I 'd kind of like to do this without adding another dimension to my graph , because it 's already pretty huge .
Another order of magnitude just wo n't do .
But it seems that human language is n't a system which can be modeled by a Markov chain of length 1 .
Dissociated press works better because it only ever operates on small inputs , and always shuffles large - ish chunks .
Burroughs ' cut-ups work better because they work on large - ish chunks , and there are spatial relations that come into play -- even if you shuffle all segments of all pages , some words on the same segment are still similar distances apart , even if new words have been interspersed .
But I really like the idea of breaking the original text down into probabilities and then generating from that , rather than taking the original text and shuffling it .
The shuffling approach feels like it preserves too much of the original content , whereas all I want to preserve is the original grammar .
Maybe that 's not possible ( practical ) .
I do n't want to have huge lists of nouns / verbs .
I do n't want to encode knowledge of the language into it .
That way lies intellectually corrupt AI projects which I 'll not taunt by naming here .
One possibility would be to keep only the most popular 3 - way and higher combinations around ; for the more common ones , I could hold a pointer to a sub-table , instead of a flat probability .
Their popularity could be found using a quadtree - style subdivision of the word space ( to find the words that ``clump ' ' together . )
The problem with this is , it does n't work in a streaming fashion ; you basically have to have the whole N - way graph around before you can throw away the less - popular combinations , because you wo n't know which ones are popular until the end .
Another good compression trick would be to quantize the values ; though the maximal numerator or denominator that we need to express the probabilities might be a 16 bit number ( or higher ) , we probably could make do with 8 bits ( or less ) of resolution : have an 8 - bit lookup table of approximate probabilities .
I suspect that the values in this table would end up being on a logarithmic scale ( since that 's how nature works . )

A year - long study from the Federal Government 's advisory group on drugs has found drug testing in schools would be a waste of money .
The report was commissioned by the Australian National Council on Drugs after debate in the community about compulsory drug testing in schools .
It found that any testing system would be ineffective and not always give the right results .
Report author Ann Roche says it would also have negative effects like creating mistrust and stigma .
" Level of use is actually quite low so you 're kind of looking for a needle in a haystack , therefore there 'll be more error , " she said .
" To falsely accuse a young person of illicit drug use is really problematic . "
The study found it would cost about $ 350 million to do a saliva test for every student in the country and it says that money could be better spent elsewhere .
New South Wales Education Minister John Della Bosca says he agrees with the report 's recommendations .
Mr Della Bosca says it would also be monumental waste of taxpayer funds .
" Fewer than 2 per cent of our suspensions and expulsions were resulting from drug use or drug selling in schools , " he said .
" If students are suspended for using or possessing drugs at school , part of their return to school program will involve anti-drug counselling .
This is a far more effective way of dealing with illicit drug use . "
When putting together a social media campaign , you should consider many different things before you actually submit your content .
You need to think about creating good social media accounts , quality content , and which social media site to submit to .
Finally you get to the point where you can submit your content and take a breather … but not for long .
The days of “ submit and forget ” are over .
After you submit your content is when the social media campaign really begins and you have , on average , only about 24 hours to help get your content to the popular page of the site you have submitted to .
Here are a few things you should do to help your submission through this very important part of your social media campaign .
Participate in the conversation
There is always more to your story .
It may be an opinion or comment that opens a line of debate or conversation , a comparison to another similar story , or more information about the same story you are telling .
Research and find additional information or articles related to your topic and use the comment system to add more value to the campaign you are pushing .
Remember that the only thing you should focus on during the 24 hour push is getting more votes .
If someone else leads with a comment or discussion , then embrace it .
Reach out to your network and ask friends to comment as well .
If someone comments positively on your submission , then vote on that comment to help it stand out .
If someone comments negatively on your submission , then vote that comment down and have your network do the same .
Some systems can sort comments based on their rating and also remove them if they get enough negative votes .
Ask your network for help
Reach out to people in your network and ask them to vote on your submissions .
Be wary not to overuse or abuse your friends , and be considerate in how you ask your friends for their support .
Try to rotate and only send requests to a few people each time so you do n’t become an annoyance .
Use the communities ’ networking features
Many sites have features that allow you to share your submission with friends and users of that community .
Use these systems responsibly and you can find some great support from the community .
Remember , your job is not finished just because you have submitted your content to a social community .
You need to remain involved and support your campaign .
Every vote matters and you need to do everything you can to get your submission the popular page .
Social Media campaigns can be long and tiring , but if you want the links , branding , and traffic that social media can bring , then you have to work for it .

True story .
By Tom Symonds
Transport correspondent , BBC News
The new low emission zone ( LEZ ) in London is a first for the UK
They are in fact for the new London low emission zone , said to be the biggest urban environmental control in the world .
To enter the new zone , lorries will have to meet the so - called European Category
Three standard for airborne pollutants and nitrogen oxides - most modern vehicles now meet this requirement , but those with vehicles which do not will have to pay £ 200 a day to enter central London .
The new restrictions and charges currently only cover 12 - tonne lorries with diesel engines , but buses and coaches weighing 3.5 tonnes will be included from July , and other vehicles from 2010 .
Only cars and motorcycles will be exempt , and London 's transport authority insists there are no plans to bring them into the scheme .
Cross checks
The key challenge for Transport for London is ensuring the restrictions are properly enforced .
This relies on automatic number plate reading cameras , either fixed or mobile , which record the presence of a lorry inside the zone .
The registration is checked against the main Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency ( DVLA ) database , which records the type of engine a vehicle has , and its emissions category .
Freight representatives also argue that this is a sledgehammer to crack a nut .
There are cross checks with other vehicle databases , and lorries which breach the emissions standard can be fined £ 1,000 .
The fine is being waived for the next month , as an " introductory offer " .
So will it work ?
The London congestion charge is enforced in the same way , and there is little evidence of widespread evasion .
The low emission zone affects far fewer motorists , most of whom are company drivers who are unlikely to try to get around the system .
But using number plates to enforce an environmental law could again increase the number that are illegally copied , or deliberately mis-registered .
Expensive business
The controversial aspect of this policy relates to the cost to businesses forced to comply with the new restrictions .
The Freight Transport Association ( FTA ) estimates 10,000 lorries may breach the minimum standard .
Some companies are fitting " pollution traps " to their exhausts ; others will replace old vehicles with newer ones .
Both are expensive options , and the FTA believes the haulage industry will spend £ 100 m adapting to the new system .
Freight representatives also argue that this is a sledgehammer to crack a nut .
It is hoped the zone will ease the smog and related health conditions
They say their members would be required to improve the pollution levels from lorries anyway under future EU laws , and introducing an expensive monitoring system is a waste of time .
The extension of the restrictions will hit other companies and organisations too .
The St John Ambulance service believes it could be facing a bill for £ 4 m if it has to replace its non-compliant mobile treatment centres .
It is also true that London 's air , though the worst in the country , is getting cleaner .
Vehicle manufacturers are developing better technologies , and the catalytic converter is now standard .
But the Mayor of London believes there are still 1,000 people a year at risk of premature death due to smog , particularly those with existing lung or heart conditions .
Ken Livingstone says seven out of 10 Londoners are worried about the air they breathe , and that this justifies the new system .
Despite its name , the low emission zone will do little to reduce carbon dioxide emissions , which cause climate change .
This is another example of London pursuing a radical city - wide system of charges to solve an urban problem .
Other cities around Britain are now watching closely .

People in Baghdad are not passive victims of violence , but seek desperately to avoid their fate .
In April 2004 , I was almost killed by Shia militiamen of the Mehdi Army at a checkpoint at Kufa in southern Iraq .
They said I was an American spy and were about to execute me and my driver , Bassim Abdul Rahman , when they decided at the last moment to check with their commander .
" I believe , " Bassim said afterwards , " that if Patrick had an American or an English passport [ instead of an Irish one ] they would have killed us all immediately . "
In the following years , I saw Bassim less and less .
He is a Sunni , aged about 40 , from west Baghdad .
After the battle for Baghdad between Shia and Sunni in 2006 , he could hardly work as a driver as three - quarters of the capital was controlled by the Shia .
There were few places where a Sunni could drive in safety outside a handful of enclaves .
What happened to Bassim was also to happen to millions of Iraqis who saw their lives ruined by successive calamities .
As their world collapsed around them they were forced to take desperate measures to survive , obtain a job and make enough money to feed and educate their families .

In the US and Europe , the main measure of whether the war in Iraq is " going well " or " going badly " is the casualty figures .
The number of American soldiers and Iraqi civilians being killed went down to 39 US soldiers and 599 Iraqi civilians in January .
The White House is promoting the idea that the United States is finally on the road to success , if not victory , in Iraq .
On the back of this renewed optimism about the war , Senator John McCain , the premier hawk among the Republican candidates for the presidency , has been able to revive his foundering campaign and is set to be his party 's nominee .
Despite the scepticism of many US journalists permanently stationed in Iraq , television and newspaper newsrooms in New York and Washington ( in London they are more sceptical ) have largely bought into the idea that " the surge " – the wider deployment of 30,000 extra US troops since February 2006 – has succeeded .
But any true assessment of the happiness or misery of Iraqis must use a less crude index than the number of dead and injured .
It must ask if people have been driven from their houses , and if they can return .
It must say whether they have a job and , if they do not , whether they stand a chance of getting one .
It has to explain why so few of the 3.2 million people who are refugees in Syria and Jordan , or inside Iraq , are coming back .
At the time we had our encounter with the Mehdi Army in Kufa , Bassim was living in a house in the mixed Sunni - Shia area of Jihad in south - west Baghdad .
He loved the house , which had a sitting room and two bedrooms , because he had built it himself in 2001 .
" I did n't complete it because I did n't have enough money , " he said .
" But we were so happy to have our own home . "
He was living there in the summer of 2006 with his wife Maha , 38 , and his children Sarah , 13 , Noor , eight , and Sama , three , when Shia militiamen took over Jihad .
The struggle for the capital had begun on 22 February when Sunni insurgents blew up a revered Shia shrine in Samarra .
Bassim fled to Syria with his family and , when he returned to Jihad three months later , he found pictures of Muqtada al - Sadr , the Shia nationalist cleric who heads the Mehdi Army , pasted to the gate of his house .
Neighbours told Bassim to get out as fast as he could before the Mehdi Army militiamen came back and killed him .
He drove with his family to his father - in - law 's house in the tough Sunni district of al - Khadra , where he and his wife and three children were to live in future in a single small room .
He did not dare go back to his old home , but he heard about it in the summer of 2007 from a friendly Shia neighbour who said it had been taken over by militiamen .
" They accused me , " says Bassim , " of being a high - rank officer in the former intelligence service and because of that they got a permit [ from al - Sadr 's office ] to take it over . "
Two Shia families moved in for a couple of months and , when they left , they took all his remaining belongings .
They left the house unlocked , and soon the wooden doors and other fittings were gone .
The permanent loss of his home , his only possession of any value apart from his car , was a terrible blow to Bassim and his wife .
" I have nothing else to lose aside from my house , " he wrote to me in a sad letter in the autumn of 2007 , " and because of what happened I had a heart attack .
I worked as a taxi driver for a few days , but I could n't do it any longer because of the dangerous situation and I had no other way of earning a living .
Finally , I sold my car and my wife 's few gold things and I will try to go to Sweden even if I have to go illegally . "

I thought his plan to travel to Sweden was a terrible one , as Bassim spoke only Arabic and had not travelled outside Iraq , apart from a few trips to Syria and Jordan .
But there was nothing I could do to dissuade him .
I did not see or hear from him for six months , though I heard from his friends that his bid to reach Sweden had failed and that he was stuck in Kuala Lumpur .
Then , on 1 February , he appeared at the door of my hotel room in Baghdad , looking shrunken and miserable , and told me of his strange and disastrous odyssey .
I had originally hoped that his plan to travel illegally to Sweden was a fantasy he would never try to realise , but everything he had said in his letter turned out to be true .
He had sold his car , his wife 's gold jewellery and some furniture for $ 6,500 ( about £ 3,300 ) and borrowed $ 1,500 from his sister and the same amount from friends .
Of this , $ 6,900 was paid to Abu Mohammed , an Iraqi in Sweden , who provided Bassim and a friend called Ibrahim with Lithuanian passports ( these turned out to be genuine , but one of Bassim 's many fears over the next three months was that his passport was a fake and he would be thrown in jail ) .
The two men went first to Damascus and then , instructed over the phone by Abu Mohammed in Sweden , they flew to Malaysia .
This would seem to be the wrong direction , but Malaysia has the great advantage of being one of the few countries to give Iraqis entry visas at the airport .
Bassim and Ibrahim took rooms at the cheapest hotel they could find in Kuala Lumpur .
They were then told by Abu Mohammed to get a plane to Cambodia and take a bus to Vietnam .
Though their money was fast dwindling , they did so .
Somehow , still speaking only Arabic , they made their way from Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City .
The plan was to get a ticket to Sweden by way of France ( Bassim now thinks that this was a mistake and it would have been better to travel first to Lithuania , posing as citizens returning home , but this would have left the two Iraqis with the problem of explaining to officials there why they did not speak Lithuanian ) .
In the check - in queue at the airport in Vietnam on 5 January this year , Bassim was desperately worried he would be detected .
He had staked all his remaining money and his family 's future on getting to Sweden .
In fact , he and Ibrahim had little chance of being allowed on to the plane .
Too many Iraqis , claiming to be citizens of small East European states , had tried this route before .
Suspicious Vietnamese immigration officials took them to an investigation room where Bassim felt ill and asked for a glass of water , which was refused .
He and Ibrahim continued to protest that they were Lithuanian citizens and demanded to be taken to the Lithuanian embassy , knowing full well that Lithuania is unrepresented in Vietnam .
It was all in vain .
The officials guessed that they were Iraqis .
They sent Bassim and Ibrahim back to Cambodia .
Half - starved because he did not like the local food – " I was used to Iraqi bread , " he recalled later – and with his money almost gone , Bassim made his way back to Kuala Lumpur by the end of January .
He last saw his friend Ibrahim heading for Indonesia in a small boat .
Abu Mohammed in Sweden became elusive and , when finally contacted by phone after six days , admitted that " for Iraqis , all the ways from Asia to Sweden are shut " .
He did not offer to return Bassim 's $ 6,900 .
Demoralised , and hearing that many Iraqi refugees trying to get to Europe through Indonesia simply disappeared , Bassim used his last few dollars to fly to Damascus and took a shared taxi across the desert to Baghdad .
" The journey took three months but it felt like 10 years , " he said .
" I have lost everything . "
Life in the Iraq to which Bassim has returned is said by foreigners and Iraqis alike to be getting better .
Perky pieces in the foreign media breathlessly describe how Sunni children are once again playing football in al - Zahra park near the Green Zone , where they would have been murdered a year ago .
" The problem , " complained one American correspondent in Baghdad , " is that newsrooms back home have two mindsets – ' War Rages ' and ' Peace Dawns ' – and not a lot in between . "
Previous claims of an improvement in security by the US or the Iraqi government had been wholly false .
I remembered Paul Bremer , the US viceroy during the first year of the occupation , claiming that the Sunni insurgents were a doomed remnant battling against " the new Iraq " .
When Bremer left in 2004 , he was shown on television clambering into one helicopter and then , when the cameras departed , scuttling on to a second aircraft in case those same insurgents might shoot him down .
In contrast to the spurious turning - points of the past , the most recent political changes in Iraq , which had led to the fall in American and Iraqi casualties , are quite real .
But they differ significantly from the way in which they are portrayed in the outside world , and have less to do with al - Qa'ida and the US than the continuing struggle for power between Sunni and Shia in Iraq .
From the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003 to the summer of 2006 , the five million - strong Sunni community had battled the US and the Shia - Kurdish Iraqi government .
Then , quite suddenly , last year many of the Sunni rebel groups switched sides and allied themselves with the Americans , formed the " al - Sahwa " or " Awakening " movement and declared war on al - Qa'ida .
Dramatic changes of side when enemies embrace each other are not unknown in Iraqi politics and may stem from its traditions of tribal warfare .
I was in Iraqi Kurdistan in 1996 when the Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani , many of whose family and tribe had been murdered by Saddam Hussein , called in Saddam 's tanks to capture the city of Arbil and to repulse an offensive by the rival Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani , now president of Iraq .
The US commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , and the US ambassador , Ryan Crocker , are cautious about claiming too much success .
But the White House and the Republicans have been quick to suggest that a turning point had been reached in the war .
As in 2003 , after the American overthrow of Saddam , both the Democrats and much of the American media could be easily intimidated by the fear that they were being unpatriotic or defeatist when military victory was in sight .
" The problem in Iraq is that the agenda is driven not by what is really happening , but by the perception in America of what is happening , " Ahmad Chalabi , veteran of the opposition to Saddam and one of the most astute observers of the Iraqi scene , told me .
A problem is that US politicians and commentators assume far greater American control of events in Iraq than is the case .
The US is the most powerful player there , but it is by no means the only one .
The dramatic change of sides of Sunni guerrilla organisations such as the " 1920 Revolution Brigades " and the " Islamic Army " came about for many reasons .
In Anbar province west of Baghdad ( perhaps one - third of Iraq by area ) , the Sunni tribes had become enraged by al - Qa'ida 's attempt to establish total dominance , and to replace or murder traditional leaders and set up a Taliban - type state .
But the Sunni community could also see that , although its guerrilla war was effective against the US , it was being defeated by the Shia who controlled the Iraqi government and armed forces after the elections of 2005 .
The only source of money in Iraq is oil revenues , and the only jobs – four million , if those on a pension are included – are with the government .
The Shia , in alliance with the Kurds , controlled both .
" The Sunni people found that the only way to be protected from the Shia was to be allied to the Americans , " said Kassim Ahmed Salman , a well - educated Sunni from west Baghdad .
" Otherwise we were in a hopeless situation .
For the last two years it has been possible for Sunni to be killed legally [ by death squads covertly supported by the government ] in Baghdad . "
The " surge " – the 30,000 extra US troops implementing a new security plan in Baghdad – has helped to make Baghdad safer .
In effect , they have frozen into place the Shia victory of 2006 .
The city is broken up into enclaves sealed off by concrete walls with only one entrance and exit .
Areas that were once mixed are not being reoccupied by whichever community was driven out .
Bassim can no more reclaim , or even visit , his house in the Jihad district of Baghdad than he could a year ago .
He can still work as a taxi driver only in Sunni areas .
The US military and the Iraqi government are wary of even trying to reverse sectarian cleansing because this might break the present fragile truce .
" People say things are better than they were , " says Zanab Jafar , a well - educated Shia woman living in al - Hamraa , west Baghdad , " but what they mean is that they are better than [ during ] the bloodbath of 2006 .
The situation is still terrible . "
Baghdad still feels and looks like a city at war .
There are checkpoints everywhere .
" You seldom see young girls walking in the streets , or in restaurants , " adds Zanab Jafar , " because their families are terrified they will be kidnapped , so they send private cars to pick them up directly from school . "
New shops open , but they are always in the heart of districts controlled by a single community because nobody wants to venture far from their home to shop .
For all the talk of Baghdad being safer , it remains an extraordinarily dangerous place .
One Western security company is still asking $ 3,000 to pick a man up at the airport and drive him six miles to his hotel in central Baghdad .
The number of dead bodies being picked up by the police every morning in the capital is down to three or four when once it was 50 or 60 .
" People are being killed in the back streets and alleyways but not in the main roads as they were 12 months ago , " says one Shia leader with a network of contacts throughout Baghdad .
" About twice as many people are being killed as the government admits . "
This figure is still well below what it was 18 months ago , and is unlikely to return to its previous level as long as al - Qa'ida does not resume its suicide bombing campaign , using trucks loaded with a ton of explosives detonated in the middle of Shia markets or religious processions , killing and wounding hundreds .
If the attacks on the two bird markets in Shia areas on 1 February , killing 99 people , are repeated , then Shia death squads will start a fresh cycle of tit - for - tat killings of Sunni .
The new element in Iraq is the development of the Awakening Council , or al - Sahwa , movement .
Suddenly there is a Sunni militia , paid by the US , that has 80,000 men under arms .
This re-empowers the Sunni community far more than any legislation passed by the Iraqi parliament .
But it also deepens the divisions in Iraq because the leaders of the Awakening do not bother to hide their hatred and contempt for the Iraqi government .
At the end of January , I visited Abu Marouf , one of the leaders of the Awakening , in his headquarters near Khan Dari , halfway between Abu Ghraib and Fallujah .
Asked about his attitude to the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , Abu Marouf , until recently a commander of the 1920 Revolution Brigades , said : " Maliki has got 13 divisions [ in the army ] most of whom are Shia , and half are from militias controlled by Iran . "
In his State of the Union address , President Bush spoke of the 80,000 Awakening Council members – also labelled " concerned local citizens " , as if they were respectable householders who have taken up arms against " terrorists " .
The picture Bush evoked is similar to that often seen in Hollywood Westerns when outraged townsfolk and farmers , driven beyond endurance by the crimes of a corrupt sheriff or saloon owner and their bandit followers , rise in revolt .
In reality , in Iraq the exact opposite has happened .
The Awakening Council members of today are the " terrorists " of yesterday .
Even the police chief of Fallujah , Colonel Feisal , the brother of Abu Marouf , cheerfully explained that until he was promoted to his present post in December 2006 he was " fighting the Americans " .
Abu Marouf is threatening to go back to war or let al - Qa'ida return unless his 13,000 men receive long - term jobs in the Iraqi security services .
The Iraqi government has no intention of allowing this because to do so would be to allow the Sunni and partisans of Saddam Hussein 's regime to once again hold real power in the state .
Bizarrely , the US is still holding hundreds of men suspected of contacts with al - Qa'ida in Afghanistan and elsewhere , while in Iraq many of the Awakening members are past and , in many cases , probably current members of al - Qa'ida being paid by the US Army .
" I knew a young man , aged 17 or 18 , " says Kassim Ahmed Salman , " who was a friend of my brother and used to carry a PKC [ a Russian light machine - gun ] and fight for al - Qa'ida .
I was astonished to see him a few days ago in al - Khadra where he is a lieutenant in al - Sahwa , standing together with Iraqi army officers . "
The present state of Iraq is highly unstable , but nobody quite wants to go to war again .
It reminds me of lulls in the Lebanese civil war during the 1970s and 1980s , when everybody in Beirut rightly predicted that nothing was solved and the fighting would start again .
In Iraq the fighting has never stopped , but the present equilibrium might go on for some time .
All the Iraqi players are waiting to see at what rate the US will draw down its troop levels .
The Mehdi Army is discussing ending its six - month ceasefire , but does not want to fight its Shia rivals if they are supported by American military power .
Al - Qa'ida is wounded but by no means out of business .
Four days after I had seen Abu Marouf , who was surrounded by bodyguards and maintains extreme secrecy about his movements , al - Qa'ida was able to detonate a bomb in a car close to his house and injure four of his guards .
Protestations of amity between Shia security men and Awakening members should be treated with scepticism .
My friend , the intrepid French television reporter Lucas Menget , filmed a Shia policeman showering praise on the Awakening movement .
He introduced two of its members , declaring enthusiastically to the camera : " You see , together we will defeat al - Qa'ida . "
Back in his police car , the policeman , lighting up a Davidoff cigarette and shaking his head wearily , explained : " I do n't have a choice .
I was asked to work with these killers . "
Iraq remains a great sump of human degradation and poverty , unaffected by the " surge " .
It was not a government critic but the civilian spokesman for the Baghdad security plan , Tahseen Sheikhly , who pointed out this week that the city is drowning in sewage because of blocked and broken pipes and drains .
In one part of the city , the sewage has formed a lake so large that it can be seen " as a big black spot on Google Earth " .
In the coming weeks , we will see the fifth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq by American and British forces on 19 March , and the fall of Saddam Hussein on 9 April .
There will be much rancorous debate in the Western media about the success or failure of the " surge " and the US war effort here .
But for millions of Iraqis like Bassim , the war has robbed them of their homes , their jobs and often their lives .
It has brought them nothing but misery and ended their hopes of happiness .
It has destroyed Iraq .

SO !
I am offering you all a piece of history .
This rug was made from 3 of my ex's most prized shirts , including an old school Beastie Boys shirt he got at a concert years ago .
It really is something , and I spent a lot of time making it , so I do n't want it to go to waste .
What do I want in return ?
Well , I 'm pretty broke .
Our breakup left me essentially pennyless , but whatever .
I 'm willing to accept anything in return ( extra points if YOU have a tshirt rug made from your evil ex's shirt that you would like to trade ) .
Here 's the catch though ... you have to promise to abuse this rug .
I mean straight up abuse it .
Make it a front door mat so everyone can wipe their feet on it .
Put it under your cat 's litter box .
Hang it on the wall and throw offensive things at it ... I do n't care .
But if you could send me a photo of the rug once you 've had your filthy way with it , I would be much obliged : DThis is a small photo of the rug in question .
It is quite large , and if you want , I have a couple more shirts of his that I would gladly attatch to this rug , making it much larger .
If you would like a better photo , please just ask , and I will send one your way .
But please , serious offers only .
This is a work of art , and I am quite proud of it .
If you have any questions , please feel free to ask .
151 Congressmen Derive Financial Profit From War Blood money stains the hands of more than 25 % of members of the U.S. House and Senate By Ralph Forbes Who profits from the Iraq war ?
More than a quarter of senators and congressmen have invested at least $ 196 million of their own money in companies doing business with the Department of Defense ( DoD ) that profit from the death and destruction in Iraq .
According to the latest reports , 151 members of Congress invested close to a quarter - billion in companies that received defense contracts of at least $ 5 million in 2006 .
These companies got more than $ 275.6 billion from the government in 2006 , or $ 755 million per day , according to FedSpending.org , a website of the watchdog group OMBWatch .
Congressmen gave themselves a loophole so they only have to report their assets in broad ranges .
Thus , they can be off as much as 160 percent .
( Try giving the IRS an estimate like that . )
In 2004 , the first full year after the present Iraq war began , Republican and Democratic lawmakers — both hawks and doves — invested between $ 74.9 million and $ 161.3 million in companies under contract with the DoD .
In 2006 Democrats had at least $ 3.7 million invested in the defense sector alone , compared to the Republicans ’ “ only ” $ 577,500 .
As the war raged on , so did the billions of profits — and personal investments by Congress members in war contractors , which increased 5 percent from 2004 to 2006 .
Investments in these contractors yielded Congress members between $ 15.8 million and $ 62 million in personal income from 2004 through 2006 , through dividends , capital gains , royalties and interest .
Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and Rep. James Sensenbrenner ( R - Wis. ) , who are two of Congress ’s wealthiest members , were among the lawmakers who garnered the most income from war contractors between 2004 and 2006 : Sensenbrenner got at least $ 3.2 million and Kerry reaped at least $ 2.6 million .
Members of
War hawk Sen. Joe Lieberman ( IConn . ) , chairman of the defense - related
Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , had at least $ 51,000 invested in these companies in 2006 .
Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) , who voted for Bush ’s war , had stock in defense companies , such as Honeywell , Boeing and Raytheon , but sold the stock in May 2007 .
Of the 151 members whose investments are tied to the “ defense ” ( war )
industry , as far as we know , not one of them offered to donate their bloodstained profits to the national treasury to offset the terrible debt they have imposed .
Has one of them even offered to donate one cent of their war profits to lessen the debt that increases more than $ 1 million a minute ?
When our boys and girls are wounded the government bills them to return their reenlistment bonus .
They have to return any pay they received while they were hospitalized .
They have to pay for their helmets and uniforms that are destroyed in the hell of war .
But they keep on fighting for these politicians ’ right to keep their war profits .
 Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) $ 3,001,006 to $ 5,015,001
 Sen. Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) $ 250,001 to $ 500,000
 Rep. Kenny Ewell Marchant ( R - Tex . ) $ 162,074 to $ 162,074
 Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney ( D - N.Y. ) $ 115,002 to $ 300,000
 Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen ( R - N.J. ) $ 115,002 to $ 300,000
 Rep. Shelley Berkley ( D - Nev. ) $ 100,870 to $ 100,870
 Rep. James Sensenbrenner Jr. ( R - Wis. ) $ 65,646 to $ 65,646
 Sen. Jeff Bingaman ( D - N.M. ) $ 50,008 to $ 227,000
 Rep. Sam Farr ( D - Calif . ) $ 50,001 to $ 100,000
 Rep. Stephen Ira Cohen ( D - Tenn . ) $ 45,003 to $ 150,000 Contact freelance writer Ralph Forbes at [ email protected ] .

Danica Patrick Indy Racer is HOT Under the Collar ( Photos )
is hopping mad and there is n't anything she can do about it .
The Indy racer is highly critical of a new ruling that she feels will penalize her for being 5 ft. 2 in. tall and 100 pounds soaking wet .
The 26 year old will have to add weight to her race car to compensate for her lighter size .
The new rule is being set to equalize the playing field .
Those who are heavy set may be able to remove some weight from their vehicles .
Patrick is only one of two females who race on this particular circuit .
She has not yet had a victory in her four seasons .
With the potential change to her vehicle , she envisions that it will be just that much more challenging .
The 2008 season will kickoff March 29 , under the lights at Homestead - Miami Speedway ( 8 p.m. ET , ESPN2 ) .
The race will be the first since open - wheel racing unified on Feb. 22 , moving forward under the banner of the IndyCar Series and the sanctioning of the Indy Racing League .
Patrick is one of 26 cars are entered in the event , making it the first race since 2001 that the season will start with that many cars on the track .
It also is the first time since 2003 that a race other than the Indianapolis 500 has featured that many starters .
She 's also got a lead foot off the track .
We 've got photos of Danica after the jump .

This article from The Wall Street Journal outlines how the NSA is increasingly engaging in domestic surveillance , data collection , and data mining .
The result is essentially the same as Total Information Awareness .
According to current and former intelligence officials , the spy agency now monitors huge volumes of records of domestic emails and Internet searches as well as bank transfers , credit - card transactions , travel and telephone records .
The NSA receives this so - called “ transactional ” data from other agencies or private companies , and its sophisticated software programs analyze the various transactions for suspicious patterns .
Then they spit out leads to be explored by counterterrorism programs across the U.S. government , such as the NSA ’s own Terrorist Surveillance Program , formed to intercept phone calls and emails between the U.S. and overseas without a judge ’s approval when a link to al Qaeda is suspected .
[…]
Two former officials familiar with the data - sifting efforts said they work by starting with some sort of lead , like a phone number or Internet address .
In partnership with the FBI , the systems then can track all domestic and foreign transactions of people associated with that item — and then the people who associated with them , and so on , casting a gradually wider net .
An intelligence official described more of a rapid - response effect :
If a person suspected of terrorist connections is believed to be in a U.S. city — for instance , Detroit , a community with a high concentration of Muslim Americans — the government ’s spy systems may be directed to collect and analyze all electronic communications into and out of the city .
The haul can include records of phone calls , email headers and destinations , data on financial transactions and records of Internet browsing .
The system also would collect information about other people , including those in the U.S. , who communicated with people in Detroit .
The information does n’t generally include the contents of conversations or emails .
But it can give such transactional information as a cellphone ’s location , whom a person is calling , and what Web sites he or she is visiting .
For an email , the data haul can include the identities of the sender and recipient and the subject line , but not the content of the message .
Intelligence agencies have used administrative subpoenas issued by the FBI — which do n’t need a judge ’s signature — to collect and analyze such data , current and former intelligence officials said .
If that data provided “ reasonable suspicion ” that a person , whether foreign or from the U.S. , was linked to al Qaeda , intelligence officers could eavesdrop under the NSA ’s Terrorist Surveillance Program .
[…]
The NSA uses its own high - powered version of social - network analysis to search for possible new patterns and links to terrorism .
The Pentagon ’s experimental Total Information Awareness program , later renamed Terrorism Information Awareness , was an early research effort on the same concept , designed to bring together and analyze as much and as many varied kinds of data as possible .
Congress eliminated funding for the program in 2003 before it began operating .
But it permitted some of the research to continue and TIA technology to be used for foreign surveillance .
Some of it was shifted to the NSA — which also is funded by the Pentagon — and put in the so - called black budget , where it would receive less scrutiny and bolster other data - sifting efforts , current and former intelligence officials said .
“ When it got taken apart , it did n’t get thrown away , ” says a former top government official familiar with the TIA program .
Two current officials also said the NSA ’s current combination of programs now largely mirrors the former TIA project .
But the NSA offers less privacy protection .
TIA developers researched ways to limit the use of the system for broad searches of individuals ’ data , such as requiring intelligence officers to get leads from other sources first .
The NSA effort lacks those controls , as well as controls that it developed in the 1990s for an earlier data - sweeping attempt .

Print This Email This Prominent Freethinker warns of America's ' flight from reason ' Susan Jacoby , a prominent intellectual who worries about the growing disregard for reason in American political debates , says the dumbing down of political discourse is affecting how citizens choose their leaders and is letting candidates manipulate their audience .
" Without a base of knowledge of how things are you can't really have a reasonable talk about how things ought to be , " Jacoby recently told PBS 's Bill Moyers .
" In other words , you can say , ' Oh , we do n't want a [ healthcare ] program which will prevent people from choosing their own doctors . '
Well , are we able to choose our own doctors ?
I 'm not .
I have to choose within a managed care network . "
Jacoby says political culture should not be viewed separately from the culture at large .
Rather politics is an extension of everything else that is happening in the country .
She credited former President Franklin D. Roosevelt with convincing a reluctant country to enter World War II by trying to educate , rather than manipulate them .
" It 's been forgotten now in the mythology of World War II that even when the Nazis invaded Poland and attacked England , overwhelming majority of Americans were opposed to American involvement in the war , " she said .
" The reason they came around is not just Pearl Harbor .
Franklin D. Roosevelt spent several years trying to educate a resistant public about the stake that America had in the future of Europe .
The renewal of the draft in 1941 , six months before Pearl Harbor , in the summer of 1941 , passed by one vote .
Imagine what would have happened if the Army had been disbanded , if FDR had not made all those educational efforts , where we would have been six months later when Pearl Harbor was attacked . "
She accused Bill Clinton and George W. Bush of abandoning that educational spirit .
In the case of the current president , she said he capitalized on the country 's post - 9/11 desire for revenge to invade Iraq .
" To be non-partisan about it , Bill Clinton and George W. Bush are two of the biggest failures as teachers in chief of any presidents we 've ever had , " she said .
" Bush at foreign policy obviously .
It 's great to bring people along with you when everybody 's in favor of the war as they were in 2003 ' cause there was this desire to strike back at somebody , anyone , for 9/11 .
So Bush just said , ' Oh , yeah .
Saddam Hussein had something to do with 9/11 . '
And people believed it . "
The problem of American irrationality , she said , is compounded by right - wing thinkers who have pinned the label of " intellectual " purely on liberal ideas , allowing them to make their own fantasies seem rational .
" For example , when you will talk to right - wing intellectuals about the Iraq war -- it does n't matter that it has n't worked out to them .
They still think it was right .
And the evidence of how it got started , how it got started on false pretenses and so on , it does n't matter to them , " she said .
" They make wishful thinking sound rational .
It 's the same thing now when we 're hearing that the , quote , surge is working .
Well , the surge is working as long as we have those troops there .
But when anybody says to me in the right - wing intellectuals that the surge is working -- it 's working .
There are fewer people being killed in suicide bombings every day because we have a lot more young soldiers there in harm 's way than there were six months ago .
How many people were killed in suicide bombings in Baghdad before America entered the war ?
I believe the answer is none .
So what they 're doing is comparing , you know , apples and oranges .
The left -- on the other hand -- to be intellectual is not necessarily to be rational .
And there are many -- there are many anti-rational intellectuals . "

The preznit blush claims to spy on us to save us from " turrists " while his regime outs CIA agents who are really working to protect us , and as his regime sells nuclear secrets to " turrists " ?
What will happen if this and this get out ?
The NIST report concerning 9 - 11 is under appeal / review by well known architects and engineers as to its accuracy and factual well being .
NIST admits in writing that it cannot explain the government 's conspiracy theory as far as building 7 and towers one and two ( ibid ) .
Will Amurka ever turn back into America if Sibel 's story is too emotionally difficult to believe for many people ?
Even when it is already on the record that government officials and government agents have spied for foreign nations ?
And remember Feeney helping the Chinese spy who plead guilty in Florida ?
The one Clint Curtis disclosed ?
That bushies do the same is not at all difficult for me to believe , since they even wanted to sell our ports to mid-east nations who openly supported the Taliban .
Yep , the same nation that Halliburton moved its headquarters to .
Treason against America is alive and well in BIG BROTHER'S Amurka .

Let me pass this along :
My problem with this article is , that it is published in The Sunday Times , which is one of the worst war advocate and profiteer Murdoch 's propaganda papers .
' The Sunday Times ' and propaganda - media owner Rupert Murdoch , have for as long as is known cooperated with the CIA / Mossad , the UK's MI5 and MI6 and the rest of the spooks .
Murdoch 's papers write about the 9/11 massacre , but still - contrary to the truth - stick to the official US / UK version and brainwashing : Osama 's bin Laden 's ragheads did it .
Nothing in those pro-war papers gets published - and certainly not this kind of ' information ' in those outlets - that is n't aimed at certain groups .
If you check the source , you 'll see that Murdoch is a disinformation pest for mankind .
So , I 'm inclined to say that @S .
Balu is quite correct , in seeing the item as ' CIA / Mossad propaganda ' .
In reality it was as Tony S. writes : " The CIA pressed Dutch govt .
not to interfear , ( this must be a Freudian slip ... - HR ) claiming they were after more suspects surrounding Khan .
That 's how he got away with the stolen nuclear secrets .
This was publicly stated by Ruud Lubbers , former Dutch Prime Minister a couple of years ago . "
And Lubbers - who also was the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) - stated clearly that the CIA and its managers are guilty of nuclear proliferation .
- Url. : http://tinyurl.com/38pj2a
Now : we know that Sibel Edmunds has a unique ' gag order ' as ' The Sunday Times ' in this article describes .
And that this ' gag order ' is global and until further notice by the US / UK junta 's henchmen : " The US attorney - general has imposed a state secrets privilege order on her , which prevents her revealing more details of the FBI ’s methods and current investigations . "
So it 's logical to ask why Sibel Edmunds now is published worldwide , and - the gag order does n't count here - is allowed to be quoted by Murdoch 's paper and read by everybody ?
Why , who and on what level was ' permission ' given for this in the US and decided to publish this about the nuke proliferation ?
Concerning Sibel Edmunds , the use which is made of her and to what she now is said to have heard and seen : '' Her story shows just how much the West was infiltrated by foreign states seeking nuclear secrets .
It illustrates how western government officials turned a blind eye to , or were even helping , countries such as Pakistan acquire bomb technology .
The wider nuclear network has been monitored for many years by a joint Anglo - American intelligence effort .
But rather than shut it down , investigations by law enforcement bodies such as the FBI and Britain ’s Revenue & Customs have been aborted to preserve diplomatic relations . '' [ end excerpt ]
According to this not to be trusted article : " Khan was close to Ahmad and the ISI .
While running Pakistan ’s nuclear programme , he became a millionaire by selling atomic secrets to Libya , Iran and North Korea . "
Meaning : whom can we blame for the next - probably nuclear - ' false flag ' operation ?
Those " infiltrated foreign states seeking nuclear secrets " ?
We all know that the Pakistani ' spooky thugs ' from ISI , are the ' little brothers ' of the CIA / Mossad , trained and many times paid by them , and get most of their orders from them .
There are small rogue groups too , and those are not only dangerous but can be used to set up ' black ops ' .
So the one to blame - like the stop of the Dakar rally - http://tinyurl.com/3e3pvn - is again the fictitious 'al Qaeda ' and the dead Osama bin Laden , just referring to the timeline here : " 2001 - Weeks before 9/11 , Khan ’s aides meet Osama Bin Laden to discuss an Al - Qaeda nuclear device . "
The drumbeat in the major media now will be : and the rogue states got 'm !

While we are all very glad to hear this info finally getting out , I wonder how much of it was gained by the illegal wiretapping going on , even before 9/11 .
This may end up being used as justification for illegal surveillance .

I have a couple of questions that perhaps could be passed on to Sibel :
Is her story the key to understanding the real motives for White House action against Valerie Plame and Joseph Wilson ?
Does the Plame - Wilson story hold the key to understanding why there was no follow - through on the investigation of Sibel 's story , despite demonstrable evidence and motivation for moving on it by elements within the government ?
Think about it for a second : Valerie Plame ran an undercover operation that tracked movement of Nuclear technology and materials around the world , with a main focus of interest , presence , and activity centered in Turkey .
What if interested parties high in the administration caught wind of an active investigation coming close to the core of these activities , so they outed her in order to shut off the investigation ?
The act of outing her was high - risk .
WAY too high risk to be explained by simple political revenge ...
But preventing the wholesale incarceration of your power structure could certainly inspire such a risky undertaking .
Something to consider ...

Sibel is a 9 - 11 conspiracy afficionado , but she does not buy the official government conspiracy theory :
Alex Jones :
You would n't be surprised if elements or criminal elements or private contractors were involved in 9/11 ?
Sibel Edmonds :
No , I would n't be surprised .
Alex Jones :
So you would n't be surprised like many others , because of the evidence and the cover - up you 've seen , if 9/11 was an inside job ?
Sibel Edmonds :
At this point , I 'd have to say no , I would n't be surprised .
( Sibel Interview ) .
Some of the information she has includes real 9 - 11 facts but of course many folk are afraid to consider that aspect of Amurka .
The truth about Amurka replacing America is too scary for some to believe and the presstitutes are and have been on a propaganda campaign to cover it all up .
Standard fare for the MSM .

Even if Al Gore had prevailed to become President in 2000 , perhaps he would have soon met with an untimely death .
Remember , Neo-con - friendly Joe Lieberman was his VP .
Was that Gore 's choice or some other heavyweight funder of the Democratic Party ?
This is all highly speculative , but I have wondered if Lieberman was not a Bush - Cheney / Neo-con camp infiltrator of the Democratic Party that would have prevailed whatever happened in the 2000 election .

This article is very interesting .
But if you go deeper , Check out the following link .
It suggest that the USA had two different agencies , one trying to stop Pakistan from getting arms and the other trying to help it .
Makes you think this is part of the USA 's goal to destabilize South Asia by helping Pakistan in a method to slow India 's growth .

- Floridiot I would certainly consider it , but I believe the opposite .
There 's plenty of evidence right from the mainstream news of all the bombs going off in and under the towers .
The only reason to deny it is to make LIHOP plausible , which it 's not .
Silverstein had to get rid of his asbestos nightmare and probably wanted to do some insurance scam for years .
Then on 911 Cheney 's actions were HIGHLY suspicious meanwhile some equally suspicious Isrealis danced while documenting the event and the rest is history .

Thank you for your strength and conviction Ms. Edmunds because your patriotism is an inspiration to all world people trying to save our planet .
Truth will lead to the removal and life imprisonment of the treasonous lying bush / cheney administration .
OUR current U.S. political system that favors the reign of influence by the 1 % er corporatists MUST END .
These skull and bonesmen and their propaganda machine are the biggest corrupt terrorists that WE THE PEOPLE have to deal with or face the consequences .
We can stop them from doing any more damage to our world by fostering a truth movement like at B blog .
The total damage done to our country and world is still on going because the U.S. Justice system is so corrupted that they STILL REMAIN IN POWER .
Alberto Gonzalez , bush 's previous choice for Attorney General pushed through congress on the same day when the 2004 presidential rigged electors of New Mexico , Nevada , Ohio , and Florida could n't " recall " virtually anything under oath that happened under his tenure before stepping down .
Would you really expect this despicable lawyer from bush 's camp given command of the U.S. Justice Department to investigate the bush / cheney crime family ?
Is anyone really that stupid to believe that criminals are gonna implicate themselves ?
Not in this life .
But you could make these bastards step down like Nixon and that 's a start .
How disgustingly obvious your control in the U.S. mass media by putting putin , gw bush , and hitler back in the day on the cover of TIME magazine .
Describing them favorably as modern man of the year as opposed to the corrupt power hungry good for nuthin murderous leaders that they are .
Abolish U.S. politicians from accepting multi-national corporate contributions AND you take away their influencial power .. power that reverts back to WE THE PEOPLE .

And I wonder how many of these folks show up in the PMA , Deborah Jeane Palfrey , Pamela Martin & Associates , phone records ?
I know that the first PMA phone record I looked at had a number that linked back to a non-junior person .
But with a 10 year old phone number a number of folks can have had it .

Praise God , if he exists , this story is spreading on the Internet today .
I 've linked it to a couple of blogs , and it is on Raw Story as well as here and getting discussion on a C & L. thread on McGovern 's call for impeachment .
The crack has appeared in the dam I hope .
If true , this story is treason plain and simple like Robert Hanson's .
Just when you believe you can't read anything more corrupt and criminal about the Bush administration , something else always turns up .
Anyway , thanks BradBlog .

The last thing one wants to do is make a decision .
The first , second , and third things a person wants to do is investigate to get the facts .
All Sibel has said is that she does not believe the official government story printed in the 9 - 11 Commission Report .
She does not offer to tell the truth ( i.e. make conclusions ) about it before the investigating is over .
She has reason to believe strange things were and are going on but can't tell all .
Hundreds , thousands , and now millions of people are of her opinion .
Architects and engineers , commercial airline pilots , and a host of other professionals question as Sibel does .
Neither Sibel nor those folks are spooks .
And all they want is a proper , professional , investigation .
One past director of NIST , at the world conference on fire safety , said this :
" I wish that there would be a peer review of this , " he said , referring to the NIST investigation .
" I think all the records that NIST has assembled should be archived .
I would really like to see someone else take a look at what they 've done ; both structurally and from a fire point of view . "
" I think the official conclusion that NIST arrived at is questionable , " explained Dr. Quintiere .
" Let 's look at real alternatives that might have been the cause of the collapse of the World Trade Towers and how that relates to the official cause and what 's the significance of one cause versus another . "
( AE911 and OpEdNews ) .
It is n't kooky to want it done right .
Then we will know if spooks did anything or not .
And we will know the facts in a more scientific and professional manner .
" You 're doin ' a heckuva job 9 - 11 Commission " does n't cut it anymore .

Dredd , I only see one problem with asking for a proper investigation , has there ever been one in the past ?... none that I can think of , especially the more pungent crimes and when it's the investigators / Government trying to cover up their own mess .
The insurance company paid up on the towers .
I would rank ( pun intended ) this one up with the worst by far .
We are only left to speculate .

Great work Brad & crew , And thank you Sibel Edmonds !
This really has gone viral on the net ... at least on the blogs and the alternative news sites .
Nothing in the corporate press as of yet .
I wo n't be holding my breath .
I see Colleen Rowley at protest events around the Twin Cities now and then .
It would be very interesting to have a chat with her about this .
Ray McGovern , Larry Johnson and Valerie Plame would be excellent sources to tap into as well .
I wish I could get directly in contact with them .
I am sure you can Brad !
Let 's hear their perspective .
It is so tough to figure out how to fight this bloodless ( on the surface ) coup through which we are losing our nation as it has been happening on so many fronts , but pushing for the truth to be revealed and sharing it as thoroughly as possible is a huge part of the remedy .
Let 's just hope these revelations do n't push these thugs into the corner .
They are far too evil without being desperate .
One thing that is being underplayed in all of this is how many of the people ' named ' by the combination of the Times article , the picture page on Edmonds ' website and lists put out by Larisa Alexandrovna among others is how many have dual American and Israeli citizenship .
The truth needs to come out and if it has to happen under a barrage of charges of anti-semitism , then so be it .
These treasonous thugs need to be prosecuted - no matter what nation (s ) they pretend to call home .
January 19th , 2009 is not too late for impeachment .

Floridiot # 24 Bro , you asked : " ... has there ever been one in the past ? " .
Well , lets recap .
The spirit of this thread is one of hope .
The british newspaper has printed a bombshell that has generated hope .
Hope for a truthful and complete investigation of the things Sibel wants to tell , but the preznit blush regime has ordered her not to tell .
So it seems that some women in the world , like Sibel and Bhutto , are standing up to power and demanding the truth and demanding it now .
Chickenshit men in the MSM do not seem to have the courage to do that , so lets give these American and other freedom loving women their " day in court " .
Let 's hope there is still the ability to do a proper investigation , and that Amurka has not utterly blinded over America .
Let 's get behind this flicker of hope ... but without becoming intoxicated with hope , and as you intended to say , mixing some sober doubt in as well .
Onward !!!

Sibel publicly stated that she had a huge story and she would speak to anyone in the MSM who would print it .
That she had to leave the US and cross the ocean to find a paper that would print it , tells you all you need to know about our corrupted media .
Bush 's planned attack on Iran also seems to be going just swimmingly .
First we 'll have a couple of theats back and forth and then we get our new " Gulf of Tonkin " .

The mainstream media are n't about to touch this , they do n't have the courage .
As example , recall that Phil Donahue tried to have a 50/50 exchange between liberals and conservatives on his show .
He was told to have two conservatives for every liberal - which he did n't do .
There were complaints - not from his sponsors , but from other corporations .
Donahue 's network caved in .
This shows just how much the mainstream media cannot be trusted to be objective .
It 's the money that counts .

While I greatly respect Larissa 's reporting , she took a commenter on her site to task today for daring to mention the term " Zionist " to describe Dov Zakheim and other signatories to the PNAC .
http://www.atlargely.com...6206920#comment-96206920
This entire story cannot be understood unless and until yo put at its core , Mossad , and the Zionist ( neocon ) agenda to use 9/11 and all that has followed as the pretext to justify the creation of Eretz Israel .
Larissa claims to have insisted that people stop using the word " Zionist . "
Now as yourself why that would be , AND , if she insists that people not pursue that portion of the story , how much she can actually be relied upon to reveal the ENTIRE TRUTH .
Pay very close attention to all of the disinformation and roadblocks that have and will attempt to distance Israel / AIPAC 's role in all of these matters .
When you certain known Israeli apologists in the media writing stories designed specifically to hide Israel 's direct role in 9/11 and the Sibel Edmonds story ( all the same story ) , REVEAL THEIR TRAITOROUS BEHAVIOR .

Sept 14 , 2006 ' Every last piece ' destroyed Adam Candeub , now a law professor at Michigan State University , said senior managers at the agency ordered that " every last piece " of the report be destroyed .
" The whole project was just stopped - end of discussion , " he said .
Candeub was a lawyer in the FCC's Media Bureau at the time the report was written and communicated frequently with its authors , he said .

" You can't tell any more the difference between what 's propaganda and what 's news . "
FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein
15 August , 2006 http://www.cbsnews.com/s...ational/main1900602.shtm
On ABC's Nightline , Monday , August 14 , former hostage Jill Carroll recounted how the Iraqi insurgency was " like a family affair … what are you gonna do , arrest them all , kill them all ? "
At that moment over on C - SPAN , President Bush , in the State Department 's Treaty Room , was giving the answer : Yes .
In the very next segment on C - SPAN , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu each delivered their own declarations of war in the Knesset .
All three leaders , in the US and in Israel , pointed to Syria and Iran as the new front in the " war on terror . "
This during a " cease - fire . "
Did the FCC Report about MEDIA CONTROL reveal that the Zionists control the US Media ?
Is that why a report , funded with your tax dollars , was destroyed ?

The biggest problem with getting this out there ( as I see it ) is that sooo many people are involved .
If cornered , they 'd likely get away with simply saying : " this is just more nonsense from the crackpot ' conspiracy theorists ' --- only thing is that " it is real " , so real that it would be hard to convince our own countrymen that their own kind could be guilty of such treachery .
It would be portrayed akin to the Kennedy assasination conspiracy theorists or even to accounts of UFO witnesses .

A full investigation should trigger additional checks and balances prior to the 2008 election all the way down to how they cheated to get into office .
Election votes counted in secrecy by the same felons involved with the candidates who stole the U.S. election .
More than just lies and a breach of trust , these individuals who mask themselves as quote religeous caring neo-conservative republicans and democrats must be tried as the FASCIST 1 % er corporatist lying murderers that they are .
bush / cheney government have carelessly endanger our national / world security , used our military as pawns , bankrupted our nation and corrupted the FEDERAL RESERVE BANK economy that 's been in place adversely effecting most Americans .
They have directed the reverse of 100's environmental laws and policies in congress always favoring polluters .
Much more that just the possibility of future false flag war games like on 9/11 , these people must be immediately removed since they are presently afforded the full powers of their respective office in addition to additional powers they have taken in their tenure .
If necessary , a state militia must be assembled to enforce the removal and prosecution in a world court by a non-bush appointed judge .
In addition , jailing without parole must be the call of the day for the bush / cheney admininstration criminals and their accomplices .
Never again can we allow our government to be controlled by the bottom line of corporate interests .
Corporate interests , lobbies , and contributions must be forever eliminated from the US political system .
The on going part the corporate mass media played during the bush / cheney years must be reviewed .
Since multi-national corporations run the airwaves , propaganda posing as truth .
Killing , murder , and death dominates the news .
News reporting has gotten away from the truth to a slant to how it directly effects the interests of their owners ( corporate 1 %ers ) .
THIS MUST END .
Media must be allowed to be media ONLY .
Even the ownership of print , TV , and radio forms of media owned by 1 parent company as changed thanks to Ronald Reagan should be broken up to ensure inaccurate propaganda by stories are n't run .
Lastly , our Federal agencies must be clensed .
The Pentagon , CIA , FBI , all need new blood and all protocal changes must be reviewed and reverted in the best interests of our nation .
Dennis Kusinich for President .
He is a man of the people and not a corporate sellout .

Sadly Kucinich has zero chance because the corrupt MSM has done everything possible to make certain that he has no chance . " " necessary , a state militia must be assembled to enforce the removal and prosecution in a world court by a non-bush appointed judge .
In addition , jailing without parole must be the call of the day for the bush / cheney admininstration criminals and their accomplices " "
Even sadder is the fact that this is really the only viable option left because these criminal elements have complete control of every single avenue that is normally used to put scum such as this in prison .
They have total control of the Supreme Court , the entire Congress and the MSM is without any question covering up the crimes and refusing to investigate .
That leaves only one option .
The final sadness is that the American people will not rise up in the massive numbers needed to take this country back until its too late .
Our best chance is to take back the MSM first because until we have the MSM actually telling the truth instead of pure Reich wing propaganda then we will never have the absolute HATRED of ALL of Congress & these treasonous bastards that is NEEDED in order to get enough people off their damn asses to do something .
Human nature works on 2 extremes either Love or Hate is what makes a human being take action .
This is why even though approx .
50 % of this country knows that 2 elections were blatantly stolen , that the entire Bush administration has committed treason & countless crimes have told so many bald faced lies it would take decades to document them all , have destroyed the Bill of Rights , attacked this country in a false flag attack on 9/11 and on & on the list is endless .
The reason nothing is happening and 10s of Millions are not marching on Washington is because of lack of one or the other ( Love or Hate )
The majority of that 50 % of this country that knows what is going on yet still does nothing is because they do n't HATE this administration yet .
The majority of this country is just " indifferent " .
We need the MSM to come out and tell the damn truth , tell the FACTS about 9/11 , the FACTS about 2000 / 04 ' stolen elections , the FACTS about Iraq and all the lies told by this administration and do it non -stop until it freaking sinks in .
Then we will have the sheer unbridled absolute hatred that is needed for the human animal to put down his Big Mac and get off their collective fat asses and do something before its too late .
We have a system that is totally broken so no matter whom is elected ( if there even is an election ) in 08 ' it will make virtually no difference , the Democrats are so whipped & spineless that it makes me sick to look at them , the Rethuglicans are so corrupt & insane that nothing is going to change them .
We need a system overhaul , doing an oil change in an engine that just broke a crankshaft is n't going to fix anything .

The men , described as illegal immigrants from the Middle East , were arrested Tuesday afternoon in a white Chevy van near the Meadowlands based on a tip from witnesses who saw them " cheering " and " jumping up and down " in Liberty State Park after the attack , a source said .
Witnesses took the plate number and the FBI sent out an alert to area cops , reading : " Vehicle possibly related to New York terrorist attack . . .
Three individuals with van were seen celebrating after initial impact and subsequent explosion . "
Port Authority cops nabbed the three as they drove along Route 3 in East Rutherford in the van , which had the words " Urban Moving Systems " painted on it .
After grilling the men and searching the van in vain for explosives , the FBI turned the men over to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for deportation . ”
2 ) SECOND – Top Pentagon officials are accused of actively targeting weak human resources within sensitive war departments for Foreign intelligence agencies to TURN !
How many more ‘ dots ’ have to be presented here before this information hits the headlines in the American media ?
Murdoch paper or not – the American people need to see this information – forget ObamavsHillary ; or speed boats swarm US destroyers .

Comment # 60 :
Your love and hate motivation theory of the American human animal is a good way of explaining away a lot of the apathy of the US people .
Your opinion that nothing will get done until it is to late however is only speculation .
Another idea to get the word out is to get this story to as many college newspapers as possible .
Kids do not like to worry about politics for the most part although they are most emotional charged and harness the angst of youth .
On a whole , once they learn this story , it will be like the Vietnam draft .
Kids did n't want a draft to fight a 1 % er corporate war of lies for the men in Washington .
This anger trickled down to the America 's high school youth AND brought the end of the Vietnam War NOT some war mongering general 's revisionist history that the US was victorious .
Tapping into the full blow anger of America 's youth about these treasonous destructive criminals WILL END their reign of terror and help change the system .

So when are the neocons going to set of a gas bomb ( or nuke or biological bomb ) in a US city ( kill a million people ) , declare martial law , nuke Iran ( kill another million people ) , fill up the concentration camp all over the US with anybody who can read ( kill another million people ) , and sell each other stock options in Zyklon B .
Surely the neocons wo n't risk being found out - they will destroy the world first .

I concur with # 9 that the Valerie Plame outing was about stopping her effective work in anti-wmd proliferation and not political payback for hero husband Joseph Wilson 's statements .
I am frightened thinking that the Murdoch Times is planting a preview of an attack on the USA with nukes in the autumn of 2008 to consolidate support and emergency powers ushering in Rudolph Ghouliani to take over for Cheney - Bush2 .
Careful newswatchers recall the Al - Q'aida chatter reported through spring and summer 2001 of an air based terror attack .
\\ I finally understand the fecklessness of the Dems in taking on letting Sibel Edmonds speak --- there is blame to spread around in both parties , and a lot of juicy embarrassing dirt on every politician and functionary .
The results of which would be too unpredictable .

The most important story in American history next to that of the 9 - 11 inside job ignored by our mainstream media , Congress and the BushCo controlled DOJ .
Not even a mention for or against Sibel Edmonds in our controlled news media .
This is proof positive that not only is our media controlled by zionist interests , but so is our government .
Do you think Ron Paul knows who Sibel Edmonds is ?
He should !
This is about spying , secrets , and criminality all being censored .
This is about the treason and traitorship our zionist " friends " by false flag ops via tyranny .
No investigative journalism here in America today .
America is broken beyond repair and the only candidate out there that wants to try to fix it is being labeled a racist by the AIPAC smear group .
Who says they can't keep 9 - 11 a secret and cover it all up ?
Most of America still believes bin Laden and his rag tag team attacked us on 9 - 11 because our controlled media fails to perform investigative journalism and divulge the facts .
Unless Ron Paul gets in office , the internet will soon be controlled too .
We 'll be like Nazi Germany passing information from person to person .
Your papers please ?

I hope you 're getting everything from Edmonds that you can - I 'm surprised she 's still alive .
Remember Chinagate - Clinton Administration officials were in on this as well .
Someone 's seeing to the same crowd getting elected no matter what the people think or vote for : bush / clinton / clinton / bush / bush / clinton ?
When are we going to start hanging people for treason ?
We must get out from under the military industrial complex , the special interests and take the government back .
This is a set up for global war - global nuclear war , the demise of America and an overall nightmare just too horrible to contemplate .

Click to viewAnother classic science fiction franchise is getting the " reboot " treatment , but its biggest star could be even harder to recast than William Shatner 's Captain Kirk .
A new Bill And Ted movie finally got the green light — probably from the same people at MGM who thought that War Games sequel was a good idea — and it could show up in the next couple of years .
The biggest question : where are they going to find an actor who can bring the Keanu ?
Click through for details .
Advertisement
As in the original , Bill and Ted are high - school students who are in danger of flunking unless they create a " full presentation " on the subjects of all their classes .
They travel through time and meet the historical figures they 're supposed to have learned about , including Gandhi and Calamity Jane this time around .
The main differences are that the phone Bill and Ted use to travel through time is n't an old - school phone booth , but something " funkier . "
Their band is called the Atomic Gorillas instead of the Wyld Stallyns .
The script is supposedly full of " hip " pop culture references for today 's kids , like Bill and Ted worrying they 're going to miss The Dark Knight .
No clue whether there 's a George Carlin character this time around , or who might play him .
There are a lot fewer " Whoas . "
Advertisement
I was a lot more excited about a new Bill And Ted when I briefly thought it would feature Keanu and Alex back in their original roles , playing middle - aged stoners who have made a mess of their lives in spite of all Carlin 's predictions .
If we have to have a remake , maybe it can do something new and interesting with the concept — like instead of being the saviors of a future world , Bill and Ted are actually patsies , given a time machine by someone who wants to wreck history but does n't want his / her fingerprints all over it .
And then Bill and Ted have to undo all the damage they 've done .
That would be totally excellent .

XIENG KHOUANG , Laos ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Eight months pregnant , Peng Souvanthon stands in the windy , sun-drenched hills of Laos instructing other women as they remove unexploded bombs from a war that ended more than three decades ago .
Laotian women detect unexploded ordnances in Xieng Khouang province , north of Vientiane , April 4 , 2008 .
The sparsely - populated country which has bordered with China , Vietnam , Thailand and Cambodia is one of the most - heavily bombed countries in the world .
REUTERS / Nguyen Van Vinh
Peng , 25 , leads the first all - women team who risk their lives to clear cluster bombs , shells , bullets and other ordnance with the Mines Advisory Group , a British charity with similar operations in former war zones all over the world .
“ I expect to protect or save the lives of staff who deal with UXO ( unexploded ordnance ) and to help the community so they can farm more productively , ” Peng , dressed in all - green clothes and a wide - brimmed khaki hat , told Reuters Television in Nong Het in the northern province of Xieng Khouang .
Two team members using a hand - held detector found an old bomb , prompting Peng to get out a megaphone and a radio to alert nearby farmers to the danger as the site was marked .
The high - pitched message in Lao and Hmong languages pierced across the valley , where the gentle tinkling of cowbells is the most common sound .
The sparsely - populated country which has borders with China , Vietnam , Thailand and Cambodia is one of the most - heavily bombed countries in the world .
Thousands of bombing missions in the 1960s and early 70s U.S. war in Southeast Asia left 15 of its 18 provinces contaminated with unexploded ordnance , which still kills and maims people and hinders agricultural development .
“ Lao women contribute to the development of the country and want to be employed in the same jobs as men , ” said Willi Kubirske , technical field manager for MAG .
“ Once a female has been employed it elevates her status in the community .
They are doing a very important job by helping to clear the country of UXO . ”
The all - women team is funded by the Japan - ASEAN Integration Fund to clear existing farmland and land that will be used in future for new cultivation .
Metal scrapyards filled with ordnance fragments and bomb casings are commonplace .
Farmers use old shell casings to build fences for their livestock .
Women drivers are still rare in Laos , but MAG team driver Noimany Pialeuxay is just 19 and has been driving vehicles since she was 12 years old .
Noimany drives the 12 - member team to all of their assignments .
“ I am responsible for their lives , but I concentrate and do my job , my best job , ” she said .

Others World 's first wooden sports car unveiled + - 11:10 , February 21 , 2008
Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article A U.S. design company has created the world 's first wooden supercar , which would put both Porsche and Lamborghini in the shade with a staggering top speed of 240 mph , media reported Thursday .
A U.S. design company has created the world 's first wooden supercar " Splinter . " ( Xinhua Photo )
The 4.6 meter - long , two - seater " Splinter " car , made from maple , plywood and MDF , has a 4.6 liter V8 petrol engine and a six - speed gearbox .
It weighs 1,134 kilograms -- 240 kilograms less than the lightweight Porsche 911 GT3 .
Despite its power , it will achieve 20 mpg , according to its designer , Joe Harmon , 27 .
" Wood is a truly amazing material to work with , " Harmon said .
" It has a higher strength - to - weight ratio than aluminium or steel , and it possesses a versatility that makes many different types of construction techniques possible . "
The car is due to hit the road later this year .
The design company , Joe Harmon Design , has not yet decided on a price for the supercar .

" The car is due to hit the road later this year .
The design company , Joe Harmon Design , has not yet decided on a price for the supercar .
Ms. Duggin and others who have explored the arcane subject in depth say legal argument and basic fairness may indeed be on the side of Mr. McCain , a longtime member of Congress from Arizona .
But multiple experts and scholarly reviews say the issue has never been definitively resolved by either Congress or the Supreme Court .
Ms. Duggin favors a constitutional amendment to settle the matter .
Others have called on Congress to guarantee that Americans born outside the national boundaries can legitimately see themselves as potential contenders for the Oval Office .
“ They ought to have the same rights , ” said Don Nickles , a former Republican senator from Oklahoma who in 2004 introduced legislation that would have established that children born abroad to American citizens could harbor presidential ambitions without a legal cloud over their hopes .
“ There is some ambiguity because there has never been a court case on what ‘ natural - born citizen ’ means . ”
Mr. McCain ’s situation is different from those of the current governors of California and Michigan , Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jennifer M. Granholm , who were born in other countries and were first citizens of those nations , rendering them naturalized Americans ineligible under current interpretations .
The conflict that could conceivably ensnare Mr. McCain goes more to the interpretation of “ natural born ” when weighed against intent and decades of immigration law .
Mr. McCain is not the first person to find himself in these circumstances .
The last Arizona Republican to be a presidential nominee , Barry Goldwater , faced the issue .
He was born in the Arizona territory in 1909 , three years before it became a state .
But Goldwater did not win , and the view at the time was that since he was born in a continental territory that later became a state , he probably met the standard .
It also surfaced in the 1968 candidacy of George Romney , who was born in Mexico , but again was not tested .
The former Connecticut politician Lowell P. Weicker Jr. , born in Paris , sought a legal analysis when considering the presidency , an aide said , and was assured he was eligible .
Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. was once viewed as a potential successor to his father , but was seen by some as ineligible since he had been born on Campobello Island in Canada .
The 21st president , Chester A. Arthur , whose birthplace is Vermont , was rumored to have actually been born in Canada , prompting some to question his eligibility .
Quickly recognizing confusion over the evolving nature of citizenship , the First Congress in 1790 passed a measure that did define children of citizens “ born beyond the sea , or out of the limits of the United States to be natural born . ”
But that law is still seen as potentially unconstitutional and was overtaken by subsequent legislation that omitted the “ natural - born ” phrase .

レジーナクリニック熊本院が入っているビルの外観
全身脱毛はレジーナクリニック熊本院の医療脱毛で決まり！3つのポイントを解説
みなさまにご満足いただくため医療脱毛。レジーナクリニックが選ばれるには理由があります。もっとキレイになりたい。より美しくありたい……女性がこのように考えることは“アタリマエ”のこと。ですが、日々のお手入れが大変で時間がかかるというのも、またひとつの事実です。これから初めて脱毛する方、これまでサロンでの脱毛で失敗した方など、いろんな方がいらっしゃるかと思います。
レジーナクリニックが選ばれる理由を3つのポイントに分けて説明します。
POINT 01 厚生労働省が認めた日本初の脱毛器で施術
レジーナクリニックではアレキサンドライトレーザー脱毛機を使用しており、患者様の肌や毛質に合わせて施術をすることができます。
※日焼けしていたり、褐色に近い箇所の脱毛希望の方は、カウンセリングにてご相談ください。
POINT 02 最短8ヶ月で全身脱毛が完了
エステ脱毛では2〜3年かかる全身脱毛ですが、レジーナクリニックでは2ヶ月おきに施術ができるため、最短8ヶ月で全身脱毛が完了します。
※予約状況や毛周期によっては8ヶ月で全身脱毛が完了しない場合がございます。あらかじめ問診時にご確認くださいませ。
最 短８ヶ月で脱毛コース完了が可能な理由
イラストでは毛が伸びた状態ですが本来は剃毛しているため毛穴を見て毛の太さを判断して施術を行います。当院のスタッフは脱毛を専任で行ってきているので照射するべき毛穴を見つける判断や照射の強さ・速度の調整を素早く行えます。最短で2ヶ月おきに脱毛施術を行うことができるため、全5回コースの場合は最短8ヶ月で脱毛コースが完了します。
POINT 03 施術スピー ドUP！全身脱毛90分/回で完了！
2018年3月から、アレキサンドライトレーザー脱毛機の照射スポットを拡張したことにより、全身脱毛（顔・VIO除く）1回の施術時間が最短90分まで短縮され、施術予約が取りやすくなりました。また、患者様のカラダへの負担も軽くなるため、より通い続けやすくなりました。
※照射スポットは患者様からの指定ができませんのでご了承ください。

おすすめの全身脱毛＋のセットプラン☆
ほかにもワキだけや腕だけなど、多彩なプランがあります
レジーナクリニック熊本院の施術範囲

A birth - control pill for men is now a reality , according to an international consortium of physicians who revealed their formula for “ safe , effective and reversible ” hormonal contraception for males .
The preparation includes progestin , a key ingredient found in women ’s birth - control pills , and the male sex hormone testosterone .
Progestin , a synthetic version of a hormone produced in a woman ’s ovaries , helps suppress ovulation when used in an oral contraceptive .
It appears to function in an analogous fashion for men , suppressing “ both rate and extent ” of sperm production .
“ Reliable and timely contraception is a reasonable expectation for a wide range of couples of differing ethnicity , age and other characteristics , ” the researchers stated yesterday .
“ The rate of suppression is comparable to that achieved after vasectomy . ”
The team included 18 endocrinologists from the United States , Australia , Germany , China , Italy , the Netherlands and Switzerland , who based their conclusions on 30 studies conducted from 1990 to 2006 , including data from the World Health Organization .
Most studies charted the efficacy of such treatments and the effects on the health of men given hormonal birth - control treatments by mouth , injection or through a skin patch for at least three months .
Birth control remains a feminine affair for the most part .
In developed countries , 73 percent of contraception worldwide involved “ female methods , ” according to the United Nations ” Population Division , which surveyed women of reproductive age in 160 nations .
Condoms accounted for 13 percent and vasectomies 6 percent .
Some say men are ready for more participation , however .
“ Men are already using the only two contraceptives they have — condoms and vasectomy — in great numbers .
At least in the United States , the idea that men are n’t willing to participate is clearly out of date , ” said Elaine Lissner , director of the Male Contraception Information Project , a California - based nonprofit interested in nonhormonal methods .
“ We used to talk about men ‘ sharing the burden ’ of contraception .
But these days , many men talk about wanting ‘ control . ’
Men want to control their own destinies , ” Ms. Lissner said .
Potential solutions were showcased in the “ Future of Male Contraception ” conference in September , sponsored by the National Institutes of Health , the Department of Health and Human Services and the University of Washington .
Among the proposals from assorted researchers : testosterone gel combined with the female contraceptive DepoProvera , an “ Intra Vas Device ” which literally blocks sperm movement with plugs , and drug therapy that lowers a man ’s supply of vitamin A — and thus his fertility .
The researchers , however , did not predict when male birth - control pills will be available to the public — though Dr. David Handelsman , another researcher on the team , has estimated a wait of about three years .
They are clearly optimistic , though .
“ Considerable progress has been made , ” said Dr. Peter Liu , an endocrinologist with UCLA and the University of Sydney who directed the latest research , published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism .
However , the team might not be able to benefit from the muscle of drug manufacturers .
Lacking proof that male contraceptives could be profitable , major pharmaceutical companies remain “ mostly interested spectators , ” according to Dr. Handelsman .
“ The big dollars are really elsewhere , ” he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation .

MI5 traces al - Qaeda ' sleeper cell ' to British police
*** Junior MI5 agents risked careers by speaking to a newspaper when they discovered that members of an al - Qaeda cell they were trying to trace turned out to be working for the Metropolitan Police .
The officers , who were identified as contacts for al - Qaeda , are believed to be involved with the highly secretive and mysterious " Special Branch " which has special powers , is not subject to public scrutiny , and has links to senior officials within the security services including MI5 .
The police service has refused to discuss the matter and claims that the officers in question are " under surveillance " .
But this reassurance is hollow and questionable when the whistle - blowers are the very MI5 agents supposedly doing the surveillance .
***
Terrorist sleeper cell ' within Met '
Scotland Yard has refused to discuss allegations that a sleeper cell of al Qaida spies is being kept under secret service surveillance after infiltrating the Metropolitan Police .
According to the News of the World , in the past few weeks MI5 agents have identified four officers suspected of passing secrets from the force .
All four are allegedly Asians living in London and are feared to have links with Islamic extremists in Britain and worldwide terrorist organisations .
MI5 bosses reportedly fear the moles may have been planted to keep al Qaida informed of anti-terror raids , and may have already accessed sensitive information about ongoing operations .
Secret service agents are said to be monitoring the suspects , who work at different London police stations .
A Yard spokesman said : " All police officers and police staff , upon joining the Metropolitan Police Service and during their careers undergo a range of security checks .
" These are robust and vary accordingly to the type and sensitivity of the individual postings .
" We take matters of security very seriously and if any issues arise about individuals , they may be subject to further assessment .
" This could lead to restrictions being put in place relating to where an individual may work within the organisation or could lead to their dismissal . "

TEHRAN : Iran has hanged a man convicted of raping three boys when he was 13 despite retractions from his accusers and an order for a judicial review of his case , a Western rights group and an Iranian daily said on Thursday .
Makwan Mouloudzadeh , 20 , was put to death on Wednesday in a prison in the western province of Kermanshah , daily Etemad-e Melli said .
Clarisa Bencomo , a Middle East children 's rights researcher of U.S. - based Human Rights Watch , said it had information the family was later told to come and pick up the body .
" We did confirm that the execution took place , ; she told Reuters by phone from Cairo .
; We spoke to people who have seen the body . "
" We 're appalled .
Iran is the leading executor of children and juvenile defenders , " she said , referring to people under 18 at the time of the crime .
Iranian judiciary officials were not available for comment .
Other Iranian media did not carry reports of the execution .
Iran says it is prosecuting criminals under its Islamic sharia law and rejects criticism of its human rights record .
Human Rights
Watch had called on the Islamic Republic to prevent Mouloudzadeh 's execution , saying he was sentenced to death in May by a Kermanshah court even though it said all of his accusers had retracted their statements .
Etemad-e Melli , a reformist newspaper , said in November judiciary chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi -Shahroudi had ordered the execution be suspended because it was in this case against sharia law , without elaborating .
Bencomo said the required review did not take place .
Etemad-e Melli on Thursday quoted Mouloudzadeh 's lawyer Saeed Eghbali as saying that , contrary to Hashemi - Shahroudi 's preliminary opinion , ' the case was rapidly sent back to Kermanshah and the sentence carried out ' .
The daily said he was arrested last year near his family home and paraded around the town of Paveh on a donkey .
Human Rights
Watch this week said Iran was known to have executed two other juvenile offenders earlier this year .
' In imposing death sentences on people for crimes committed before the age of 18 , Iran flouts clear and specific human rights obligations ' , it said .
Fellow rights group Amnesty International said in September it had recorded a total of 210 executions so far in Iran this year , compared with 177 for all of 2006 , giving Iran one of the highest rates of execution in the world .
Murder , rape , adultery , armed robbery , apostasy and drug smuggling are all punishable by death under Iran 's sharia law , imposed after the 1979 Islamic revolution .
A woman walks past the waiting area of the XM Satellite Radio building after the U.S. Justice Department approved that Sirius Satellite Radio's $ 4.59 billion purchase of rival XM Satellite Radio would be given antitrust clearance in Washington in this March 25 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Larry Downing
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A senior Democratic senator urged U.S. communications regulators on Friday to block Sirius Satellite Radio's SIRI .
O purchase of rival XM Satellite Radio XMSR.O , saying the deal would lead to higher prices to customers .
Sen . Byron Dorgan , a high - ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee , wrote to the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission saying the agency should not follow the “ illogical ” decision of the Justice Department , which last month granted the deal antitrust approval .
“ This merger is contrary to the public interest .
I hope that the FCC will stand up for competition in the public interest and deny this merger , ” Dorgan , of North Dakota , said in the letter to FCC Chairman Kevin Martin .
The merger would bring entertainers such as Oprah Winfrey and shock - jock Howard Stern under the same banner .
It has been criticized as anti-competitive by the traditional radio industry , and by some U.S. lawmakers including Dorgan .
However , antitrust authorities at the Justice Department approved the combination after concluding it would not harm consumers .
The department said satellite radio companies face stiff competition from traditional AM / FM radio , high - definition radio , MP3 players and audio delivered by mobile phones .
With the Justice Department ’s approval in hand , analysts have said XM and Sirius are unlikely to face outright opposition from the FCC , although the agency could impose conditions on the deal designed to protect consumers and preserve competition .
Under U.S. law , the FCC is tasked with looking beyond competition issues and determining whether a communications deal is in the overall public interest .
Sirius Chief Executive Mel Karmazin has promised that the combined company would let customers buy channels individually as well as let them block adult channels and get a refund for those channels .
Sirius has also said all existing XM and Sirius satellite radios will continue to work after the merger .

Flashback November 2005 : NAR States " Foreclosure Risk Minimal "
A rather unfortunate incident turned into a source of entertainment for me today …
The unfortunate incident was that my old desktop computer , which I set up in 2006 and used pretty much every day since , finally gave up the ghost .
Therefore , I spent most of this weekend setting up a new desktop system ( a Shuttle SX38P2 Pro with an Intel E8400 processor overclocked to 3.4GHz/1600MHz FSB , if you ’re curious . )
While setting up my new desktop , I decided it was probably time to “ clean house ” a bit and go through all my old documents .
I spent a few hours weeding out over 50 GB (! ) of no -longer - needed files .
While digging through archives of documents I had saved , I came across a gem : A PDF report from the National Association of Realtors , which is dated November 28 , 2005 .
I now vaguely remember chuckling at this report in 2005 when I saved it , knowing I would probably want to keep it for posterity .
I have saved it in all of its glory here on my server for your reference .
As you read it , I assure you at least some of you may think this is fake or exaggerated .
Fortunately for both of us , some not - so - astute Realtors ( TM ) made a copy freely available on their site as well .
( I note that they have removed “ Fremont ” from the title of their copy of the PDF … likely because their office does not serve the Fremont area . )
Let ’s kick back , pop open a cold drink , and have a look !
NAR Decries : No Bust In Sight !
A quick refresher — 2005 was the year housing prices peaked in the Bay Area .
There were no signs of a slowdown in sight .
The NAR made this quite clear :
“ With home prices rising strongly in most parts of the country , there has been widespread media coverage on the possibility of a housing market bust .
A thorough analysis of the San Francisco - Oakland - Fremont metro market , as detailed below , reveals that there is little danger of this . ”
Shew !
Sure glad I trusted the NAR .
* wipes sweat from brow *
Next paragraph :
“ Because prices have risen faster than income , the ratio of price - to - income is currently above the historical norm .
This measure is frequently cited to imply that there is a housing market bubble .
But this ratio is a misleading measure in assessing bubble prospects .
A more relevant measure is the mortgage servicing cost relative to income .
This ratio is at a very manageable level .
It implies no widespread financial overstretching to purchase a home in the region . ” ( emphasis mine )
I am sure all of the people whose homes are now in foreclosure found this very comforting .
“ Affordability ”
“ The current price of $ 726,900 is more than three times the national average . ”
Let me emphasize that this was the median price … i.e. half of all houses sold for more than $ 726,900 .
This in an area where the median household income is just over $ 70,000 a year !
How can the “ median ” family have afforded a house that was 10 x their annual income ?
The answer is … they could n’t , and so they resorted to “ liar loans ” and interest - only loans in a sucker ’s game that would leave everyone involved worse off than before .
“ Job Creation ” Touted Is Actually Nonexistent
Of all of the crap in this PDF , there are two things about it that really do bother me .
The rest I can shrug off or laugh at , but these two are artful manipulation .
Here ’s the first one :
“ The job market has turned the corner after taking a large hit from the fallout of the technology bubble .
There have been 24,100 payroll job additions in the past 12 months to July .
Many new job holders seek their own housing units . ”
STOP RIGHT THERE .
Contrast the above statement with the following article , which appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle in September 2005 — just two months prior to this bubblicious PDF :
“ The Berkeley labor economists noted that the state ’s economy has gotten a huge boost from housing .
Construction and related fields such as real estate or lending , all related to the housing boom , accounted for half of all the net job growth in the state between 2002 and 2005 . ”
HALF .
HALF of all job growth since the bust in the so - called “ Silicon Valley ” was NOT in tech , but in real estate .
Are you beginning to see what a monster this housing boom / bust has created ?
We are nowhere near the bottom .
Those real estate jobs that were created arguably wo n’t be needed in a bust , just like the many dot - com boom jobs that were created vanished within 3 years after the bust .
This is only the beginning of the shakeout .
It has been only about two years since the party stopped .
It will be several more before we can realistically say what an impact it will have when most of the jobs that were created during the “ recovery ” disappear…again .
NAR Acknowledges the Dark Horse
This is the other piece that shook me so visibly .
NAR and others have been quiet about how many houses were financed with dangerous “ ticking time bomb ” loans .
But in this document , it ’s clearly spelled out :
“ ARMS accounted for 67 % in 2004 across the region , one of the highest rates in the country .
Furthermore , the interest - only loans accounted for nearly half of all loans in 2004 . ”
ARMs are Adjustable Rate Mortgages , or mortgages that “ float ” with the interest rate .
Many of them have “ introductory rates ” at 1 , 2 , or 3 % and then reset higher — much higher — after a period of 3 - 5 years .
Here is a chart ( not from the NAR , of course ) that shows when the ARMs will reset :
( Click on image for bigger image )
We are not even a year into this chart .
The worst is yet to come .
67 % of the loans taken out were adjustable rate .
The recent interest rate lowering by the Fed may help folks with these loans out , and surely some of them will refinance … but banks wo n’t refinance loans that are “ underwater ” — where the borrower owes more than his / her home is worth .
As prices decline , more and more of these homes go underwater .
In Conclusion : Pay Attention !
Pandering and bad statistics being touted as “ news ” showcases a major problem I have with newspapers and news sources in general : often , in an effort to be “ balanced ” , they will place a quote from a NAR representative or a local real estate agent next to a quote from an economist .
The problem is that one group ( real estate agents ) makes money when you buy a house , so of course they will always urge people to buy .
The other side — economists — have no vested interest in what the market does , because they get paid to write reports no matter what happens .
Whenever you read news articles , be careful to pick out why someone is saying what they are saying .
If their job depends on you taking a specific action ( like buy a house ) , they will make sure their slant is that you should do it , even if it is clearly not in your best interest .
Take anything anyone with financial vested interest in you taking an action says with a grain of salt .
Always keep abreast of alternate sources like Patrick.net and the Housing Bubble Blog for non-Realtor - biased news .
My next real estate post will be next week , and it will be your complete guide to figuring out exactly when the higher - priced houses will begin to fall in price ( I have charts ! ) and unbiased numbers that show you how to decide when a coastal property or a higher - priced property is considered “ affordable ” .
It ’s something that many of you have requested — and that I have a personal interest in , as I do expect to eventually buy an ocean - view property .
Of course , I am not a real estate agent , and I wo n’t make any money whether you decide to buy a property or not …
I just enjoy researching and writing about economics and real estate .
Make sure to subscribe to my blog — I post about the real estate market at least once a month .
As always , if you have questions or comments , I welcome them in the comments below — and I do try to answer them all .

こ こ３年ぐらい同一案件のアジャイル的な開発をやっているのですが、
見積もりについて経験則がまとまってきたので整理してみたいと思います。
まず、前提として以下のような作業を請け負っています。
顧客の要望を聞いて要件開発を行う
要件を元にシステムの設計を行う
設計を元にプログラムの製造を行う
テストを行 う
運用時に発生した障害の調査
開発は１期のスパンが２か月～３か月程度で、 開発した機能のリリースを行いながら順次機能拡張していくといった感じになります。
作業の見積もりはその作業の種別により分類されます。
建築での比喩で表現すれば、大きく分けると設計図面を引く前と引いた後です。
これに加え、突発的な飛び込み作業があるので、以下の３つに分類しています。
設計図面を引くまでの作業
引いた図面をもとに開発する作業
突発的に発生する作 業
そして、それぞれの作業ごとに不確定要素（リスク）が存在します。
設計図面を引くまでの作業
要件開発の部分では、時間をかければ時間をかけただけ、作るべきモノの設計書(図面と比ゆしたもの)が増えます。
顧客側のいいなりに作業しているとえらく時間を取られる可能性があります。その部分がリスクと言えばリスクでしょう。
しかし、どうせ図面を大量に用意したところで投入人数が決まっているなら１期の開発で消化できる量が
決まっていますから、定量に達したところで開発側主導で中断するべきです。
具体的にはシステムの設計の過程で、ある程度確度の高い見積もりができますから、
積算して定量に達したらそれ以上の設計には着手しないで次回送りにします。
定量が定まっているためか、開発主導で中断できるせいなのか、この過程にかかる時間は
比較的安定していてそれほど大きなブレはありません。
引いた図面をもとに開発する作業
この過程も、それほど開発工数はブレません。
設計の際に洗い出した作業は思いのほか工数を外さないものです。
しかし、怖いのは洗い出しに失敗して、見落としていた作業があった場合。
この、作業の見落としは工数見積もりのブレの中では特に注意すべきポイントだと思います。
一番大きな痛手となるのは、設計が差し戻しになったケース。とても大きな工数を消耗してしまいます。 設計者が用件だけではなくシステムの設計も把握している人材でさえあればこのリスクはかなり低減します。 また、顧客との打ち合わせの仕方次第で仕様のどんでんがえしのリスクは軽減されます。
また、技術的なリスクもあります。 とくにシステムのコアとなる部分など、高度な部分の開発は、やってみてできなかったというケースがあり、
頭数を投入したからと言ってどうにかできるものでもありませんから、締め切りを後ろに伸ばすか、
後の工程を短い期間で無茶してやるかという選択になってしまいます。
・作業の見落としがないようにする ・技術的に不安がある部分は検証を事前に行っておくようにする
といったところを気をつけるとよいでしょう。
突発的に発生する作 業
障害対応が主なものです。 こればっかりはいつ出るのかわかったもんじゃありません。
保険の考え方を導入して予備工数を積むしかないでしょう。
製造した機能ごとに算出した工数を予備として積んでおきましょう。 私の方では
( 製造にかかった時間 x 複雑さ係数 ) / ( リリース後経過月数 * 調整係数 )
といった算出の仕方をしています。時間経過に伴い、障害の発生率は落ちていくとしています。
直前の期でリリースした機能は比較的高い発生率と想定し、古い期にリリースした機能ほど
発生率は低くなるととらえています。
基準となるのは製造にかかった工数としています。
これは設計や仕様書の策定、テストケースの策定、テストの実施を抜いた、
プログラムの製造に関わる作業をてっとり早く定数化する手法です。
FP(ファンクションポイント法)などの規模感を測定する指標を持っているならそれらを利用してもよいでしょう。
ただし、ステップ数は規模感の測定に用いるには誤差が大きすぎるのでそのまま使うのはやめたほうがよい。
ここのリスクばかりは本当にコントロールしきれない。
一時期に集中的にバグが露呈することもあります。
ですが、金融工学に基づく保険の手法に学んで、リスクに対して備えを用意する程度にはあがきましょう。

HONG KONG --
It turns out that train tracks in Tibet are n't where the antelope play .
Earlier this week , Xinhua , China 's state - run news agency , issued an unusual public apology for publishing a doctored photograph of Tibetan wildlife frolicking near a high - speed train .
The deception -- uncovered by Chinese Internet users who sniffed out a Photoshop scam in the award - winning picture -- has brought on a big debate about media ethics , China 's troubled relationship with Tibet , and how pregnant antelope react to noise .
The antelope imbroglio began in the summer of 2006 .
The Chinese government was celebrating its latest engineering feat , and an enthusiastic wildlife photographer from the Daqing Evening News was camped out on the Tibetan plateau eating energy bars and waiting for antelope to pass .
On July 1 , 2006 , in an event scheduled to coincide with the Communist Party 's 85th birthday , Chinese President Hu Jintao hosted the launch of China 's train to the " roof of the world . "
The $ 4 billion Qinghai - Xizang railway -- a remarkable system that transports passengers to an altitude ( 16,000 feet ) so high that ballpoint pens can explode en route from the air - pressure change -- traverses 1,200 miles of rugged terrain to connect the rest of China to the remote Tibetan plateau .
Northern Rock relied heavily on money markets
The EU has said it will launch a full investigation of the state bailout plan of troubled UK bank Northern Rock .
Northern Rock was given emergency government funding last year , after it was hard hit by the credit crunch .
In February , the government said the bank would be temporarily nationalised , but it needs European regulators to approve its rescue plan .
UK taxpayers are now subsidising the bank in loans and guarantees to other lenders to the tune of about £ 55 bn .
According to the BBC 's business editor , Robert Peston , the move by the EU was widely expected , given the size of the government rescue package .
Restructuring
The bank recently said it would cut about 2,000 jobs by 2011 and reduce its residential mortgage lending by half , as part of plans to turn around the troubled bank 's fortunes .
Northern Rock must repay Bank of England loans worth about £ 25 bn .
At the end of March , the bank said it would repay its state loan by 2010 even though it said it would not break even for three years .
At heart of the EU investigation is whether the long - term restructuring plan harms competition in the market .
Under EU rules , public support can be allowed to stop firms from going bankrupt , but long - term government aid that is seen to undermine competition is not permitted .
Danish banks have already made formal complaints to the European Commission alleging unfair competition in the European banking sector after Northern Rock was given state aid .
CLEVELAND ( Reuters ) -
As hundreds of thousands of American home owners fall behind on their mortgage payments , more people are turning to short - term loans with sky - high interest rates just to get by .

While figures are hard to come by , evidence from nonprofit credit and mortgage counselors suggests that the number of people using these so - called “ pay day loans ” is growing as the U.S. housing crisis deepens , a negative sign for economic recovery .
“ We ’re hearing from around the country that many folks are buried deep in pay day loan debts as well as struggling with their mortgage payments , ” said Uriah King , a policy associate at the Center for Responsible Lending ( CRL ) .
A pay day loan is typically for a few hundred dollars , with a term of two weeks , and an interest rate as high as 800 percent .
The average borrower ends up paying back $ 793 for a $ 325 loan , according to the Center .
The Center also estimates pay day lenders issued more than $ 28 billion in loans in 2005 , the latest available figures .
In the Union Miles district of Cleveland , which has been hit hard by the housing crisis , all the conventional banks have been replaced by pay day lenders with brightly painted signs offering instant cash for a week or two to poor families .
“ When distressed home owners come to us it usually takes a while before we find out if they have pay day loans because they do n’t mention it at first , ” said Lindsey Sacher , community relations coordinator at nonprofit East Side Organizing Project on a recent tour of the district .
“ But by the time they come to us for help , they have nothing left . ”
The loans on offer have an Annual Percentage Rate ( APR ) of up to 391 percent -- excluding fees and penalties .
All you need for a loan like this is proof of regular income , even government benefits will do .
On top of the exorbitant cost , pay day loans have an even darker side , Sacher notes .
“ We also have to contend with the fact that pay day lenders are very aggressive when it comes to getting paid . ”
Ohio is on the front line of the U.S. housing crisis .
According to the Mortgage Bankers Association , at the end of the fourth quarter Ohio had 3.88 percent of home loans in the process of foreclosure , the highest of all the 50 U.S. states .
The “ Rust Belt ” state ’s woes have been further compounded by the loss of 235,900 manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2007 .
But while the state as a whole has not done well in recent years , pay day lenders have proliferated .
Bill Faith , executive director of COHHIO , an umbrella group representing some 600 nonprofit agencies in Ohio , said the state is home to some 1,650 pay day loan lenders -- more than all of Ohio ’s McDonald ’s , Burger Kings and Wendy ’s fast food franchises put together .
“ That ’s saying something , as the people of Ohio really like their fast food , ” Faith said .
“ But pay day loans are insidious because people get trapped in a cycle of debt . ”
It takes the average borrower two years to get out of a pay day loan , he said .
Robert Frank , an economics professor at Cornell University , equates pay day loans with “ handing a suicidal person a noose ” because many people can’t control their finances and end up mired in debt .
“ These loans lead to more bankruptcies and wipe out people ’s savings , which is bad for the economy , ” he said .
“ This is a problem that has been caused by deregulation ” of the U.S. financial sector in the 1990s .
Because of the astronomical interest rates there is a movement among more states to implement a cap of 36 percent APR that is currently in place in 13 states and the District of Columbia .
“ Thirty - six percent is still very high , ” said Ozell Brooklin , director of Acorn Housing in Atlanta , Georgia where there is a cap in place .
“ But it ’s better than 400 percent . ”
SPRINGING THE TRAP
But even in states like New York where pay day loan caps or bans exist , loopholes allow out - of - state lenders to provide loans over the Internet .
Janet Hudson , 40 , ran into pay day loans when she and her fiance broke up , leaving her with a young son and a $ 1,000 monthly mortgage payment .
Short on cash , she took out three small pay day loans online totaling $ 900 but fell behind with her payments .
Soon her monthly interest and fees totaled $ 800 .
“ It almost equaled my mortgage and I was n’t even touching the principal of the loans , ” said Hudson , who works as an administrative assistant .
After falling behind on her mortgage , Hudson asked Rochester , New York - based nonprofit Empire Justice Center for help .
A lawyer at Empire , Rebecca Case - Grammatico , advised her to stop paying off the pay day loans because the loans were unsecured debt .
“ For months after that the pay day lenders left me voice mails threatening to have me thrown in jail , take everything I owned and destroy my credit rating , ” Hudson said .
After several months , the pay day lenders offered to reach a settlement .
But Hudson was already so far behind on her mortgage that she had to sell her home April 2007 to avoid foreclosure .
“ Thanks to the ( New York state ) ban on pay day loans we ’ve been spared large scale problems , but Internet loans have still cost people their homes , ” Case - Grammatico said .
A national 36 percent cap on pay day loans to members of the military came into effect last October .
The cap was proposed by Republican Senator Jim Talent and Democratic Senator Bill Nelson -- citing APR of up to 800 percent as harmful to the battle readiness and morale of the U.S. Armed Forces .
There are now proposals in other states -- including Ohio , Virginia , Arizona and Colorado -- to bring in a 36 percent cap .
And , in Arkansas , attorney general Dustin McDaniel sent a letter to payday lenders on March 18 asking them to shut down or face a lawsuit , saying they have made a “ lot of money on the backs of Arkansas consumers , mostly the working poor . ”
Alan Fisher , executive director of the California Reinvestment Coalition , an umbrella group of housing counseling agencies , said up 2 million Californians have pay day loans .
“ We expect pay day loans will make the housing crisis worse , ” Fisher said .
California ’s state assembly is set to debate a bill to introduce a 36 percent cap .
“ Thanks to the credit crunch and foreclosure crisis , state and federal policy makers are taking a hard look at the policy of credit at any cost , ” the CRL ’s King said .
“ But more needs to be done , fast . ”

To hear the Bush administration tell it , the current flare - up in Iraq is a sign of the success of the surge .
In theory at least there ’s a certain logic to this argument .
What administration officials claim is that the surge has allowed the al Maliki government to consolidate its power sufficiently that it can take on Sadr ’s militia , the outlaw but until recenlty quiescent Mahdi Army .
Unfortunately , and not surprisingly , that does not seem to be what ’s happening .
The clearest analysis I ’ve read is Fred Kaplan ’s short piece in Slate , which explains that this is not so much the Iraqi ‘ government ’ standing down an outlaw ‘ militia ’ as a face off between two militias , one of which happens to control the government .
Labels aside , this seems to be al Maliki ’s attempt to break the Mahdi Army , possibly because Iraq is soon to hold regional elections and Maliki ’s supporters fear the Sadrists will do too well in the southern port city of Basra .
Fred does n’t say this , but I wonder myself if this is n’t also an effort of Maliki ( now allied with what used to be SCIRI ) to crush the Sadrists while he still has the power of the US military behind him .
Most accounts I ’ve seen suggest that Sadr actually has more popular support than Maliki and his supporters , at least among the Shia population .
It must not be lost on Maliki and his supporters that a Democrat may succeed President Bush and that that new president may be much less likely to prop up his government with American money and military might .
So perhaps best to crush opponents now , with the help of the US military , in advance of that less certain future .
As an aside , President Bush is saying that Iran is , in the words of the Times , “ arming , training and financing the militias fighting against the Iraqi forces . ”
Perhaps that ’s true .
But it ’s hard not to note that the Badr Organization ( formerly the Badr Corps ) , which Maliki has allied himself with , is the outfit that was actually created in Iran under the tutelage and financing of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard .
So this at least seems like a rather partial take on what ’s occurring .
In any case , whatever it is and whoever is behind it , the crackdown does not appear to be going well .
The Times has a muted run-down of where things stand .
The government forces do not seem to be making much headway in Basra and protests and violence has broken out in a number of Iraqi cities .
Baghdad itself is now under a curfew until Sunday .
A more breathless piece in the Times of London says that Maliki ’s “ operation to crush militia strongholds in Basra [ has ] stalled , members of his own security forces defected and district after district of his own capital fell to Shia militia gunmen . ”
Finally , this piece in tomorrow ’s
Post suggests that while this effort may have begun with the Iraqi forces in the lead , US forces are quickly being drawn in to the thick of the fighting while the Iraqi government troops are in at least some cases receding into the background .
From the Post …
U.S. forces in armored vehicles battled Mahdi Army fighters Thursday in Sadr City , the vast Shiite stronghold in eastern Baghdad , as an offensive to quell party - backed militias entered its third day .
Iraqi army and police units appeared to be largely holding to the outskirts of the area as American troops took the lead in the fighting .
Four U.S. Stryker armored vehicles were seen in Sadr City by a Washington Post correspondent , one of them engaging Mahdi Army militiamen with heavy fire .
The din of American weapons , along with the Mahdi Army ’s AK - 47s and rocket - propelled grenades , was heard through much of the day .
U.S. helicopters and drones buzzed overhead .
The clashes suggested that American forces were being drawn more deeply into a broad offensive that Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , a Shiite , launched in the southern city of Basra on Tuesday , saying death squads , criminal gangs and rogue militias were the targets .
Everything out there suggests that is another engagement between the handful of factions and warlords now controlling Iraq and a possible heat up of the incipient civil war that ’s been on the back burner for the last several months .
And we ’re quickly getting drawn into the thick of the fighting .
Because the Iraqi government forces who seem to have started this for their own reasons and , according to US government officials , without warning to the US , are n’t up to the fight and now need the US military to bail them out .
One US official tells the Post that many in the US government believe this whole gambit was Maliki firing “ the first salvo in upcoming elections , ” which probably sums up all we need to know about the state of Iraqi democracy and political reconciliation .
BEIJING–In the darkest of ironies , as the Olympic torch was lit in Athens yesterday , a court in China sentenced a man to five years in prison after he dared to say the principle of human rights is more important than the Olympic Games .
Unemployed former factory worker , Yang Chunlin , 54 , gathered more than 10,000 signatures on a petition last year , appealing against illegal seizures of land from poor farmers by powerful local officials in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang .
The petition letter began : " We want human rights , not the Olympics . "
Yang was promptly arrested July 6 and charged with trying to subvert state power – a broad charge frequently used against those who openly criticize the government .
After Yang 's trial last month – which lasted less than a day – Sophie Richardson of Human Rights Watch said she feared that , " soon it will be official that objecting to the Olympics is a crime in China . "
In fact , prosecution of outspoken Chinese citizens has picked up pace in the final months before the Games .
Yang 's is the third case of a well - known dissident to come before the courts in recent weeks .
Last month , democracy activist and writer Lu Gengsong was sentenced to four years for " inciting to subvert state power . "
And last week well - known activist Hu Jia was hauled before the courts , but he has yet to be sentenced .
Hu Jia is perhaps best - known for his work in helping HIV / AIDS victims .
He and his wife Zeng Jinyan had been kept under house arrest for months in Beijing , before he was finally arrested on Dec. 27 .
Yang Chunlin's 5 - year sentence yesterday , comes only weeks after Chinese Foreign Minister , Yang Jiechi , publicly scoffed at suggestions that any citizen might be sentenced for saying human rights were more important than the Olympics .
" People in China enjoy extensive freedom of speech , " Yang told reporters during an official visit by British Foreign Minister David Milibank .
" No one will get arrested because he said that human rights are more important than the Olympics .
This is impossible .
" Ask 10 people from the street to face public security officers and ask them to say `human rights are more important than the Olympics ' 10 times or even 100 times , and let 's see which security officer would put him in jail . "
During
Yang 's time in jail , the group China Human Rights Defenders claimed he was chained for days in a fixed position and forced to clean the waste of other inmates .
Yesterday , as Yang was being led away from court , a scuffle broke out between police and his family , and Yang was pushed to the floor and shocked with electric batons , according to his lawyer Li Fangping .
Yang now has 10 days to decide whether he will appeal , Li told The Associated Press .
While Yang was being sentenced in China , International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge was insisting to reporters in Athens that it was " right " to have awarded the Olympic Games to China , saying the event would act as a " catalyst " for change .
He said it was n't in his or the IOC 's job to dictate directives to a sovereign state , or to engage it in political discussions .
Still , human rights campaigners decried the yesterday 's sentencing .
" Yang Chunlin 's 5 - year sentence darkensthe lighting of the Beijing Olympics torch , " Sharon Hom of Human Rights in China , told the Star from New York .

" Imprisonment for peacefully expressing your views – protected by the Chinese Constitution and international human rights law – undermines any claim to the `human rights ' progress cited IOC President Jacques Rogge , " she said .
China has made it clear that it will not brook any embarrassing protests highlighting political or social problems during the Games .
But human rights campaigners have vowed to seize the opportunity to protest while the world 's eyes are on China .

April Fool Don Eigler – a researcher famous for spelling I - B - M with individual atoms – stunned the world once again today by revealing on his blog that a creature known as Robert Scoble is really a research project .
A few years back , IBM researchers started to think more and more about the potential rise of so - called virtual worlds exemplified today by creations such as Second Life .
Impressed by their own vision and competence , the scientists decided to shoot past the limitations of server - based worlds and to enter the real world .
And so they set about working on a prototype system that could interact with human beings in a near lifelike manner .
The end result ?
The Robert Scoble – a thing the world has come to know as a semi-autonomous blogger .
" Honestly , we had no idea that this would pan out when we initialized work on the project , " Eigler said .
" We 're just beyond thrilled that the Scoble has enjoyed such success .
This speaks volumes about IBM 's insight and willingness to confront constrained , conventional , bandwagonny thinking . "
IBM 's Scoble contraption relies on a solar - powered nanoscale projector running an embedded version of Gringo Linux .
Thanks to top secret work with graphene , IBM can arrange carbon atoms in a lattice so intricate and fantastic that the Scoble ships with close to 1TB of memory , which allows the system to form basic sentences and make simple gestures .
" It basically has the brain power of a dog that 's been clubbed to the head a few times , " Eigler said .
" That 's why we busted into hysterics when it got a job at Microsoft .
We just pushed the button , sent it in and let it go .
Next thing we know one of our biggest competitors has hired a projection drone .
It 's awesome stuff . "
IBM 's staff also had little idea that their artificial intelligence software would give Scoble such a level of independence .
Only days out of the lab , the creature fired up a blog where it discussed simple observations about the world such as how much it enjoyed cats that wear diapers and the smooth texture of peanut butter .
Later , the Scoble left Microsoft and managed to convince some of the world 's most eager publishers to hire it .
Thanks to a complex IBM quasi-numeric salary Pareto parser algorithm known as " CashMachineY " Scoble evolved into one of the best paid bloggers on the planet .
The IBM researchers were also fascinated by Scoble 's interaction with virtual worlds and spaces .
The real world - based Scoble entered Second Life and then later began conversing with himself on an application known as Twitter .
" It 's Scoble use of Twitter that 's probably the most impressive to us , " said famed IBM researcher Irving Wladawsky - Berger .
" You can see when he goes into glitch mode and writes things like ' Twitter is down , ' ' I love Twitter , ' " My underwear is fire hydrant , ' ' Pizza is yum yum , ' and the like .
We just reboot him remotely when that happens and pray for more complete thoughts to come out again .
Sometimes it works .
Sometimes it does n't .
" Either way , this is mind - blowing stuff .
Twitter is awesome .
Scoble is awesome .
Plus , it 's nice to have a warm body in our Second Life space . "
Since learning about the Scoble , critics have emerged who argue that the device demeans the spirit of the human experience .
" Frankly , I think it 's disgusting that this thing , this drone has been able to out earn me , " said Rob Enderle , chief consultant for the Enderle Group and vice president of Enderle International Dining Club Inc .
" I had cornered the market on vacuous , non-committal observations about the technology market .
To be bested by a nano particle is depressing , and I think something that could concern all man .
" That said , I 'm looking forward to the consulting opportunities that this research may present .
I think the technology could be both good and bad and expensive or cheap , depending on the circumstances .
" It 's also certainly possible that I could expand my business via a Scoble of my very own , which is exciting .
And frightening .
I think he can take the HP account . "
Later this year , IBM plans to recall the Scoble to its Watson Research center where it will upgrade the system with new firmware and another 500 GB of memory .
The company expects that this refresh will allow the Scoble to blog in entire paragraphs and take early steps toward forming abstract thoughts .
As a show of good faith and world flattening , the Chinese Olympic Committee also plans to team with IBM around having the Scoble write about this summer 's games for the official state - run newspaper .
The Register caught up with Scoble to discuss some of these exciting , upcoming events , although the device suffered from a memory - leak which caused it to guffaw over and over again throughout the duration of our interview .
IBM was unable to fix the glitch , despite hitting Ctrl - Alt - Delete repeatedly on a nano scale keyboard located near the system 's anus .
Some things never change . ®

This article covers the basic equipment , information , and skills required to successfully engage in practical long - range rifle shooting .
Keep in mind that this is an article and not real training , and there is no substitute for getting out there and learning from each shot .
It is divided into three sections .
The first is about the rifle and gear .
The second discusses trajectory and optics selection in depth .
The third explains how to put everything together to make hits on targets in the field .

Join the discussion :
Practical Long -Range Rifle Shooting on the Thunder Beast Arms Forum What Is Practical Long - Range Rifle Shooting ?
Practical precision rifle shooting involves engaging small and / or distant targets at the limit of weapon , ammunition , and shooter capability under time pressure in field settings .
Applications include but are not limited to : very small targets 1 /4 " - 1 " at 100 to 200 yards , so - called " cold bore " shots , arbitrary unknown distance targets , moving targets , ranging , shooter / spotter communication , and combinations of all of those under time constraints .
Generally , these include everything a rifleman is likely to find in any " sniper " , " tactical " , or " field " rifle match .
The typical platform is a bolt action rifle , though an auto - loader of sufficient accuracy and appropriate caliber can do the job with some trade - offs .
For our purposes , consider " long range " to reach to the load 's trans - sonic boundary ( the point at which the bullet slows to 15 to 20 percent faster than Mach 1 ) .
For example , with typical 308 loads and rifles , we are interested in ranges from 25 yards out to about 700 - 1100 yards , depending on ambient conditions and the particular load .
It 's About Making Hits , Not Having Perfect Gear
All of the questions discussed in this article have been and will continue to be debated to death on the internet , at the hunting camp , and at the gun-shop .
Equipment choices are important , but not something to obsess over .
It is more important to get some quality gear and get shooting , than it is to get paralyzed with indecision due to too many choices , or change equipment too often to get good .
Remember , long - range practical shooting is about making hits in the field .
Practice and skill are more important than equipment .
Buying high - quality equipment the first time around rarely brings regrets .
Pay Once For Good Gear -
It 's Worth It Some of the equipment discussed in this article is expensive -- really expensive .
Let 's get this out of the way : long range shooting is not cheap , but the rifles and optics are not where the expense lies .
Long range shooting is expensive because it requires a lot of practice to become really good , and practice means time and ammunition .
Many people balk at spending $ 1000 or more on a rifle or scope .
This is misguided .
Spending money for good equipment in these two areas especially are some of the best places to spend money in a precision rifle system .
Along with the rifle action , stock , and mounts , these costs are fixed over the life of the rifle .
The cost of training , ammunition , and barrels dramatically eclipses those fixed costs .
To illustrate the point , let 's analyze the cost of training with a high - end factory precision rifle ( AI - AE ) using a top of the line S&B or US Optics scope for 5 years .
A rifleman with a moderate but regular training schedule might shoot 3000 per year .
If he is shooting 308 , a realistic barrel life might be 8000 rounds .
Over the 5 years , that will be 15,000 rounds and 2 barrels .
For ammunition , we will use a conservative estimate of what reloaded ammunition might cost .
Let 's assume he takes 2 rifle classes in that period , travels to one large match per year , and uses one tank of gas per month practicing locally .
Rifle purchase cost $ 2500 ( not counting first barrel ) Scope purchase cost $ 2100 Fixed Cost Total $ 4600
Two replacement barrels $ 1200 15,000 reloads $ 6000 Consumables Cost Total $ 7200
Two classes enrollment $ 1600 Two classes travel & lodging $ 2000 Five major match entry fee $ 875 Five matches travel & lodging $ 5000 Five local matches per year entry & gas money $ 2400 Total Training Cost $ 11,875
It 's clear that both consumable costs and training costs will totally eclipse the fixed rifle and optics costs by a factor of four over a five year period .
If you plan on shooting regularly to achieve a superior level of proficiency , it makes sense to buy the best rifle and scope you possibly can .
To put it another way , why make a $ 500 compromise when selecting the rifle or scope when it could put the $ 1000 you 've invested in a rifle class or national match at risk ?
Wine is one of the oldest alcoholic beverages on the planet .
Its history spans thousands of years and while heavy drinking of any alcoholic beverage rather brings lots of health - related troubles instead of benefits , current research suggests that a glass of red wine each day may be providing you with more than just a little relaxation .
Reduced risk of death from nearly all causes : European researchers suggest that moderate daily intake of red wine ( 22 - 32 g of alcohol ) has a protective effect on all - cause mortality .
According to studies from France , UK , Finland and Denmark , moderate consumption of wine is more beneficial than that of beer or spirits .
Smoking : Acute smoking significantly impairs vessels ’ natural ability to relax , or vasodilate .
Red wine , with or without alcohol , decreases the harmful effect of smoking on the endothelium – layer of cells that provide a friction - reducing lining in lymph vessels , blood vessels , and the heart .
Heart disease :
One of the well - known and most studied benefits of red wine is its heart protective effect .
Moderate consumption of red wine on a regular basis may be a preventative against coronary heart disease .
Scientists believe the red wine reduces the risk of coronary heart disease by reducing production of low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol and boosting high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol .
Blood clots :
Red wine produces anticlotting , or antithrombotic , action .
Light to moderate consumers of wine have lower levels of protein fibrinogen which promotes blood clot formation .
Atherosclerosis :
Red wine may prevent the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis ( hardening or “ furring ” of the arteries ) .
Atherosclerosis starts when blood vessels begin to lose their ability to relax .
Both the alcohol and polyphenols in the red wine appear to favorably maintain healthy blood vessels by promoting the formation of nitric oxide ( NO ) , the key chemical relaxing factor that plays an important role in the regulation of vascular tone .
Hypertension : Excessive alcohol consumption is generally considered a risk factor for hypertension .
However , there is some evidence of favorable effects of red wine on blood pressure .
Two glasses of red wine ( 250 ml ) , taken together with the meal , lower post - meal blood pressure in hypertensive persons .
Kidney stones :
Red wine intake reduces the risk of kidney stone formation .
Alzheimer ’s disease : Moderate wine drinking correlates with a lower risk for Alzheimer ’s disease .
Researchers found that resveratrol , a red wine polyphenol , produces neuroprotective effects .
So while my conclusion does not include a blanket statement telling everyone to drink wine everyday , it may be worth a try if your situation today leaves you at risk for any of the point above .

Most design trends come unexpectedly , evolve over time , become pointless and finally disappear from the design landscape .
This holds particularly for web design , which is — just as every other creative field — prone for over - hyping and over - usage of trends .
Being used excessively ( sometimes properly , but mostly without any reasonable purpose ) , trends lose their ability to communicate information , express something unique or innovative and consequently lose their visual appeal .

This holds particularly for web design , which is — just as every other creative field — prone for over - hyping and over - usage of trends .
Being used excessively ( sometimes properly , but mostly without any reasonable purpose ) , trends lose their ability to communicate information , express something unique or innovative and consequently lose their visual appeal .
Web 2.0 style is an excellent example for this evolution in design .
In 2007 we ’ve observed a clear example of design abuse , as glossy buttons , colorful reflections , 3D - effects , rounded corners and xx-large font sizes could be found almost everywhere ( and we ’ve presented some examples a year ago ) .
However , currently we ’ve been observing a new step in this evolution .
Web 2.0 elements start to disappear ; they become more subtle , more user - centric , more content - oriented and less loud .
What is the Grunge style ?
As Web 2.0 style passes way , it ’s time for something new .
Few weeks ago we ’ve written about the hand - drawing style in modern web - design .
And as Web 2.0 style is all about glossy and shiny look , another option would be something rather crude , radical and provoking .
Such as the grunge style — dirty look with irregular , nasty , sometimes even ugly and crooked visual elements .
Will it establish itself as a trend ?
Probably not .
However , it may be used once some creative and unconventional design approach is needed .
You may want to take a look at the following related posts :
Below we ’ve collected everything you would ever need for a perfect design in a grunge style — design examples , free fonts , icons , textures , brushes and even few tutorials .
Examples of Grunge Style
Grunge does n’t necessarily stand for dirty .

“ We ’re very excited and very pleased with this decision , ” said Valverde ’s lawyer brother , Frank .
“ We ’re looking forward to spending some time with him . ”
Valverde , 36 , was a college student with no criminal record when he learned that his girlfriend of three years had been raped by Joel Schoenfeld , a photographer on probation for two other sex attacks .
At his trial , he testified that he had gone to Schoenfeld ’s Greenwich Village studio loft Jan. 5 , 1991 , with a gun in a bid to scare him off from trying to contact his girlfriend again , when the pair got into a fatal scuffle .
Police had n’t been able to arrest Schoenfeld for the attack on the girlfriend because she was too traumatized to press charges .
A Manhattan jury acquitted Valverde of murder charges , convicting him on the lesser charge of manslaughter because he acted under “ extreme emotional distress ”
Police said Valverde ’s 19 - year - old girlfriend responded to a newspaper ad in June 1990 seeking models , and Schoenfeld suggested she act as his secretary in his studio instead of paying lab and photo - developing fees .
Days later , the girlfriend told the police , Schoenfeld raped her inside the studio at 375 West St .
While behind bars , Valverde earned college degrees and taught his fellow inmates , and his good behavior garnered him letters of support from prison guards , politicians and even the late John Cardinal O’Connor .
The girlfriend has since married and is now a mother , according to an individual familiar with the case .
Valverde ’s supporters , led by Hispanics Across America President Fernando Mateo , staged a rally last summer in front of the parole offices in Albany .
“ We took three busloads of people , and we held a huge rally demanding his release , ” Mateo said .
“ I usually do n’t put our organization out there if I feel there is any doubt . ”

It 's here again , the day when jokers set out to make fools of the rest of us .
But not every bizarre story is a hoax .
Here is a round - up of some of the day 's seemingly spoof news stories which are actually true ( and one that is n't ) .
1 . A new pay - per - view funeral service scheme is being launched today .
The Daily Mail says the scheme at Southampton Crematorium allows mourners to grieve from home by watching proceedings online .
Fool : Flying penguins 2 . A turtle is addicted to nicotine .
He became addicted after picking up the smouldering butts in his owner 's garden , in Kouqian , China , and sulks if he does n't get his fix .
The Daily Express , which picked up the story from Chinese news agency Xinhua , includes a gob - smacking picture of the turtle doing a rather good impression of Dot Cotton .
3 . The menopause is caused by the age - old battle between wives and mothers - in - law , reports the Times .
As long as 50,000 to 300,000 years ago , competition for food in a family unit was a battle won by the younger women who fed their offspring , which led to the older women losing their ability to breed .
With food hard to find , mothers - in - law tended to help rear the grandchildren rather than have more children themselves .
4 . An injection that allows women bigger and better orgasms by increasing the size of the mysterious G - spot is being launched in the UK , says the Sun .
The £ 800 collagen jab takes less than half - an - hour and is given under local anaesthetic .
5 . School desks and chairs are to be enlarged to meet the needs of the UK's ever - heavier schoolchildren , reports the Express .
On average British children are a centimetre taller than they were 10 years ago , and there are more obese youngsters , so desks supplied to UK schools will reflect this .
Stolen from a busy aquarium 6 .
Wind turbines or solar panels built by UK companies anywhere in the world could count towards Britain 's renewable energy targets under controversial government proposals , according to the Financial Times .
7 . You will soon be able to have a tattoo on your teeth , reports the Sun. Steve Heward , the dentist who started the craze in the US plans to set up in Britain .
8 . The traditional Chinese martial art T'ai Chi can help control diabetes , reports the Daily Mail .
Apparently , researchers have found the flowing movements and deep breathing involved can result in a fall in blood sugar levels .
9 . A thief walked out of a busy Norwegian aquarium with a crocodile that was over two feet long , says the Independent .
10 .
Drinkers have been banned from calling barmaids " love " .
An outraged Daily Star says new discrimination laws mean landlords that allow punters to chat up staff could be hauled before a tribunal and face unlimited fines .
And finally , a genuine spoof .

Obama : Bush should consider boycott of Olympic ceremony Reuters
Published : Wednesday April 9 , 2008
|
Print This Email This LEVITTOWN , Pa. , April 9 - President George W. Bush should boycott the opening ceremony of the Olympics if China does not take steps to help stop genocide in Darfur and improve human rights in Tibet , U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama said on Wednesday .
But Obama qualified that by saying any decision should be made closer to the date of the Olympic Games in Beijing in August .
" If the Chinese do not take steps to help stop the genocide in Darfur and to respect the dignity , security and human rights of the Tibetan people , then the president should boycott the opening ceremonies , " Obama , a Democratic senator from Illinois , said in a statement .
" I am also deeply concerned about China 's failure to support efforts to halt the genocide in Darfur .
Regarding the Beijing Olympics this summer , a boycott of the opening ceremonies should be firmly on the table , but this decision should be made closer to the Games , " he added .
Obama , who holds a lead over his rival Sen.
Hillary Clinton of New York in the race to become the Democratic presidential nominee , did not go as far as Clinton in his statement on China and the Olympics .
Clinton 's call for Bush to weigh a boycott did not include any qualifiers about making the decision at a later date .
Clinton and Obama are vying to become their party 's nominee to run in the November election to pick a successor to the Republican Bush .
Bush plans to attend the Summer Olympics opening ceremonies in Beijing in August and so far has resisted pressure to change his plans in response to a violent crackdown against protesters in Tibet by Chinese authorities .
China has also been accused of refusing to use its influence on the Sudanese government to get it to stop what the United States calls a genocide in Sudan 's Darfur region .
At a rally earlier in the day , Obama was asked about China and said the United States needed to take a stronger and more consistent stance toward Beijing when it comes to human rights issues .
" In our policy toward China , we have not been consistent enough and tough enough in pushing them to deal with Tibet properly but also ( on ) their continued support of Sudan , a country that has been engaging in genocide against the peoples of Darfur , " he said .
But Obama also said the United States lacked leverage with China because the country holds so much U.S. debt .
" It 's very hard to tell your banker that he 's wrong , " he said .
" And if we are running huge deficits and big national debts and we 're borrowing money constantly from China that gives us less leverage . "
How different the world might look now if the US president and his advisers had settled on the phrase Axis of Unbearably Odious , or Axis of Hatred .
But they rejected that and instead plumped for Axis of Evil , and the rest is history .
So begins the script to Oliver Stone 's new movie , W , on the life of George W Bush , which begins filming this month and will be produced at speed .
Stone , a director with a keen eye for publicity , is thought to want to get the film into cinemas before the November presidential election , and certainly before Bush quits the White House on January 20 .
He insists that the film will be an accurate and fair portrait of Bush the man , though historical objectivity is not one of Stone 's strong points , judging by his previous presidential efforts , Nixon and JFK ,
The writing team appears to have pored over a considerable library of books and magazine articles on Bush and plucked out the tastiest rumours and juiciest morsels of gossip .
There are plenty of Bushisms in the script , and scenes of him drinking vodka and orange cocktails .
In the director 's own words , the film will address the question : " How did Bush go from being an alcoholic bum to the most powerful figure in the world ? "
The part of Bush will be played by Josh Brolin , no stranger to Texan roles , having been in the Coen brothers ' Oscar - winning No Country for Old Men. Elizabeth Banks of Spider - Man and The 40 - Year - Old Virgin is expected to play the first lady .
ABC News , which has read an early copy of the screenplay , describes it as a " warts - and - all portrayal " , though judging by its account of the script it might more accurately be called a " warts - and - yet more warts " portrait .
Bush 's early relationship with his father is depicted as problematic at best .
When his father confronts him about his drinking after he crashes his car , the younger George Bush replies : " Mr Perfect .
Mr War Hero. Mr Fucking God Almighty . "
The father also features heavily in the latter half of the screenplay , by which time Dubya has entered the world of politics .
Stone , a critic of the Iraq war , applies cod psychology to the president 's motivations for the invasion , according to ABC 's account of the screenplay .
After the elder Bush 's defeat in 1992 by Bill Clinton , his son tells him he would still be in the White House if he had toppled Saddam Hussein in the first Gulf war .
When the current president is asked in 2002 what his focus on Saddam is all about , he replies , in reference to a Kuwaiti claim that the Iraqi intelligence services plotted to assassinate his father during a visit to Kuwait in the spring of 1993 : " You do n't go after the Bushes and get to talk about it .
Ya got me ? "
It takes power to make power — even with a solar grand plan .
From the mining of quartz sand to the coating with ethylene - vinyl acetate , manufacturing a photovoltaic ( PV ) solar cell requires energy — most often derived from the burning of fossil fuels .
But a new analysis finds that even accounting for all the energy and waste involved , PV power would cut air pollution — including the greenhouse gases that cause climate change — by nearly 90 percent if it replaced fossil fuels .
Environmental engineer Vasilis Fthenakis , a senior scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton , N.Y. , and his colleagues examined the four most common types of PV cells : multicrystalline silicon , monocrystalline silicon , ribbon silicon and thin - film .
( Other contenders , such as amorphous silicon or superefficient multijunction cells were excluded for lack of data or lack of widespread application to date . )
Even taking into account the low efficiency of thin - film solar cells or the energy needed to purify silicon for the other types of PV , all proved to entail significantly fewer emissions in their entire life cycle than the fossil fuels needed to produce an equivalent amount of electricity .
In fact , most of their dirty side derived from the indirect emissions of the coal - burning power plants or other fossil fuels used to generate the electricity for PV manufacturing facilities .
These four types of solar cells pay back the energy involved in their manufacture in one to three years , according to an earlier analysis by the same team .
And even the most energy - intensive to produce — monocrystalline silicate cells with the highest energy conversion efficiency of 14 percent — emit just 55 grams ( 1.9 ounces ) of globe warming pollution per kilowatt - hour — a fraction of the near one kilogram ( 2.2 pounds ) of greenhouse gases emitted by a coal - fired power plant per kilowatt - hour .
Even though thin - film solar PVs employ heavy metals such as cadmium recovered from mining slimes , the overall toxic emissions are " 90 to 300 times lower than those from coal power plants , " the researchers write in Environmental Science & Technology .
The energy benefits of solar photovoltaics will only improve as the technology continues to boost its efficiency at converting sunlight to electricity or proves to last longer than the 30 years anticipated by manufacturers .
" There is no reason for this not to last a lot more than 30 years , " Fthenakis says .
If solar energy begins to power its own production — a so - called PV breeder cycle , in which PV - generated electricity goes to produce more PV cells — the outlook is even sunnier .
" I think 30 percent of the energy consumption in the [ manufacturing ] facilities is easily met from the land they have available [ on ] the roof and in the parking lot , " Fthenakis says .
And , as Fthenakis and colleagues argued in a recent article in Scientific American , if storage technologies such as compressed air improve , then PV could provide the majority of electricity needs in the U.S. " With storage , " Fthenakis says , " it is feasible to go to 100 percent . "
Biologists have created baker ’s yeast capable of living to 800 in yeast years without apparent side effects .
The basic but important discovery , achieved through a combination of dietary and genetic changes , brings science closer to controlling the survival and health of the unit of all living systems : the cell .
The study is scheduled to appear in the Jan. 25 issue of the journal PLOS Genetics .
A companion study , showing that the same genetic changes in yeast reverse the course of an accelerated aging syndrome , appears in the Jan. 14 issue of the Journal of Cell Biology .
Longo ’s group put baker ’s yeast on a calorie - restricted diet and knocked out two genes , RAS2 and SCH9 , that promote aging in yeast and cancer in humans .
“ We got a 10 - fold life span extension that is , I think , the longest one that has ever been achieved in any organism , ” Longo said .
In 2005 , the same research group reported a five - fold life span extension in the journal Cell .
Normal yeast organisms live about a week .
“ I would say 10 - fold is pretty significant , ” said Anna McCormick , chief of the genetics and cell biology branch at the National Institute on Aging and Longo ’s program officer .
The NIA funds such research in the hope of extending healthy life span in humans through the development of drugs that mimic the life - prolonging techniques used by Longo and others , McCormick added .
Baker ’s yeast is one of the most studied and best understood organisms at the molecular and genetic level .
Remarkably in light of its simplicity , yeast has led to the discovery of some of the most important genes and pathways regulating aging and disease in mice and other mammals .
A study recently published in Cell ( Issue 130 , pages 247- 258 , 2007 ) reported that a mouse with a gene mutation first identified by Longo ’s group lived 30 percent longer than normal and also was protected against heart and bone diseases without apparent side effects .
Longo ’s group next plans to further investigate life span extension in mice , and also is studying a human population in Ecuador with mutations analogous to those described in yeast .
“ People with two copies of the mutations have very small stature and other defects , ” he said .
“ We are now identifying the relatives with only one copy of the mutation , who are apparently normal .
We hope that they will show a reduced incidence of diseases and an extended life span . ”
Longo cautioned that , as in the Ecuador case , longevity mutations tend to come with severe growth deficits and other health problems .
Finding drugs to extend the human life span without side effects will not be easy , he said .
An easier goal , Longo added , would be to use the knowledge gained about life span “ in a fairly limited way , to reprogram disease prevention . ”
In the study appearing in the Jan. 14 Journal of Cell Biology , Longo ’s group developed a yeast model for human Werner / Bloom syndromes , incurable diseases that prematurely age , increase cancer incidence and eventually kill their victims .
The same mutations that play a central role in the 10 - fold life span extension reversed the premature aging process , the researchers found .
Longo suggested that although a very simple system was used in his studies , existing drugs targeting analogous anti-aging pathways in humans – specifically the pathway involving Insulin Growth Factor , or IGF - 1 – should be considered for testing on Werner / Bloom patients .
“ Maybe it will do nothing , but having nothing else , I think it ’s certainly a good thing to try , ” Longo said .
In the PLOS Genetics study , Longo ’s group identified a major overlap between the genes previously implicated in life span regulation for yeast and mammals and those involved in life span extension under calorie restriction .
“ We identified three transcription factors … that are very important for the effect of calorie restriction , but at the same time , we also showed that it ’s not enough because even without these transcription factors , calorie restriction can still extend life span a little bit , ” Longo said .
“ So that means that we ’ve identified a lot of the key players in the calorie restriction effect but not all of them . ”
Calorie restriction – in practice , controlled starvation – has long been shown to reduce disease and extend life span in species from yeast to mice .
Scientists believe that a nutrient shortage kicks organisms into a maintenance mode , enabling them to re-direct energy from growth and reproduction into anti-aging systems until the time they can feed and breed again .
Calorie restriction is now being tested by other researchers on primates and even humans , Longo said .
Longo has been studying aging at the cellular level for 15 years and has published articles in the nation ’s leading scientific journals .
His laboratory developed a simple and inexpensive method for measuring the true chronological life span of yeast .
Previously , scientists used the number of a yeast cell ’s offspring as a proxy for its age .
The so - called replicative life span technique remains in use , and the NIA ’s McCormick said that Longo ’s method was controversial at first .
However , she said , the scientific community now appears to accept its usefulness .
She said Longo ’s “ stationary phase ” method is particularly applicable to studies of cells that do not divide for most of their life , such as those in the brain or in muscle .
“ Stationary phase I think of as normal cell survival , ” McCormick said .
She added that NIA funds both stationary phase and replicative life span research .

USA TODAY survey :
We 're in recession , economists say The U.S. economy is in recession , or soon to be in one , according to USA TODAY 's quarterly survey of leading economists .
Two - thirds of the 52 economists polled said the U.S. economy is in recession .
Add those who believe the economy will be in recession soon , and 79 % believe that the economy will contract at some point in 2008 .
The good news :
The recession will be short and shallow , and inflation will abate , say the 52 economists surveyed .
In general , they expect the nation 's gross domestic product to shrink by half a percentage point in the second three months of the year .
The survey comes in a key week for economic data .
The Commerce Department reports Wednesday its initial measure of gross domestic product for the first quarter .
On the same day , the Federal Reserve will set a target for its key fed funds rate , which broadly affects borrowing costs .
In the survey , 87 % predict the Fed will cut the short - term rate by a quarter - percentage point , to 2 % .
Most economists surveyed think the recession will be short and shallow .
Unemployment , one of the hallmarks of a recession , will probably rise to about 6 % , says David Berson , chief economist for the PMI Group .
" That 's pretty low for a recession , " he says A few feel the economy will weaken but not fall into recession .
" A recession , by definition , is a broad - based decline in GDP that lasts more than a few months , " says Ken Mayland of ClearView Economics .
Even if there were a decline in the first quarter , it 's not certain there will be a decline in the second , Mayland says .
Economists think the inflation rate , which in March was 4 % on a year - over - year basis , according to the consumer price index , will decline throughout the rest of the year .
That 's because they also think the economy will slow .
" Recessions usually bring inflation down , " Berson says .
A slower economy means less demand for goods and services , which makes it harder for companies to raise prices .
That does n't mean prices will fall , Berson cautions .
It means they will rise at a slower rate .
Economists say there 's still plenty to worry about .
Allen Sinai , chief global economist for Decision Economics , gives the Federal Reserve top marks for its actions but says many things are outside the Fed 's control — such as the prices of food and oil .
" We think inflation will stay sticky high , " Sinai says .
" It 's driven by forces outside the U.S. "
One big force : the huge demand for food and energy by India and China .
The other big worry : real estate .
" Given the drop in home prices , there 's a big risk that foreclosures will go up more than expected , " Berson says .

Welcome to GreatSeal.com ,
the website all about the extraordinary symbol
that represents the people of the United States of America .
Designed by some of the nation 's most visionary Founders , the two sides of the Great Seal embody the essential guiding principles these farsighted patriots hoped we would always follow .
The actual Great Seal adopted by Congress on June 20 , 1782 is a written document that precisely describes the imagery .
For the past 238 years , the U.S. Department of State has been sealing official documents using engraved dies based on this official description .
The first die is shown here .
( Note : the design is in reverse . )
The government also has official illustrations of the Great Seal 's two sides .
An illustration of a seal is known as a " realization " of its design description .
For generations , the Great Seal has inspired artists to create compelling realizations  graphic links to the revolutionary spirit of the people who gave us our freedom .
18th - century and 21st - century realizations
The Great Seal 's designers provided a brief explanation of its symbolism , however the more we know about its design process and meaning of its symbols and mottoes , the better we can understand why this emblem is as important today as ever before .
It was and still is America 's Vision Statement .

After 14 months of negotiation , New York City has agreed to pay more than $ 21 million to settle a federal class - action discrimination lawsuit filed against the Department of Parks and Recreation and will make “ major changes in certain of its personnel practices ” as part of the settlement , the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund announced today .
The settlement , which is expected to be ratified by Judge Denny Chin in United States District Court in Manhattan , includes $ 11.9 million in back pay and compensatory damages to a group of about 3,500 former and current workers .
“ We decided that it would be better to settle than to litigate , ” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg told reporters at a news conference in Chinatown today .
“ It was something that took place a long time ago and I think we are satisfied that our procedures today in that department , and I think in all departments , do not discriminate against anybody . ”
The settlement could signal the end of a case that dates to 1999 , when 20 black or Hispanic parks workers filed complaints with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission asserting that the department — under the Giuliani administration and the parks commissioner at the time , Henry J. Stern — had illegally discriminated on the basis of race and national origin in assigning and promoting employees .
In February 2001 , the E.E.O.C. found “ reasonable cause ” to believe the discrimination had occurred , clearing the way for the lawsuit .
The suit was a particular blow to Mr. Stern , a colorful former City Council member who served as parks commissioner under Mayor Edward I. Koch and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani , uses the name StarQuest and sends out regular e-mail messages with political commentary through a small nonprofit group he established , New York Civic .
The plaintiffs complained that they were bypassed by promotions because of a recruiting program Mr. Stern had started to recruit young graduates of elite colleges — nearly all of them white — to fill positions in the agency .
Embarrassed by the publicity , the Giuliani administration for a while ordered Mr. Stern to remain silent .
Then , in June 2002 , the Parks Department — now under a new commissioner , Adrian Benepe , reporting to a new mayor , Michael R. Bloomberg — received another blow : a Justice Department lawsuit that accused the agency of of discriminating against black and Hispanic workers for the past seven years by favoring whites for promotions — including those who were part of the special recruiting program .
Time and again , the suit contended , the Parks Department failed to follow any objective guidelines for determining promotions and filling management positions , failed to post notices of job openings , and ” rarely , if ever ” conducted the required interviews for vacancies .
The department said its practices had changed , but documents provided as part of the federal lawsuit detailed the extent of the discriminatory practices .
In June 2005 , the city settled the federal lawsuit , agreeing to broad changes in its promotion practices , including posting job vacancies so that all employees would be aware of them and making promotions on the basis of positive performance evaluations and other proof of merit .
Meanwhile , the original 2001 employees ’ lawsuit , known as Wright v. Stern , continued to drag on .
“ Today ’s settlement is a clear victory for those who were denied equality in the workplace for so long , ” said Theodore M. Shaw , director - counsel and president of the defense fund , which uses the initials L.D.F. and is independent of the NAACP fund .
“ L.D.F. commends the black and Latino workers of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation who stood up to this injustice and had the courage to fight for change . ”
Since December 2006 , the defense fund worked with several lawyers — including Cynthia Rollings of Beldock Levine & Hoffman and Lewis M. Steel — to reach a settlement with the city .
The settlement announced today includes just $ 11.9 million to be distributed to the class of plaintiffs , which includes about 3,500 former and current parks employees ; about $ 8 million in lawyers ’ fees , and about $ 1 million in litigation expenses .
Under the settlement , the city has agreed over the next three years to establish ways for employees to obtain review of salary differences that they believe are discriminatory ; to obtain adjustments in those salaries if disparities are not justified ; to increase pay in certain specific job titles ; to train interviewers to ensure that employees who apply for promotions are treated fairly and objectively ; and to examine the process by which managers are selected in the future .
Robert H. Stroup , head of the economic justice group at the legal defense fund , said the pay disparities arose in large part because the Parks Department had used a system of provisional promotions that often ended up being permanent and were less transparent than promotions made through regular civil service procedures .
The settlement calls for the Parks Department to show greater transparency in promoting managers .
Also , as a result of the settlement , employees feel they are not being paid as much as a colleague for the same work , they will be able to bring the matter to the department for a formal review .
Georgia Pestana , chief of the Labor and Employment Law Division at the city ’s Law Department , said in a statement :
This agreement should not be construed as an admission of wrongdoing by the Parks Department .
The City defended the Parks Department in this litigation for almost a decade , because we do not believe it discriminated or retaliated against its African - American and Hispanic employees .
Nonetheless , the City must evaluate the risks presented by a lengthy , multi- phased trial and seek to attain a result in its best interests .
We believe this proposed settlement achieves that objective .
Mr. Stern , who was parks commissioner from 1983 to 1990 and again from 1994 to 2002 , said in a phone interview today , “ We never practiced discrimination on the basis of race , except for affirmative action . ”
He added , “ We deny any discrimination and thank the corporation counsel . ”
Mr. Stern said of the recruiting program : “ The program was to get young college graduates to work long hours at low salaries .
The problem was you could n’t black graduates to work for $ 22,000 or $ 25,000 , either because they had loans or were offered better jobs by companies that wanted them .
Nonetheless , we never turned one down – we accepted every black graduate that applied to the program .
We went out of our way to recruit at historically black colleges .
Any black employee who wanted to could have asked to be in this program .
None of them asked to because they were being paid more . ”
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China 's northern region of Inner Mongolia is on high alert against a severe flood threat caused by ice blocking the Yellow River during the spring thaw , state media said .
More than 70,000 people in the region were on standby for rescue and disaster relief efforts along the frozen 720 - km ( 450 - mile ) stretch of China 's second longest river , known as " China 's sorrow " for its frequent flooding .
" The People 's Liberation Army 's air force and artillery troops have also joined the flood prevention operation , " Xinhua news agency said .
" Blasting will be carried out if there are any big ice blockages on the river . "
Sections of the river freeze and thaw at different times .
If a blockage persists , water levels may rise and cause flooding and dam bursts , threatening lives and property .
The ice - run phenomenon happens at the start of winter and spring .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
The river 's ice flood was the heaviest in 40 years , Xinhua said .
" Low - quality dams in certain sections have worsened the situation , " it said .
The Yellow River in Inner Mongolia began to melt on Tuesday after a full thawing of the upper stretch in neighboring Ningxia autonomous region .
The 5,464 - km Yellow River originates in Qinghai province in the northwest and flows through Gansu , Ningxia , Inner Mongolia , Shaanxi , Shanxi , Henan and Shandong before emptying into the Bohai Sea .
In Qinghai , 14 Tibetan herdsmen , including a 9 - day - old baby , were rescued on Tuesday after being trapped on a snow - covered mountain for 40 days , Xinhua said .
The herdsmen were well except for a 63 - year - old who suffered snow blindness , according to rescuers .
The baby and his mother were sent to hospital for observation .

They tell us that America is complicit in the " murder of the unborn , " has become " Sodom " by coddling gays , and that our public schools are sinful places full of evolutionists and sex educators hell - bent on corrupting children .
They say , as my dad often did , that we are , " under the judgment of God . "
They call America evil and warn of immanent destruction .
Obama 's minister 's shouted " controversial " comments were very much like things pastors on the right say too .
Dad and I were amongst the founders of the Religious right .
In the 1970s and 1980s , while Dad and I crisscrossed America denouncing our nation 's sins instead of getting in trouble we became darlings of the Republican Party .
( This was while I was my father 's sidekick before I dropped out of the evangelical movement altogether . )
We were rewarded for our " stand " by people such as Congressman Jack Kemp , the Fords , Reagan and the Bush family .
The top Republican leadership depended on preachers and agitators like us to energize their rank and file .
No one called us un-American .
Consider a few passages from my father 's immensely influential America - bashing book A Christian Manifesto .
It sailed under the radar of the major media who , back when it was published in 1980 , were not paying particular attention to best - selling religious books .
Nevertheless it sold more than a million copies .
Here 's
Dad writing in his chapter on civil disobedience :
" If there is a legitimate reason for the use of force [ against the US government ] ... then at a certain point force is justifiable . "
And this :
" In the United States the materialistic , humanistic world view is being taught exclusively in most state schools ...
There is an obvious parallel between this and the situation in Russia [ the USSR ] .
And we really must not be blind to the fact that indeed in the public schools in the United States all religious influence is as forcibly forbidden as in the Soviet Union .... "
Then this :
" There does come a time when force , even physical force , is appropriate ...
A true Christian in Hitler 's Germany and in the occupied countries should have defied the false and counterfeit state .
This brings us to a current issue that is crucial for the future of the church in the United States , the issue of abortion ...
It is time we consciously realize that when any office commands what is contrary to God 's law it abrogates it 's authority .
And our loyalty to the God who gave this law then requires that we make the appropriate response in that situation ... "
I 'm not saying if I agree with Dad here or not .
My point here is n't about Dad or Rev Wright 's words but about the double standard applied to judging them and using them to smear Obama .
Take Dad 's words and put them in the mouth of Obama 's preacher ( or in the mouth of any black American preacher ) and people would be accusing that preacher of treason .
Yet when we of the white Religious Right denounced America white conservative Americans and top political leaders , called our words " godly " and " prophetic " and a " call to repentance . "
My dad 's books denouncing America and comparing the USA to Hitler are still best sellers in the " respectable " evangelical community and he 's still hailed as a prophet by many Republican leaders .
When Mike Huckabee was recently asked by Katie Couric to name one book he'd take with him to a desert island , besides the Bible , he named Dad's Whatever Happened to the Human Race ?
a book where Dad also compared America to Hitler 's Germany .
The hypocrisy of the right attacking Obama , because of his minister 's words , is staggering .
When my late father and I were the guests of Jerry Falwell at Liberty Baptist College , Falwell said to us quite casually and seriously , while speaking of the " homosexual problem , " that : " If I had a dog that did what they do I take it out and shoot it . "
And when it came to saying God was damning America he and Pat Robertson sided with the 9/11 hijackers by saying the terrorist 's actions served America right and were God 's punishment .
Yet John McCain went to Liberty Baptist College and spoke for Falwell , in order to " mend fences " with the Religious Right .
He said he no longer believed that Falwell was " an agent of intolerance . "
And Rudi Giuliani gladly accepted Robertson 's endorsement .
So much for the Republican " mainstream . "
This cuts left too .
Fair is fair .
So where are the clips -- playing incessantly next to Hillary Clinton 's picture -- of her antiwar friends and Bill Clinton 's fellow draft dodger members of the New Left , cursing and damning America during Vietnam War protests and since ?
The company that Bill and Hillary kept in the late 1960s through the 1970s was defined by damning America and sometimes by rooting for the North Vietnamese .
Clinton said he " loathed " the military .
We still made him commander in chief .
Screen shots of the avatar showing two different gestures , based on the human ’s movements .
Credit : Schreer , et al. ©2008 IEEE .
It ’s a little bit like looking in the mirror at your cartoon double , except that the “ reflection ” is an avatar on your computer screen .
Wave your hand , nod your head , speak a sentence , and your avatar does the same .
The technology is already on display at the headquarters of Deutsche Telekom in Bonn , Germany , and at the Deutsche Telekom Laboratories in Berlin .
Visitors can experiment with making gestures and watching comical characters mimic them in real time .
The public feedback is very positive , according to researchers Oliver Schreer , Peter Eisert , and Ralf Tanger , of the Fraunhofer Heinrich - Hertz - Institut in Berlin , and Roman Englert with the Deutsche Telekom Laboratories and Ben Gurion University in Beer - Sheva , Israel .
The team will publish the results of its study on its vision - and speech - driven avatar technology in an upcoming issue of IEEE Transactions on Multimedia .
“ The presented approach allows intuitive , touchless user interaction , ” Schreer told PhysOrg.com .
“ Due to the recognition capabilities , any novel interface can be designed for interactive human - computer interaction . ”
The researchers ’ prototype system is compatible with a normal PC , with the only hardware required being a low - cost Webcam and a pair of standard headphones .
The complete set of audio- visual analysis is performed in real - time , which allows an immediate animation of the virtual character .
To begin , the program would n’t require any training or individual input of gestures .
However , since the system relies on skin color recognition to follow the movements of the hands and head , users must wave their hands around at first to enable the system to determine the individual ’s skin color .
Wearing skin- colored clothing should be avoided .
The system can recognize a set of 66 parameters that define facial expression , and it also contains a set of high - level facial expressions ( such as joy , sadness , surprise , and disgust ) .
Users can also press buttons to manually activate these expressions .
The system also recognizes “ visemes , ” which move the lips in accordance with the phoneme being spoken based on voice analysis .
A set of 15 visemes can represent all phonemes .
The system also recognizes a set of 186 body motion parameters that define joint rotation in the arms and upper body .
The head rotation is detected as well in order to represent head nick , head shake and head roll .
By detecting the positions of fingers , the system can recognize many basic gestures , including many from the American Sign Language alphabet .
Sometimes the avatar ’s hands do n’t exactly mimic the user ’s hands , as the main aim is to make the avatar ’s movements as smooth and natural as possible .
In the future , the researchers plan to apply the system in virtual chat rooms and online call center applications , such as technical support .
In both situations , users are represented by avatars .
The avatars become animated based on the users ’ movements and speech , while maintaining the privacy of the users .
The researchers also hope to integrate the avatar system into mobile devices , where it could serve as a user - friendly interface in addition to touch screens , a stylus , or speech recognition systems .
“ Some aspects like gestures based on hand recognition are already market mature , ” Schreer said .
“ Finger analysis and interpretation are more complicated and may need another one or two years in order to achieve robust algorithms that operate under real - life conditions , i.e. the real environment .
Initial applications are scrolling of menus in cellulars ( e.g. SMS browsing ) and in the medical area for the control of interfaces in operating rooms . ”

Holly Robinson Peete's Mega Charity Super Bowl Events
Actressand her husband , are pulling out all the stops when it comes to throwing some mega Super Bowl parties to benefit charity .
The former NFL quarterback and TV host is one half of the power couple that own a magnificent estate in Phoenix .
Rockridge Estates will be a happening place from Thursday through Super Bowl Sunday .
Following his retirement from football , Peete became one of the hosts of Fox Sports talk show The Best Damn Sports Show .
Holly Peete is an actress , singer and author .
She published two books in 2006 ; Get Your Own Damn Beer , I'm Watching the Game ! and A Woman 's Guide to Pro Football .
Private parties include the crew from The Best Damn Super Bowl Party Period featuring rapper Ludacris .
There will be a live concert by Chris Rock and a huge celebrity party hosted by actress Jenny McCarthy .
The palatial home will be open to guests who are willing to purchase tickets ranging from $ 300 to $ 1,000 .
The residence can hold up to 2,000 people for any of the planned events .
People will be shuttled to the remote location in an attempt to stay in the good graces of the neighbors , who have also thoughtfully been invited .
The Peete's are hoping to raise a great deal of money for their Hollyrod Foundation , established in 1992 .
For the past nine years , the couple has hosted a party in whatever host city the Super Bowl landed , with proceeds going to their foundation .
They have raised anywhere from $ 250,000 to $ 2 million in previous years .
The Hollyrod Foundation provides medical , physical and emotional support for those suffering from debilitating life circumstances , including Parkinson 's Disease .
Another charity that will benefit from the weekend events will be Southwest Autism Research & Resource Center .
The Peete 's oldest son has autism .
The difference this year is that the venue is their personal home .
The Frank Lloyd Wright inspired home sits on 12 acres , complete with it's own 18 hole executive golf course and a brook with waterfalls .
The home is scarcely seen from passersby , and most people are n't aware of it 's presence .
That is likely to change after this weekend .
Frontline 's Timid Iraq Retrospective Frontline ’s “ Bush ’s War ” on PBS Monday and Tuesday evening was a nicely put - together rehash of the top players ’ trickery that led to the attack on Iraq , together with the power - grabbing , back - stabbing and limitless incompetence of the occupation .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly Except for an inside - the - beltway tidbit here and there – for example , about how the pitiable Secretary of State Colin Powell had to suffer so many indignities at the hands of other type - A hard chargers – Frontline added little to the discussion .
Notably missing was any allusion to the unconscionable role of the Fourth Estate as indiscriminate cheerleader for the home team , nor any mention that the invasion was a serious violation of international law .
But those omissions , I suppose , should have come as no surprise .
Nor was it a surprise that any viewer hoping for insight into why Cheney and Bush were so eager to attack Iraq was left with very thin gruel .
It was more infotainment , bereft of substantive discussion of the whys and wherefores of what in my view is the most disastrous foreign policy move in our nation ’s history .
Despite recent acknowledgements from the likes of Alan Greenspan , Gen. John Abizaid and others that oil and permanent ( or , if you prefer , “ enduring ” ) military bases were among the main objectives , Frontline avoided any real discussion of such delicate factors .
Someone not already aware of how our media has become a tool of the Bush administration might have been shocked at how Frontline could have missed one of President George W. Bush ’s most telling “ signing statements . ”
Underneath the recent Defense Authorization
Act , he wrote that he did not feel bound by the law ’s specific prohibitions : “ (1 ) To establish any military installation or base for the purpose of providing for the permanent stationing of United States Armed Forces in Iraq , ” or
“ (2 ) To exercise United States control of the oil resources of Iraq . ”
So the Frontline show was largely pap .
At one point , however , the garrulous former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage did allude to one of the largest elephants in the living room – Israel ’s far - right Likudniks – and their close alliance with the so - called neo-conservatives running our policy toward the Middle East .
But Armitage did so only tangentially , referring to the welcome ( if totally unrealistic ) promise by Ahmed Chalabi that , upon being put in power in Baghdad , he would recognize Israel .
Not surprisingly , the interviewer did not pick up on that comment ; indeed , I ’m surprised the remark avoided the cutting room floor .
Courage No Longer a Frontline Hallmark Frontline has done no timely reportage that might be looked upon as disparaging the Bush administration – I mean , for example , the real aims behind the war , not simply the gross incompetence characterizing its conduct .
Like so many others , Frontline has been , let ’s just say it , cowardly in real time — no doubt intimidated partly by attacks on its funding that were inspired by the White House .
And now ?
Well the retrospective criticism of incompetence comes as polling shows two - thirds of the country against the Iraq occupation ( and the number is surely higher among PBS viewers ) .
So , Frontline is repositioning itself as a mild ex-post - facto critic of the war , but still unwilling to go very far out on a limb .
Explaining the aims behind war crimes can , of course , be risky .
It is as though an invisible Joseph Goebbels holds sway .
On Monday evening I found myself initially applauding Frontline ’s matter - of - fact , who - shot - John chronology of how our country got lied into attacking and occupying Iraq .
Then I got to thinking – have I not seen this picture before ?
Many times ?
It took a Hollywood producer to recognize and act on the con games that sober observers could not miss as the war progressed :
Where were the celebrated “ weapons of mass destruction ” ( WMD ) ?
Robert Greenwald simply could not abide the president ’s switch to “ weapons of mass destruction programs , ” which presumably might be easier to find than the much - ballyhooed WMD so heavily advertised before the attack on Iraq .
You remember – those remarkable WMD about which UN chief inspector Hans Blix quipped that the U.S. had 100 percent certainty of their existence in Iraq , but zero percent certainty as to where they were .
Robert Greenwald called me in May 2003 .
He had read a few of the memoranda published by Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity ( VIPS ) exposing the various charades being acted out by the administration and wanted to know what we thought of the president ’s new circumlocution on WMD .
I complimented him on smelling a rat and gave him names of my VIPS colleagues and other experienced folks who could fill him in on the details .
Wasting no time , he arrived here in Washington in June , armed simply with copious notes and a cameraman .
Greenwald conducted the interviews , flew back to his eager young crew in Hollywood and , poof , the DVD “ Uncovered : The War on Iraq ” was released at the beginning of November 2003 .
So Frontline is four and a half years behind a Hollywood producer with appropriate interest and skepticism .
( Full disclosure : I appear in “ Uncovered , ” as do many of the interviewees appearing in Frontline ’s “ Bush ’s War . ” )
Actually , the interviewing by Frontline occurred just a few months later .
I know because I was among those interviewed for that as well , as was my good friend and former colleague at the CIA , Mel Goodman .
I was struck that Mel looked four years younger on this week ’s Frontline .
It only then dawned on me that he was four years younger when interviewed .
Have a look at “ Uncovered , ” [ http://www.truthuncovered.com/index.php ] and see how you think it compares to Frontline ’s “ Bush ’s War . ”
Safety in Retrospectives
It also struck me that producing a Frontline - style retrospective going back several years is a much less risky genre to work with .
Chalk it up to my perspective as an intelligence analyst , but ducking the incredibly important issues at stake over the next several months is , in my opinion , unconscionable .
The troop “ surge ” in Iraq , for example .
Only toward the very end of the program does Frontline allow a bit of relevant candor on a point that has been self - evident since Cheney and Bush , against strong opposition from Generals Abizaid and Casey ( and apparently even Rumsfeld ) , decided to double down by sending 30,000 more troops into Iraq .
A malleable new Secretary of Defense [ Robert Gates ] would deal with the recalcitrant generals and pick a Petreaus ex Machina of equal malleability and political astuteness to implement this stop - gap plan .
One of the last Frontline interviewees concedes that the purpose of the “ surge ” was to stave off definitive defeat in Iraq , so that Bush ’s war could be handed off to his successor somewhat intact .
( Even that seems doubtful at this point . )
“ That decision [ to order the ‘ surge ’ ] at a minimum guaranteed that his [ Bush ’s ] presidency would not end with a defeat in history ’s eyes , that by committing to the ‘ surge ’ he was certain to at least achieve a stalemate , ” said journalist and author Steve Coll .
Okay , a small kudo to Frontline for including that bit of truth – however obvious .
Rather Not , Thank You Intimidation of the media is what has happened all around , including with Frontline , which not so many years ago was able to do some gutsy reporting .
Let me give you another example about which few are aware .
Do you remember when Dan Rather made his Apologia Pro Vita Sua , admitting that the American media , including him , was failing to reveal the truth about things like Iraq ?
Speaking to the BBC on May 16 , 2002 , Rather compared the situation to the fear of “ necklacing ” in South Africa .
" It 's an obscene comparison , " Rather said , " but there was a time in South Africa when people would put flaming tires around peoples ' necks if they dissented .
In some ways , the fear is that you will be necklaced here , you will have a flaming tire of lack of patriotism put around your neck . "
Talking to another reporter , Dan told it straight about the careerism that keeps U.S. journalists in line : " It 's that fear that keeps [ American ] journalists from asking the toughest of the tough questions and to continue to bore - in on the tough questions so often . "
The comparison to “ necklacing ” may be “ obscene ” but , sadly , it is not far off the mark .
So what happened to the newly outspoken Dan Rather with the newly found courage , when he ran afoul of Vice President Dick Cheney and the immense pressure he exerts on the corporate media ?
We know about the lies and the cheerleading for attacking Iraq .
But there is much more most of us do not know and remain unable to learn if Rather and other journalists keep acting the part of the lion in the Wizard of Oz , before he gets his courage .
For Dan Rather , the fear would simply not go away – even after leaving CBS for HDNet and promising that , on his new “ Dan Rather Reports ” show , viewers would see hard - hitting and courageous reporting that he said he could n’t do at CBS .
Will it surprise you that Dan Rather can not shake the necklace ?
I refer specifically to a program for “ Dan Rather Reports , ” meticulously prepared by award - winning producer , Kristina Borjesson .
The special included interviews with an impressive string of first - hand witnesses to neocon machinations prior to the U.S. attack on Iraq , and provides real insights into motivations – the kind of insights Frontline did not even attempt .
Nipped in the Bud Last year Borjesson ’s taping was finished and the editing had begun .
Borjesson ’s requests to interview people working for the vice president had been denied .
But , following standard journalistic practice ( not to mention common courtesy ) , she sent an e-mail to John Hannah in Cheney ’s office in order to give Hannah a chance to react to what others – including several of the same senior folks on Frontline last evening – had said about him for her forthcoming report .
At that point all hell broke loose .
Borjesson was abruptly told by Rather ’s executive producer that by sending the e-mail , Borjesson could have “ brought down the whole ( ‘ Dan Rather Reports ’ ) operation . ”
The show was killed and Borjesson sacked .
For good measure , she was also accused of “ coaching ” interview subjects and taking their words out of context .
Since neither Rather nor his executive producer would provide proof to substantiate that allegation , Borjesson took the unprecedented step of sending her script and transcripts to all her interview subjects and asking them to confirm or deny that she had coached them or taken their words out of context .
Not one of them found her script inaccurate or said they were coached .
She has the e-mails to prove this .
This sorry episode and Frontline ’s careful avoidance of basic issues like the strategic aims of the Bush administration in invading and occupying Iraq are proof , if further proof were needed , that the White House , and especially Cheney ’s swollen office , exert enormous pressure over what we are allowed to see and hear .
The fear they instill in the corporate press , and in what once was serious investigative reporting of programs like Frontline , translates into programs getting neutered or killed outright – and massive public ignorance .
Some consolation is to be found in the good news that , in this particular case , Kristina Borjesson is made of stronger stuff ; she has not given up , and was greatly encouraged by how many of the very senior officials and former officials she had already interviewed consented to be re-interviewed ( since the tapes belonged to the “ Rather Not ” folks ) .
Now who looks forward to being re-interviewed ?
Borjesson ’s original interviewees took into account her problems with the cowards and the censors – and her atypical , gutsy refusal to self - censor – and went the extra mile .
A tribute to them as well , and their interest in getting the truth out .
Borjesson is now completing the program on her own .
Look for an announcement in the coming months , if you ’re interested in real sustenance rather than the pabulum served up , no doubt under duress , by Frontline .
Ray McGovern works with Tell the Word , the publishing arm of the ecumenical Church of the Saviour in inner-city Washington , DC .
He was an Army infantry / intelligence officer in the early sixties , then a CIA analyst for 27 years .
He now serves on the Steering Group of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity ( VIPS ) .

Known as the " Shameless " family among horrified neighbours , the McFaddens " boast " three generations of adults who are not working .
All ten members of the clan share a council house and live off benefits amounting to around £ 32,000 a year .
And very happy they are , too .
Matriarch is grandmother Sue McFadden , 54 .
" Our neighbours are so snobby - they call us the " Shameless " family and say that we ought to go out to work .
But how can we work when we have all these children to look after ?
Scroll down for more ...
Jean Thompson , right , with son Steven and granddaughter Jessica , who says : ' It is my right to claim benefits ' .
All ten members of her family share a three - bedroom council house
" The only problem is , " she says without a hint of irony , " that we 're living in a three - bedroom council house , which is ridiculous .
" I'm asking the council for a ten - bedroom home for all of us .
We need more space .
It 's awful sometimes when all the children are squabbling .
Still , we do have a big TV with Sky , but we need some relaxation . "
Of course they do , poor lambs .
What a damning verdict on our claim - it - all society , a grotesque mirror of the dark television drama Shameless .
That show features fictional father - of - eight Frank , who is work - shy and self - pitying .
Living on the Chatsworth Estate , he heads a family of dysfunctional teenagers living on an estate of benefit claimants and cheats .
The McFaddens bear an uncanny resemblance .
Grandmother
Sue is divorced and has three daughters , Theresa , 34 , Debbie , 32 , and Tammy , 24 .
None of the adults living in the house in Ellesmere Port , near Chester , has a job , and there are also six grandchildren living at home - Kyle , 18 , Clayton , 12 , Tyler , nine , Courtney , eight , Jodie , seven , and Lucas , six .
But the really disturbing aspect of the McFaddens ' lifestyle is that they are far from alone .
Six million Britons are living in homes where no one has a job and " benefits are a way of life " , according to a report by MPs .
Shock figures also revealed that 20,000 households in Britain are pocketing more than £ 30,000 a year in state benefits .
With thousands of children growing up in families where their parents and grandparents have never worked , a senior government adviser warned this week of a " terrible legacy " of youngsters who had no expectation of ever getting a job .
Sue herself is defiant .
" People do n't understand how hard it is to keep a family like this going - no wonder we can't work .
How could I go out to work with all these children at home ?
Local people call us scroungers and that is so unfair .
We need the money to keep the family going .
" We get about £ 2,700 a month in benefits , from income support to disability allowance , and child benefit for the kids .
Kyle is at college and he gets the Education Maintenance Allowance of £ 30 a week , and we get Housing Benefit , too .
Our rent is £ 40 a week , so our benefits do n't go far . "
Jean Thompson , 66 , has n't worked for over 40 years .
She lives in Neath , Swansea , with husband Glyn , 61 , a retired plumber .
They have three grown - up children , two of whom live on benefits , including son Steven Martin , 39 .
Jean says : " My own dad worked down the pit , but my mum did n't work , so I suppose I wanted the same life that she had when I grew up .
I just wanted to be at home and live off other people .
" I left school at 15 with no qualifications and worked in a sewing factory for a short while then gave it up and went on the dole instead .
Even when my kids were older , I did n't go back to work because I did n't want to .
I never get bored .
I just sew , knit and clean .
" I do n't worry about the example I set to my kids or the fact that two of them do n't work .
It 's up to them
what they do , it 's their life , not mine , so it 's not my problem .
I do n't think my desire never to work and to live off the state and my husband rubbed off on Steven .
He makes his own decisions .
" I 'm certainly not angry that Steven does n't have a job .
He 's got children , that 's his job .
And I do n't worry that he 's setting a bad example to his children - that 's up to him . "
Scroll down for more ...
Steven left school 23 years ago and has worked for only five years in that time .
It 's 12 years since he last had a job .
Steven lives in Swansea with partner Donna , 24 , who 's never worked , and their daughter Celsea , three .
His eldest daughter from a previous partner , 17 - year - old Jessica , is also on benefits .
Steven says : " Mum never really made us think about work .
I did do a plumbing YTS scheme after school .
They paid £ 27 a week , but it was so boring looking at pipes and sinks all day .
When I told my dad I was bored , he said I should never stick with a job I did n't like .
" So , eventually , in my 20s , I thought : " I 've tried security work and plumbing and I 've even been a taxi driver for six months , but I just do n't like working " .
My mates all left school and became mechanics , sweating it out in stinking , dirty garages for a couple of hundred quid a week .
" I 'm much better off than any of them .
The highlight of their day is going to the bakery to get a pasty for lunch and they 've aged 20 years from the stress of working for a pittance and being stuck indoors all day .
It 's my right to claim benefits .
We 're all entitled to do what we want in life .
" I could have trained as a fireman or something , but I did n't want the responsibility .
All I 've ever wanted is to chill out and have easy money .
All my family and friends live in council houses - my parents included . "
Steven 's daughter Jessica left school last year without any qualifications and has been claiming benefits since .
She says : " It 's fine that my mum and dad do n't work .
I 'm not ashamed or anything .
" But I suppose if they did both have jobs then I 'd have grown up seeing them going to work and earning money and realised how you go about getting work and holding down a job .
That would have made me more likely to leave school and want to get a job straight away .
But they 've both managed OK on benefits .
" Because my gran , Jean , did n't work either then I suppose it 's just normal in our family not to have jobs .
" I do n't like the idea of having to be bossed around at work and I do n't want to go to college or anything because I like to stay in bed in the morning .
In the meantime , it 's my right to claim benefits .
One day I 'd like a council flat . "
Heady ambition indeed .
But is it inevitable that generation upon generation of unemployed families just follow their parents into lives of idle nihilism ?
Is it the fault of a system which offers benefits too easily - or the fault of parents who fail to encourage their children to aspire or succeed ?
Claire Halsey , a consultant clinical psychologist , says : " We are creatures of habit .
We take most of our cues from our parents .
Most of us repeat the patterns of our families , and also take on values of families .
If parents value working , children are more likely to value it and strive for it themselves .
" If it becomes entirely normal for parents to get up late and not expect to work , this becomes entirely normal for their children too .
" If you do n't see your parents get up , get dressed for work and go out , you do n't have a set routine in the day .
It becomes very difficult to shift from being unstructured into the discipline of work .
" There are also issues with motivation .
When you are unqualified and have very few skills , you tend to be in jobs that are more dull and mechanical , and have to accept a high degree of direction and authority from the employer .
If that is n't your ethos , if you have n't accepted authority at home or in school , you tend to rebel and fail in the workplace . "
Certainly , Emma Sussock 's life is a grim blueprint set out by the generations before her .
Her mother Ann , a divorcee , has n't worked for 30 years , and exists on benefits and daytime television .
Meanwhile , her beloved step - grandfather Carl Davies , a former gas fitter , has survived on benefits since a heart attack 20 years ago .
Emma , 19 , lives in a one - room council refuge , existing on benefit handouts as she raises her two - year - old daughter .
It is the same as her mother Ann 's life before her .
Ann , a divorcee , lives in a one - bedroom council flat in West Derby , Liverpool .
She says : " When I left school at 16 with no qualifications I did a youth training type scheme for a year , serving up meals at the local YMCA for about £ 25 a week .
Then I went on benefits and have n't come off them since .
I did n't enjoy the work .
" I was n't encouraged to work hard by my parents and lots of my friends went straight onto benefits , so I did the same .
I live in a one - bed council flat , but the £ 54 - a - week rent is paid for by the authorities .
I also get £ 118 a fortnight jobseeker 's allowance and I have to pay for my food and bills .
" It 's a real struggle .
I spend £ 10 a week on cigarettes , but I can't afford to go out and I have n't got lots of expensive gadgets , just a portable TV in my lounge .
Watching TV is all I do most days .
I watch the soaps and The Jeremy Kyle Show .
I 'm used to this way of life now . "
But what aspirations does this mother have for her own daughter to break free of the poverty trap ?
Ann shrugs : " When Emma was at school , I 'd try to encourage her to work harder than I did , but I do n't suppose I was a very good role model .
" All my friends , and her friends ' parents , were on benefits , too , so she did n't know any different .
She used to play truant and I was n't very happy about that , but it's what everyone her age did .
" She 's busy being a mum to Codie now , so she can't be expected to work , but I hope that one day she 'll get herself a council house . "
Emma Sussock 's grandfather Carl also lives on benefits , but he at least has a dream : that his grand - daughter does n't waste her life in a haze of unemployment and handouts .
Carl , 69 , says with a sigh : " I just hope she does n't follow her mates into a life on benefits .
" We seem to be left with a whole generation of young people today who think it 's OK to live off the state .
The worth ethic that my generation grew up with has died .
My dad was a bricklayer , my mum stayed at home and I was brought up to work hard .
I left school at 16 to take on an apprenticeship as a gas fitter .
" I enjoyed the structure of going to work and earning my own money .
In those days people would do anything to earn a living and put food on the able for their families .
" One winter in the early Sixties we were n't able to work as gas fitters for eight weeks because the snow was so bad .
We queued for hours at the National Assistance Board , the equivalent of the JobCentre now , but came away with just 50 p in benefits .
That was incentive for the other men and me to work shifting snow for the council to earn more money .
" When I had to give up work due to ill health , after a heart attack 20 years ago , life changed drastically .
Suddenly I was claiming sickness benefits that were worth about £ 52 a week compared to the £ 200 to £ 400 a week I 'd been earning as a gas fitter .
I had to stop smoking , going to the pub or playing golf .
" My wife Lily and I had to sell our house and move into the council house where I still live .
I 'd have given anything to go back to work . "
Carl thinks the Government have simply made it too easy for people not to work .
He says : " I do n't blame myself for Ann not working .
Even if she tried to get a job , she'd be looking at jobs paying the minimum wage , which is not as much as she claims in benefits .
It 's the Government 's fault : benefits are too generous . "
But is the Government to blame for Ann Sussock 's reluctance to tear herself away from daytime television ?
She says with a shrug : " I 've not worked for 30 years , so it 's not really a big deal . "
And what of Emma , tragically bright and animated ?
She says : " My mates and I were too busy having a laugh at school to care about working and when I left I did n't have any GCSEs .
We 'd bunk off school , hang around in the town or the local park .
Mum was cross , but that did n't bother me .
" Do I think my mum is a bad example because she 's always lived on benefits ?
Maybe if she had worked then I 'd have been more likely to get a job straight from school because it would have seemed normal .
" But the truth is when I left school I could n't be bothered to work .
There was n't anything I wanted to do other than be a singer .
I got pregnant not long after , but the father 's never been around .
Now I get £ 100 a week in benefits , income support , child benefit and tax credits .
" In some ways , I wish I could go out and get a job because I 'd love to be able to afford to go out with my mates , buy clothes and take Codie on holiday or to the zoo .
But I think it would be harder if I was working because I 'd only get a job paying the minimum wage , yet I 'd have to pay my own rent then , so I 'd have nothing left .
But I do want a better life for Codie and me . "
It 's too early to tell what the future holds for Codie , as his family shambles around him , claiming benefits and living off the State .
One can only hope that when he grows up , he 'll consider it shameful rather than Shameless .
The European Commission has announced the indefinite postponement of an EU deal due to be signed with Serbia , blaming " obstruction " by the country 's nationalist Prime Minister , Vojislav Kostunica .
Olli Rehn , the Enlargement commissioner , said yesterday : " I very much regret we have to postpone [ today 's ] signing of the political agreement . "
He said he regretted " the obstruction by certain politicians in Belgrade in blocking the signature " .
He added : " They have really failed to hear the choice of the Serbian people , " a reference to Mr Kostunica .
It took just days after the re-election of the pro-European President , Boris Tadic , for Serbia to plunge into a deep crisis over the signing of the co-operation deal with the EU , viewed by nationalists as a " trick " to persuade the nation to recognise the independence of Kosovo .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Kostunica repeated his rejection of the deal on Tuesday , calling it a " deception " .
He bluntly linked it to Monday 's EU decision to approve a police and justice mission for Kosovo .
Mr Kostunica said in a statement : " The political agreement that the EU has proposed while it deploys a mission to dismember our country is a deception ...
By signing , Serbia would indirectly recognise the independence of Kosovo . "
Serbia strongly opposes the imminent independence of Kosovo , which is backed by the EU and US and is due to be declared by the end of the month .
But Mr Tadic promised Serbian co-operation with the EU , regardless of the Kosovo issue .
Mr Kostunica 's dramatic combination of the two issues was widely exploited by nationalist sections of the public and official media .
Hardline nationalists say the signing of the deal would amount to " treason " , but the political analyst Misa Brkic said : " This manoeuvre has the aim to trick people and to bring reforms to a standstill . "
EU foreign ministers offered the political co-operation deal last week , only days before Serbia 's presidential election .
It includes improved political dialogue , free trade , visa relaxation and co-operation in education with Serbia .
It does not mention Kosovo at all .
The deal was viewed as an incentive for Serbia to create closer ties with the EU in light of the fact that it is still not able to sign the EU 's Stabilisation and Association Agreement because it has failed to arrest some war crimes suspects .
But Mr Kostunica linked it to the EU 's view on Kosovo and insisted it be taken before parliament .
However , the parliamentary speaker , Oliver Dulic , refused to take up the issue until there was a clear government position to debate .
The Foreign minister , Vuk Jeremic , a member of Mr Tadic 's Democratic Party , said : " This is an exceptionally serious situation , the government is paralysed . "
By Bernard Weiner , The Crisis Papers
Most of the books I 've read about the awfulness of the Bush presidency remind me of the old story about the blind men trying to figure out what an elephant looks like .
Each one feels the part in front of him and describes the elephant within that singular context .
The blind men's descriptions are correct but they do n't really capture " elephant - ness , " the totality of what such an animal might be .
" The Shock Doctrine " by The Nation / Guardian writer Naomi Klein gets the pieces of the elephant right , but , more importantly , the book displays the author 's deep understanding of the dangerous political / economic philosophies that undergird U.S. domestic and foreign policy .
In this , " The Shock Doctrine " is the most compelling , intelligent , meticulously researched and wholistic book I 've yet read about how the U.S. , over the past fifty years , got itself into the unholy mess it 's in today .
A large part of Klein 's book , as you might guess , involves the catastrophe that is Iraq and the " war on terror " in general .
But those military misadventures , she says , are but symptoms of the more all - encompassing ideological mindset that breeds the reckless policies being pursued today both domestically and internationally .
PROFITEERING ON HUMAN TRAGEDYM
In the main , that ideology rests on a narrow , greed - oriented economic and political philosopy that barely recognizes the concept of a " public good . "
Instead , the goal is what can be gained by private corporations and individuals if the " public good " is removed from the equation so that " free market " forces are permitted to act unconstrained .
The idea is to return to some imagined " clean slate " where those free - market forces can be allowed to do their stuff absent governmental interference and oversight .
The economic " shock therapy " visited upon developing Latin American countries and the Iraq War / Occupation provide just two examples of such human intervention .
Often , however , Mother Nature through earthquakes , hurricanes , floods , etc. wipes the slate clean so that the greed paradigm can be allowed to flourish by removing ( usually poorer ) residents who get in the way of corporate desires .
Klein incisively and movingly relates the tale of what happened in Sri Lanka in the wake of the tsunami disaster , where the local fishing villages were turned into luxurious tourist sites by money - hungry government officials in cahoots with Western developers .
( Page 385 )
Klein uses the term " disaster capitalism " to refer to these " orchestrated raids on the public sphere in the wake of catastrophic events , " where the forces of greed view such tragedies " as exciting market opportunities . " ( p.6 ) She quotes a Republican leader in Louisiana : " We finally cleaned up public housing in New Orleans .
We could n't do it , but God did . "
Katrina , Klein says , is a clear example of the new " preferred method of advancing corporate goals : using moments of collective trauma to engage in radical social and economic engineering . " ( p.8 )
In short , in " disaster capitalism " there are huge profits to be made from other peoples ' misery , and since the welfare of the public is of no import in this economic / political theory , all that is needed for full control and enhanced profits are ways to optimally manage that misery .
MAN - MADE TRAUMA AND CHAOS
If nature does n't provide that trauma , humans can .
According to Klein , that 's what " Shock & Awe " was all about in Iraq and which will be used in other attacks as well .
The idea is to traumatize an entire culture through death , destruction , deprivation , fright , and often torture .
One U.S. entrepreneur in Iraq stated it baldly : " fear and disorder offer real promise " in the marketplace .
( p.9 ) This is reminiscent of Condoleezza Rice 's famous comment after 9/11 that the terrorist tragedy offerred conservatives a good " opportunity " to move quickly on their business and political agendas .
Much of the rationale for this type of thinking was born from Milton Friedman 's economic model developed at the University of Chicago in the 1950s and beyond .
Klein , oddly enough , does n't even mention the complementary teaching by political philosopher Leo Strauss , the Machavellian godfather of neo-conservative extremism , who also was on the Chicago faculty ; many of Strauss ' students became key players in the CheneyBush Administration .
Strauss in a nutshell : grab what you can get by whatever means necessary .
While Friedman 's tough , corporate model can be , and has been , imposed on democratic cultures , Klein notes , " authoritarian conditions are required for the implementation of its true vision . " ( p.11 ) And thus aggressive , tough strictures are often employed , often by dictators or invading armies or world financial institutions .
In non-dictatorships , government ( which takes its cues from public clamor for services ) must be effectively neutered or " hollowed - out " over time .
The aim is to privatize as many of those public - need functions as possible , so that huge amounts of money can be made and , as it happens , healthy chunks of that cash can then be funnelled back into party coffers to aid proponents of free - markets to stay in office and expand their power base .
( Conservative activist Grover Norquist aims for the day when government will be shrunken to the point that it can be " drowned in a bathtub . " )
In the Bush Administration , Klein writes , " the war profiteers are n't just clamoring to get access to government , they are the government ; there is no distinction between the two . " ( p. 314 )
PRIVATIZING GOVERNMENT ITSELF
As we have seen time and time again in the Bush Administration , virtually every possible government function is outsourced to corporate contractors , often with no bidding for those contracts .
The middle - class and poor get stomped on and squeezed , but the corporate behemoths and multinationals -- the Bechtels and Halliburtons and Blackwaters and KPMGs -- make out like bandits .
Graft and corruption are built into the system , with billions simply disappearing into corporate black holes , with the Administration conveniently looking the other way .
And the general public , of course , winds up paying for all this transfer of wealth and is left holding the bag in the form of lack of spending on public needs and infrastructure upkeep and a huge debt burdening future generations .
" A more accurate term for a system that erases the boundaries between Big Government and Big Business is not liberal , conservative or capitalist but corporatist , " writes Klein . ( p. 87 ) ( Mussolini described this amalgam of government and business as fascism . )
" Its main characteristics are huge transfers of public wealth to private hands , often accompanied by exploding debt , an ever - widening chasm between the dazzling rich and the disposable poor , and an aggressive nationalism that justifies bottomless spending on security .
...
Other features of the corporatist state tend to include aggressive surveillance ( once again , with government and large corporations trading favors and contracts ) , mass incarceration , shrinking civil liberties and often , though not always , torture . " ( p. 15 )
At times , Klein seems to be suggesting that such behaviors are but unfortunate and accidental by - products of over - zealous free - marketeers , but mostly she leans in the direction of a conscious conspiracy on the part of the corporatist manipulators of the economy and body politic .
For example , she says , " the extreme tactics on display in Iraq and New Orleans are often mistaken for the unique incompetence or cronyism of the Bush White House .
In fact , Bush 's exploits merely represent the monstrously violent and creative culmination of a fifty - year campaign for total corporate liberation . " ( p.19 )
LATIN AMERICA AS CHICAGO LAB
Milton Friedman 's economic model , engineered by his former students ( Klein calls them the " Chicago Boys " ) placed in key countries around the world , rested upon , to use Friedman 's words , inflicting " painful shocks : only ' bitter medicine ' could clear those distortions and bad patterns out of the way . " ( p. 50 ) But time after time when economic shock therapies were tried out in the real world -- downsizing government , eliminating millions of jobs , deregulation of industries , etc. -- the resulting social chaos and dislocation were so horrific that the experiments had to be trimmed back or reconfigured , often using the very Keynesian mixed - economy approaches that are anathema to the Friedmanites .
The first public laboratory for Friedman 's drastic economic model was Latin America in the '50s and '60s and then beyond : Iran , Indonesia , former colonies in Afria , etc .
But , says Klein , rather than encourage and bring democracy to Guatamala , Brazil , Argentina , Chile , et al. , the result was the CIA - engineered " overthrow of democracy in country after country .
And it did not bring peace but required the systematic murder of tens of thousands and the torture of between 100,000 and 150,000 people . " ( p. 102 )
Iraq , she indicates , is merely the latest manifestation of what happens when private profit and private power are the be-alls and end - alls of government policy , complemented by imperial hegemony resting on a belief in American " exceptionalism . "
" As proto - disaster capitalists , the architects of the War on Terror are part of a different breed of corporate - politicians from their predecesors , one for whom wars and other disasters are indeed ends in themselves .
...
That 's because what is unquestionably good for the bottom line of these companies is cataclysm -- wars , epidemics , natural disasters and resource shortages .
...
Public service is reduced to little more than a reconnaissance mission for future work in the disaster capitalism complex . " ( p. 311 )
SHOCKING & AWING IN IRAQ
Nowhere is this more evident that in Iraq , which contains all four of those calamities ( war , epidemics , natural disasters and resource shortages ) in one convenient location :
" After the crusade had conquered Latin America , Africa , Eastern Europe and Asia , the Arab world called out as its final frontier ...
The architects of this invasion were firm believers in the shock doctrine -- they knew that while Iraqis were consumed with daily emergencies , the country could be discreetly auctioned off and the results announced as a done deal . "
>>
" The architects of the war surveyed the global aresenal of shock tactics and decided to go with all of them -- blitzkrieg military bombardment supplemented with elaborate psychological operations , followed up with the fastest and most sweeping political and economic shock therapy program attempted anywhere , backed up , if there was any resistance , by rounding up those who resisted and subjecting them to ' gloves - off ' abuse ...[ an ] experiment in mass torture for months . " ( p. 331 )
Torture and the other dislocations usually occur early as a demonstration model ; the extreme maltreatment is not aimed solely or sometimes even mainly at those persons tortured or killed , but are designed to stimulate a general sense of chaos and fright and to " destroy the parts of society that those people represent , " such as resisters , political activists , or labor organizers .
( p. 101 )
So why did the U.S. Occupation go so badly ?
One could name a host of reasons , but certainly a huge one is an obvious blind spot in the theory of American exceptionalism :
" It was this theft of Iraq 's reconstruction funds from Iraqis , justified by unquestioned , racist assumptions about U.S. superiority and Iraqi inferiority -- and not merely the generic demons of ' corruption ' and ' incompetence ' -- that doomed the project from the start .
( p. 347 ) ...
It was straight - up corporate gorging on state coffers . " ( p. 355 )
" [ The Bush Administration} had commissioned a kind of country - in - a - box , designed in Virginia and Texas , to be assembled in Iraq .
... Iraqis did not see the corporate reconstruction as ' a gift ' : most saw it as a modernized form of pillage , " in cahoots with a corrupted Iraqi government bureaucracy .
( p. 347 ) At that point , a huge number of those disenchanted , angry Iraqis joined the armed rebels .
RENTING -BACK ESSENTIAL SERVICES
So what lies in store for the future , now that so many major countries are little more than national - security police states , with their traditional governmental public - service functions outsourced or otherwise " disappeared " ?
Klein looks into her crystal ball :
>>
" The next phase of the disaster capitalism complex is all too clear : with emergencies on the rise , government no longer able to foot the bill , and citizens stranded by their can 't - do state , the parallel corporate state will rent back its own disaster infrastructure to whomever can afford it , at whatever price the market will bear .
For sale will be everything from helicopter rides off rooftops to drinking water to beds in shelters . " ( p. 319 ) Blackwater providing armed guards in post - Katrina New Orleans was just the tip of the iceberg ( p. 421 ) , or Sandy Spring , GA. , where the entire city government is run by the private corporation CH2M Hill .
>>" But the [ disaster ] industry has far greater ambitions , including privatized global communication networks , emergency health and electricity ... the contracting - out of police and fire departments to private security companies ... and the ability to locate and provide transportation for a global workforce in the midst of a major disaster .
... [ We are witnessing ] the expansion of the narrow military - industrial complex into the sprawling disaster capitalism complex .
Today , global instability does not just benefit a small group of arms dealers ; it generates huge profits for the high - tech security sector , for heavy construction , for private health - care companies treating wounded soldiers , for the oil and gas sectors -- and of course for defense contractors . " ( p. 420 )
And the stock markets reflect that reality , rising as disasters occur .
Says Klein : " Shock - therapy ' reforms ' have been the crack cocaine of financial markets . " ( p. 87 )
COUNTERING THE GREED MERCHANTS
Can anything be done to counter the rise of the national - security / disaster - capitalism states ?
Klein says the blowback is already happening against disaster - capitalism all over the globe , but is most clearly evident in Latin America where leaders and populations are rebelling against U.S. hegemonic desires and harsh IMF policies .
They are learning to " build shock absorbers into their organizing models , " Klein writes .
( p. 453 )
In Europe , two countries ( France and Holland ) rejected the European Constitution , the French because they saw that document as " the codification of the corporatist order , " what they called " savage capitalism . "
More and more grassroots - generated collectives are being started in Brazil to reclaim unused land , and in Argentina hundreds of bankrupt companies " recovered " by their workers have been turned into democratically - organized cooperatives .
( p. 455 )
These are small steps , to be sure , but they may represent strong , active anti-disaster capitalism tectonics about to emerge .
Certainly , the appearance of this brilliantly argued book is a giant and necessary step in turning this country , and the world , around . #

Explanation :
If you took a picture of the Sun at the same time each day , would it remain in the same position ?
The answer is no , and the shape traced out by the Sun over the course of a year is called an analemma .
The Sun 's apparent shift is caused by the Earth 's motion around the Sun when combined with the tilt of the Earth 's rotation axis .
The Sun will appear at its highest point of the analemma during summer and at its lowest during winter .
Analemmas created from different Earth latitudes would appear at least slightly different , as well as analemmas created at a different time each day .
The analemma pictured to the left was built up by Sun photographs taken from 1998 August through 1999 August from Ukraine .
The foreground picture from the same location was taken during the early evening in 1999 July .

To say , as some have , that the 2004 presidential election was won and lost on “ moral values ” is probably an overstatement .
It ’s nevertheless true that among church - going , God-fearing types who think the country has lost its moral bearings , George W. Bush enjoyed vastly more support than did his rival , John Kerry .
Is there a lesson here for the Democrats ?
Yes , there is , according to Jim Wallis , editor of the leftish religious magazine Sojourners , whose new book , God ’s Politics :
Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Does n’t Get It , argues that Democrats , if they ever want to win an election , must learn how to talk about moral values , indeed , to talk the language of moral values , in a way that remains true to the party ’s principles .
The American Right has been able to define “ moral values ” narrowly , almost exclusively in terms of wedge issues like abortion and gay marriage .
It does n’t have to be this way , Wallis argues .
Drawing on more than 30 years of work combating poverty , as well as an intimate knowledge of the Bible , Wallis , an evangelical Christian , argues that moral values encompass actions and attitudes toward a host of issues , including poverty , the environment , criminal justice and war .
Through a conversational combination of first - person stories , news analysis , statistics and old fashion preaching ( on the written page ) , Wallis paints a very different picture of what religion means than the one President Bush and many of his supporters have in mind .
His message seems to be resonating with Americans from across the political spectrum .
Published by HarperSanFrancisco late in January , it is now fifth on the New York Times bestseller list .
For more than a month now , Wallis has been traveling the country to promote God ’s Politics .
Speaking in churches , bookstores and on radio and television talk shows , Wallis says he is witnessing what could be the birth of a new movement that challenges the hold the Right has had on religion and morality for decades .
In San Francisco recently , he dropped by to speak with MotherJones.com .
MotherJones.com :
The subtitle of your book is “ Why the Right Gets it Wrong and the Left Does n’t Get it . ”
What does the Right get wrong ?
Jim Wallis :
The Right is comfortable with the language of religion , values , God talk .
So much so that they sometimes claim to own that territory .
Or own God .
But then they narrow everything down to one or two issues : abortion and gay marriage .
I am an evangelical Christian , and I can’t ignore thousands of verses in the Bible on [ another ] subject , which is poverty .
I say at every stop , “ Fighting poverty ’s a moral value , too . ”
There ’s a whole generation of young Christians who care about the environment .
That ’s their big issue .
Protecting God ’s creation , they would say , is a moral value , too .
And , for a growing number of Christians , the ethics of war — how and when we go to war , whether we tell the truth about going to war — is a religious and moral issue as well .
I think the Right has made a serious mistake in adopting a moral - values strategy , because they ’re winning in the short run .
[ But ] in the long run , they ’re going to lose this debate because they wo n’t be able to restrict it to two issues .
Once you open that door to a values conversation , it ’s going to undercut a right - wing economic agenda , which values wealth over work and favors the rich over the poor , or resorts to war as the first resort and not the last .
To quote the White House , when it comes to moral values in this discussion , I say , “ Bring it on ! ”
Let ’s have the conversation , because the Right ’s going to lose this debate in the end .
But not if the Left does n’t even get in the conversation .
MJ.com :
Is that what you mean when you say the Left does n’t get it ?
JW : [ Democrats ] forget their own progressive history .
Every major social movement in our history was fueled in large part by religion and faith .
Abolitionism , women ’s suffrage , child labor law , and most famously , civil rights .
Where would we be if the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had kept his faith to himself ?
Here ’s a party that was vitally connected to the civil rights movement , led by black churches , now has driven so far [ away ] , they ’re successfully portrayed by the Right as a secular party hostile to religion .
I think people who are religious or , say , even spiritual , have not felt like there ’s much of a home on the Left .
That ’s at least a huge political concern .
Even those who are n’t religious need to respect people of faith .
The connection the world ’s waiting for is to connect the hunger for spirituality with passion for social change .
Because spirituality , when it is n’t disciplined by social justice , in an affluent society , becomes narcissistic .
We buy the books , we buy the tapes .
We hear the guru speaker .
Barnes & Noble has a whole wall of how to be spiritual , balanced , healed , whole .
Spirituality becomes a commodity to be bought and sold .
So spirituality has to be disciplined by social justice .
MJ.com : And the Left ’s big mistake is that it has ignored that potential ?
JW : Not just ignored ; they ’ve ceded the territory .
They ’ve ignored it at their peril and they ’ve turned it over so that the Right gets to say , “ Okay , we ’ll define it our way .
Abortion , gay marriage .
That ’s it .
That ’s all .
Nothing else . ”
MJ.com :
What would you say to what you call in the book “ secular fundamentalists ” who say , “ I do n’t want anything to do with religion , and I do n’t want my politics or my party to have anything to do with religion either ? ”
JW : I do n’t call all secular people “ secular fundamentalists . ”
At every book stop , people say , “ I ’m secular ; I ’m an agnostic .
Thank you for making me included tonight .
I feel spiritually inspired , but I ’m not religious .
But I care about moral values . ”
So , to those people I would say , “ You know , you can be who you are , but just respect people who are people of faith and include [ them ] in the movement . ”
To the secular fundamentalists who want to exclude any religion , I would say , “ Do you want to lose every election for the rest of your life ?
Get smart .
Remember progressive history . ”
We all have an investment in our politics having a moral compass .
MJ.com :
In the book you say that it ’s not a matter of whether religion should influence politics , it ’s a matter of how .
JW : Yeah .
This is America .
This is the most religious nation on the face of the earth .
Religion will be a factor in our public life .
The founders wanted to separate church and state not to diminish the role of religion but to strengthen it .
Europe has a state church framework and religion has almost no influence .
Here , where it ’s separated , it ’s more dependent and more vital , and stronger .
The founders thought strong religion was a factor in the political health of the nation .
I say in the book how Lincoln gets this right , that you do n’t invoke God ’s blessing on the nation ’s policies .
You do n’t say , “ God is on our side . ”
That leads to all the worst stuff in politics : triumphalism , hubris , bad foreign policy .
If you worry that you are on God ’s side , that leads to humility and reflection , accountability , maybe even penitence — the missing values in politics .
King did it best : Bible in one hand , Constitution in the other .
He never said , “ I ’m religious , so I get to win . ”
He did n’t said , “ God spoke to me , and I have the fix for Social Security . ”
He said , “ I ’m motivated by my faith , but I ’ve got to persuade the public on the basis not of religion but of the common good . ”
MJ.com :
And nowhere in the book do you say that people need to get religion .
JW : In a funny way , I say both parties need to get religion on poverty .
This is the big issue on God ’s heart , if we take the Bible seriously .
Three million people living on less than $ 2 a day .
Thirty thousand children dying every single day of what I call a silent tsunami— nobody pays attention to it .
The Right is attacking me for trying to help the Democrats get religious language so they can win an election .
I say to Democrats when they call , “ If you want Bible verses and cheap God -talk , I ’m not really interested .
This is n’t going to be a sprint for you , but a marathon .
Not a forum , but a long - term conversation . ”
I ’m interested in content more than language .
What is the content of our politics ?
If getting religion means caring about poverty , then I want both parties to do that .
[ And for President Bush ] , I ’d like to see some real serious commitment to poverty reduction both at home and around the world .
I ’d like to see him do the right thing .
But so far , it ’s faith - based initiatives over here and a budget over here and there ’s no commitment to poverty whatsoever .
MJ.com :
And that says a lot about this country , right ?
That we allow that to happen ?
JW : I do n’t hear people saying , “ What about what the Bible says about the poor ? ”
So if his religious backers do n’t raise that question and the Democrats do n’t speak ever about religion , then he gets to say , “ I ’m a Christian and it applies to this , this and this , but it does n’t apply to my budget . ”
We ought to say , “ Yeah , faith does scrutinize budgets , so let ’s have a moral values audit of the budget . ”
MJ.com :
You mentioned in the book a poll that came out shortly after the election that said the majority of Americans wanted to hear about poverty .
JW : “ What is the greatest moral crisis facing America ? ” is the poll .
This is after the flawed exit poll .
Sixty - four percent said either greed and materialism or poverty and economic justice .
And I think about 16 percent , abortion , and 11 percent or less , gay marriage .
So when the question was asked straight up , moral values , that ’s what happened .
MJ.com :
If that ’s what ’s on the minds of the American people , and at least in election years , candidates theoretically listen to their constituents , then why was n’t that part of the discussion ?
JW : Good question .
Why did n’t John Edwards get listened to ?
He did by the voters ; he did n’t by his own party .
He became vice president and they put him on the shelf .
John Edwards was speaking to this powerfully in the spring .
Two Americas .
Good language .
And he was put on the shelf .
What if we had a candidate who spoke to the issues of economic justice as a moral value ?
I think there ’d be a deep resonance among American people .
Democrats have n’t made poverty a moral issue in years .
MJ.com :
So you think it was more the party not heeding the issue than the citizens ?
JW : Absolutely .
I ’m out in the country all the time now ; this is a big , big issue .
This is a big issue for religious and non-religious people .
Poverty could be the thing that calls us together across our political dividing lines .
But you need political leaders who articulate that and say why this is connected to our faith , our humanity , and our security .
The line [ from my book ] that draws a great response every single time is , “ Unless we drain the swamp of injustice in which these mosquitoes of terrorism breed , we ’ll never overcome terrorism . ”
Everybody knows that .
Most Americans know that you ca n’t defeat terrorism by killing terrorists .
So the president says , “ My response to terrorism is to kill terrorists . ”
And John Kerry says , “ Yup .
And my response is to kill even more of them . ”
That was our debate .
It ’s politically foolish and spiritually bankrupt .
[ The prophet ]
Micah ’s said that there ’s no security apart from common security .
Israelis are n’t going to ever be secure unless Palestinians are .
Wealthy nations wo n’t be secure until poor nations are .
That ’s just true .
MJ.com :
But our foreign policies wo n’t change until the leadership in the Democratic Party — or even the Republican Party — brings moral values into the discussion ?
JW : John Kerry should have said in the debates when he was being beat up on abortion and Eucharist , “ Mr. President , the Pope says the war in Iraq is wrong .
The Pope says it is n’t a just war .
Mr. President , why are you defying the Holy Father in Iraq ?
As a Catholic I must ask you that question . ”
Well , he could n’t say that because he did n’t have a clear position himself on Iraq , John Kerry did n’t .
MJ.com :
In the book you said the President did n’t meet with you or other religious leaders before the war .
Tony Blair did .
What do you make of the president using religious language to justify the war , yet refusing to acknowledge religious leaders ?
JW : At first , he was genuinely open and had meetings with several of us about poverty and faith - based initiatives .
The first time I met him , he actually said this very candid thing : “ I do n’t understand poor people , I ’ve never been around poor people .
I ’m a white Republican guy who does n’t get it .
I ’d like to .
How do I get it ? ”
I do n’t hear presidents talking that way very much .
That made me hopeful .
But then , he closed off after Sept. 11 , and Iraq especially .
He uses the language of religion but he ’s not willing to be accountable to biblical faith , so he does n’t want to listen to religious wisdom that might disagree with him .
A moral response to terror is a complicated issue , and he should avail himself of all the wisdom he can find .
He would n’t have to agree with it all .
Just listen .
Tony Blair listened for over an hour .
And talked .
Rigorous , good moral dialogue with Blair .
And Bush — even his own Methodist bishops he would n’t listen to .
That ’s a mistake .
It ’s a political mistake .
It ’s a moral failure to not listen .
The majority of Christians throughout the world were opposed to the war in Iraq .
That ’s a fact .
And the Christian president fought the war in Iraq .
What does that mean about his perception of faith ?
MJ.com : Well , what do you make of that ?
JW : That we ’re dealing with a religion that is more American than Christian .
He changes the words of scripture .
“ The light shines in the darkness .
The darkness does not overcome it , ” he said at Ellis Island , the first anniversary of Sept. 11 .
Well , that ’s [ from the Gospel of ] John .
It ’s not the American beacon of freedom to the world .
You do n’t change the words of scriptures .
That bothers us evangelicals .
Or he changes hymnology : “ Power , power , wonder working power . ”
When he said that in the State of the Union , he got 60 million people going , “ I know that song . ”
But the wonder working power in the song is the salvation of Christ — not the faith and idealism of the American people .
This is an American civil religion .
This is n’t biblical faith .
I think the president just does n’t want to be accountable to biblical faith .
MJ.com : So Bush has a selective reading of the Bible .
But for readers who may not know the Bible very well , which teachings of Jesus is Bush practicing and which is he not ?
JW : My conversion text is the 25th chapter of Matthew , where Jesus said , “ As you ’ve done to the least of these , you ’ve done to me . ”
I do n’t hear Bush ever talking about the Sermon on the Mount ; I just do n’t hear it .
I ’m hard pressed to think of teachings of Jesus that are being talked about in the White House .
Jesus did n’t speak at all about homosexuality .
There are about 12 verses in the Bible that touch on that question .
Most of them are very contextual .
There are thousands of verses on poverty .
I do n’t hear a lot of that conversation .
What you really do n’t hear [ from Bush ] is Jesus saying , “ Blessed are the peacemakers . ”
Or even more , how many sermons have we heard since Sept. 11 on the text , “ Love your enemies ? ”
It has n’t been a very popular text since Sept. 11 .
Well , we should at least have a debate about what Jesus meant by blessed are the peacemakers and love your enemies in a world full of terrorism and tyranny .
I remember Bill O’Reilly one night was yelling at me about Iraq .
I said , “ Bill , what would Jesus do ?
Can you imagine him climbing into the cockpit of a B - 52 and dropping a load of bombs over Baghdad ? ”
And Bill said , “ Well , Jesus would surely want to protect the American people . ”
And I said , “ Really ?
What about the Iraqis ? ” “ Well , well , them , too . ”
Once you start talking about this in a religious frame , it ’s troubling .
The Republicans will not hold [ Bush ] accountable to the biblical prophets when they think all the issues are about abortion , and the Democrats do n’t even know the language .
He gets away with it .
There ’s got to be a progressive religious response to Bush that says , “ We do n’t quibble with your piety , but we challenge your theology . ”
There is no American exceptionalism in the Bible .
The Gospel is uneasy with empire — except American empire ?
MJ.com :
And in your travels you ’ve seen that kind of response to Bush growing up from the grassroots ?
JW : It ’s become a national town meeting .
Folks who ’ve been coming out feel that when faith is talked about in the media or the White House it ’s not their faith .
It ’s always this narrow , either Religious Right or this White House religion , and I think people are finding their own voice and their own faith in the safe space of a discussion about a book .
There are evangelicals , Catholics , mainline , black churches , Jews , Muslims , young people who say they ’re spiritual but not religious , agnostics who say they ’re secular but care about moral politics .
MJ.com :
Yet even if there is all that energy , unless it ’s organized and geared towards a goal …
JW : Well , the conversation back around my shop is , “ What do we do with this ? ”
This is n’t just about selling books now .
This is about how to build a movement on the back of a book tour .
The story now is not the book , but the tour .
Why are so many people at bookstores ?
We ’re getting 400 in Dayton , Ohio , and Austin , Texas , and Wichita , Kan .
Also in Philadelphia and Boston .
They ’re sitting on the floor .
In Los Angeles , it was pouring rain .
A thousand people showed up .
It ’s this buzzing thing , which means that something is needing to be expressed .
I ’m getting 30 new speaking invitations every day .
There are a lot of young , articulate spokespeople who ought to be out in the churches speaking , so we ’re going to create a speakers bureau and then move these invitations out to this new generation of young women , young men who have a lot to say .
I think it ’s less about my voice than [ the people ’s ] .
They do n’t feel their voice has been represented in the conversation .
And this is a chance to be heard .
The good news is that the monologue of the Religious Right is now over and a new dialogue is finally beginning .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Vice President Dick Cheney left on Sunday for the Middle East to raise concerns about high oil prices , push Israeli - Palestinian peace talks , and seek support for Iraq , where war began five years ago this week .

Cheney , who has strong ties with leaders in the Middle East , will visit Oman , Saudi Arabia , Jerusalem , the Palestinian territories , and Turkey during a nine - day trip to the region .
“ Clearly , our ongoing efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan will be discussed , ” John Hannah , national security adviser to Cheney , told reporters .
“ Middle East peace , Iran , the situation in Syria , Lebanon , the violence in Gaza , energy -- it ’s a very long list and rich agenda . ”
Cheney will reinforce the message from visits by President George W. Bush in January and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice earlier this month , in a stepped - up diplomatic push for Israelis and Palestinians to move forward on peace efforts dealt a blow by violence in Gaza and Israel .
“ The mood has deteriorated incredibly in the last six weeks since the president was there , ” Jon Alterman , director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said .
“ From the outside it ’s very hard to see that Secretary Rice was able to even arrest the slide let alone get things moving forward .
My guess is the vice president will be able to arrest the slide if not necessarily put things on track , ” he said .
In Saudi Arabia , Cheney will discuss energy with King Abdullah as record - high oil prices strain the U.S. economy , but he was not expected to repeat the call by Bush for OPEC to increase production .
“ I ’m not sure he ’ll seek anything more than a good and thorough discussion about the current situation in the global energy markets , ” a senior administration official said .
ARAB ANCHOR
The United States wants Saudi Arabia , and other Arab allies like Egypt , to set up a diplomatic presence in Iraq by appointing an ambassador and opening an embassy in Baghdad .
“ The United States can do a lot for Iraq , but we cannot provide Iraq with an anchor in the Arab world , a kind of legitimacy for the new Iraqi project that comes from being fully integrated in its neighborhood , ” the U.S. official said .
“ And I think clearly some of our friends in the Arab world can do more on that score , ” he said on condition of anonymity .
But analysts were skeptical that Cheney would make any major breakthroughs .
“ I do n’t think that he ’s going to be able to bring back anything meaningful because he ’s got nothing to offer , ” Steven Simon , a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations , said .
“ He represents a lame duck president , a floundering economy , a situation in which the U.S. for all its efforts in Iraq has no leverage on the government in Baghdad , ” Simon said .
Cheney throughout his trip will discuss the situation in Iraq , where security has improved , but violence persists five years after the U.S. - led invasion .
Bush will soon receive a new assessment from Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker , that he will weigh in deciding whether any changes to U.S. strategy are needed .
Cheney will tell allies that the United States remains concerned about Iran ’s nuclear ambitions and would like to see its growing regional influence contained .
“ I expect in all of these countries that the challenge we face from Iran will be a very high topic of conversation , ” the U.S. administration official said .
The message for Turkey , which has been fighting Kurdish rebels known as the PKK in northern Iraq , will be that the United States agrees “ the PKK is a terrorist organization that needs to be defeated , ” and will continue to support Turkey in addressing the problem , the official said .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Stunned Bear Stearns shareholders who saw investments virtually wiped out overnight when a takeover deal with JPMorgan Chase was unveiled are demanding to know how it was put together in the first place .
A man walks past the Bear Stearns office in Singapore March 17 , 2008 .

For instance , they -- and Washington lawmakers -- want answers on how the deal was arranged , and gained government approval and financing , all in a few hours , and seemingly without alternative bidders being canvassed .
They also have a host of questions about the role of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department in engineering the emergency deal .
So far , some crucial details remain murky .
“ Under the circumstances , shareholders should be entitled to know just about everything , ” said James Melican , chairman of shareholder advisory firm Proxy Governance Inc , which is expected to make a recommendation to investors on whether or not the deal should be approved .
“ There needs to be full disclosure of exactly what happened over the weekend , ” he said .
Investors have “ an absolute right to know whether or not there is any other alternative mechanism that could either keep Bear Stearns in business or at least have them get a more appropriate price for their shares . ”
Billions of dollars in shareholder value has been wiped away in the last week .
Based on current market prices , the takeover is valued at $ 2.41 a share , a shockingly low offer compared with Bear ’s $ 159 stock price last April .
Another highly unusual aspect of the deal is the way JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N has been allowed into the Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N headquarters to provide " management oversight of its operations . "
If shareholders were to reject the JPMorgan offer , JPMorgan still would have been in a position to understand everything about Bear ’s trading strategies , staff quality and assets .
JPMorgan even has an option to buy the Bear Stearns ’ building if the deal collapses .
The U.S. Congress also wants answers , particularly on the involvement of the Federal Reserve in pushing the deal , which came as Bear Stearns faced a sudden cash crunch and possible collapse .
In an unusual move , the Fed agreed to lend $ 30 billion to fund illiquid Bear Stearns assets to help seal the takeover .
Among the unanswered questions are :
Were other parties asked to bid on Bear Stearns , or did the government solely approach JPMorgan about the takeover ?
Were any overseas banks or private equity firms asked to consider a bid , or did the buyer have to be a large U.S. bank ?
Also , how did the Federal Reserve arrive at the $ 30 billion figure and did it discuss with Bear whether it was preferable to arrive at a quick sale or explore a bankruptcy filing ?
How could due diligence be done and the deal approved in the space of a few frantic hours on Sunday ?
And how can a party taking over another be allowed to run the target before the deal has gone through ?
With so many unknowns , the U.S. Senate Finance Committee is reviewing the sale and particularly what implications it may have for taxpayers .
On Thursday afternoon ,
The committee ’s top Republican , Iowa Sen .
Chuck Grassley , said he wanted details of the Fed ’s financial support of the deal , as well as how Bear insiders were being treated under the buyout .
In the House of Representatives , the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee also wants to know more .
The committee is conducting a “ preliminary review ” of the deal , an aide to Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California , who chairs the panel , said on Thursday .
A decision on whether to launch a more formal investigation or to hold committee hearings could take several weeks , said the aide , who declined to be identified .
The aide added that the Bear Stearns developments dovetailed with separate hearings that Waxman ’s committee has conducted on compensation packages for top executives at troubled firms .
Some questions should be answered when the companies disclose the merger proxy , which must include more details about how the deal was hammered out and whether other potential bidders were contacted .
The SEC is always concerned “ that the entire background of the merger be set forth , ” Melican said .
“ They ’re always very insistent on that , even in a normal case .
I would think in this case , they would be even more so . ”
Also , if there are any legal challenges , Bear Stearns and JPMorgan could be forced to cough up more details , experts say .
Another unanswered question , experts say , is what forced the Fed to step forward .
Sanford Brown , who previously worked in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and is now an attorney at law firm Bracewell & Giuliani , wanted to know when the government realized problems were on the horizon .
“ Two years ago , the research guys at the Fed and the FDIC probably saw this coming , ” he said .
“ Why did n’t they come in sooner ?
Somebody along the way should have said ‘ stop ... we ’re creating too much risk in the system . ’
A new study should delight fans of the comic book superhero Spider - Man .
Researchers from the Munich Technical University ( M.T.U. ) in Germany have built a microfluidics ( miniature plumbing ) system for spinning short strands of artificial spider silk .
The new strands are less than half a millimeter , or 0.02 inch long , and their strength and elasticity are still untested .
Other research groups have already created strands yards or more in length that come close to the properties of real spider silk .
Such strands have long been desired for weaving into lighter bulletproof vests or artificial tendons and ligaments , but even relatively short strands could find niche applications in medical procedures such as brain surgery , says M.T.U. biophysicist Andreas Bausch , a co-author of the new study .
Devotees of Spider - Man comics will recall that — contrary to cinematic revisionism — Spidey slung webs not from glands in his wrists but by using a special web fluid of his own design , shot from a pair of wrist - mounted sprayers .
Similarly , researchers have built their own versions of web shooters in the past out of syringes .
Forcing silk proteins with the right additives through a narrow opening fuses the proteins into strands .
The Munich researchers took the technique a step farther .
They studied artificial dragline silk , which spiders use to hang from ceilings and outline their webs , based on that of Araneus diadematus , the European garden spider [ see image ] .
One of the team members had previously inserted a pair of dragline silk genes ( dubbed eADF3 and eADF4 ) into bacteria for easy production .
Without such tricks , " you would have to milk spiders to do these experiments , " Bausch says .
Bausch and his colleagues used a trident - shaped set of channels [ see image ] to first mix their dissolved silk proteins with potassium phosphate , which causes the silk proteins to clump into microscopic spheres measuring a mew microns in diameter ( a micron is one millionth of a meter ) .
They then lowered the pH of the mixture from 8.0 to 6.0 ( to make it slightly more acidic ) and forced it through a constriction measuring roughly 10 microns wide .
The scientists report in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA that they created a series of short strands by ratcheting up the speed past 600 microliters per hour ( equivalent to less than 10 ounces per minute from a garden hose ) .
Bausch and company believe that the pH drop causes the spheres to change shape after bonding together via chemically sticky ends , and the narrow constriction mashes the silk globs together once they are flowing fast enough .
They note that real spiders can spin their silk at a more leisurely pace because they start with a more viscous silk solution .
Making fibers is a small first step , says Randy Lewis , a molecular biologist at the University of Wyoming in Laramie .
He says his team has spun strands up to a yard long that stretch as much as 50 percent and have roughly half the tensile strength of real spider silk .
" Without mechanical testing data , " he says , " it 's really hard to analyze whether the kind of system they have is going to be particularly useful " for applications .
But he says the new system may help researchers improve artificial silks , which vary from strand to strand in unpredictable ways .
Spider - Man 's science - whiz alter ego Peter Parker would surely approve .
Is this a planet in the making ?
A gap in the dust circling a young star in the constellation Auriga may mark where material is condensing into a planet , 11 astronomers led by Ben R. Oppenheimer of the American Museum of Natural History say in a paper to be published in The Astrophysical Journal .
The group used an Air Force surveillance telescope at Haleakala Observatories on the Hawaiian island of Maui and a special camera to examine a region near the star AB Aurigae , corresponding to the scale of our own solar system , that had not been observed before at high resolution .
The results , they said , provided new insight into the process of planet and star formation .
The star is about 470 light years away and , being only about one million to three million years old , is still surrounded by the dusty detritus out of which it formed .
In the picture , which shows the intensity of so - called polarized light scattered off dust particles , there is a gap about nine billion miles from the star , roughly three times the distance from Earth to Neptune .
Intriguingly , there is also what Dr. Oppenheimer and his colleagues call a “ low significance detection ” of a bright dot in the gap .
If real , it could either be dust condensing on some object , Dr. Oppenheimer explained , or the object itself , which , based on its age and brightness would be 5 to 37 times the mass of Jupiter .
That would put it on the dividing line between a planet and a kind of failed star called a brown dwarf .
A Pennsylvania eatery is challenging diners to eat a huge burger at one sitting .
Video More video A Pennsylvania restaurant is selling a 15 - pound burger that comes with 25 slices of cheese , 1 whole head of lettuce , 2 onions and other additions .
Play video
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - Starting last weekend , a Pennsylvania restaurant put a 15 - pound burger on its menu , claiming the largest burger available anywhere .
Dennis Liegey , the owner of Denny 's Beer Barrel Pub in Clearfield , 120 northeast of Pittsburgh , said the " Beer Barrel Belly Buster " weighs in with 10 pounds of meat molded into a 20 - inch patty on a specially baked , 17 - inch bun .
The balance of the weight comes from 25 slices of cheese , a head of lettuce , three tomatoes , two onions , plus copious quantities of mayo , ketchup , relish , mustard , and peppers .
Any two people who can eat it within a three - hour sitting get it for free .
For everyone else , it costs $ 30 .
Long - running challenge " We 've been running a burger challenge since 1991 , " said Liegey .
" It started out with two - and three - pound patties , and went to a six - pounder in 1998 with five pounds of toppings . "
Over the years Liegey said he has sold more than 10,500 of the two - and three - pounders , and 853 of the six - pounders .
He has kept careful count of how many diners have finished each offering : 256 ate the whole two - pounder and 39 finished three - pounders .
And last February , one person , a 100 - pound female college student , Kate Stelnick , from Princeton , New Jersey , ate the entire six - pounder .
( The burger with toppings represented 11 percent of her body weight . )
The 15 - pound burger can feed a family of 10 , according to Liegey .
He has sold two so far to teams of two people , and neither team did much more than put a dent in it .

It ’s becoming a trend for outfits such as the IFPI , MPAA , BPI and their equivalents to demand that ISPs disconnect their file - sharing customers from the internet .
Unfortunately for them , ISPs do n’t want to play ball with these demands and are starting to make their opinions known while refusing to be bullied .
Even the European Parliament thinks that disconnecting file - sharers from the Internet is disproportionate .
When Simonsen Advokatfirma sent a letter to Norwegian ISPs via the MPAA ’s lawyer Espen Tondel , it was probably expected that the ISPs would agree to their outrageous demands .
Not so .
Instead , IKT Norway – an interest group for ISPs – stood up for the ISPs stating :
“ In a constitutional state , the police and the prosecuting authority have the job of investigating and indicting , not lawyers and communication engineers .
Most of the big ISPs in Norway are members of IKT Norway and we will support the various ISPs as best we can against what we see as a preposterous demand from Simonsen ”
Now , in a detailed letter , IKT Norway has responded in the strongest possible way :
Regarding demands to prevent alleged unauthorized publication .
We refer to the letter from Simonsen Advokatfirma DA on behalf of Norsk Videogramforening dated 4 .
March 2008 , also other letters from Simonsen dated 19 march 2008 and sent to several internet service providers ( ISPs )
1. Demands issued to the ISPs
In your letter you claim that the ISPs have an obligation to prevent alleged illegal activity .
It ’s further suggested that this should be carried out by the ISP by matching IP addresses with customer names and thereafter forward provided letters to the subscribers which ( apparently ) used the listed , dynamic IP addresses .
Principally we do not consider it an ISPs role to report on suspicions regarding breach of intellectual property rights without a court ruling , to contribute to legal decisions regarding our customers .
The ISPs will of course follow current laws and , if they receive a final ruling which demands action , they will follow it .
However the ISPs do not believe it to be their task to monitor or through their own evaluation and / or the subjective assessments of others , to censor or sanction [ content ] on the net .
It ’s important that the rule of law is upheld and that the protection of rights is correct in accordance with the constitution , i.e. the police investigate and the court of law makes the judgment .
2. Roles of the ISP and responsibility
We stress that the ISPs on their own do not breach the law .
We believe that you are familiar with the national implementation of the European Info - Soc Directive and that it deviates from Denmark .
Your reference to a Danish ruling is not relevant in this case .
( Comment from Norwegian translator : Norway parted from Denmark in 1814 , that ’s why we celebrate 17th May and they should know better ! )
In your letter you refer to the law regarding e-trade and cease and desists .
Such an instruction must be issued to the one who ’s allegedly breaching your clients rights .
A superficial trial to ascertain an copyright breach without the accused being a part of the case , and without letting the accused defend himself according to the normal principle of contradiction , is inexpedient .
The consequence of this will be of such a large magnitude for the individual Internet user that we believe a more though investigation and court involvement is needed .
Further investigation [ by the police ] will show if it ’s possible to identify the user which the copyright holder claim has beached their rights , and after this a justified ruling can be made by the court of law .
When it comes to your comment on responsibility and helping out to commit the crime if the ISP does not prevent the alleged illegal activity , we do not agree .
An ISP has no responsibility for what the customer does on the net as you suggest in your letter .
Based on this we reject your accusation that the ISPs have a responsibility for the users use of network and devices .
The ISPs will not follow your demand to block access / prevent alleged illegal activity .
3. Conclusion
IKT - Norway stresses that it ’s important to protect intellectual property .
Without a strong governance of intellectual property rights , the incentive to invent and create may suffer .
We do not protect nor sympathize with breaches of intellectual property rights , or other actions which breach the law .
However , the work to protect intellectual property must be carried out in such way that it does not breach fundamental constitutional principles .
Your private investigation carried out on the net has be further investigated by the police and / or the court of law .
Best regards ,
IKT - Norway

I started using CFL bulbs ( Compact Fluorescent Lamps ) in the 90’s when they were still around 20 bucks a pop and were rather more cumbersome .
Nowadays you can buy them for just a few dollars .
Since the cost has plummeted and they come in all sorts of wattage , shapes and sizes to fit the vast majority of standard light fittings , there really is no point in buying incandescent bulbs any more .
Incandescent bulbs not only consume excessive energy but also a hole in your wallet in comparison .
Some countries , including the USA and Australia , have also officially sounded the death - knell for incandescent bulbs ; phasing them out over the next few years .
But a new predicament faces us – what to do with the bulb once it ’s completed its useful life .
I ’ve had several emails on this topic .
It ’s been great to see environmentally conscious people thinking past the purchase !
Thankfully , CFL ’s last for a very long time – 2 - 5 years .
I ’ve had some bulbs last well beyond that .
Given their growing popularity though , it does mean we are faced with hundreds millions of spent CFL ’s needing to be responsibly disposed of or preferably recycled annually .
Do n’t bin your CFL’s
Throwing CFL ’s in the bin is n’t a good idea .
Aside from the waste of materials , there is one rather unsettling issue with compact fluorescent lamps – they contain a small amount of mercury ; approximately 3 - 5 milligrams .
It ’s a tiny amount , about the size of the very tip a ballpoint pen and far less than what is present in a watch battery .
Still , a hundred million of these small amounts does become a significant issue .
There has been quite a bit of panic about mercury in CFL ’s ; but I ’d like to point out that coal fired electricity production generates mercury in the form of emissions that go straight into the atmosphere .
CFL mercury levels are less than the additional mercury emissions involved in powering a comparable incandescent globe over the same period of a CFL ’s lifespan .
In addition to that , there ’s all the other negative environmental impacts associated with coal - fired electricity generation ; even so called “ clean - coal “ .
The less coal burned , the better .
Additionally , at the end of a CFL bulb ’s life , little of the mercury remains in its most toxic form .
Regardless , given the fragility of the bulbs ; caution is necessary and mercury should n’t wind up in landfill at any time and at any level .
Mercury is a powerful toxin that contaminates earth , air and water and accumulates in animal tissue .
Keep CFL ’s out of regular recycling
You should also not place lamps in your regular recycling collection because they can shatter while being transported or sorted and contaminate recyclable items ; plus put recycling center staff at risk .
How to dispose of CFL’s
The best way to find out how you can recycle or safely dispose of CFL ’s is to contact your local waste authority for advice .
If you ’re in the USA , the EPA page on bulb disposal provides a regularly updated comprehensive list of recycling centers and options around the nation .
Earth911.org is also an excellent resource where you can run a search on your zip code for recycling centers .
Another avenue to investigate is to contact your electricity authority – some utilities are providing their customers with CFL recycling or advisory services .
Yet another option is to ask the retailer who supplies your bulbs if they have a recycling program – some larger retailers have programs in place already .
It ’s a good opportunity to put pressure on retailers who do n’t , by letting them know you ’ll buy your bulbs from outlets that do provide this facility .
If all of the above proves fruitless ; hang onto the bulbs by placing them in a crush - proof container .
The issue of mercury in bulbs will become more pressing and as the green revolution really starts kicking into gear ; governments and manufacturers will be forced to provide proper facilities .
What if you break a CFL ?
The Australian Department of Environment offers the following advice :
– Open windows in the room to air out fo 15 minutes before cleaning up
– Do n’t use a vacuum as this could spread mercury into the air
– Wear gloves when cleaning up
– Use a disposable brush to gently sweep up fragments
– Use a moist paper towel to help pick up remaining tiny fragments
– Wrap the pieces up in layers of newspaper and place in a sturdy sealable bag or container along with anything used to clean up the mess .
The advice is then to place the container or bag in your rubbish bin , but I feel that perhaps it should be treated as hazardous chemical waste ; i.e. stored safely until such time that it can be taken to a hazardous chemical disposal facility .
Given all that messing around , it just pays to be extra careful when handling a CFL bulb :) .
If the idea of using anything containing mercury really bothers you or you do n’t particularly like CFL ’s for other reasons , perhaps consider LED lighting as a mercury - free alternative .
LED ’s are even more energy efficient and have a longer lifespan than compact fluorescent lamps .
Other alternatives are halogen or xenon hybrid bulbs .
If you prevously used incandescent bulbs for heat applications , there are heat bulbs available that are more efficient .
A recent Well blog post about bullies in the workplace generated more than 300 reader comments , prompting me to explore the issue further in my Well column in Science Times this week .
Bullying in the workplace is incredibly common — a recent survey suggests more than one - third of employees have been bullied on the job .
The problem is that the tactics used by workplace bullies usually are insidious and difficult to complain about .
Often , the only way the bullying stops is when the victim quits .
Here ’s a Workplace Aggression Research Questionnaire developed by researchers from the State University of New York in New Paltz and Wayne State University that identifies these often subtle bullying behaviors .
Take the quiz to find out if you ’re a victim of bullying .
Occasional insults do n’t count .
Bullying occurs when the behavior has occurred consistently during the past six months .
In the past six months have you regularly :
Been glared at in a hostile manner ?
Been excluded from work - related social gatherings ?
Had others storm out of the work area when you entered ?

Khampa warriors foray into Tibet for an attack on the PLA
After bolting the latch of the toilet 's door , Thupten Ngodup took a deep breath , opened the cap of the gasoline canister , poured the pale liquid to the last drop on his head till he was soaked to the skin , flicked a lighter and turned into an orange ball of fire .
With pieces of flesh bursting off his body with cracking sounds and raging flames licking his hair and searing his skin , he staggered like an inferno , screaming something that sounded like " Independence " .
As people ran towards him to dowse the flames , Ngodup went down on his knees with his hands folded , praying even as the blaze seethed from under the rugs thrown on him .
A few days after his self - immolation bid at the hunger strike by Tibetans at Jantar Mantar in Delhi in April 1998 , Ngodup became a martyr for his " homeland " and a hero for his people living in exile .
He was cremated with a secret still buried in his heart .
A few days later , amid a debate on " deviating from the Middle Way of the Dalai Lama " within the Tibetan community , a few people walked to Ngodup 's eight - by - six feet shack near the Tsechokling monastery in Dharamsala where the 60 - year - old man worked as a cook till the day he took a bus to Delhi to join the fast - unto - death to attract the UN 's attention to the " Chinese atrocities in Tibet " .
Amidst the Dalai Lama 's photos , Tibetan flags , Buddha statues , prayer bowls , a chair , some clothes , a bed , three pots , a few empty bottles of rum and an untouched bundle of bidis was hidden Ngodup 's little secret : the man was a former Tibetan guerrilla fighter .
He had picked up a rifle and carried it for 13 years to fight the Chinese in Tibet .
Thupten Ngodup 's little secret is a monstrous truth that lives in the hearts of almost all Tibetans in exile .
Every monk humming a mantra under a tree , every hand counting notes at a sweater shop , every face staring at customers in a caf�� , every finger turning a rosary in a temple knows this :
With guns in their hands , radios in their pockets and poison capsules hanging around their necks , thousands of Tibetan guerrillas ��� many of them trained by the CIA ��� went into Tibet to fight the People 's Liberation Army for 15 long years .
Most of them never returned .
Those who survived the deadly battles and came back home just faded away in the narrow alleys of refugee settlements .
Many of them are still active : making tea in a restaurant , selling books in a shop , weaving carpets in a factory , writing articles for their cause or just turning the prayer wheel in their grizzled hands .
Some of them live in grey stone dwellings on the ridge of green mountains , with red and yellow prayer flags fluttering over their little huts .
They talk about their fight with pride .
Then they sink into bitterness .
" The CIA just used us for its own dirty games with the Chinese , " says Tsering , a former guerrilla , with a glint in his old eye .
" Then the Americans betrayed us .
The Nepalis stabbed us in the back .
Everyone dumped us , " he adds , as his eyes turn red .
Members of Tibetan armed resistance group , Chushi Gangdruk , with their weapons
Within the Tibetan community in exile , the former guerrillas are like heroes of folklore .
With outsiders , the story is rarely shared .
The story of Tibetans ' armed resistance against the Chinese began in 1955 when the eastern parts of Tibet ��� Kham and Amdo ��� were run over by the rampaging troops of the PLA .
The Khampas of the region ��� known as horse - riding , fearless fighters ��� formed an armed resistance group called the Chushi Gangdruk and tried to stop the PLA 's advance into Lhasa .
When the March 10 , 1959 , uprising against the Chinese failed , Chushi Gangdruk guerrillas helped the Dalai Lama flee to India and they retreated into the northern Nepalese region of Mustang .
From a mountain jutting out into lunar - like valleys , the guerrillas forayed into Tibet , struck PLA convoys and withdrew to Mustang .
In the 1960s , as the Cold War intensified and thousands of Tibetan refugees arrived in India , a few of them were picked up from the road gangs of north India and flown to secret training camps on the remote Pacific island of Saipan and in Colorado in the Rocky Mountains .
" They were given sleeping pills on flights and were never told that they were in America , " says Lobsang , who fought alongside a few men who learnt guerrilla warfare and clandestine radio operations from the Americans .
Parachuted into Tibet , the men were asked to organize resistance cells .
Till the mid-60s , the CIA dropped arms and ammunition for the Mustang guerrillas as they conducted raids into Tibet and waged a bloody war with the PLA .
" Then , in early 1969 , the supplies suddenly stopped , " recalls Tsering .
" We did not know why the Americans stopped helping us . "
The guerrillas fighting a tough battle in a hidden corner of the world could not understand the Cold War games .
As Sino - Soviet relations plummeted to a new low and Henry Kissinger made many trips to Beijing for his shuttle diplomacy , the Chinese put a condition for establishing diplomatic relations : stop all connections and assistance to the Tibetans .
President Richard Nixon obliged .
And Nepal 's King Birendra followed suit by ordering his army to crush the resistance .
Fearing bloodshed , the Dalai Lama taped a message telling the Tibetans to lay down their weapons and surrender .
They did not say no to their lama .
" But the Nepalis did not keep their word , " says Lobsang , recalling how thousands of guerrillas were slaughtered .
Those who managed to escape to India brought with them the story of Chushi Gangdruk to the settlements .
It remained a story till it was documented by Tenzing Sonam and Ritu Sarin in their film , The Shadow Circus : The CIA in Tibet .
With interviews with former rebels and CIA operatives , the film for the first time revealed the violent past Tibetans do n't like to talk about .
" Since 1974 the Tibetan movement has stressed on non-violence and dialogue .
So , it became inconvenient to talk about the armed struggle , " says Sonam .
Chushi Gangdruk still exists , though not as an armed resistance group .
Its members still believe in complete independence for Tibet .
As Lhasa burns and the Dalai Lama threatens to quit if the movement turns violent , the former guerrillas and their young supporters are anxious .
" Last time we fell to Kissinger 's cunning diplomacy .
Everyone betrayed us .
This time , it 's China 's market charm that will make them betray us , " says a young activist .
As China clamps down on the protesters , the bitter memories of the past have come back to haunt the surviving members of Chushi Gangdruk .
They are certain that the world will let the Tibetans down again .
That 's why they are so reluctant to talk about their Mustang days .
Like Thupten Ngodup , the Buddha 's warriors want to go away with their secret in their hearts .

Today when I finished school I met this girl who I used to take dancing classes with .
She was together with a guy in my brothers class and somehow we started talking about rape and stuff .
Her cousin had been raped after she ’d passed out on a party .
This cousin blamed herself .
She should ’ve taken better care of herself , she should n’t have had so much to drink , she should n’t have passed out .
My friend had called people from the party wanting to know the names of the guys who ’d raped the cousin .
These people were all like “ no , these guys are our friends !
You ca n’t report them to the police ! ”
Assholes .
Guys like that are not your friends , and if they do n’t get reported you could be the next they take advantage off .
And even if they are your friends , how can you live with yourself if you deliberately let somebody elses rapists off ?
If someone you knew had been raped by two different guys at a party YOU attended , how can you withhold information that might help these rapists get convicted ?
It ’s partly because of people like you that so few rapists get convicted !
Rape is a horrible crime even if it is you friend who committed it .
Katie Couric : CNN's Next Larry King ?
It has been 19 months since Katie Couric exited her Today Show post at NBC to embark on a new career as the first female CBS news anchor in prime time .
The honeymoon is over as network executives are rethinking her 5 year contract that would have kept her at the helm until 2011 .
It is increasingly evident that Couric has not been the shot in the arm that CBS needed to pull their ratings out of third place .
Couric , paid $ 15 million a year , pulls in an average of 5.9 million viewers daily - compared to 8.3 million who tune in to NBC's Nightly New With Brian Williams and 8 million who view ABC's World News With Charles Gibson .
Some may argue that 5.9 million viewers is still a hefty audience but in the ratings war it sucks wind and CBS knows it .
Though CBS and Couric have made statements to the contrary , The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Couric is slated to step down in January 2009 .
This will coincide with the planned retirement of CNN interviewer Larry King who is 74 years old .
That platform seems to be a better fit for the 51 year old who earned her reputation as a skilled interviewer when she was at Today .
CNN President Jon Klein , a CBS veteran with close ties to some at the network , has expressed admiration for Couric 's work , and the two are friends .
They had lunch in late January , and the anchor attended Mr. Klein 's birthday party in March .
Do n't be surprised if this scenario comes to pass .
NBC weekend anchor Campbell Brown jumped ship and joined CNN late last year as a replacement for Paula Zahn .

Every marketer digs a user - generated campaign … until it gets hijacked in some way , which it inevitably does .
Greenpeace , for example , has been running a contest to name a whale .
Following the usual ho - hum entries , a group of zealots banded together to push the candidacy of one Mr. Splashy Pants .
Like most Internet memes — see the dramatic chipmunk — this one spawned all sorts of added activity , including the making of a logo , T - shirt and Facebook groups .
Reddit , the social news site , even recast its logo as Mr. Splashy Pants .
Now , Greenpeace , which we erroneous thought had lightened up a bit , is looking to take down Mr. Splashy Pants .
It has recognized Mr. S.P. as a candidate , but has accused Splashy Pants enthusiasts of stuffing the ballot box — now it ’s disallowing some clicks and even extending the voting deadline , apparently in the hope that some tamer name like Aiko ( “ little love ” in Japanese ) will gain steam .
My money ’s on Mr. Splashy Pants pulling out the win .
Thanks to Molly Parsley , AKQA employee and Mr. Splashy Pants fan , for pointing out this injustice .

Baghdad 's Sadr City is still burying its dead from the fighting Iraqi authorities have lifted a curfew in Baghdad , allowing people to leave their homes and easing most measures put in force on Thursday .
Driving is still prohibited in three mainly Shia districts , including Sadr City , which saw some of the heaviest fighting last week .
Mehdi Army militiamen have withdrawn from the streets , residents say .
On Sunday , their leader , radical cleric Moqtada Sadr , ordered them to stop fighting Iraqi security forces .
The fighting has claimed more than 240 lives across the country since Tuesday .
The southern city of Basra , where the Iraqi army launched its campaign against the Shia militias , is also reported to be quieter , although some areas remain under the control of the Mehdi Army , and gunfire has been reported .
Another barrage of rockets or mortars hit the Green Zone complex of government and embassy buildings in Baghdad on Monday .
No casualties have been reported .
' Positive ' move
In Baghdad , residents are slowly venturing out onto the streets again , with queues reported at some shops selling food and household goods .
Moqtada Sadr told followers to " work with Iraqi government offices "
The balaclava - clad , gun-toting militiamen are nowhere to be seen , reports say .
In Basra , the curfew has been lifted in daytime but will remain at night , authorities said .
Moqtada Sadr 's statement on Sunday said : " Because of the religious responsibility , and to stop Iraqi blood being shed ... we call for an end to armed appearances in Basra and all other provinces .
" Anyone carrying a weapon and targeting government institutions will not be one of us . "
The cleric also demanded that the government apply the general amnesty law , release detainees and stop what he called illegal and random raids against his militia .
He also told his followers to " work with Iraqi government offices to achieve security and to file charges against those who have committed crimes " .
The statement was welcomed by a spokesman for Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki , who warned fighters who did not withdraw would face government action .
' No resolution ' However , Hazem al - Araji , an aide to Moqtada Sadr , told reporters that the cleric 's appeal to his militias would not mean handing in weapons .
Ghazi Askar , 4 , is one of hundreds of Iraqis injured in the fighting The BBC's Adam Brookes in Baghdad says this means the Mehdi Army will remain intact .
He says that although the move gives Mr Maliki a chance to claim victory , the central demand has not been met and this is not a resolution of the conflict .
The fighting began last Tuesday in Basra , when the prime minister vowed to " re-impose law " in the city .
He had then given militias until 8 April to surrender their weapons in return for cash .
The situation had appeared to be deteriorating on Saturday , with fierce fighting in both Baghdad and Basra .
Coalition forces had become more involved , with US air raids in the two cities in recent days , and British forces joining the fighting in Basra .

What are these ?
In New York , the Supreme Court is not the state ’s highest court , but rather a district - level trial court ; its judges are elected for 14 - year terms , often without opposition .
The highest tribunal in New York is the state Court of Appeals .
The lower court rulings that were voided by the justices on Wednesday had barred the New York State Board of Elections from using the judicial convention system , directing the board to hold primaries instead , until the State Legislature could set up a new selection system .
The high court ’s rejection of those decrees was not a surprise , given that when the case was argued last Oct. 3 , several justices voiced skepticism of the lower courts ’ conclusions .
The lower courts had ruled that picking State Supreme Court nominees by party convention violated the First Amendment right of political association by excluding not only the voters but also judicial candidates who are not anointed by party elders from the process .
The high court found instead that the Constitution cut the other way , in favor of the state system .
“ A political party has a First Amendment right to limit its membership as it wishes and to choose a candidate - selection process that will in its view produce the nominee who best represents its political platform , ” Justice Scalia wrote .
He noted that nothing prevents people with judicial aspirations from wooing party leaders .
Nor does anything compel the delegates chosen in party primaries in each assembly district to vote the way the party leaders desire , although they almost always do .
Judicial aspirants are free to try to persuade the delegates to vote for them .

Join the rally to protest C - 51
( Natural News )
A new law being pushed in Canada by Big Pharma seeks to outlaw up to 60 percent of natural health products currently sold in Canada , even while criminalizing parents who give herbs or supplements to their children .
The law , known as C - 51 , was introduced by the Canadian Minister of Health on April 8th , 2008 , and it proposes sweeping changes to Canada 'sthat could have devastating consequences on the health products industry .
Among the changes proposed by the bill are radical alterations to key terminology , including replacing the word " drug " with " therapeutic product " throughout the Act , thereby giving the Canadian government broad - reaching powers to regulate the sale of all herbs , vitamins , supplements and other items .
With this single language change , anything that is " therapeutic " automatically falls under the Food and Drug Act .
This would include bottled water , blueberries , dandelion greens and essentially all plant - derived substances .
The Act also changes the definition of the word " sell " to include anyone who gives such therapeutic products to someone else .
So a mother giving an herb to her child , under the proposed new language , could be arrested for engaging in the sale of unregulated , unapproved " therapeutic substances . "
Learn about more of these freedom - squashing changes to the law at the Stop51.com website : http://www.stopc51.com
At the same time that C - 51 is outlawing herbs , supplements and vitamins , it would grant alarming new " enforcement " powers to theenforcement agents who claim to be " protecting " the public from dangerous unapproved " therapeutic agents " like , say , dandelion greens .
As explained on the www.Educate-Yourself.org website ( http://educate-yourself.org/cn/canadianC-51b... ) , the C - 51 law would allow the Canadian government ' senforcement agents to : • Raid your home or business without a warrant •
Seize your bank accounts •
Levy fines up to $ 5 million and a jail terms up to 2 years for merely selling an herb •
Confiscate your property , then charge you storage fees for the expense involved in storing all the products they stole from youC - 51 would even criminalize the simple drying of herbs in your kitchen to be used in an herbal product , by the way .
That would now be categorized as a " controlled activity , " and anyone caught engaging in such " controlled activities " would be arrested , fined and potentially jailed .
Other " controlled activities " include labeling bottles , harvesting plants on a farm , collecting herbs from your back yard , or even testing herbal products on yourself !
( Yes , virtually every activity involving herbs or supplements would be criminalized ... )
There 's more , too .
C - 51 is the Canadian government 's " final solution " for the health products industry .
It 's a desperate effort to destroy this industry that 's threatening the profits and viability of conventional medicine .
Natural medicine works so well -- and is becoming so widely used -- that both the Canadian and American governments have decided to " nuke " the industries by passing new laws that effectively criminalize anyone selling such products .
They simply cannot tolerate allowing consumers to have continued access to natural products .
To do so will ultimately spell the destruction of Big Pharma and the outdated , corrupt and criminally - operated pharmaceutical industry that these criminally - operated governments are trying to protect .
On May 9th , 2008 , Canadian citizens will be gathering at the Calgary Federal Court to protest C - 51 and help protect their access to natural health products .

NaturalNews is looking to hire someone with a good video camera to film the event .
We 'll gladly pay you to video tape this and send us the resulting file , which we will edit and then post for Natural News readers .
If you have a video camera ( with good audio , hopefully ) and can attend the May 9th rally , please contact us at ( U.S. ) 520-232-9300 for details .
If you do film there , be sure to use the , where you have somebody in the distance filming YOU with the camera , so that if Canadian law enforcement thugs decide to assault you and steal your video camera in order to censor the event , then somebody else in the distance has THAT on video !
You got that ?
So there are two cameras working , camera A is filming the rally , and it 's very close to the action .
Camera
B is set back farther from the scene , and it 's filming the person holding camera A .
This is standard operating practice for filming such events , and it makes it very difficult for government thugs to shut down the video .
Often , the person filming with camera B is in a car somewhere , or filming covertly so that they do n't attract attention .
Zoom lenses help a lot .
In any case , if you manage to get some video of this event , then we'd be thrilled to share it with Natural News readers .
And like I said , we 'll pay for footage , so call us for details .
Together , we can help spread the word about this important rally for health freedom in Canada .

It looks likely that the next president of the United States will be John McCain , Barack Obama , or Hillary Clinton .
There is still a chance that a third - party candidate could come out of nowhere and win , but we know that is unlikely at this point .
Although Obama talks of change and sometimes talks of withdrawing from Iraq , we know that we will mostly get more of the same .
Of course , Clinton or McCain would be a virtual guarantee of a continuation of big government in every aspect .
In this election , we finally had a libertarian who received some publicity and actually was allowed in the debates .
It is obviously disheartening that he did n't get a higher vote total , even if the mainstream media did n't cover him much .
Ron Paul reached a lot of people and made a few waves , but Americans , and in particular Republicans , seemed to reject his message .
It seems hopeless at times , as we know that the mainstream media will never willingly change .
Government will continue to grow and the whole system has been rigged in favor of the establishment .
How could we possibly ever reverse this course ?
I learned many things from Harry Browne , but the most important thing I ever learned from him is that we should still be hopeful .
It is really amazing how many libertarians think that we are doomed .
While there are certainly no guarantees , the chance of gaining back liberty and drastically reducing government in our lives is quite high in the long run .
As Harry used to say , " human nature is on our side . "
Go ahead and find a nice mall and walk around it .
Look at the people talking on their cell phones , drinking their Starbucks , and carrying their shopping bags .
Look at them getting in and out of their SUV's and playing with their iPods .
You may think they are spoiled brats , but really it is a sign of how much wealth our society has and how far we 've come .
Now we may go through some rough times in the near future and people will certainly have to cut back and save more money , but do you really think people are going to give up this lifestyle ?
There is a reason that Ron Paul drew strong support from young people .
His young supporters know that Social Security is bankrupt and that they would be much better off with far less government .
But even many young people that did n't support Paul understand that they should n't depend on Social Security and all of the other promises made by government .
It is unlikely that we will elect a libertarian president any time soon , but that does n't mean that all is lost .
It is the opinions and values of the people that will ultimately count .
Although too many people buy into the falsehood of elections and think that democracy means freedom , even these people want to run their own lives and make their own choices .
The best hope for freedom in this world may still lie with Americans .
Although the U.S. government has become an empire on the verge of bankruptcy , there is still a strong sense of individualism in this country .
We have a high degree of religious freedom , freedom of speech , and freedom of press ( yes , there are exceptions ) .
In the last year , the libertarian movement has grown by leaps and bounds , thanks in large part to Ron Paul 's presidential run .
The strongest support is from the youth and we have every reason to believe that this is a trend that will continue .
The government education system has become such a joke that most kids do n't even pay attention to what is taught in school .
Sure , they probably are n't learning to read and write as well as they should , but at least many of them are coming out of high school not believing that the government is the answer to all of their problems .
With the open communication of the internet , how can this move towards liberty be stopped ?
We have the truth on our side and now we just have to communicate to others on how much better their life would be without big government .
Most comedy shows ridicule politicians to no end and the populace has very little respect for politicians .
Their respect for government as a whole is not far behind .
The groundwork has been laid .
We must build on this .
It will not happen overnight , but it can happen .
The idea of liberty is becoming fashionable again .
The empire is dying and we will be there to pick up the pieces .
We must be consistent , truthful , radical , and unashamed of our ideas .
We can win our freedom and we will show the rest of the world how great life can be .
We will no longer spread democracy at the point of a gun .
Instead , we will spread freedom by example .

A firm , hearty handshake is always an appropriate way for men to greet each other .
But when men achieve a greater familiarity , a man hug becomes appropriate .
Some men fear male on male hugging of any kind .
But done in an appropriate way , men can still hug while remaining secure in their manhood .
Here ’s how :
Those were excellent tips .
Unfortunately , not all men are well - versed in proper man hug protocol .
These are the sad results :
Make sure your hug will be reciprocated .
As a final note , some men , especially here in America , are not quite comfortable with the fully embracing style of hugging even when done correctly .
Thankfully there is a bridge between the handshake and the bear hug : the American man hug .
With the American man hug comes certain protocol and procedure that men have n’t articulated , but nonetheless follow .
These unspoken rules allow men to hug each other without feeling like they ’re being wussy .
The How of the American Man Hug
1. Begin with a traditional firm handshake
2. Keeping your hand clasped with your buddy , wrap the left arm around the shoulder of your friend .
3 . Slap your friend ’s back two times .
The back slap is key .
Somehow hitting your fellow man makes the hug more manly .
4. Release embrace .
When to American Man Hug
Man hugging is not appropriate with every man you come in contact with .
It carries with it a certain intimacy that should be reserved for close friends and family .
If you were to try to man hug a new acquaintance , you would probably be greeted with stiff awkwardness .
However , if you ’ve developed a bond after your initial introduction , a goodbye hug may be appropriate upon parting .
Special occasions like those mentioned in the video warrant the full man hug .
The American man hug is appropriate for greetings and partings .

Q Given some of the drastic statements that you have made about the quality of software , is anything changing , are we progressing to better products ?
A That depends , over the last fifteen years the gap between computing science and our best industries and computing practice in industry has widened .
Very much .
Mainly due to the fact that computing science at the universities has made such progress .
Now industry is employing younger staff that has had a much better training than in the past .
Over the years I have lectured on programming over the world and the major reaction from the audience was usually : " What a pity my boss is not here . "
That is a very sad comment , but the moral of the story is that if industrial practice suffers it is largely due to the conservatism , technical incompetence , of the managers of those projects .
If however the internal organization and hierarchy of industrial programming organizations can be changed , there is room for great progress .
And I think it will change , because the pressure from below becomes stronger and stronger .
Q In practice it often appears that pressures of production reward clever programming over good programming : how are we progressing in making the case that good programming is also cost effective ?
A Well , it has been said over and over again that the tremendous cost of programming is caused by the fact that it is done by cheap labor , which makes it very expensive , and secondly that people rush into coding .
One of the things people learn in colleges nowadays is to think first ; that makes the development more cost effective .
I know of at least one software house in France , and there may be more because this story is already a number of years old , where it is a firm rule of the house , that for whatever software they are committed to deliver , coding is not allowed to start before seventy percent of the scheduled time has elapsed .
So if after nine months a project team reports to their boss that they want to start coding , he will ask : " Are you sure there is nothing else to do ? "
If they say yes , they will be told that the product will ship in three months .
That company is highly successful .
Q There is a perception that the spread of personal computers is bringing with it a spread of alleged computer literacy .
The ' PC revolution ' is thought to ready the lay user more for computer based solutions and should thus help the progress of computer use in corporations .
Is there any substance to this perception or is this development maybe just muddying the water ?
A Two comments to this question .
One comment is that your view of industrial programs as pointed out in the question is narrow .
There are all sorts of programs that hardly have users , if you think of a telephone exchange , or digital controls in cars or airplanes .
As to the programming products that are used by people , I hardly have first hand experience , my impression is that an enormous amount of user time is wasted figuring out what the system does and how to control it , which is the consequence of two sorts of happenings .
First of all that the designers have failed to keep the interface of a system as simple as possible which is a challenge ; but as soon as you realize that the main challenge of computer science is how not to get lost in the complexities of their own making , it is quite clear that this is a major task .
Secondly , the scene is very much burdened by the fact that a large fraction of the people involved are functionally illiterate ; particularly in the United States .
Q Do you really feel that this is more the case here than in Holland ?
A Oh yes .
In Europe a much larger fraction of the populationcan write .
People in America have really suffered from the combination of TV , which makes reading superfluous , and the telephone .
A few years ago I was at CalTech and that is a hiqh quality place and everybody recommends it because the students are so bright .
A graduate confessed to me no he did not confess , he just stated it , that he did not care about his writing , since he was preparing himself for an industrial career .
Poor industry !
Q This leads to another question : in the production of software is ....
A I prefer the term design of software , since it is an abstract product .
Q Ok , in the design of software is there a significant difference between what is going on in Europe and in this country ?
A Yes .
American computer science if practical remains much closer to the actual machine , and if theoretical is much more theoretical , whereas my personal fascination with the topic is the fact that the fruitful area of overlap of practical and theoretical is so huge .
What is nice from a theoretical point of view is usually eminently useful , and what is a really good practical idea always has something deep underlying it .
And my fascination with the topic is that there is a large area where the traditional distinctions between pure and applied is meaningless .
I always refuse to be called a pure computer scientist if that implies that I am unpractical .
I also refuse to be called a practical computer scientist if that means that what I do is theoretically shallow , or lousy .
That synthesis between pure and applied , where the distinction disappears is more readily realized in the European scene than here .
Traditionally the distinction between pure and applied mathematics has always been very strong in the USA .
A simple example is the fact that it is quite common in universities here to have separate departments for pure mathematics and say statistics and operations research .
Such a separation would be unheard of in most European universities .
Secondly , the American computer industry carries more weight , and as a result there is a tendency to see computing exclusively in an industrial context .
Q Does this difference have any bearing on the nature of products developed in Europe as opposed to in the USA  speaking of products used by people , are they more user - friendly to use that modish word ?
A User - friendliness is a word that never should have been invented .
Q What word should have been invented to connotate the idea ?
A The idea is wrong !
It is a long story about the user , which I will try to condense .
The point is that the computer user , as functioning in the development of computer products is not a real person of flesh and blood but a literary figure , the creation of literature , rather poor literature .
15 years ago I Inoticed that Dutch computer scientists developing products , when talking of the needs of the user would use in the middle of a Dutch sentence the American word user , which of course is perfectly translatable , as you and I both know .
Our cigarette packages have english on them as well ......... ; but then I discovered that in spite of their anglophobia , the word user is perfect French .
Then I discovered that it is also perfect Russian and the two of us also know more Japanese than you think .
Well the mere fact that that little word is not translated , but it is taken over as a foreign body , in Dutch , French , Russian and Japanese discussions , means that it has lost its original meaning .
Now , if you start to analyze the many character traits of that literary figure , you discover that he is most uninspiring .
He is stupid , education resistant if not education proof , and he hates any form of intellectual demand made on him , he cannot be delighted by something beautiful , because he lacks the education to appreciate beauty .
Large sections of computer science are paralyzed by accepting this moron as their typical customer .
Rare are the computer companies that are prepared to make a Mercedes , the analog the high quality product for the discerning customer .
As it turns out , particularly in the USA mathematics is the pinnacle of user unfriendliness , if you read the catalogs of text book publishers , then it is quite clear that the major recommendation that they give a book is that it is a-mathematical , that it does not require mathematical knowledge , etc .
So , user friendliness is , among other things the cause of a frantic effort to hide the fact that eo ipso computers are mathematical machines .
Q What is to be done for the industry to break that impasse ?
A It may not be possible .
Five or six years ago Harlan B. Mills has falsely argued that the computing industry , the computer users and the educational institutions were in a complete deadlock situation .
The industry does not feel responsible for educating the people , for they are extremely conservative in their products ; so that sets the standard of the demands of users for industry .
Universities do not dare to teach the real stuff in their undergraduate curriculum , because the industry and the future employers are not looking for that .
His conclusion was that breaking this deadlock was a federal responsibility .
I think universities can .
If they do not do that , they forsake their role .
What is the implication of being a leading institute ?
What is most needed is , at a number of good universities , a few strong departments of unfashionable computer science .
Whether this is planned or not , I think some professors of computer science just will not be suppressed .
They can not be tamed to present a lot of junk .
Q And you intend to be one of those not suppressed ......?
A I have never been that !
Q In that fight for liberation , is your move to the US of special significance ?
A No , because I carry out my work just as I did before .
I got a very nice offer and the reason that I welcomed it was that , having eleven years with Burroughs Corp.
eleven wonderful years , for which I am very grateful to the company  but in course of those years my interest broadened beyond the technical needs of the computing industry .
At least as the computer industry perceived them .
I felt that a return to the university campus would be appropriate .
Q Is the USA the paradise for computer science that it is made out to be ?
A No .
Q Why would you say that ?
A Because it is in danger of being supported to death .
It is certainly not a paradise for computer science .
One of the things a computer scientist has to do is to distinguish between the intrinsic problems of computer science and the use of computers in society .
And we should for instance clearly distinguish between problems of computer science and problems generated an educational system .
We should also clearly separate the problems of computer science and those generated by the traditional interface between the industry and its customers .
User satisfaction is not a quality criterion for a computer product .
Q What would make you say that ?
A I was introduced to user satisfaction as a quality criterion years ago and I found it ridiculous .
You can achieve it in all sorts of ways .
For instance by not educating your customers ; telling them that it can not be any better .
Postulating that the fact that software has bugs is a law of nature .
You can even achieve it by intimidation .
The worst part of it is that the goal is too fuzzy to give any technical aid .
No , user satisfaction as a criterion is very typically American , because the American interface between the supplier and his customers , is that a supplier leaves the last stages of control to the customer .
That is why you always see " satisfaction guaranteed " and if not you may return it : they 'll mend it endlessly .
Something has happened with the design of programming languages .
Programming languages of course have to be user friendly , programmers have to like them .
For a long time features of programming languages were included on account of their supposed popularity the main criterion was will people like itagain stemming from a rather dismal perception of the user .
The great change in programming languages came from the fact that we started giving formal definitions of the semantics of programming language concepts .
Something you need if you want to be able to prove things about the programs written in it .
And even if you do not intend to do that in a formal way , it was an extremely healthy exercise for programming language designers .
Formalization acted as an early warning system : if the formal definition of a feature gets very messy and complicated , then you should not ignore that warning .
Q Can you explain some more about those language developments that have these better features ?
A The versions that computer scientists are experimenting with are languages that are not selected for their potential appeal to the uneducated , but are screened by criteria such as mathematical power in a very rigorous sense , mathematical elegance and that kind of research produced all sorts of things .
Some stay within the framework of imperative programming languages , because we know so well how to implement them very efficiently .
Others are exploring functional programming languages .
Q Can you explain the difference between the two ?
A I can try in a minute .
Others are trying to be in their considerations even less constructive .
They define the answers by a number of logical equations , leaving it to the implementation to find the solution to that set of equations .
The net effect of it seems to be that a full system for really acceptable programming will be at the same time a full system that will suffice for the description of constructive mathematics .
What is happening is that the gap between a program a computer may execute and the mathematical proof that the answer exists is narrowing .
The simplest way to characterize the difference between imperative programming languages and non-imperat ive ones is that in the reasoning about imperative programming you have to be aware of the ' state ' of the machine as is recorded in its memory .
In conjunction with that there is a clear distinction between a program on the one end and the information processed on the other .
In the case of functional programming you create a language in which you can write all sorts of expressions and evaluating an expression then means massaging that expression until you have it in the shape that you want to have it in .
Q You are speaking of the leading edge of research of computer languages .....
A Yes ,
What it is again in danger of being supported to death because one of the hopes of functional programming is that in the execution of programs written in a functional style it will be easier to exploit a lot of concurrency .
Q How much of this research is at this point flowing back into industry applications ?
A Little but more than you think .
I know of a definitely industrial environment , to wit a huge software house that is part of a large oil company and whose charter is primarily to satisfy the software needs of the parent company , so this is most definitely an industrial environment , where in the case of a new program to be developed they made a prototype using a functional programming language in an amazingly short time .
In fact in something like better than one tenth of the time an other technique would have required .
They have an implementation of this functional programming language , but not a very good one ; as a result the prototype was unacceptably slow , but the experience was that it was a very important intermediate step towards the final product .
So we have seen already that , though invisible in the final product , novel programming languages and implementation techniques are beginning to play a role behind the scene .
This is going to have a profound impact on the software community as a whole you see the point is that whenever you try to benefit in the development of programs from the availability of machines then obviously the first candidates for automation are those aspects of the programming process that are more or less routine jobs .
As a result the really difficult stuff remains .
With all our so - called programming tools the net effect is that programming becomes more and more difficult .
The easy parts are automated away and the difficult parts remain and that has now reached the stage that it requires of the software developer quite a degree of mathematical sophistication .
I was very amused when some time ago in a strictly industrial environment I observed a heated discussion .
The discussion involved a whole bunch of so - called higher order functions higher order functions are considered too fancy to even talk about to many mathematicians , they are functions that have functions for their argument and may return a function as a valueit was in a group of industrial computer scientists and they talked about higher order functions as if they were the most normal thing in the world .
Q So it is happening ....
A It is happening , yes !
If I were to take a number of my traditional mathematical colleagues and expose them to this discussion , they would not have the foggiest notion of what was going on , and if they did they would not believe it .
Q It sounds like the improvements in effectiveness that you speak of should get everybody 's attention real fast so again when is the impact going to be noticeable ?
A You know Max Planck 's answer when he was asked when quantum mechanics would be accepted by the physical ....
" When the current generation of physicists has died ! "
Q That gives us hope ?
A Yes .
You should realize that in any field the time lag , the delay between a significant scientific progress and its acceptance by the scientific community at large not to mention the moment that it finds its way into a product should be measured in generations .
The reasons for dissatisfaction with the way I have been educated on the whole I am extremely happy with my education are that nobody warned me about that time lag of a few generations , I had to discover that all by myself with a lot of frustration .
Q What is happening to the generation of current students that you referred to before , who bring some of these concepts if not some of the products with them ?
A Twenty years ago or so I came to the conclusion that the only people I could educate would become misfits .
Q Does that leave industry any hope ?
A Oh yes , the point is we can educate the scientists , who educate the industry , so as to make the industry ready to employ them .
The backwardness of industry is not a scientific problem .
Industry is becoming aware of the problems caused by its own inertia .
By definition of course this took a long time .
People are reacting to it , whether it is successful or not no one knows ....
General Motors wants to develop a new car in a completely new company !
Q So you are saying that this route was taken to break through that inertia ?
A Sure .
It is a way of starting afresh .
Q On the matter of cooperation between industry and university research , do you feel that things are done better here or in Holland .
Or can both learn from each other ?
A That is hard for me to judge , because since I am here I have had no experience with the cooperation with industry .
One of the reasons in ' 73 for my joining Burroughs Corp.
as a research fellow was that in the preceding decade I had observed that it was extremely hard to penetrate industry from a campus , from outside .
In the next ten years I discovered it was hard from the inside as well , though easier .
This applies to industry on both sides of the Atlantic .
It is definitely so that industry here is more used to giving support to individual research that has always been the case .
It is hardly possible to be a professor and not also be a consultant .
But many consultants do their own thing .
Q Do you feel that Holland should learn from this American approach ?
A My overall impression is that it does not matter what mistakes the USA makes , because they will be faithfully copied in Europe only 20 years later .
Europe can learn an immense amount from the United States .
By studying what is happening and then not copying it .
In some aspects we might even try to copy it .
Q What are you thinking of specifically ?
A Oh , the ease with which you can incorporate , I believe it costs $ 3 or so .....
Q Considering possible breakthroughs , are we at this moment constrained by technology , by programming techniques , or maybe both ?
A John McCarthy of Stanford University has made the remark a long time ago and it is still very valid , that the greatest bottleneck is not to be found in hardware but in our programming ability .
Q Speaking of programming bottlenecks what will the impact of the research in artificial intelligence be ?
A Can you research something that is not science ?
I feel that the effort to use machines to try to mimic human reasoning is both foolish and dangerous .
It is foolish because if you look at human reasoning as is , it is pretty lousy ; even the most trained mathematicians are amateur thinkers .
Instead of trying to imitate what we are good at , I think it is much more fascinating to investigate what we are poor at .
It is foolish to use machines to imitate human beings , while machines are very good at being machines , and that is precisely something that human beings are very poor at .
Any successful AI project by its very nature would castrate the machine .
Q Computer science has become very popular , are there too many students , are there too few students and do you see any change in the level of preparedness of the entering student between now and say ten years ago ?
A The topic is devastatingly popular .
Because computing is now supposed to cure all the ills of the world and more .
I once gave a short summary of the fact that over the centuries scientific effort had been a complete disaster .
The first scientific effort of course was the production of the elixir that would give eternal youth , but very rapidly they discovered that there was little point in living eternally , if you would live in eternal poverty , so the next major scientific project was how to turn anything into gold .
Now it was quite clear that the planning of these two major research efforts was beyond the powers of the seers of the day , so for sound managerial reasons the next hot issue became the accurate prediction of the future .
As time went by the original goals were forgotten .
Medicine divorced itself from quackery , chemistry divorced itself from alchemy and astronomy divorced itself from astrology .
However there is still some feeling of guilt in the academic community , because as soon as promising new branch of science or technology emerges , it is saddled up with the old hopes .
The current boom in computing is an immediate reflection of absolutely unrealistic hopes .
So if you ask whether there are too many or too few students : an order of magnitude too many .
From a scientific point of view you would like to weed out the lot .
Keep the brightest 2 % and do business .
The current generation of freshmen coming in is not only ill prepared , they have been misguided .
Q Are you suggesting that the personal computer boom has fostered fruitless play rather than ....
A Yes .
I have said it before in public and I am perfectly willing to repeat it that someone introduced to computers via Basic is in all probability mentally mutilated beyond redemption .
That is no joke .
A major branch of the Siberian Academy of Arts and sciences is aimed at keeping Basic out of Siberian high schools .
Q So what will get in ?
A Probably Basic .
Q Of other languages that are becoming popular , are there any that offer any better hope ?
A Oh yes .
The popularity of Pascal is very encouraging .
Not because it is ideal , but it is definitely orders of magnitude better than any of its competitors .
Besides that it is interesting because it is a one man product , without any form of political or industrial backing .
It has gained its popularity in slightly over a decade , because at the time of its inception it was so much better than anything else available .
Q We have seen Lisp emerge in documenting constructs ?
A Lisp was great at the time of its inception if only for a radically new way of using machines .
It has suffered the fate of having been elevated to a status of de facto standard with all its defects .
Despite its conceptual novelty a lot of the design of Lisp is terribly amateurish even by the standards of the time .
When I read the first manual , the Lisp 1.5 manual , published in 1961 , I could not believe my eyes .
It was an extremely poor language .
Now it has become the defacto standard of the AI community , which now suffers from Lisp , the way the rest of the world suffered from Fortran .
Q Is the field of computer science approaching maturity in any sense , or where are we ?
A Well , we is a rather mixed lot are n't we ?
Let me give you three dates 1968 , 1975 and 1984 .
In 1968 IBM published an ad in Datamation showing Suzie Meyer smiling in full color .
Suzie Meyer announced that she had solved all her programming problems by the simple trick of switching over to PL / 1 .
It is a great pity that Datamation did not publish a picture of Suzie Meyer four years later !
1975 was about the time that the Swedish logician Per Martin - Löf convinced himself of the fact that a well documented program was an object logically isomorphic with a constructive mathematical proof .
In that sense the word constructive refers to the most puritan of all mathematics .
By 1984 the computer science had taken notice of that fact .
Late 1983
I attended a small industrial conference on programming .
One message came across loud and clear and that was that in development of programs formal techniques would not only be indispensable , but would have to be applied on a scale without precedent .
Now if you compare that with then we have travelled long and far .
Q As a final question I would like to ask what is the most interesting research project that you see right now if you had to name one ?
KOUROU , France , Feb 11 ( Reuters ) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy called on Monday for a global programme to explore Mars , bringing together European states and more established space powers like the United States and Russia .
Sarkozy said he would ask the European Space Agency and the European Union to cooperate on a framework for dialogue with Washington and other space powers on a joint initiative .
“ Because Mars is there and Mars is accessible to the technologies available to humanity , we cannot refuse to attempt this adventure , ” Sarkozy told reporters during a visit to the launch site for Ariane rockets in French Guiana .
He said Europe had skills in robotic exploration , transport and technology while the United States , which already has a programme to explore Mars , had the financial means and “ technical and scientific competences ” .
“ I am convinced that an exploration programme can only be global , without exclusivity or appropriation by one nation or another ...
Each will be able to take part with their capabilities , their strengths and their choices , ” he said .
U.S. President George W. Bush has urged NASA to focus on getting people to the moon and to Mars .
But NASA ’s Mars Exploration Program says a manned mission to the red planet is unlikely before the early 2030s .

Despite what you 've been told about the IT skills shortage , there 's a multitude of evidence that suggests that line of reasoning is a self - serving myth .
Baseline cuts in to the belly of the IT shortage debate .
Over the last several years a number of IT industry executives and analysts have consistently promoted the idea that there exists an ever - present shortage of skilled IT workers in the market to fill the industry ’s demand .
High - profile executives such as Bill Gates of Microsoft and Craig Barrett of Intel have weighed in on their opinions about this shortage of good help in the server room and at the keyboard .
Most recently the theory of a growing shortage was bolstered by a December 2007 Gartner report entitled “ The Quest for Talent – You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet . ”
One of the report ’s authors , Andy Kyte , went so far as to say in a statement that “ ( t ) his is a massive and devastating skills shortage , and it is coming when there is a surge in the number of projects that are required from IT . ”
But there is a growing resistance to this “ common knowledge ” of IT labor shortages — a number of economists , academics and industry experts refute these claims , stating that there simply is n’t any hard evidence to support the idea that there is or soon will be an IT skills shortage .
“ It seems like every three years you 've got one group or another saying , the world is going to come to an end there is going to be a shortage and so on , ” said Vivek Wadhwa , a professor for Duke University ’s Master of Engineering Management Program and a former technology CEO himself .
“ This whole concept of shortages is bogus , it shows a lack of understanding of the labor pool in the USA . ”
Wadhwa has been studying the IT labor market since his transition to the academic world , when he began hearing student anxiety over the availability of jobs in the wake of increased offshore outsourcing and onshore hiring of foreign guest workers .
He ’d heard all of the business claims of skills shortages to justify these practices , but these assertions did n’t jibe with students ’ perception of diminished job prospects in technology .
His findings have so far shown no indication of skills shortage .
For example , in one study Wadhwa illustrated the disconnect between industry leadership ’s opinions about skills shortfalls and the quantitative facts that contradict these opinions .
He and his students at Duke went straight to the hiring source , the human resource department , at a number of top companies employing IT workers .
They asked HR professionals a number of questions that would speak to the availability of qualified workers , about topics such as the number of applicants received for IT jobs , the speed with which these positions are filled and the overall satisfaction with the employees eventually hired .
The portrait painted by the question ’s answers were very different from their executive ’s opinions on skills shortages , Wadhwa says , explaining that each indicator showed there was no lack of qualified applicants .

No clear chain of command existed at Abu Ghraib because so many individual members of various companies and brigades were thrown together there ; the chaos and lack of accountability that ensued created an environment that was ripe for abuse .
According to an internal military investigation , overall responsibility for detainee operations never came together under one person short of Lt. Gen .
Sanchez himself , who was the chief commander in Iraq .
“ It is important to understand that the MI units at Abu Ghraib were far from complete units , ” reads the internal report .
“ They were small elements from those units .
Most of the elements that came to Abu Ghraib came without their normal command structure .
The unit Commanders and Senior [ Noncommissioned Officers ] did not go to Abu Ghraib but stayed with the bulk of their respective units .
The bringing together of so many parts of so many units , as well as civilians with very wide backgrounds and experience levels in a two month time period , was a huge challenge from a command and control perspective . ”

On August 9 , 2001 , President Bush announced one of the most controversial science policies in history : federal money would be denied to research conducted on embryonic stem cell lines that had n't already been developed .
Some say Bush 's policy is tantamount to murder .
Others laud it as a defense of life against soulless scientific exploitation .
Either way , according to an article by Bush stem cell adviser Jay Lefkowitz , the President 's hand was guided by Aldous Huxley 's dystopian classic , Brave New World .
Now , for those of you who have n't paid attention , a quick bit of background : embryonic stem cells – or ESCs – have the power to become most any other cell in the body .
Scientists think ESCs could be used to rejuvenate damaged bodies and treat diseases that currently defy the power of medicine .
However , there 's only one source for ESCs : embryos .
( A new technique , called de-differentiation , may very well provide another , but it 's still too early to say . )
Harvesting ESCs destroys embryos .
If you consider embryos to be fully human , this is killing ; if not , then denying funds for potentially lifesaving ESC research could be seen as equally immoral .
Out of this tension emerged a bitter culture war front , claims and counterclaims and competing promises about the medical utility of various stem cell types , and a whole lot of hoo-ah .
We 've covered this exhaustively on Wired Science , and we come down firmly on the pro-ESC research side .
But today , that 's not relevant .
What is relevant is this passage from Lefkowitz 's article in January 's Commentary Magazine :
[...]
Another suggested that federal funding might have the unintended consequence of creating financial incentives that would encourage the creation of frozen embryos in order to destroy them .
A few days later , I brought into the Oval Office my copy of Brave New
World , Aldous Huxley ’s 1932 anti-utopian novel , and as I read passages aloud imagining a future in which humans would be bred in hatcheries , a chill came over the room .
“ We ’re tinkering with the boundaries of life here , ” Bush said when I finished .
“ We ’re on the edge of a cliff .
And if we take a step off the cliff , there ’s no going back .
Perhaps we should only take one step at a time . ”
Say what ?
The one enduring , truly bipartisan criticism of Bush 's stem cell policy is that it 's schizophrenic .
If destroying embryos after an arbitrary date is wrong , it 's also wrong before that date .
If funding research on
ESCs derived after August 9 , 2001 is wrong , so is funding research on
ESCs derived before August 9 , 2001 .
Arguing that we might as well make the best of damage already done makes no sense if you believe ends do n't justify means .
So it 's appropriate that Bush , the author of this nonsensical policy , was influenced by Brave New World , precisely because this influence appears so superficially considered .
Is Bush a vocal critic of other reproductive technologies , such as picking embryos to match prospective parents '
tastes in gender or ability , that resonate with Huxley 's dystopia ?
No .
And let 's not even talk about the social relationships critiqued by
Brave New World .
These are just as chilling as its biological speculations , but do n't seem to have aroused much political introspection in Bush .
Indeed , for Bush to have taken a message from Brave New World , he would have had to ... cherry - pick it .
Imagine that .

Hey , did I mention that I slept with Chelsea Clinton ?
April 18 , 2008 by lestro
by lestro
Yup , we got together , did a bunch of blow and then fucked like wild animals for an entire weekend , before her girlfriend came home and threw me out .
I have n’t really heard from her since the abortion , but I get a text message every now and again .
Hey , it could be true , right ?
and that is all that matters to me and Chelsea :
Hillary Rodham Clinton has recently stopped telling the story of a pregnant Ohio woman who lost her baby then died because she lacked health insurance and proper prenatal care .
The New York senator had recounted the story as it was told to her , but the account turned out to be oversimplified and wrong on some key details , according to news reports .
Still , Chelsea Clinton continued to tell it , even getting the woman ’s age wrong .
( She was 35 , not “ younger than me , ” as Chelsea Clinton reported Saturday . )
“ There was some talk in the media about whether it was true or whether it was not true , ” she said .
“ Her family has said it ’s true in the interim , but what matters to me in the following story is that no one ever doubted that it could be true in our country .
So here ’s the story we heard . . . . ”
Nice .
This year , Chelsea is proving to be quite the useful surrogate for a campaign that has had trouble breaking through to the youth vote , which Obama has had on lock since the early days of his candidacy .
Chelsea may not answer all of the questions or talk to reporters ( like any normal surrogate would ) , but she is still the only Clinton with a positive favorability rating and that goes a long way .
But this latest little bending of the truth certainly shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that she is absolutely a Clinton .
From Josef Joffe
The British website LiveLeak.com has removed Fitna , intoning that it had to “ place the safety of its staff above all else . ”
You would have thought that this is a typical reaction for all those “ Euroweenies , ” as the satirist Peter O” Rourke once called America ’s cousins from across the sea :
Let ’s cave in to the mere threat of violence .
In fact , the debate is a lot more thoughtful and diverse .
This is all the more significant because European constitutional practice does not share the American tradition of the “ heckler ’s veto . ”
First enunciated by Justice Douglas in Terminiello v. City of Chicago , 337 U.S. 1 ( 1949 ) , the basic idea is that utterances , works of art or rallies must not be suppressed just because they might arouse uncontrollable anger on the part of those who take offense .
( The actual term “ heckler ’s veto ” was first invoked in Brown v. Louisiana , 383 U.S. 131 , 1969 . )
The most dramatic recent case was a planned demonstration by American Nazis in Skokie , Illinois in 1978 , a home to many survivors of the Holocaust .
An Illinois appeals court lifted the ban .
That episode gave rise to the immortal scene in Blues Brothers , where John Belushi and Dan Akroyd plow their car into the Nazi ranks , hurling them into the lake below .
Yet in Europe , the mere expectation of communal violence against hateful speech routinely leads to bans and prohibitions .
Significantly , the Dutch government has imposed no such sanctions on Geert Wilder ’s Fitna .
The Hague as well as the EU have merely condemned the 16 - minute film .
On the other hand , no television station would air it , so Wilders had to “ premiere ” it on the Internet .
Fitna is the kind of montage that can be applied to anything in order to disgrace it .
The familiar tools are selectivity , suggestive juxtaposition , incendiary commentary .
In that , Fitna resembles your basic anti-semitic tract where quotes from the Hebrew Bible are used to depict Jews as murderous fanatics and their god as a vengeful , cruel deity — never mind what else is in the corpus and how revelation has been changed by two millennia of interpretation .
Come to think of it , as the respected NRC Handelsblad reminded its readers , the agitprop produced by Sergei Eisenstein or Michael Moore used the very same techniques .
And what about Al Gore ’s An Inconvenient Truth , which oscillates between manipulation and mendacity , but profits from its obeisance to contemporary standards of correctness ?
The Dutch have not forgotten the murder of politician Pim Fortuyn and the filmmaker Theo Van Gogh , and so this haven of multiculturalist laissez - faire has become a lot less tolerant of militant self - righteousness in the name of Allah .
So have the French in the aftermath of bloody riots by young Muslims in their squalid suburbs .
The Germans , always willing to turn the other cheek , given their murderous racism in the Nazi years , have been shocked by foiled terrorist plots as well as “ honor killings ” in their midst .
Perhaps , Europeans are also afflicted by a nagging sense of shame , having left little Denmark in the lurch while the country faced boycotts and burning embassies in the wake of the Muhammad cartoons .
This time , Europe is walking the fine line between appeasement and self - assertion .
The Dutch are a perfect example .
No , they would not ban Fitna .
Instead , they went into full defensive mode .
The government dispatched faxes to the municipalities : Beware , Fitna is on the Net .
The police were placed on alert throughout the land .
Embassies in Islamic countries were instructed to ready emergency procedures planned long ago , all the way to preparing for evacuation .
On the other hand , the Dutch bent over backward to assuage Muslim rage , knowing full well that such fury is never spontaneous , but a convenient pretext for scoring another Big One in the “ clash of civilizations . ”
Dutch diplomats were dispatched to assure Muslim regimes that Fitna was strictly a private affair — and by no means condoned by the powers that be .
Alas , so the line went , we Westerners have a tradition of free speech that keeps governments from enforcing an official truth .
What these emissaries did not cite , one surmises , is another , now safely banished part of our history .
This is those three centuries of million - fold annihilation in the name of the One True God , be he the Lord or a secular Deity , as in the guise of Stalin or Hitler .
To invoke this bloody past in defense of free speech would have been totally incorrect , the kind of cultural hauteur that would assign to the West a higher perch on the scale of civilizational progress .

So far , so good .
In their Friday sermons , Muslim clerics in Holland called for reasonability and restraint .
So far , the government ’s “ counter - insurgency ” apparatus is just idling .
Islamic bloggers are keeping the flames of rage low .
Have these good folks been intimidated by the harsher mood in Europe ?
A note of caution :
In the wake of the Danish Muhammad cartoons , it took a few weeks before the propaganda engines in Libya , Pakistan and Egypt kicked in .
Next stop is Germany , where a municipal theater in Potsdam , a suburb of Berlin , will premiere Salman Rushdie ’s Satanic Verses on Sunday .
Recall that this led to Khomeini ’s death fatwa against the author in 1989 and innumerable eruptions of Muslim rage throughout the world .
Recall also the submissive response by the Archbishop of Canterbury , Robert Runcie : “ Only the utterly insensitive can fail to see that …
Salman Rushdie ’s book has deeply offended Muslims both here and throughout the world . ”
This time , twenty years later , submission and self - assertion , rage and restraint are more balanced .
For now .

Home Foundations for Structured Programming with GADTs Foundations for Structured Programming with GADTs , Patricia Johann and Neil Ghani .
POPL 2008 .
GADTs are at the cutting edge of functional programming and become more widely used every day .
Nevertheless , the semantic foundations underlying GADTs are not well understood .
In this paper we solve this problem by showing that the standard theory of datatypes as carriers of initial algebras of functors can be extended from algebraic and nested data types to GADTs .
We then use this observation to derive an initial algebra semantics for GADTs , thus ensuring that all of the accumulated knowledge about initial algebras can be brought to bear on them .
Next , we use our initial algebra semantics for GADTs to derive expressive and principled tools -- analogous to the well - known and widely - used ones for algebraic and nested data types -- for reasoning about , programming with , and improving the performance of programs involving , GADTs ; we christen such a collection of tools for a GADT an initial algebra package .
Along the way , we give a constructive demonstration that every GADT can be reduced to one which uses only the equality GADT and existential quantification .
Although other such reductions exist in the literature , ours is entirely local , is independent of any particular syntactic presentation of GADTs , and can be implemented in the host language , rather than existing solely as a metatheoretical artifact .
The main technical ideas underlying our approach are ( i ) to modify the notion of a higher - order functor so that GADTs can be seen as carriers of initial algebras of higher - order functors , and ( ii ) to use left Kan extensions to trade arbitrary GADTs for simpler - but - equivalent ones for which initial algebra semantics can be derived .
I found this to be a really interesting paper , because the work had an opposite effect on my opinions from what I expected .
Usually , when I see a paper give a really clean semantics to an idea , I end up convinced that this is actually a good idea .
However , Johann and Ghani gave a really elegant treatment of GADTs , which had the effect of making me think that perhaps Haskell - style GADTs should not be added as is to new programming languages !
This is because of the way they give semantics to GADTs as functors | C| -> C , where C is the usual semantic category ( eg , CPPO ) and |C| is the discrete category formed from C that retains the objects and only the identity morphisms .
If I understand rightly , this illustrates that the indices in a GADT are only being used as index terms , and their structure as types is going unused .
So it 's really kind of a pun , arising from the accident that Haskell has * as its only base kind .
This makes me think that future languages should include indices , but that these index domains should not coincide with kind type .
That is , users should be able to define new kinds distinct from * , and use those as indexes to types , and these are the datatypes which should get a semantics in the style of this paper .

NBC says it wants to be able to put its TV content back on the iTunes Store , but still has a few reservations — one of which could hold the network back from joining iTunes forever .
NBC would still like to be able to bump up prices — something that Apple has been stubborn about in the past , but has shown it 's open to negotiation over when it comes to movie licensing .
NBC would also like Apple to tighten up its DRM , however , in such a way that would block NBC 's content from being transferred onto iPods .
NBC chief digital officer George Kliavkoff made the comments during an interview at this week 's Ad : Tech conference in San Francisco , where he discussed what the company wants out of its relationship with Apple .
" We 'd love to be on iTunes .
It has a great customer experience .
We 'd love to figure out a way to distribute our content on iTunes , " Kliavkoff said , according to CNet .
" We have film distribution with iTunes so yes , we do talk to Apple . "
Still , those hopeful that their favorite shows might make a triumphant return to iTunes anytime soon should n't hold their breath .
The kicker was when Kliavkoff decided to delve into piracy and digital music players .
" If you look at studies about MP3 players , especially leading MP3 players and what portion of that content is pirated , and think about how that content gets onto that device , it has to go through a gatekeeping piece of software , which would be a convenient place to put some antipiracy measures , " he said .
" One of the big issues for NBC is piracy .
We are financially harmed every day by piracy .
It results in us not being able to invest as much money in the next generation of film and TV products . "
That 's right : NBC would like to dump its contents back onto iTunes , ask you for at least $ 2 ( or more ) per episode , and then have Apple place extremely tight restrictions on if and how it can be played on an iPod or iPhone .
Without the ability to take it with you off of a computer — like , say , when you 're riding the train to work , or flying across the country — there is n't a lot of difference between buying a show on iTunes and watching it for free on Hulu .
And perhaps that 's the point .
Kliavkoff also indicated that NBC still expects more control over pricing ( translation : more money ) , and even made a jab at Apple 's effect on the music industry as a result of its rigid pricing structure :
" The music industry guys would have something to say about how the pricing has affected their product over the last few years , " he said .
When NBC and Apple had their messy break - up last August , Apple accused the network of attempting to hike up prices from $ 1.99 to $ 4.99 per download .
This was in addition to reports in the media that the two were already butting heads over DRM .
( Apple 's fairly liberal DRM scheme allows users to authorize up to five different machines , and play DRMed content on an unlimited number of iPods synced up to those machines — it 's one of the few DRM schemes in use that does n't completely stifle users , but that Hollywood and TV networks have long hated . )
In December , NBC pulled its long list of shows from the iTunes Store , as it had just begun testing its own online video venture , Hulu .
Hulu has turned out to be pretty decent , as far as online video is concerned , although it still has a number of limitations ( including only being able to access videos while online , and not being able to download them to any devices ) .
Since Apple 's iPods ( and iPhone ) are appealing in no small part because of their ability to play content from the iTunes Store , we will likely see pigs grow wings and take off before Steve Jobs agrees to enforce the type of restrictions that NBC apparently wants .
The farmers are seeking for the release of a farm leader , Ramiro Choc , arrested earlier this month on charges of robbery and illegally occupying land .
The farmers are said to have occupied land in the area for the past decade .
The government is now reportedly willing to help the farmers legalise their position on the land they use .
Local officials and representatives of Guatemala 's Human Rights Prosecutor 's office negotiated between police and farmers to ensure the hostages were freed , after 32 hours in captivity .
Five representatives of the farmers ' union will now fly to the capital , Guatemala City , for talks with the government .
Jungle village
The farmers disarmed the officers on Thursday at the police station in the Caribbean coastal town of Livingston and took them by boat to the remote jungle village of Maya Creek , police said .
Police spokesman Faustino Sanchez had told the Associated Press news agency : " They told us they are going to kill them one by one . "
Among those taken hostage were the police station head , a police district head and four other commanders , local media reported .
Mr Choc had urged his supporters to release the police officers in a telephone call from jail , Guatemala 's interior department told AP .
The detained farm leader has also been accused of inciting residents to take over land , including nature reserves .
Just weeks after the US Federal Communications Commission said it would investigate claims that Comcast was surreptitiously throttling P2P file - sharing traffic , the mega American ISP has issued new terms of service , telling customers it likes to practice " reasonable network management " .
These terms of service seem to mirror a footnote to the FCC 's 2005 Internet Policy Statement - a bit of government wisdom Comcast has used time and again to justify its BitTorrent busting .
Way back in May last year , an independent network researcher named Robb Topolski revealed that Comcast was preventing users from " seeding " BitTorrents and other P2P files .
When one machine attempted to trade a file with another , Topolski's tests showed , the ISP would send a duped " reset flag " to break the peer - to - peer connection .
Speaking to The Reg , Comcast flatly denied this .
But five months later , The Associated Press confirmed Topolski's tests , and Comcast changed its tune .
Sort of .
The ISP admitted to " managing traffic " in an effort to keep its customers in very good spirits .
" Our customers use the Internet for downloading and uploading files , watching movies and videos , streaming music , sharing digital photos , accessing numerous peer - to - peer sites and thousands of applications online , " read the statement the company tossed our way .
" We have a responsibility to provide all of our customers with a good Internet experience and we use the latest technologies to manage our network so that they can continue to enjoy these applications . "
Then , in early November , members of the SaveTheInternet coalition formally asked the FCC to crack down on Comcast 's BitTorrent busting , claiming the ISP is in violation of the commission 's Internet Policy Statement , which seeks to protect the rights of American internet users .
" In 2005 , when the FCC adopted an order reclassifying wireline broadband as an information service , it sought to ensure that network providers of Internet service , like phone and cable companies , would not violate network neutrality , " SaveThe Internet said .
" Consumers are entitled to access all applications , services , and content of the consumer ’s choice , and entitled to competition among providers of networks , applications , services , and content . "
But the FCC 's policy statement includes a footnote that says ISPs have the right to practice " reasonable network management . "
SaveTheInternet claimed this does n't apply when an ISP " intentionally degrades " net apps , but Comcast immediately sought shelter under this footnote .
" We engage in reasonable network management to provide all of our customers with a good Internet experience , and we do so consistently with FCC policy , " read a canned statement from Comcast executive vice president David Cohen .
" As the FCC noted in its policy statement in 2005 , all of the principles to encourage broadband deployment and preserve the nature of the Internet are ' subject to reasonable network management . '
The Commission clearly recognized that network management is necessary by ISPs for the good of all customers . ”
Well , the Commission has finally decided to weigh in .
Last month , at the International Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) , chairman Kevin Martin said his people would , at some undisclosed time in the future , investigate Comcast 's treatment of peer - to - peer traffic .
Little more than two weeks later , Comcast made the first change to its term of service in two years , adding that reference to " reasonable network management practices " .
" The company uses reasonable network management practices that are consistent with industry standards , " the terms say .
" Comcast tries to use tools and technologies that are minimally intrusive and , in its independent judgment guided by industry experience , among the best in class .
Of course , the company 's network management practices will change and evolve along with the uses of the Internet and the challenges and threats on the Internet . "
There you have it : Comcast 's BitTorrent bagging is " best in class . "
When we spoke to Comcast spokesman Charlie Douglas , he denied that the revised terms of service had anything to do with the FCC 's investigation .
" Contrary to what others are saying , this was just a clarification of our policy , just standard day - to - day changes , " he said .
" Our terms are revised from time to time to further articulate our terms for our customers .
What about the " reasonable network management practices " bit ?
That is n't a response to the FCC investigation ?
" No , " said Douglas .
" Other ISPs have terms of service and they get updated from time - to - time . " ®
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Jesse Ventura is n’t holding his breath to find out who wins the Democratic presidential nomination , or for that matter who takes the White House in the November election .
“ It ’s irrelevant , ” says the one - time professional wrestler and former Minnesota governor whose election to that post in 1998 as a rank outsider and third - party unknown shocked the national political establishment .
“ I oppose the two - party system .
All it is is more of the two - party dictatorship , ” he said .
“ What I wish we had on the ballot for all our elections is ‘ none of the above ’ so you could show you have no confidence in the government .
“ It would be amazing just how often ‘ none of the above ’ would win ... the only difference I see is that if a Democrat wins ( in November ) our taxes will go up .
That ’s not saying they spend any more or less than the Republicans but the Republicans put it on a credit card , or the national debt . ”
Even Barack Obama , who is vying with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination and is the freshest face in contention , would wind up being a “ puppet on a string ” if he wins , said Ventura , who left office after one term .
The two - party system , Ventura believes , blocks changes he would like to see -- such as abolishing the federal income tax in favor of a national sales tax .
He made the comments in an interview during a trip promoting his latest book “ Do n’t Start the Revolution Without Me . ”
The book is a tour of his often contentious days as governor , with commentary on everything from the Iraq war -- “ a stupid war ” -- to marijuana -- the excuses for legalizing it are fast disappearing .
COLLECTIVE EGO
If the war is not on the front burner of the political debate now or later , it should be , he said , because the country ’s current economic woes can be tied to it .
It should be on voters ’ minds in November , he said , because “ We ’ve got people dying over there . ”
“ We carry a large ego and when we do something that is categorically wrong we have trouble admitting we did something wrong , ” he said .
That ’s a picture he sees better than some , he said , living part of the year in Mexico , looking in on U.S. life rather than being part of it .
He lives in a remote area “ an hour from pavement , ” solar powered and “ off the grid . ”
While his book is true to life throughout , the last chapter veers into fantasy , Ventura said , in which he inserts himself into what would happen if a truly strong independent ever makes a serious bid for the presidency .
In his scenario , Ventura is assassinated while leading a protest at the White House , where President George W. Bush has bombed nuclear sites in Iran , declared martial law and postponed the 2008 presidential election .
“ I used myself as an example ... if a third party candidate legitimately becomes a threat , he would be assassinated physically or credibility - wise .
The powers that be would never allow a true independent to become president , ” he said .
For now , Ventura added , he has no plans of seeking the presidency .
“ It ’s too difficult , too hard .
You have to jump through different hoops in every state , ” he said .

The U.S. Defence Department banned Google teams from making detailed street - level video maps of U.S. military bases , after images of a Texas base ended up on the popular internet site .
A message sent to all Defence Department bases and installations around the country late last week told officials not to allow the mapping website to take panoramic views inside the facilities .
Air Force Gen. Gene Renuart , chief of the U.S. Northern Command , said Thursday that that the decision to issue a formal ban was made after at least one Google crew requested and was permitted access to a base , identified in the message as Fort Sam Houston .
Renuart said he was concerned that allowing the 360 - degree , street - level view could provide sensitive information to potential adversaries and endanger base personnel .
" [ It shows ] where all the guards are , it shows how the barriers go up and down , it shows how to get in and out of buildings , and I think that poses a real security risk to our military installations , " he said .
Google says mapping was mistake
Google spokesman Larry Yu said a Google crew mistakenly asked for access to a base , breaking Google policy .
" It is against our policy to request access to military bases for the purpose of capturing imagery in Street View , " he said , adding that when Google was contacted , the imagery was taken off the site within about 24 hours .
Street View is a feature on Google Map pages that allows viewers to click on a location and see a panoramic view of that spot .
The issue emerged just a few days after published reports suggested that protesters used Google Earth to help plot their access to the roof of a parliament building in Britain .
Renuart stressed that the military ban was not an attack against Google , but that it was more a concern about secondary effects of an otherwise good technology .
" Google was very appreciative of us letting them know that we had a concern , " he said .
" They understand the security implications , and they have given us no indication that they would not be helpful to us if we asked . "
Buenos Aires may mean fair winds in English , but smoke from burning scrubland has blown over the capital .
The government has blamed farmers for illegally starting fires to clear land for grazing .
The smoke has caused traffics chaos , forcing roads to be closed and flights to be cancelled .
The smoke is also causing breathing problems and people have sought medical treatment for eye problems .
Firefighters are tackling 70,000 hectares of land that is burning to the north of the capital .
President Cristina Fernandez has urged the authorities to prosecute those responsible for the fires .
This satellite image shows the clouds of smoke that were heading towards Buenos Aires on Wednesday .
The problem has now drifted to neighbouring Uruguay , with smoke hanging over Montevideo .

Meet Yuki-taro , a self - guided , GPS and camera equipped robot snowplow that somehow manages to look as cute as Pokemon 's Pikachu - this is Japan , after all !
Snow ?
In Japan ?
Yes indeed , and not just on top of Mount Fuji .
Some parts of northern Japan can receive a surprising amount of snow in wintertime , enough to block roads and isolate people living in mountain villages .
Elderly people in particular are at risk in these areas , both from being shut - in and from trying to shovel all the snow .
That 's where " Yuki - taro , the friendly snowbot " , comes in !
Though only a prototype at present , Yuki - taro 's creators in the snowy city of Niigata expect to have a marketable version ready within 5 years at a cost of under 1 million yen ( about $ 9000 ) .
That may sound like a lot , but it 's likely that municipalities would pay the cost and deploy them where needed .
Besides , Yuki - taro is packed with high - tech features such as a GPS positioning sensor , twin video cameras for obstacle avoidance in the " eyes " , and an integral snowblock maker that will thrill local kiddies looking to build an igloo or two !
The internal compressor addresses a very real problem - what to do with the snow ?
Instead of acting as a snowblower , which might create more snow clearance problems ,
Yuki - taro takes in snow at the front , squeezes it into rectangular bricks , and excretes said bricks out the back .
Try teaching your dog to do that !
The bricks can be easily stacked and stored for summer cooling needs - unless those pesky neighborhood kids get at them first !
The first part of Yuki - taro 's name means " snow " in Japanese while " Taro " is a popular boy 's name .
If it were sold here - and one day , it likely will be - it'd probably be called " Snow Joe " or something .
Like most Japanese robots , Yuki - taro is designed to look cute .
There are more than a few altered photos of Yuki- taro modified to look like Pokemon 's Pikachu foating around online .
Expect a Pikachu conversion kit ( and , dare I say it , a Hello Kitty version ) to be sold right alongside Yuki - taro once he / she / it hits the stores ( via Pink Tentacle )

Day in and day out I go about my business , I hang out with my kids and my grandchildren , take care of the elders , I go to work , I teach and I write , I organize and I participate in the never - ending effort to build a powerful movement for peace and social justice ; now and then ( and unpredictably ) I appear in the newspapers or on TV with a reference to my book Fugitive Days , a memoir of the revolutionary action and militant resistance to the Viet Nam War — the years of miracle and wonder — and some fantastic assertions about what I did , what I said , and what I believe .
The other night , for example , I heard Sean Hannity tell Senator John McCain that I was an unrepentant terrorist who had written an article on September 11 , 2001 extolling bombings against the U.S. , and even advocating more terrorist bombs .
Senator McCain could n’t believe it , and neither could I .
My e-mail and my voice - mail filled up with hate , as happens , mostly men with too much time on their hands I imagined , all of them venting and sweating and breathing heavily , a few threats —
“ Watch out ! ” ; “ You deserve to be shot ” ; and from satan@hell.com , “ I ’m coming to get you and when I do , I ’ll waterboard you ” — all of it wildly uninformed .
I ’ve written a lot about the Viet Nam period , about politics , about schools and social justice , and I read and speak about all of it .
I encourage people to argue , to agree or disagree , to discuss and struggle , to engage in conversation .
I believe deeply in the pedagogical possibilities of dialogue — of listening with the possibility of being changed , and of speaking with the possibility of being heard — and I believe in revitalizing the public square , resisting the eclipse of the public and expanding the public space , searching for a more robust and participatory democracy .
Talking to one another can help .
So in that spirit here is another attempt at clarity :
1. Regrets .
I ’m often quoted saying that I have “ no regrets . ”
This is not true .
For anyone paying attention — and I try to stay wide - awake to the world around me all / ways — life brings misgivings , doubts , uncertainty , loss , regret .
I ’m sometimes asked if I regret anything I did to oppose the war in Viet Nam , and I say “ no , I do n’t regret anything I did to try to stop the slaughter of millions of human beings by my own government . ”
Sometimes I add , “ I do n’t think I did enough . ”
This is then elided : he has no regrets for setting bombs and thinks there should be more bombings .
The illegal , murderous , imperial war against Viet Nam was a catastrophe for the Vietnamese , a disaster for Americans , and a world tragedy .
Many of us understood this , and many tried to stop the war .
Those of us who tried recognize that our efforts were inadequate : the war dragged on for a decade , thousands were slaughtered every week , and we could n’t stop it .
In the end the U.S. military was defeated and the war ended , but we surely did n’t do enough .
2. Terror. Terrorism — according to both official U.S. policy and the U.N. — is the use or threat of random violence to intimidate , frighten , or coerce a population toward some political end .
This means , of course , that terrorism is not the exclusive province of a cult , a religious sect , or a group of fanatics .
It can be any of these , but it can also be — and often is — executed by governments and states .
A bombing in a café in Israel is terrorism , and an Israeli assault on a neighborhood in Gaza is terrorism ; the September 11 attacks were acts of terrorism , and the U.S. bombings in Viet Nam for a decade were acts of terrorism .
Terrorism is never justifiable , even in a just cause — the Union fight in the 1860 ’s was just , for example , but Shernan ’s March to the Sea was indefensible terror .
I ’ve never advocated terrorism , never participated in it , never defended it .
The U.S. government , by contrast , does it routinely and defends the use of it in its own cause consistently .
3. Imperialism .
I ’m against it , and if Sean Hannity and others were honest , this is the ground they would fight me on .
Capitalism played its role historically and is exhausted as a force for progress : built on exploitation , theft , conquest , war , and racism , capitalism and imperialism must be defeated and a world revolution — a revolution against war and racism and materialism , a revolution based on human solidarity and love , cooperation and the common good — must win .
We begin by releasing our most hopeful dreams and our most radical imaginations : a better world is both possible and necessary .
We need to bring our imaginations together and forge an unbreakable human alliance .
We need to unite to transform and save ourselves as we fight to change the world and save humanity .

Bullet - proof hoodie to go on sale
The hoodies are made from a fibre called Dyneema A bullet - proof hooded top designed to protect against street violence has been made by an east London firm .
The £ 300 " Defender " top will stop Magnum handgun bullets , according to the manufacturer Bladerunner , which also makes slash - proof vests .
Owner Barry Samms denied the hoodie was targeted at teenage gang members and said it was primarily aimed at US customers concerned about gun violence .
Mothers Against Murder and Aggression said it spread " the fear factor " .
Lyn Costello , founder of the campaign group also known as Mamaa , said it sent out the wrong message .
We want to encourage them away from a life of violence not towards it
Lyn Costello , Mamaa " I do n't think it helps .
It spreads the fear factor and makes teenagers think they are invincible .
" It disgusts me that companies think about money rather than the safety of our kids .
" We want to encourage them away from a life of violence not towards it . "
A total of 11 teenagers have died as a result of violent crime in London since the start of the year .
Thinner material
The top is made from a fibre called Dyneema , which is thinner than the material used to make traditional bullet - proof vests .
Mr Samms , who owns the Romford firm , said he could only manufacture a hoodie because it was not possible to put a zip into bullet - proof material .
I do n't see that there is much of a market in the UK , because luckily we have such strict gun laws
Barry Samms , Bladerunner
He said : " Adults wear hoodies too .
My mum wears one and you do n't see her hanging out on street corners .
" We really thought last year when we brought out the stab - proof top that they were going to be for teenagers , yet they are the last people to actually buy one . "
He said a mother from Walthamstow , east London , whose son had been mugged three times , was among customers asking for bullet - proof clothing .
" We 've had quite a lot of interest from the US and a couple of calls from the UK , " he said .
" I do n't see that there is much of a market in the UK , because luckily we have such strict gun laws .
" People do n't have to go to such extremes to protect themselves over here . "

What are these ?
By CHRISTIAN GYSIN
The British Airways plane that crash landed at Heathrow today was a Boeing 777 - currently regarded as the safest aeroplane in the world by aviation experts .
The plane has only been in use for seven years and is the first aircraft of its kind to have been designed by computers and boasts the latest " avionic and navigational systems " .
The Boeing 777 has a number of variant models - such as the 777-200ER and 777-300 ER - but all the models being flown around the world currently have a clean safety record .
Scroll down for more ...
One of the most distinguishing features of the plane relates to its undercarriage and the six wheels attached to the main landing gear .
At present Singapore Airlines is the largest operator of the 777 with a fleet of 69 - while British Airways currently runs 43 of the wide - bodied twin engined airliners .
While there have been no " hull loss accidents " involving the planes , there have been a few incidents in recent years .
The one death involving a 777 was at Denver International airport in 2001 when a ground worker received fatal burns while refuelling BA flight 2019 .
The accident saw the aircraft 's wings badly scorched but repairs were carried out and the plane was soon back in service .
In August 2004 a Singapore Airlines 777-312 suffered an engine explosion as it took off from Melbourne airport .
This was later found to have been caused by erosion to high pressure " liners " within the Rolls - Royce engines .
And on March 1 , 2005 , there was a problem involving a Pakistan International Airlines 777-200 ER .
Fire was seen around the left " main landing gear " as it came in to land at Manchester International Airport .
The crew and passengers were evacuated and there was minor damage to the aircraft which was later repaired .
The most recent incident involving the 777 prior to today 's Heathrow emergency landing involved a Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777-200 ER on August 1 , 2005 .
The plane had taken off from Perth , Western Australia , en route to Kuala Lumpur when it started to " overspeed and stall " and then " pitch " at 41,000 feet .
The pilots executed an emergency landing at Perth and no one was injured .
Sony BMG is no stranger to piracy .
As one of the most vocal supporters of the RIAA and IFPI antipiracy efforts , the company has some experience hunting down and punishing consumers who do n't pay for its products .
The company is getting some experience on the other side of the table , however , now that it 's being sued for software piracy .
PointDev , a French software company that makes Windows administration tools , received a call from a Sony BMG IT employee for support .
After Sony BMG supplied a pirated license code for Ideal Migration , one of PointDev 's products , the software maker was able to mandate a seizure of Sony BMG 's assets .
The subsequent raid revealed that software was illegally installed on four of Sony BMG 's servers .
The Business Software Alliance , however , believes that up to 47 percent of the software installed on Sony BMG 's computers could be pirated .
These are some pretty serious — not to mention ironic — allegations against a company that 's gone so far as to install malware on consumers ' computers in the name of preventing piracy .
Sinking pirates can pay ( BSA )
While PointDev is claiming € 300,000 ( over $ 475,000 ) in damages in its suit against Sony BMG , Agustoni Paul - Henry , PointDev 's CEO , says ( from a Google translation of a French report ) that this is more about principle than money : " We are forced to watch every week if key software pirates are not [ sic ] on the Internet .
We are a small company of six employees .
Instead of trying to protect us , we could spend this time to develop ourselves . "
Paul - Henry thinks Sony BMG 's piracy of PointDev 's products is the fault of more than just a single employee ( again , translated ) : " I think piracy is linked to the policy of a company .
If the employee has the necessary funding to buy the software he needs , he will .
If this is not the case , he will find alternative ways , as the work must be done in one way or another . "
Certainly , one wonders what led to Sony BMG to steal PointDev 's product in the first place .
It 's a safe bet that the company can afford to pay for the necessary licenses , which leaves sheer laziness as the most likely culprit .
In any event , it 's absolutely inexcusable for a company that has been at the forefront of the antipiracy fight , going so far as to surreptitiously install rootkits on its customers '
PCs .

Facebook WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Senate voted Thursday to condemn an advertisement by the liberal anti-war group MoveOn.org that accused the top military commander in Iraq of betrayal .
The 72 - 25 vote condemned the full - page ad that appeared in The New York Times last week as Gen. David Petraeus , the top military commander in Iraq , testified on Capitol Hill .
The ad was headlined : " General Petraeus or General Betray Us ? Cooking the books for the White House . "
USA TODAY ON POLITICS : Candidates Clinton , Dodd vote ' no '
The ad became a life raft for the Republican party as the war debate kicked into high gear .
With several Republicans opposed to President Bush 's war strategy , GOP members were able to put aside their differences and rally around their disapproval of the ad .
Sen. Gordon Smith , one of the few Republican senators who supports legislation ordering troop withdrawals , told reporters Thursday he thought Petraeus ' testimony and the MoveOn.org ad were the two biggest factors in keeping Republicans from breaking ranks with the president : Petraeus ' testimony because it was persuasive and the MoveOn add because it went too far by attacking a popular uniformed officer .
" It was stupid on their part and disgraceful , " said Smith , R - Ore .
The resolution condemning the ad was sponsored by conservative Republican John Cornyn of Texas .
Voting against it were Democratic presidential hopefuls Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut .
Sen . Barack Obama of Illinois , another contender for the Democratic nomination , did not vote , although he voted minutes earlier for an alternative resolution by Sen.
Barbara Boxer , D - Calif .
That resolution condemned the MoveOn ad as an " unwarranted personal attack , " but also condemned political attack ads that questioned the patriotism of Sen.
John Kerry , D - Mass. , and former Sen. Max Cleland , D - Ga. , both Vietnam veterans .
USA TODAY ON POLITICS : MoveOn moves on with more ' betrayal '
In a news conference , President Bush denounced the ad as " disgusting " and criticized Democrats for not immediately condemning it .
" And that leads me to come to this conclusion : that most Democrats are afraid of irritating a left - wing group like MoveOn.org , or more afraid of irritating them , then they are of irritating the United States military , " Bush said Thursday .
Eli Pariser , executive director of the liberal group , responded : " What 's disgusting is that the president has more interest in political attacks than developing an exit strategy to get our troops out of Iraq and end this awful war . "
Democrats were reeling after failing to pass legislation Wednesday by Sen. Jim Webb , D - Va. , that would have required active - duty troops to spend as much time at home as they do in combat .
The 56 - 44 vote fell short of the 60 votes needed to cut off a GOP filibuster .
The legislation was seen as Democrats ' best shot at challenging Bush this year because of its pro-military premise .
It 's failure all but assured Democrats would not be able to muster the support for tougher bills ordering troops home by next summer .
" We have learned that the Republican Party is now openly advocating a permanent U.S. presence in Iraq that could continue for at least the next 50 years , " Webb said in a statement .
Momentum behind Webb 's bill stalled after Sen. John Warner , R - Va. , announced he had decided the consequences would be disastrous .
Warner , a former longtime chairman of the Armed Services Committee , had voted in favor of the measure in July but said he changed his mind after talking to senior military officials .
Hagel said the White House also " has been very effective at making this a loyalty test for the Republican Party . "
The 56 senators voting to advance the measure were 49 Democrats , six Republicans and Vermont independent Bernard Sanders .
Voting against it were 43 Republicans and Connecticut independent Joseph Lieberman .
The vote " means Congress will not intervene in the foreseeable future " in the war 's execution , Lieberman told reporters .
In coming days , the Senate plans to vote on legislation by Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , that would order combat troops home in nine months .
Levin , chairman of the Armed Services Committee , said his bill would allow some troops to remain behind to conduct such missions as counterterrorism and training the Iraqis ; he estimated the legislation , if enacted , would cut troop levels in Iraq by more than half .
The Senate also planned to vote on legislation by Sen. Russ Feingold , D - Wis. , and Reid , D - Nev. , that would cut off funding for combat next year .
The firm deadlines reflect a shift in strategy for Democrats , who had been pursuing a bipartisan compromise on war legislation .
But after last week 's testimony by Petraeus , Democrats calculated not enough Republicans were willing to break party ranks and support more tempered legislation calling for combat to end next summer .

D.B. Cooper Hijack Clue - Buried Parachute ( Photos )
FBI agents are looking into a discovery that could shed new light on the 1971 hijack case ofin Washington state .
The 36 year old mystery began when a man boarded a Northwest Orient flight from Portland , Oregon to Seattle , Washington .
He claimed to have a bomb and demanded a $ 200,000 ransom .
The passengers were released unharmed and the plane took off again with Cooper still on board .
He ordered the pilots to head for Mexico .
The hijacker , wearing a white parachute , exited the plane via the back stairs and parachuted with briefcase in hand .
Investigators believe he landed in extremely rough terrain in Clark County , Washington .
Investigators combed the rural areas in search of Cooper .
His story became one of folklore with much speculation about his brazen crime and escape .
In 1980 , a family on a picnic found $ 5,880 of Cooper 's money in a bag on a Columbia River beach , near Vancouver .
The FBI has determined that the location could not have been where Cooper 's parachute would have dropped him .
One theory is that the money may have washed down to the beach via the Washougal River .
Children playing outside their home near Amboy found the chute 's fabric sticking up from the ground in an area where their father had been grading a road , FBI agent Larry Carr said Tuesday .
They pulled it out as far as they could , then cut the parachute 's ropes with scissors .
Their father called the agency because he had seen a recent TV show detailing the 36 year old unsolved mystery .
When FBI agents overlaid the family 's address onto a map investigators made in the early days of the investigation , they learned another encouraging fact :
They lived right in Cooper 's most probable landing zone , between Green and Bald mountains .
Whether agents plan to further excavate the property is yet to be determined .
Undoubtedly , scientific analysis of the parachute fabric will be undertaken .
If it turns out to be D.B. Coopers parachute , it still leaves open the rest of the story .
With 21 pounds of $ 20 bills strapped to his body , he launched himself from a commercial aircraft .
Where did he go from there and where is he now ?
Agents do n't believe he survived the jump .
They have a partial DNA profile from the necktie that he left behind on the plane .
FBI agents released a good deal of information in 2007 in an attempt to get the public thinking about the case they have long ago dubbed ' Norjak ' .
Apparently that move paid off .
It was that TV broadcast that caused the family that unearthed the potential new clue to notify the FBI .
Check out two photos of the parachute after the jump - note that one has distinctive markings .
California , the epicenter of the housing bubble is facing difficult times .
It is becoming rather apparent that this housing bubble has the risk of causing a worldwide recession .
It is hard to imagine until you look at the facts how this bubble got out of hand so quickly .
The foreclosure problem is now hitting squarely on the state .
Last month for Southern California over 30 percent of homes sold were distressed properties .
This rate is only increasing and will put future pressure on prices on the downside since first , we still have record inventory and it is harder to get a home loan .
The latter part , getting a home loan is harder and for the right reasons .
Folks simply do not have the incomes to support the prices in many areas .
The only way they can purchase homes in these areas is with liar loans or sub - prime products but those are now largely absent and rightfully so .
We are left with the reality that prices were fueled by egregious lending practices and lack of income .
We can look at it another way .
It would n’t be such a problem if in the last 10 years incomes had doubled as well .
In California , per capita income went up 56 percent while the median home price in Los Angeles went up twice as fast .
So how can it be that prices became so disconnected ?
In this article we are going to examine multiple facets of the housing market both in California and nationally and demonstrate that areas like California , are in fact in a double bubble much larger than the average US market .
Los Angeles Median versus U.S. Home Median Price
Contrary to popular belief , buying a new US home and the median home price in California were n’t so much apart in 2000 .
Of course the new home of 2000 was probably a lot larger and nicer than the Los Angeles median priced home but the above chart gives us a good reference to begin with .
First , let us look at the start date of 2000 compared to the peak January prices of 2007 :
2000
Los Angeles Median : $ 192,000
US New Home Median : $ 163,500
* Difference of 17 percent
2007
Los Angeles Median : $ 520,000
US New Home Median : $ 254,400
* Difference of 104 percent
What happened during these seven years that sent Los Angeles home prices twice over the national new home median price ?
If in fact , the nation itself is facing a historic bubble which if we are to look at the above chart , is correcting quickly how historic is the California bubble ?
It is in fact unprecedented and there is really no model telling us how low prices can go since we never had a model showing us that prices could run up so quickly .
This for the most part was fueled by lax lending , financially irresponsible loan products , a Federal Reserve that was asleep at the wheel , and an economy that was addicted to easy credit .
No one really is without blame but some have a much larger share of the responsibility .
Both the national market and the California market are now facing steep corrections .
Southern California at the height of the bubble in 2005 was underwriting adjustable rate mortgages for 70 percent of all home purchases .
Even now with rates still at historical lows and Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and the FHA trying all they can to juice the market , have no products that make up for the gap that the NINJA products once took up .
Unless government backed institutions are able to come up with methods of not checking income and greasing the wheels , the bubble burst still has years to correct especially in double bubble areas like California .
New Homes Sold
We have never witnessed a national housing bubble .
It is the case that areas like Florida in the 1920s , Southern California in the early 1990s , and other cities like Boston have seen past bubbles but on a regional level .
The subdivision assembly line of building new homes has been developed to a science .
In no time in history were we able to build so many houses so quickly .
The only problem with this was that it was fueled at the expense of future expected growth and credit .
One thing to be said about credit and buying a home .
Mortgages in their 30 year flavor came about in the first half of the 1900s .
Previously , mortgages had a term of 15 years and at times , even 10 years .
This changed as the product evolved and the 30 year mortgage has been status quo for the majority of the 1900s .
The extension to 30 years made sense since many people , it was assumed , would be living in their homes long after their mortgage is paid off .
The logic of the utility of a mortgage evolved in the 1990s but morphed into another creature in the 2000s .
The mortgage product was viewed as a temporary bridge until you were able to sell your home , at a large profit of course , and were able to buy a much larger home in the parroted five to seven years .
The home , as you can see from the new home sales above , was now a pit stop until you were able to buy a newer and bigger home .
This psychology burned strongly and created the additional demand for new homes .
No longer was a home valued for its stability but was seen as a commodity with only future appreciation and zero risk involved .
The market created the consumer psychology which we are currently battling with .
The consumer for the most part is still expecting easy access to credit because that is how they were conditioned for a decade .
Per Capita Income
Let us look at the per capita income for California .
During this mega bubble decade , per capita income for Californians went up by 56 percent .
However , the median home price went up by over 100 + percent statewide .
Take a look at the above chart to see how per capita income has grown .
It may seem drastic but then examine that in conjunction with the first chart looking at Los Angeles County .
Growth in home prices stripped any gains in personal income .
Normally , we would see similar growth spurts if income went up as well .
This has occurred in the past during inflationary times .
Yet , we had a major disconnect here .
So how can it be that incomes grew at a much slower pace yet people were able to support higher prices ?
That is where the bridge of toxic loan products comes in :
Debt has exploded in the last decade .
Although it has slowly started to decrease simply because of a credit crunch , we are still in uncharted territory .
The amazing thing is banks would still be loaning out these banana republic loan products if it were n’t for the house of cards simply collapsing on its own weight .
That is why these bailouts and now there is talk of giving the Federal Reserve , a key culprit in this bubble , much more responsibility over Wall Street .
How is that even an option ?
First , we have Greenspan slashing rates fueling the bubble and also encouraging people to take adjustable rate mortgages .
Then , we have Ben Bernanke missing the mortgage debacle by saying in the first half of 2007 that sub-prime was contained and there was nothing to worry about .
Now , the panic has set in and he is doing a déjà Greenspan by slashing rates and showing him up , but bailing out an investment bank .
What makes anyone think that Bear Stearns is the only investment bank with problems ?
Does this mean that we ’ll be bailing out every other investment firm with problems ?
After all , if you dig into their balance sheets they all have toxic products linked to mortgages with the only difference being how much each one carries .
Homeownership and Vacancy Rates
As expected , the homeownership rate is declining nationwide but also in California .
With historically low affordability and stagnant wages , we can expect the homeownership rate to continue to decline .
In fact , in areas such as Los Angeles County where the majority of people rent , we can expect prices to decline even further because there is a ready market to absorb folks that decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to leave their homes .
In addition , from the graph above you can see that homeownership rates spiked from 1997 to 2006 in conjunction with the advent of toxic mortgage products .
This is another good leading indicator of a future bottom .
We can expect to hit 56 percent once again and then , we can start discussing if we are truly at any housing bottom .
And in a further sign of market distress , the vacancy rate in the state is increasing :
Well this is also being caused by the state of the dismal and looming short falls in the California state budget .
Keep in mind that many of the proposed job layoffs have not made their way onto the market .
This will only further drop the homeownership rate and also keep vacancy rates spiking .
Trade Balance
You may have noticed that many pundits have now been laying off the talk that a lower dollar will help us with exports .
Take a look at the above chart and you ’ll see that a lower dollar is actually doing very little in helping this situation .
Now why is that ?
For one , Americans are hyper - consumers .
Nowhere on this planet is there a people that spend so much money , usually on credit , and have a resiliency to keep on spending .
Many other nations including Japan have a higher per capita income and also , a strong savings rate .
Our savings rate is negative .
So a lower dollar is a double whammy since imports go up in price relative to the dollar and exporters abroad see Americans consuming less hurting their bottom line .
Having a low dollar policy is pennywise and pound foolish .
Most Americans get paid in dollars and consume very little domestic products .
The market for our exports is nowhere as strong as the market here is for imports .
To think this was going to be a remedy for our economy was somewhat baffling .
I was looking at the hottest growth sector and it is healthcare .
With an aging population , which of course is n’t out there producing and a younger population caring for them , which sectors are going to be producing these so called shadow exports ?
The market abroad is nowhere strong enough for it to avoid a recession .
Future Steps
We are going to face drastic changes in the next decade .
The concept of credit is going to radically shift and we are going to need to prioritize as a nation .
It is amazing how many people I talk to that simply cannot imagine coming up with 20 percent down for a home .
Or many do n’t grasp the idea that if you want to purchase a luxury item , maybe you should save up and pay for it in cash .
My guess is that as credit becomes more scarce , people will have to determine what is a need and a want .
Priorities are going to realign and maybe this double bubble pop will be a positive thing for the nation in the long term .
After all , how is becoming consumerist hamsters really positive for our nation ?
Would n’t it be better if we were prudent , industrious , and financially savvy ?
It is hard to stomach when I hear the government tell us , “ go out and spend those rebates ” since this is such a wrong course of action .
Hopefully people are now seeing through this and gearing up for tighter times and being positive that we do n’t repeat these same mistakes again .

I just watched “ Fitna , ” a 17 - minute film by Geert Wilders , head of the Dutch Freedom Party , which takes a hard - line stance against Muslim immigration .
Released on the Internet on Thursday , “ Fitna ” juxtaposes verses from the Koran with images and speeches from the world of jihad .
Heads cut off , bodies blown apart , gays executed , toddlers taught to denounce Jews as “ apes and pigs , ” imams calling for global domination , protesters holding up signs reading “ God Bless Hitler ” and “ Freedom go to Hell ” -- these are just some of the powerful images from “ Fitna , ” an Arabic word that means “ ordeal . ”
Predictably , various Muslim governments have condemned the film .
Half the Jordanian parliament voted to sever ties with the Netherlands .
Egypt ’s grand imam threatened “ severe ” consequences if the Dutch government did n’t ban the film .
Meanwhile , European and U.N. leaders are going through the usual motions of theatrical hand - wringing , heaping all of their anger on Wilders for sowing “ hatred . ”

Me ?
I keep thinking about Jesus fish .
During a 1991 visit to Istanbul , a buddy and I found ourselves in a small restaurant drinking , dancing and singing with a bunch of middle - class Turkish businessmen , mostly shop owners .
It was a hilariously joyful evening , even though they spoke nearly no English and we spoke considerably less Turkish .
At the end of the night , after imbibing unquantifiable quantities of raki , an ouzo - like Turkish liquor , one of the men came up to me and gave me a worn - out business card .
On the back , he ’d scribbled an image .
It was little more than a curlicue , but he seemed intent on showing it to me ( and nobody else ) .
It was , I realized , a Jesus fish .
It was an eye - opening moment for me , though obviously trivial compared with the experiences of others .
Here in this cosmopolitan and self - styled European city , this fellow felt the need to surreptitiously clue me in that he was a Christian just like me ( or so he thought ) .

Traditionally , the fish pictogram conjures the miracle of the loaves and fishes as well as the Greek word IXOYE , which not only means fish but serves as an acronym , in Greek , for “ Jesus Christ the Son of God [ Is ] Savior . ”
Christians persecuted by the Romans used to draw the Jesus fish in the dirt with a stick or a finger as a way to tip off fellow Christians that they were n’t alone .
In America , the easiest place to find this ancient symbol is on the back of cars .
Recently , however , it seems as if Jesus fish have become outnumbered by Darwin fish .
No doubt you ’ve seen these too .
The fish symbol is “ updated ” with little feet coming off the bottom , and “ IXOYE ” or “ Jesus ” is replaced with either “ Darwin ” or “ Evolve . ”
I find Darwin fish offensive .
First , there ’s the smugness .
The undeniable message : Those Jesus fish people are less evolved , less sophisticated than we Darwin fishers .
The hypocrisy is even more glaring .
Darwin fish are often stuck next to bumper stickers promoting tolerance or admonishing random motorists that “ hate is not a family value . ”
But the whole point of the Darwin fish is intolerance ; similar mockery of a cherished symbol would rightly be condemned as bigoted if aimed at blacks or women or , yes , Muslims .

As Christopher Caldwell once observed in the Weekly Standard , Darwin fish flout the agreed - on etiquette of identity politics .
“ Namely :
It ’s acceptable to assert identity and abhorrent to attack it .
A plaque with ‘ Shalom ’ written inside a Star of David would hardly attract notice ; a plaque with ‘ Usury ’ written inside the same symbol would be an outrage . ”
But the most annoying aspect of the Darwin fish is the false bravado it represents .
It ’s a courageous pose without consequence .
Like so much other Christian - baiting in American popular culture , sporting your Darwin fish is a way to speak truth to power on the cheap .
Whatever the faults of “ Fitna , ” it ai n’t no Darwin fish .
Geert Wilders ’ film could very , very easily get him killed .
( He ’s already guarded around the clock . )
It essentially picks up the work of Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh , who was murdered in 2004 by a jihadi for criticizing Islam .

“ Fitna ” is certainly provocative , yet it has good reason to provoke .
A cancer of violence , bigotry and cruelty is metastasizing within the Islamic world .
It ’s fine for Muslim moderates to say they are n’t part of the cancer ; and that some have , in response to the film , is a positive sign .
But more often , diagnosing or even observing this cancer -- in film , book or cartoon -- is dubbed “ intolerant ” while calls for violence , censorship and even murder are treated as understandable , if regrettable , expressions of well - deserved anger .
It ’s not that secular progressives support Muslim religious fanatics , but they reserve their passion and scorn for religious Christians who are neither fanatical nor inclined to use violence .
The Darwin fish ostensibly symbolizes the superiority of progressive - minded science over backward - looking faith .
I think this is a false juxtaposition , but I would have a lot more respect for the folks who believe it if they aimed their brave contempt for religion at those who might behead them for it .

France said on Thursday an Iranian rocket Tehran says is intended to put a satellite into orbit is in fact a missile that cannot navigate in space , and added to concerns that the technology is aimed at making weapons .
On Monday , Iran launched what it said was a rocket designed to carry a locally - made research satellite .
" This new test , presented by the Iranian authorities as the illustration of a space programme when the missile in question does not have extra-atmospheric capabilities , is a further source of concern , " French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Pascale Andreani said on Thursday .

Yesterday I talked about the cubes { 1 , 8 , 27 , 64 , 125 , ...} and how their first differences { 7 , 19 , 37 , 61 , ...} might at first seem to lack an obvious pattern , but taking the second differences { 12 , 18 , 24 , ...} takes you down to the simply related level .
Taking the third differences { 6 , 6 , ...} brings us to the perfectly stable level , where chaos dissolves into order .
But this ( as I noted ) is a handpicked example .
Perhaps the " messy real world " lacks the beauty of these abstract mathematical objects ?
Perhaps it would be more appropriate to talk about neuroscience or gene expression networks ?
Abstract math , being constructed solely in imagination , arises from simple foundations - a small set of initial axioms - and is a closed system ; conditions that might seem unnaturally conducive to neatness .
Which is to say :
In pure math , you do n't have to worry about a tiger leaping out of the bushes and eating Pascal 's Triangle .
So is the real world uglier than mathematics ?
Strange that people ask this .
I mean , the question might have been sensible two and a half millennia ago ...
Back when the Greek philosophers were debating what this " real world " thingy might be made of , there were many positions .
Heraclitus said , " All is fire . "
Thales said , " All is water . "
Pythagoras said , " All is number . "
Score : Heraclitus 0 Thales 0 Pythagoras 1
Beneath the complex forms and shapes of the surface world , there is a simple level , an exact and stable level , whose laws we name " physics " .
This discovery , the Great Surprise , has already taken place at our point in human history - but it does not do to forget that it was surprising .
Once upon a time , people went in search of underlying beauty , with no guarantee of finding it ; and once upon a time , they found it ; and now it is a known thing , and taken for granted .
Then why can't we predict the location of every tiger in the bushes as easily as we predict the sixth cube ?
I count three sources of uncertainty even within worlds of pure math - two obvious sources , and one not so obvious .
The first source of uncertainty is that even a creature of pure math , living embedded in a world of pure math , may not know the math .
Humans walked the Earth long before Galileo / Newton / Einstein discovered the law of gravity that prevents us from being flung off into space .
You can be governed by stable fundamental rules without knowing them .
There is no law of physics which says that laws of physics must be explicitly represented , as knowledge , in brains that run under them .
We do not yet have the Theory of Everything .
Our best current theories are things of math , but they are not perfectly integrated with each other .
The most probable explanation is that - as has previously proved to be the case - we are seeing surface manifestations of deeper math .
So by far the best guess is that reality is made of math ; but we do not fully know which math , yet .
But physicists have to construct huge particle accelerators to distinguish between theories - to manifest their remaining uncertainty in any visible fashion .
That physicists must go to such lengths to be unsure , suggests that this is not the source of our uncertainty about stock prices .
The second obvious source of uncertainty is that even when you know all the relevant laws of physics , you may not have enough computing power to extrapolate them .
We know every fundamental physical law that is relevant to a chain of amino acids folding itself into a protein .
But we still can't predict the shape of the protein from the amino acids .
Some tiny little 5 - nanometer molecule that folds in a microsecond is too much information for current computers to handle ( never mind tigers and stock prices ) .
Our frontier efforts in protein folding use clever approximations , rather than the underlying Schrödinger equation .
When it comes to describing a 5 - nanometer object using really basic physics , over quarks - well , you do n't even bother trying .
We have to use instruments like X - ray crystallography and NMR to discover the shapes of proteins that are fully determined by physics we know and a DNA sequence we know .
We are not logically omniscient ; we cannot see all the implications of our thoughts ; we do not know what we believe .
The third source of uncertainty is the most difficult to understand , and Nick Bostrom has written a book about it .
Suppose that the sequence { 1 , 8 , 27 , 64 , 125 , ...} exists ; suppose that this is a fact .
And suppose that atop each cube is a little person - one person per cube - and suppose that this is also a fact .
If you stand on the outside and take a global perspective - looking down from above at the sequence of cubes and the little people perched on top - then these two facts say everything there is to know about the sequence and the people .
But if you are one of the little people perched atop a cube , and you know these two facts , there is still a third piece of information you need to make predictions : " Which cube am I standing on ? "
You expect to find yourself standing on a cube ; you do not expect to find yourself standing on the number 7 .
Your anticipations are definitely constrained by your knowledge of the basic physics ; your beliefs are falsifiable .
But you still have to look down to find out whether you 're standing on 1728 or 5177717 .
If you can do fast mental arithmetic , then seeing that the first two digits of a four - digit cube are 17__ will be sufficient to guess that the last digits are 2 and 8 .
Otherwise you may have to look to discover the 2 and 8 as well .
To figure out what the night sky should look like , it 's not enough to know the laws of physics .
It 's not even enough to have logical omniscience over their consequences .
You have to know where you are in the universe .
You have to know that you 're looking up at the night sky from Earth .
The information required is not just the information to locate Earth in the visible universe , but in the entire universe , including all the parts that our telescopes can't see because they are too distant , and different inflationary universes , and alternate Everett branches .
It 's a good bet that " uncertainty about initial conditions at the boundary " is really indexical uncertainty .
But if not , it 's empirical uncertainty , uncertainty about how the universe is from a global perspective , which puts it in the same class as uncertainty about fundamental laws .
Wherever our best guess is that the " real world " has an irretrievably messy component , it is because of the second and third sources of uncertainty - logical uncertainty and indexical uncertainty .
Ignorance of fundamental laws does not tell you that a messy - looking pattern really is messy .
It might just be that you have n't figured out the order yet .
But when it comes to messy gene expression networks , we 've already found the hidden beauty - the stable level of underlying physics .
Because we 've already found the master order , we can guess that we wo n't find any additional secret patterns that will make biology as easy as a sequence of cubes .
Knowing the rules of the game , we know that the game is hard .
We do n't have enough computing power to do protein chemistry from physics ( the second source of uncertainty ) and evolutionary pathways may have gone different ways on different planets ( the third source of uncertainty ) .
New discoveries in basic physics wo n't help us here .
If you were an ancient Greek staring at the raw data from a biology experiment , you would be much wiser to look for some hidden structure of Pythagorean elegance , all the proteins lining up in a perfect icosahedron .
But in biology we already know where the Pythagorean elegance is , and we know it 's too far down to help us overcome our indexical and logical uncertainty .
Similarly , we can be confident that no one will ever be able to predict the results of certain quantum experiments , only because our fundamental theory tells us quite definitely that different versions of us will see different results .
If your knowledge of fundamental laws tells you that there 's a sequence of cubes , and that there 's one little person standing on top of each cube , and that the little people are all alike except for being on different cubes , and that you are one of these little people , then you know that you have no way of deducing which cube you 're on except by looking .
The best current knowledge says that the " real world " is a perfectly regular , deterministic , and very large mathematical object which is highly expensive to simulate .
So " real life " is less like predicting the next cube in a sequence of cubes , and more like knowing that lots of little people are standing on top of cubes , but not knowing who you personally are , and also not being very good at mental arithmetic .
Our knowledge of the rules does constrain our anticipations , quite a bit , but not perfectly .
There , now does n't that sound like real life ?
But uncertainty exists in the map , not in the territory .
If we are ignorant of a phenomenon , that is a fact about our state of mind , not a fact about the phenomenon itself .
Empirical uncertainty , logical uncertainty , and indexical uncertainty are just names for our own bewilderment .
The best current guess is that the world is math and the math is perfectly regular .
The messiness is only in the eye of the beholder .
Even the huge morass of the blogosphere is embedded in this perfect physics , which is ultimately as orderly as { 1 , 8 , 27 , 64 , 125 , ...} .
So the Internet is not a big muck ... it 's a series of cubes .
Monday , some readers and callers to the Sentinel expressed shock that police knew what was going on and yet nobody was arrested as they drove away from the gathering , apparently under the influence of marijuana .
Grant Boles , a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol in Aptos , said the CHP made no arrests Sunday …
Location :
This year 's 4/20 holiday was bigger and bolder than ever before , generating big headlines big web traffic , and really really big pot parties .
Even the Drug Czar participated by suggesting the holiday is dangerous and warning parents to keep a close eye on their children .
But for all the fanfare , no one got hurt on 4/20 .
I do n't think one could possibly overstate how revealing that simple fact really is .
Scanning the 4/20 news coverage , one fails utterly to find examples of the sort of negative outcomes we 've been told to expect when people use this drug .
Last week , more people got more stoned more publicly than any other day of the year .
If pot is dangerous , this would be the time to learn that lesson in stark terms .
So where are the hospitalizations ?
The fights ?
The car accidents ?
In Boulder , CO a turnout of 10,000 produced no arrests or mishaps .
This means not only that police were ignoring open marijuana use , but that the users were remarkably well behaved under the influence of the drug .
They did n't fight , steal , damage property , or do anything else that would have forced the police to take action .
Out of 10,000 people at a completely disorganized marijuana - themed event , nothing went wrong at all .
Similarly , at UC Santa Cruz a crowd of 6,000 led police to express embarrassment at their failure to suppress marijuana culture .
And again , there were no arrests made for any offenses of any kind .
Arrests and injuries are typical at sporting events , but not these giant impromptu 4/20 pot parties .
This quote from the Santa Cruz Sentinel illustrates that point nicely : Amazingly , the California Highway Patrol had an uneventful afternoon on the biggest pot-smoking day of the year .
I guess no hippies crashed their cars that day .
No one swerved over the yellow line and got pinched for DUI .
You can bet we'd know about it if they had .
I 'm not saying people should get stoned and drive .
I 'm asking where to find the carnage we 've been told to expect from stoned drivers .
So often , we 're told that if we change our marijuana laws , everyone will get stoned and it will be horrible .
Yet , when marijuana is used gratuitously by massive crowds at unsanctioned events , negative outcomes are extraordinarily rare .
The drug is simply not effective at hurting people .
The whole " marijuana is harmless " argument for reforming marijuana laws certainly has its limitations , but damn , look how amazingly safe marijuana is !
Wow !

Incredible as it seems , live high voltage transmission lines can be worked barehanded .
According to ‘
" Live wire work is extremely common on low voltage distribution systems within the UK as all linesmen are trained to work ' live ' .
Live wire work on high voltage distribution systems within the UK is carried out by specialist teams .
These teams are sometimes referred to as ' Hot Glove ' teams " .
Other linemen workers use some kind of cages to move along the power lines .
Their work is also very dangerous and spectacular .

First time I saw these guys over the power lines I thought it was a fake .
But linemen who work from helicopters are for real and they are considered a highly specialized area of line work ; few linemen have the special training to perform it .
Incredible as it seems , live high voltage transmission lines can be worked barehanded .
According to ‘ Wikipedia ’ , " the lineman must be isolated from the ground by using an insulated bucket truck or other method .
The lineman wears special conductive clothing which is connected to the live power line , at which point the line and the lineman are at the same potential , allowing the lineman to handle the wire safely " .

Fox News : Caffeinated drink a gateway to cocaine addiction Nick Langewis and David Edwards
Published : Thursday April 10 , 2008

Print This Email This " Pure Uncut Energy , " says the packaging of a white , powdery energy drink mix sold as Blow , containing 240 mg of caffeine per serving .
One 8.3 - ounce can of energy beverage Red Bull , in comparison , contains 80 mg of caffeine , and a 12 - ounce serving of Jolt Cola comes in with 72 mg .
Blow , also slang for the early - 20th century toothache remedy turned illegal recreational drug cocaine , comes in such presentations as the " Recreational User Pack " and " Fiender 's Hook - Up . "
Accessories include a mirror and fake credit card that can be used to separate the substance into " lines , " much like those one would prepare with intent to force a powder such as cocaine to transcend the blood - brain barrier and enter one 's bloodstream , with the assistance of a rapid intake of air through the nasal cavity , to induce a pleasurable chemical reaction ( or , " to snort it to get high " ) .
A letter from the Food and Drug Administration has raised concerns with the product 's manufacturers about its suggestive marketing tactics .
The agency shares the concerns of the segment 's skeptical panelists that Blow could pose a public health risk .
" We have a tremendous amount of respect for the FDA , " says Logan Gola , CEO of Las Vegas - based Blow Energy Drink Mix , " but ... we feel we 're marketing the product legally , and most importantly our attorneys feel that we 're marketing the product legally and lawfully . "
" We 're not marketing towards kids at all , " Gola adds .
" We 're an adult product , and we firmly believe that adults have the freedom to choose which products they support . "
The drug references , Gola continues , are meant to cater to an adult sense of humor rather than encourage illegal drug use .
He insists that Blow is only meant to compete with other energy drinks .
" We go after the party crowd - - you know , the edgy crowd -- and they absolutely love Blow . "

The new issue of Democracy : A Journal of Ideas ( registration , but easy and free ) is very interesting .
Here is one proposal , from Jason Bordoff :
Drivers who are
similar in all respects–age , gender , driving record–pay roughly the
same premiums whether they drive 5,000 or 50,000 miles per year , even
though the likelihood of a collision increases with each mile .
This
“ all - you - can - drive ” pricing scheme imposes significant costs on
society : more traffic accidents , congestion , air pollution , greenhouse
gas emissions , and dependence on oil .
… the effect of PAYD on miles traveled and gasoline
consumption would be significant : a 6.5 percent reduction under
conservative estimates , and others suggest the reduction could be as
high as 10 percent .
To put that in perspective , it would take an
81 - cent - per - gallon increase in the gas tax to achieve a 6.5 percent
reduction in miles driven .
The debates tonight on ABC in case you missed them , were the most revealing episode in the entire campaign for the 2008 Presidential nomination of both parties .
It was n’t that there was anything that has n’t been said before , it was because of the way that things were said .
On the Republican side , there were total mean - spirited jabs at each other that portrayed the candidates to be more like a crowd of cat - callers than Presidential candidates .
They incessantly sparred with each other like men at a bar that have let their guard down after a few drinks and were showing their true selves rather than the cultivated side of their personality that they use for business .
They might have agreed with each other in principle , but the slightest variance in talking about Republican virtue was greeted with scathing comments from the others .
The one who was the primary recipient in the barely concealed barbs was predictably , Ron Paul .
The Representative from Texas did not take it and grin ; he came back at his fellow Republicans in a way that infuriated them .
He talked about their views and said that they will never be able to put any economic changes on the table until they stop the trillion dollar drain on the budget that the wars are costing the American taxpayers .
The entire debate was mostly about the war on terror and continuing the war in Iraq .
Immigration was a big subject with McCain and Romney sparring like two prize - fighters .
The entire Republican debate was marked by periodic praise for George W. Bush that showed either their ignorance of the current approval ratings of the current President , or just their ignorance period .
The Democratic debate was narrowed down to four , with Sen. Dodd and Sen. Biden out of the race and Gravel and Kucinich not invited .
The debate hardly lacked in substance however as the four engaged each other in rugged verbal combat , tough words for each other but not as sleazy as the Republicans that came on first .
The high point for me was when Sen .
Edwards stated that it was impossible to call for changes in government corruption from the corporate sector when you take money from lobbyists and PAC ’s that donate to your political campaign , an obvious attack on Sen. Hillary Clinton .
Clinton fired back by saying that smooth words and high principled speeches do n’t necessarily mean that the person uttering them can actually lead a country .
Sen .
Obama came back at her and said that words can indeed inspire the people of this nation to do what is necessary in order to turn this nation around in the right direction .
All four agreed that George W. Bush ’s tenure in office had put the future of this nation in peril .
Finally , Hillary Clinton said that she would start moving troops out of Iraq within her first ninety days in office and that she would leave no troops in Iraq .
Surprisingly , no other candidate asked her why she had made such a surprising about - face from her earlier stance on Iraq .
Maybe they were all just grateful that she did .
Gov. Richardson seemed dismayed about the attacks that the candidates made on each other .
He should have been happy that they did n’t attack him .
Maybe if he had better than a 4 % showing in Iowa they would have .
I imagine that they felt he was n’t worth the effort .
Personally , I like Bill Richardson but I ’m sick to death of him giving out his resume as an answer to every question he answers .
He might do everyone a favor by pulling out of the race .
Maybe if he pulled out the media might have room for Kucinich and Gravel .
I do n’t understand why they ban these two candidates .
Obama and Edwards seem to bring enough venom for the corporate led special interest groups that whatever Gravel and Kucinich could bring to the table certainly could n’t add to it .
They might even act as “ calming ” figures .
The difference between the two party ’s candidates was certainly dramatic .
Maybe there is hope for the two - party system after all , or maybe this is just a violent hang - over from the Bush years .
It was a good idea to have these debates back - to - back .
The American people got a chance to see the difference up close and personal .
If I were a Republican , I would be horrified by the spectacle I saw tonight .
That ’s the way I see it .
A Sydney woman has been ordered to stand trial after pleading not guilty to the stabbing murders of her father and sister .
The 26 - year - old will also defend a charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to murder her mother .
The attack allegedly happened at the family 's Revesby home in Sydney 's south - west in July last year .
The Supreme Court was told mental health will be an issue at the trial , which will start in July .
It is alleged that the woman was denied psychiatric help because of her parents ' belief in Scientology .
LONDON
PARIS
SAN FRANCISCO
The words are taken verbatim from the official Chinese news agency , Xinhua .
The pictures are n't .
The heavy snow in London exerted slim effect on people 's passion of seeing Beijing Olympic flame as large crowds lined along the street to greet the relay of torch on Sunday in the host city of 2012 Games .
Dragon and lion dancing performance dressed up the Chinatown like a festival .
Large groups of Chinese in squares or concentration point waited the flame hours before its arrival .
" The Olympic games are very important for all Chinese .
In Chinatown , everyone is very anxious to see the torch pass , " said London Chinese Community Center spokeswoman Annie Wu. The Notting Hill Gate in west London greeted the Beijing Olympic torch on Sunday morning with a mini carnival reminiscent of the annual carnival that draws over one million revelers .
People with families and toddlers turned out in the hundreds braving wintry snow to line the streets in Notting Hill Gate and celebrate the Olympic torch .
Chinese ambassador to Britain Fu Ying ran her leg in Chinatown , who was a hot topic of British media over whether she would be a torchbearer .
"
It 's a great day for both London and Beijing .
The two cities meet each other today , " said Fu . " I hope the Olympic flame can splash peace , harmony and friendship to the world .
I 'm happy to see large groups of residents give their warm welcome to the flame 's arrival including the elderly and the young .
"
It 's really a great pleasure to see Londoners smiling and waving .
" Tens of thousands of spectators went to the street of Paris to watch the torch relay , which covers 28 kilometers starting the Eiffel Tower and ending at the Stade ( Stadium ) Charlety in the south of the city .
Many on - lookers waved Chinese flags to cheer the event or put flag stickers on the face .
One of them told Xinhua that some of the flags were hand - made by themselves or posted by their friends in China .
The torch relay resumed on ground at around 2 p.m. ( 1200 GMT ) on Monday after the torch was twice put onto bus earlier for technical reasons , a Xinhua photographer following the torch relay witnessed .
Spectators of the Beijing Olympic torch relay were greatly annoyed and angered by Tibetan separatists and their supporters attempting to disrupt the Monday event in Paris , the fifth leg of the flame 's global tour .
" We 've come here only to watch the torch relay , " said a Paris student , who gave his first name as Mark .
" What in the world does this have anything to do with us except for annoying us ? " he added , pointing to Tibetan separatist demonstrators .
Foreign media reports saying the Olympic torch was forced to be extinguished during the relay in Paris were false , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu said early Tuesday morning .
The modes of the relay in Paris were temporarily changed to safeguard the security and dignity of the Olympic torch under the circumstances there , Jiang said in a statement released by the ministry .
"
The reports by foreign media are false in claiming that the Olympic torch was forced to be extinguished during its relay in Paris , " said Jiang .
As the Olympic torch has traveled to San Francisco , the city is extending its arms to embrace the flame with pride , emotions and courage .
Despite criticism for giving the green light to the Olympic torch relay , San Francisco mayor Garvin Newsom said the city takes great pride in hosting the great event .
" The Olympic torch represents the journey for excellence , and we are honored to have the opportunity to host and contribute to the Beijing Olympic Journey of Harmony , " Newsom said in an interview with Xinhua days before the torch relay .
The city is the torch 's only stop in the continent as part of its worldwide relay , called " Journey of Harmony " .
With iconic landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge , the Transamerican Building and the famous Victorian houses , San Francisco is an ideal backdrop as the world looks on to the extraordinary event , according to the mayor .
The relay ran for two and half hours along the San Francisco area with the closing ceremony held at the airport .
Thousands of people gathered along the route of the relay under a sunny sky to show their support for the torch run in the U.S. city , which is the sixth leg of the torch 's global journey .
Chinese Ambassador to the United States Zhou Wenzhong said on Wednesday that the Olympic torch relay in San Francisco was " successful " under enthusiastic reception of the American public , including the Chinese Americans and overseas Chinese .
" The Olympics belongs to all , and the Olympic torch carries and passes around the Olympic spirit and advocates peace , friendship , harmony and cooperation , " the ambassador said in a statement .
In September , a team of surgeons and immunologists at Duke University proposed a reason for the appendix , declaring it a “ safe house ” for beneficial bacteria .
Attached like a little wiggly worm at the beginning of the large intestine , the 2 - to 4 - inch - long blind - ended tube seems to have no effect on digestion , so biologists have long been stumped about its purpose .
That is , until biochemist and immunologist William Parker became interested in biofilms , closely bound communities of bacteria .
In the gut , biofilms aid digestion , make vital nutrients , and crowd out harmful invaders .
Upon investigation , Parker and his colleagues found that in humans , the greatest concentration of biofilms was in the appendix ; in rats and baboons , biofilms are concentrated in the cecum , a pouch that sits at the same location .
The shape of the appendix is perfectly suited as a sanctuary for bacteria :
Its narrow opening prevents an influx of the intestinal contents , and it ’s situated inaccessibly outside the main flow of the fecal stream .
Parker suspects that it acts as a reservoir of healthy , protective bacteria that can replenish the intestine after a bacteria - depleting diarrheal illness like cholera .
Where such diseases are rampant , Parker says , “ if you do n’t have something like the appendix to harbor safe bacteria , you have less of a survival advantage . ”

SEOUL , South Korea , Dec. 7  A Hong Kong - registered oil tanker leaked 10,810 tons , or 66,000 barrels , of crude oil off South Korea ’s stormy west coast today , officials said , in what was estimated to be the nation ’s largest maritime oil spill .
A band of oil about three miles long was snaking slowly toward the coast , which is dotted with scenic beaches , wildlife habitats and oyster and other fishing beds .
“ So far , we have no reports of damage , ” said Kim Jong - seok , an official at the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry .
“ Much will depend on how the sea currents move in coming hours .
We have 40 vessels out there fighting the oil spill . ”
The spill occurred when a vessel carrying a crane crashed into the 147,000 - ton tanker Hebei Spirit this morning about five nautical miles off the coast near Taean , 90 miles southwest of Seoul .

Last night I saw some pundits on the news discussing the results of a poll .
When Americans were asked if they would vote for an African - American for president , more than 9 out of 10 people said yes .
But when asked if they knew anyone who would not vote for an African - American , about half said they know such a person .
One inference you might make from these results , and the one drawn by the pundits on the show , is that people are secretly racists .
They tell pollsters they are not bigots , but once inside the voting booth they are .
The other inference is something I call math .
If there are ten friends , and only one is a racist , then it is true that 90 percent are not racists while everyone knows someone who is .
It ’s that one guy .
Here ’s the way I think the election is going to go down .
Obama will get nominated , and polls will start to show he will get 95 % of the African - American vote .
This will frighten all the racists who had n’t planned to vote , and get them to the polling places , thus handing the election to John McCain , even if he is only being kept alive by machines at that point .
Here ’s a little unscientific survey question of my own :
1 . Do you personally know anyone who thinks Obama is a Muslim ?
2 . Do you personally know anyone who suspects Obama might secretly hate America and is running for President to destroy it from within ?
I know registered voters in both of those categories .
That 's why your next president will be named McCain .
That 's just a prediction , not a preference .
Joe wrote yesterday about an ad Hillary is running in Wisconsin , claiming that Obama is ducking debates .
Obama hits back today with a new ad ( you can see the video via the link ) :
After 18 debates , with two more coming , Hillary says Barack Obama is ducking debates ?
It ’s the same old politics , of phony charges and false attacks .
On health care , even Bill Clinton ’s own Labor Secretary says Obama covers more people than Hillary and does more to cut costs , saving $ 2,500 for the typical family .
Obama ’s housing plan , it stems foreclosures and cracks down on crooked lenders
That ’s change we can believe in .
I ’m Barack Obama and I approve this message .

A human rights lawsuit filed on behalf of prominent US government agencies - including the Central Intelligence Agency and the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base - has been filed in a European Court .
The lawsuit , which plaintiffs also sent to Foreign Minister David Miliband - asks that British websites cease engaging in " cruel , unusual and persistent " interrogation techniques which leave the US visitors disorientated .
The lawsuit says that government personnel visiting sites ( including The Register ) have been subjected to " cruel and inhuman " requests for survey information , often for prolonged periods .
The British interrogators , says the lawsuit , bombard visitors with humiliating questions such as " How much do you earn ? " , " Is your IT Department really going Green ? " and " Mobile phone Lanyards - do they make you truly connected ?
Do you know where yours is ? " .
Disinformation and disorientation techniques are also used in a violation of the Geneva Convention on Web Surfing .
Visitors are told " this will only take 20 minutes of your time , Thanks ! " and then subjected to a disorientation program .
Methods include graphics of exploding donuts that roll across the screen ( until the survey is answered ) and promotion material which repeats on a endless loop , forcing visitors into a " stress position " .
The lawsuits highlights the ( illegal ) use of Macromedia Flash for surveys - itself a violation of the Convention - and documents techniques such as check boxes that can't be unchecked , and removing the ability to go backwards on multipage forms , which leave the respondent unable to function logically .
A human rights lawyer told The Register : " Torture never produces truthful results .
If someone is shining a light in my eyes screaming , ' Are you going to deploy fibre based storage in your enterprise in 2008 ? ' , I 'm just going to lie . " ®

Click to viewWhen you 're installing Windows in a virtual machine or on old , slow hardware , you want the leanest , meanest and fastest - running configuration possible .
Most of the time , you want the best from your operating system , including all the bells and whistles .
Other times , you do n't want the default , bloated Windows installation , with every single built - in feature slowing you down .
Luckily , whether you want to put Windows on a diet in a virtual machine or you want to get Windows up and running all snappy - like on older hardware , you 've got a handful of excellent and free options at your disposal .
Let 's take a look at a few ways to trim down your Windows installation so that it takes up less space on your hard drive and eats less RAM while it 's running .
Advertisement
What 's the Point ?
Advertisement
There are a lot of reasons you might be interested in lightening up and streamlining a Windows installation .
I happen to want a super - lightweight version of Windows to run on VMware Fusion on my Mac , so I can run my must - have Windows applications without allocating a lot of hard drive space or memory to the virtual machine .
That means that the virtual machine will run more quickly and take up fewer resources on my Mac .
On the other hand , a lightweight Windows install is also perfect for older hardware that just can't keep up with XP .
In fact , your hardware does n't even have to be that bad to still enjoy benefits of this process .
A slimmed down Windows install is also appealing for the performance gains it affords , because it allows your computer to allocate more memory and resources to individual programs rather than the operating system as a whole .

Whatever your reasons for wanting a lightweight Windows install , I 'm going to focus on a couple of methods for shrinking Windows XP below .
In my examples I 'll be explaining how I used the freeware applications nLite and GameXP to optimize my Windows installation for fast performance in a limited environment , like a VMware virtual machine .
Build a Lightweight Windows Install with nLite
Advertisement
Freeware Windows application nLite goes directly into your Windows installation disc and helps you selectively rip out all the features and software you do n't want .
When you 're done ( and you can be pretty ruthless ) , you 'll have a new Windows installation disc that you can use to install the lighter , gutted version of Windows .
Out of all of the options discussed in this feature , the nLite method will probably give you the best results .
Before we dive in , here 's what you 'll need :
A Windows installation disc
nLite
A computer running Windows to run the nLite wizard and create your new install disc
Advertisement
First , fire up nLite .
As you 'll see on the welcome screen , nLite works with Windows XP , 2000 , and Server 2003 .
If you want to strip down a Vista installation , you 'll want to use the Vista version of nLite , called vLite .
I 'm sticking with nLite and XP in my example , since right now Vista is n't anywhere as close as XP to what you could reasonably call lightweight .
Advertisement
On the next screen on the installation wizard , nLite will ask you to point it to the location of your Windows installation disc .
If you 've got a disc in your drive , point it there .
Next nLite will ask you to pick a folder on your hard drive to save the stripped install files to .
Once you 've pointed nLite to all the right places , click Next to copy all the files from your disc onto your hard drive .
Once nLite finishes copying the Windows installation files to the folder you selected on your hard drive ( which will take a few minutes ) , the fun begins .
Advertisement
The next window you 'll see is the nLite Presets window , which you can use to replicate a previous nLite session so you can re-create a slimmed - down disc without going through the work of manually selecting the components you want to remove .
For example , you could copy everything I 've done by grabbing my Last Session.ini file ( created after you use nLite ) containing all the tweaks I made when streamlining XP for VMware and importing it at the Presets window ( pictured ) of the nLite wizard .
Then , instead of going through all the settings yourself , you could choose my presets file , click Next , accept everything on the Task Selection pane as - is , and click through all the windows until you 've created the new installation disc .
Advertisement
NOTE : I 'm not including my Last Session.ini file because I have n't been able to test it sufficiently , and I 'd hate to spread around a broken version of Windows to everyone .
Advertisement
If you do n't want to go with a preset , you can make all the changes you want to at the Task Selection window .
At this window , you green light everything you want to include or remove from the installation .
For example , if your installation CD currently only includes XP Service Pack 1 , you could integrate the SP2 update directly into your nLite disc .
Likewise , you can integrate any hotfixes ( like the revised Daylight Saving Time hotfix ) or drivers into your installation .
For our purposes , however , the important part comes in the Remove section .
Whatever your preferences for the rest , be sure to green light the Remove Components section .
When you 're happy with your Task Selection choices , click Next .
The nLite wizard will now walk you through each green - lighted feature .
For example , if you chose to integrate a service pack , you 'll need to point nLite to the downloaded service pack .
Advertisement
Assuming you chose to remove components , you 'll eventually come to the Components step of the nLite wizard .
In this step , you choose what components of the Windows installation you want to exclude .
You can be brutal in this section , but keep in mind that disabling some components can cripple some Windows features .
Advertisement
To help you rip out as many components as possible while ensuring you do n't break any important features , nLite has a Compatibility option that allows you to check important features that you want to keep intact .
Advertisement
For example , I want to make sure my lightweight Windows install can still access the internet , so I 've ticked the DHCP functionality ( Ethernet and Wi -Fi ) .
Since I 'm going the merciless route while slimming my install disc with nLite , I 'm selecting just a few compatibility options ( as seen in the screenshot . )
After choosing those options , I 'm going through the Components list and checking off most components I 'm not expecting to use — which is most of them — for removal .
This part can take some time , but the nLite wizard does a nice job of informing you of what each component does and what may be affected if you remove it .
You can remove most of the components without ever noticing , but keep an eye out when you 're going through the list .
Advertisement
Once you 've set up your components for removal , click Next to advance to the next step .
You 'll see different steps depending on what options you gave the green light to earlier , like system tweaks .
Here you can conduct all sorts of simple system tweaks that can help with your performance .
For example , check out the Performance options for various tweaks .
Likewise , you can save on performance overhead by tweaking options in the Visual Effects section .
Some , like disabling window animations , can boost performance , while others are more a matter of taste .
Advertisement
Like the Components section , you may want to spend a few minutes deciding what you prefer in this section .
Do n't stress too much about these choices , though , as none of them should really make anything go wrong with your install .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Steep food and fuel prices that are taxing global consumers and handcuffing recession - wary central bankers threaten to seep deeper into export channels , triggering a worrisome second round of global inflation pain .
The symptoms of price pressure are easy to spot .
In Japan , shoppers are cutting back on potato chips and beer .
More Americans are forgoing luxuries such as dining out at steak restaurants .
In China , the price of pork is up nearly 60 percent .
Europe ’s retail sales have slowed .
The causes are also clear .
Oil prices topped $ 100 a barrel on Tuesday .
Grains and other commodities are setting record highs , powered by demand for biofuels and from fast - growing economies including China and India .
The U.S. consumer price index for January was up 4.3 percent from a year earlier , slightly higher than economists had expected .
China ’s consumer inflation rate jumped to 7.1 percent last month , an 11 - year high .
“ With grains prices soaring , energy costs high , and iron ore set to jump after Brazil ’s Vale increased prices by 65 percent over 2007 , there appears no relief on the horizon for the Chinese people on food , gasoline or durable goods like refrigerators , ” said Andrew Busch , global foreign exchange strategist with BMO Capital Markets in Chicago .
Globalization closely ties world markets .
Soaring Chinese pork prices not only make meals costlier in China , but they could lead to demands for higher wages that eventually translate into rising prices for exported toys , clothing , furniture , electronics and countless other items .
Wednesday ’s U.S. inflation report showed strong price increases on a distressingly wide range of products , including the usual culprits of food and fuel as well as apparel , prescription drugs and tobacco .
Global food prices in particular will probably remain high as emerging markets move up the food ladder , demanding more meat -- and the grains to feed the livestock .
The Reuters / Jefferies CRB Index .CRB of commodity prices hit a record high for a fourth straight session on Wednesday .
Despite assurances from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that inflation will cool as the economy slows , investors in U.S. government bonds are betting that pricing pressure will persist .
Yields on longer - dated Treasury bonds have spiked in the past week , reflecting mounting inflation worries as the Fed cuts interest rates to prop up the economy .
Rising yields on the benchmark 10 - year note in turn threaten to deepen the economic gloom by lifting mortgage interest rates and undermining demand in the struggling U.S. housing market .
Mortgage applications tumbled 22.6 percent last week .
EXPORTS NEXT ?
Where inflation spreads is tricky to predict .
A key question : How long China will absorb rising costs and shrinking profit margins rather than risk losing consumers in the United States , where it sold $ 320 billion worth of goods last year ?
Merrill Weingrod , who advises companies doing business in China , said Chinese suppliers grappling with increased costs for raw materials and labor were beginning to pass along those expenses to U.S. importers .
However , companies such as Wal - Mart Stores Inc WMT.N that have the clout to dictate prices are still extracting low - cost goods from China .
U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said China was loathe to jeopardize its booming trade with the United States .
“ They ’re not going to keep that ( U.S. business ) and grow it if they ’re just passing on price increases , ” he said in a Reuters interview on Tuesday .
“ If their prices get out of whack , there are other countries that today are competing with China , in their region and in other parts of the world . ”

POLICY RESPONSE
Still , recent economic data suggests that the United States is starting to import inflation .
In January , prices for U.S. imports rose 1.7 percent , more than four times as much as analysts had expected , largely because of pricey oil .
Inflation is outpacing U.S. wage growth , putting another drag on household budgets already constrained by the housing rut and tightening credit conditions .
Retailers ranging from consumer electronics chain Best Buy BBY.N to department store owner Macy 's M.N have posted disappointing results as consumers cut back on nonessentials .
With higher prices eroding consumers ’ spending power and undercutting economic growth , central bankers are in a bind .
While lower interest rates lift economic growth , they also tend to spur inflation .
U.S. rates will probably fall further as recession fears grow , but Japan ’s central bank is not expected to raise interest rates to curb the inflationary pressure because of concern about the U.S. economy tanking global growth .
While the European Central Bank has deep concerns about inflation , it signaled earlier this month that it may lower rates this spring .
In China , the story is different .
BMO ’s Busch noted that inflation persisted even though China had allowed its yuan currency to appreciate more quickly in January .
“ This leads one to believe that the People ’s Bank of China will again use some form of monetary lever to raise costs of money to slow the economy , ” he said .

Nightfall
By Isaac Asimov
“ Of the six suns , only Beta is left in the sky .
Do you see it ? ”
The question was rather unnecessary .
Beta was almost at zenith , its ruddy light flooding the landscape to an unusual orange as the brilliant rays of setting Gamma died .
Beta was at aphelion .
It was small ; smaller than Theremon had ever seen it before , and for the moment it was undisputed ruler of Lagash ’s sky .
Lagash ’s own sun , Alpha , the one about which it revolved , was at the antipodes , as were the two distant companion pairs .
The red dwarf Beta —
Alpha ’s immediate companion — was alone , grimly alone .
Aton ’s upturned face flushed redly in the sunlight .
“ In just under four hours , ” he said , “ civilization , as we know it , comes to an end .
It will do so because , as you see , Beta is the only sun in the sky . ”
He smiled grimly .
“ Print that !
There ’ll be no one to read it . ”

Scientology is both immoral and socially obnoxious …
It is dangerous because it is out to capture people , especially children and impressionable young people , and indoctrinate and brainwash them so that they become the unquestioning captives and tools of the cult …
The auditing – the processing – begins at an early age . [ … ]
In “ The Second Dynamic ” 1982 edition under the heading “ Children ’s Confessional Ages 6 – 12 ” is a “ processing check for use on children ” .
It is a very long and vigorous interrogation . [… ]
I agree with Dr. Clark [ an expert witness ] that ‘ Scientology training is training for slavery ’ .
– Justice Latey , in a 1984 High Court decision
The other day while data mining the interweb , I came across an online PDF of Charlotte Iserbyt ’s The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America .
I ’d forgotten how good that book is and got caught up reading it once again .
As I reached the passage that highly recommends the book The Leipzig Connection , this time I decided to see whether it was available on Amazon .
It was ; and the first review immediately caught my attention :
An Essential Guide to Understanding This Book , June 7 , 2001 …
This book , although rooted in fact , was part of a continuing attempt by the Church of Scientology to discredit professional psychology and psychiatry by any means possible .
The book was published by the Delphian Foundation , a Scientology organization that runs a church school outside a small town in rural Oregon , and its sole purpose is to slander , by any means possible , modern psychology and anyone and everything associated with it .
While there was indeed a Wilhelm Wundt who was influential in the growth of experimental psychology , and while this new technology was backed financially as part of the Rockefeller family ’s attempt to clear its name through public philanthropy , what underlies the thesis of the book is the implicit theory of conspiracy that has played such a large role in the growth of Scientology and in the activities of the group as a whole .
I would advise most strongly that the message of this book be taken with a grain of salt , as the book as written is not what it purports to be and its underlying purpose leads one on a different trajectory intellectually and factually than it might otherwise appear to do .
Buyer beware – question everything in this book , particularly all supposed “ facts ” as presented .
– By LRH “ lance2289 ”
That ’s quite the charge .
It ’s the first time I ’d heard of the Scientology connection , but it turns out others have known about it for some time and it ’s easy enough to corroborate .
In short , the reviewer is absolutely correct .
As early as I can confirm , The Leipzig Connection was first published in 1978 by Delphian Press .
Antony Sutton said it was first published in 1967 :
The Leipzig Connection is the title of an excellent little booklet by Lance J. Klass and Paoli Lionni , published by The Delphian Press , Route 2 , Box 195 , Sheridan , Oregon 97378 ( $ 4 00 postpaid ) ,
The book came out in 1967 and was the first to trace the Wundt link
It has more detail on Wundt than this memorandum , but , of course , is not concerned with The Order [ of the Skull and Bones ] .
America ’s Secret Establishment : An Introduction to the Skull & Bones ( Trine Day : 2002 ) , p. 81 . – Antony C. Sutton , ( Trine Day : 2002 ) , p. 81 .
Both Iserbyt and Sutton mentioned nothing about Delphian Press being a Scientology front , however – probably because they did n’t know .
The first name assumed by the publishing house was Delphian Press ; today The Leipzig Connection is published under Heron Books .
There ’s some surprisingly well - sourced articles at Wikipedia concerning these fronts .
Heron Books :
Heron Books is an assumed business name of Delphi Schools Inc. , under which they publish many paperback books for teachers , students , and home schoolers , as well as single - subject dictionaries for all grade levels .
It is a trademark owned by Northwest Research , Inc. , which is another assumed business name of Delphi Schools Inc. Several of Heron Books published works for students are based on the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard , the founder of Scientology .
Delphi Schools :
Delphi Schools , Inc. operates private schools that utilize the study methods known as Study Tech that were developed by Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard .
The headquarters for Delphi Schools , Inc. are located at 20950 SW Rock Creek Road , Sheridan , Oregon 97378 , which operates under the assumed business name of Heron Books .
This is also the address where the founding school , The Delphian School , is located .
It was incorporated in 1973 as the Delphi Foundation , and changed to the present name in 1987 .
Delphi Schools says that its schools teach using “ The Delphi Program ” , which “ is a unique , integrated approach to learning . ”
The Study Technology is licensed through the Scientology related group Applied Scholastics .
Several Delphi schools use the Heron Basics Program of Heron Books for instruction .
One can easily confirm these connections by going to the official site of Heron Books , as well as The Delphian School of Sheridan , Oregon and typing in a site - specific search through Google , specifically querying the keyword “ Hubbard . ” ( “ Scientology ” , not surprisingly , is never mentioned outright – anywhere , at both these sites . )
A sampling from a Heron Books search :
… we highly recommend that students and parents understand and use the study skills covered in these books by L. Ron Hubbard : Learning How to Learn ( ages 6 - 11 ) , Study Skills for Life ( ages 12 - 17 ) or The Basic Study Manual ( ages 18 and up ) .

These methods , known as Study Technology , were developed by author and humanitarian L. Ron Hubbard .

A more indepth investigation into Scientology ’s Heron Books , Applied Scholastics , etc. , can be found here .
In a section titled “ Why Scientology wants its hands on your kid ? , ” there ’s a revealing quote from a Scientology manual :
Why is education so important ?
The Jesuits ( an order within the Roman Catholic Church well known for their activism ) exported the policy of starting Church schools in areas where they wished to introduce their religion .
The reasons are obvious .
By educating a child into one ’s own beliefs , one gradually takes over a whole new generation of a country and can thus influence , in the long term , the development and growth of that country .
The Jesuits were very successful at this strategy .
– Impact ( an International Association of Scientologists ’ publication ) , “ In Search of Truth ” , Issue 7 , pg. 49 , 1986
Well , it ’s hardly surprising L. Ron Hubbard used as a guide the conspiratorial , pedagogical methods of the Jesuits – as had Adam Weishaupt and Cecil Rhodes before him .
Even more curious , though – perhaps enough to give a stroke to those who propagate the Jesuits - rule - world meme – is the fact that the Delphian School at Sheridan , Oregon seems to have originally been a Jesuit school for novices .
According to Father Cornelius Michael Buckley , S.J. , there was a Jesuit named Joseph Piet who was a provincial for the Order on the Pacific coast of America .
Under Piet ’s direction , a “ novitiate in Sheridan , Oregon , was established — it was subsequently closed and in 1974 sold to the Church of Scientology ” ( Cornelius Michael Buckley , When Jesuits Were Giants : Louis - Marie Ruellan , S.J. ( 1846-1885 ) and Contemporaries , Ignatius Press , 1999 , p. 373 ) .
I encourage the reader to investigate the foregoing Jesuit / Scientology connection in greater detail .
There might just be more to this than meets the eye , especially after discovering Hubbard ’s appreciation for the Order – in particular , perhaps Scientology ’s Delphian Curriculum was cribbed directly from the machinations of Jesuit pedagogy .
This article , however is meant as a data dump only ; a preliminary investigation into some interesting recent discoveries .
To wrap it up then , The Leipzig Connection was / is indeed published by a Scientology organization .
It is not clear whether the authors ( Paolo Lionni and Lance J. Klass ) were Scientologists or not .
I think it ’s more subtle than this .
As far as I ’ve been able to confirm through excerpts on the web , the book does n’t endorse Hubbard nor Scientology , per se .
What is obvious is the fact that the book documents the infiltration of Experimental Psychology and Behaviorism into the educational establishment .
Since Scientology places so much importance on controlling people through education , combined with its avowed hatred of psychiatry , The Leipzig Connection seems like a perfect book to promote .
The exact methods used by the Wundts , the Young Hegelians , the Deweys , the G. Stanley Halls , the Skinners , etc. , need to be replaced – according to the technocratic madmen running the cult called Scientology – by the equally insidious techniques of L. Ron Hubbard .
Of course they would want to expose the competition !
In connection with this , I feel a duty to inform the wary reader of the site sntp.net ( in which large excerpts of the book in question can be read ) .
With a title such as Say No To Psychiatry – The Danger and Harm of the Sham Pseudoscience Known As Psychiatry , in hindsight it seems obvious that it ’s run by a Scientologist .
In the past I ’ve linked to some stories on the site ; you ’ll find there a good assortment of articles inveighing against the state of education , elite hegemony , the hegelian dialectic , and the dangers of humanism .

WARSAW ( AP ) —
When New York gay rights activist Brendan Fay married his partner , he never imagined that the wedding video would be aired across Catholic Poland as a warning against same - sex marriage .
Mr. Fay said he was shocked to learn President Lech Kaczynski used a brief clip of Mr. Fay ’s wedding in Canada to partner Tom Moulton in a televised address Monday evening , and Mr. Fay quickly filed a complaint with the Polish Consulate in New York .
“ Our images clearly were being used in a campaign by the president of Poland against lesbian and gay persons and fostering intolerance and fear among the people of Poland , ” Mr. Fay said Wednesday .
The video and the couple ’s marriage certificate were shown as the president warned against the dangers of adopting the European Union ’s new treaty and its Charter of Fundamental Rights , which Mr. Kaczynski said could open the door to same - sex marriage in Poland .
Mr. Kaczynski said the charter contains an article that fails to clearly define marriage as a “ union between a man and a woman , ” which “ may go against the universally accepted moral order in Poland . ”
Mr. Fay said Polish immigrants and reporters began calling him Tuesday , asking how he felt about having images of him used in the address .
Although a gay rights movement is active in Poland , little official support has been shown for same - sex marriage in the mainly Roman Catholic country , which joined the European Union in 2004 .
The Polish Constitution states that marriage is between only a man and a woman .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. State Department said on Thursday it had advised former President Jimmy Carter against meeting the leader of Hamas in Syria next week , saying it went against U.S. policy of isolating the militant group .

Carter plans to visit Israel , the West Bank , Egypt , Syria , Saudi Arabia and Jordan during a nine - day trip due to start on Sunday but gave no details of specific meetings .
“ This is a study mission and our purpose is not to negotiate but to support and provide momentum for current efforts to secure peace in the Middle East , ” the Carter Center said in a statement .
“ Our delegation has considerable experience in the region , and we go there with an open mind and heart to listen and learn from all parties , ” it said .
Carter , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 , discussed with the State Department ’s point person on Israeli - Palestinian issues , David Welch , his plans to meet exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal in Damascus , but the department said it went against U.S. policy .
“ We counseled against it , ” said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack .
“ U.S. government policy is that Hamas is a terrorist organization and we do n’t believe it is in the interests of our policy or in the interests of peace to have such a meeting . ”
Israel ’s ambassador to the United States , Sallai Meridor , also expressed concern over such a meeting .
“ The unintended consequences of such a meeting would be to embolden terrorists and undermine the cause of peace , ” he told Reuters .
Carter , 83 , served one term as president from 1977 to 1981 .
He succeeded in negotiating the 1978 Camp David Accords that paved the way for peace between Israel and Egypt but he has increasingly taken positions highly critical of Israel .
In a 2006 book , he described Israeli policy in the occupied territories as “ a system of apartheid . ”
U.S. policy is to isolate Hamas , which has control of Gaza and is committed to the destruction of Israel .
Washington sees pro-Western Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas as its partner in U.S. - sponsored peace talks with the Israelis .
PLANS UNDER WAY
“ There is an agreement to hold the meeting and arrangements are under way , ” Hamas official Ayman Taha told Reuters in Gaza of Carter ’s meeting .
Taha said the meeting was to be held following a request from the Atlanta - based Carter Center , which aims to promote global peace , health , democracy and human rights .
A spokeswoman for Carter declined to comment on specific meetings .
The delegation will include former first lady Rosalynn Carter and ex-Congressman Stephen Solarz .
Initially , Carter had hoped to go with a group of ‘ elder statesmen , ’ including former U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan and former South African President Nelson Mandela , but the others decided the timing was wrong .
“ The elders will consider consultations with key leaders in the region and outside with the purpose of developing a comprehensive report , but have decided to postpone their visit , ” said a statement on Tuesday from the group of 12 former leaders on their Web site , www.theelders.org.
Carter has been harshly critical of the Bush administration ’s foreign policy , from the invasion of Iraq to its approach to Iran as well as the Israeli - Palestinian issue .
McCormack said the U.S. government would provide support for Carter ’s Syrian trip but would not take part in any of his meetings or the planning and scheduling of those talks .
People said they fell ill and vomited after eating the dumplings
The frozen dumplings were contaminated with a highly toxic organophoshate pesticide methamidophos .
" Judging from the circumstantial evidence , we'd have to think that it 's highly likely to be a crime , " Yoichi Masuzoe told reporters .
The issue has triggered intensive media coverage and public alarm in Japan .
Japanese police say they want to work with their Chinese counterparts to investigate how the dumplings , known as gyoza in Japan , were poisoned .
Safety scares
The problem emerged last Wednesday , when 10 people were reported to have fallen ill from the dumplings - thin dough packets containing ground meat and vegetables which are then fried .
The dosage of pesticide was sufficiently concentrated to leave one five - year - old girl seriously ill .
By late Thursday there were unconfirmed reports of dozens of other cases .
The Japanese distributor , JT Foods , quickly recalled the dumplings and other products made by the same Chinese company , Tianyang Food .
But China says preliminary tests on two batches of the dumplings found them to be safe .
The two countries have not yet ratified an agreement to allow investigators to travel between them though so any contacts will be made through diplomatic channels .
In the meantime the Japanese will try to rule out the possibility that the dumplings were poisoned in Japan after they had been brought in from China .
In recent months , Chinese - made products have been involved in several safety scares .
But Japan has also had its problems .
Last year , confectioners admitted to mislabelling expiry dates on biscuits and rice cakes .

Improving on the Nazi Past Albert Speer 's Son , Urban Planner
German urban planners have never been as active worldwide as they are today , and Albert Speer is the protagonist in the current success story .
The son of the Nazi architect of the same name is preparing a new Olympic bid for Munich , has the ear of Moscow 's mayor -- and is designing entire cities for the Chinese .
In a dire article in London 's Times yesterday , reporter Ben Hoyle opened with the self - evidently ludicrous statement that " book piracy on the Internet will ultimately drive authors to stop writing unless radical methods are devised to compensate them for lost sales . "
Internet piracy , no matter how pervasive , is not about to bring the worldwide production of literature to a grinding halt , just as rampant music piracy is n't stopping my neighbor 's kid from playing his drum kit in the garage every day before dinner .
But the piece does raise the real question of whether the best writers will continue to work to their full potential in a world where their main product can be had for free .
Tracy Chevalier , who wrote Girl With a Pearl Earring , chairs the UK's Society of Authors , and she recognizes that the Internet poses a very real danger for traditional publishing .
Some of that is due to piracy , some of it is not , but Chevalier recognizes that the best response has to involve finding workable new business models for writers and publishers as the big advance / big blockbuster model changes in reaction to the web 's ability to corral niche groups and small but passionate communities .
Perhaps writers even need to stop charging for books .
Tracy Chevalier
" It is a dam that 's cracking , " she told The Times .
" We are trying to plug the holes with legislation and litigation , but we need to think radically .
We have to evolve and create a very different pay system , possibly by making the content available free to all and finding a way to get paid separately . "
That sort of innovative thinking is likely to be far more productive in the long run than the sort of " sky is falling " rhetoric that opens the article .
And it 's not even clear yet that piracy is approaching the " rampant " stage ... at least for fiction .
Despite the premise that bestselling novels like the Harry Potter books are widely available online ( which they no doubt are ) , it 's hard to believe that millions of people are reading long - form fiction on computer monitors or even e-book readers like the Kindle , Reader , or iLiad .
Actually , it 's hard to believe that millions of people are reading much fiction at all ; if they are , the publishing industry should be thrilled .
Nonfiction 's troubles are n't made up
But fiction 's share of the market has been dropping for years and is now largely the domain of female readers .
Nonfiction dominates , and it's here that unauthorized online distribution of books poses the biggest threat .
Cookbooks , travel guides , bringing - up - baby volumes — all have value in small chunks that are easily read onscreen .
In fact , Chevalier admits to doing this herself .
" It 's hitting hardest the writers who write books that you dip in and out of : poetry , cookbooks , travel guides , short stories — books where you do n't have to read the whole thing , " she said .
" Cookbook authors are really struggling .
I do it myself — if I want a recipe I go online and get it for free . "
The final edition ?
Perhaps this explains her forward - looking approach to dealing with the problem .
If grabbing a recipe online is so convenient that even the boss of the Society of Authors does it , then questions about law become almost secondary .
Given a value proposition that compelling , people will continue to get their recipes online .
While fighting it may work in the short term ( though it probably wo n't ; see the music industry for an example ) , the longer - term solution is clearly to monetize this behavior so that those who give of their time and expertise to develop a superb eggplant and spinach risotto can get paid enough to continue to do so .
Publishing 's Brave Digital Future™
Publishing has been , in many ways , a fortunate industry .
It has had the luxury of watching the music and movie businesses handle similar content issues for years , and only recently has it faced similar problems .
But that does n't mean it knows what to do about them ; as industry insiders we 've spoken to admit , every publisher and author has a different vision of the future and a different strategy for making a living in our Brave Digital Future .
Those who do long - form fiction still have time to figure this out , but for the short - form folks , the time for action is here .
Apart from the obviously illegal outlets , two big worries are Google and Amazon , with their Book Search and Search Inside the Book functionality , respectively .
Both services are simultaneously feared and loved for their ability to drive sales ... but the worry that they could expose too much content , cannibalize full volume sales , and cede even more control to non-publishers like Amazon .
Without a popular and workable system for micropayments , there 's still no good way for most Internet users to pay ( for instance ) a quarter for legal access to a particular recipe , and it's not clear that most publishers would want to do this , anyway .
Wedded to the book format like the music business has been wedded to the album , the temptation is to see such piecemeal sales as cannibalizing a larger revenue stream , though publishers have in fact begun to experiment .
Such fears have been driving the Authors Guild lawsuit here in the US against Google 's service , and the group also expressed concerns back in 2003 when Amazon launched its own search service .
Would you read an econometrics
textbook on a screen ?
Swedes would
Even longer - form works may start to be traded online , too , as e-book readers grow in popularity .
Expensive books , such as textbooks , might also cost enough to make the inconvenience of not owning a physical copy worth it .
We 've already seen the launch of the Student Bay in Sweden , a site modeled on The Pirate Bay that hosts full scans of ( expensive ) Swedish academic books .
And as far back as 2003 , copies of The Order of the Phoenix were available in full online .
And even before that , authors like Harlan Ellison saw some of their work show up in Usenet groups .
The obscurity curse ... and cure
But how many novels are popular enough that they might spawn Harry Potter - like levels of interest ?
( Short answer : none . )
Leaving aside the tiny pool of big - name authors , the truth is that nearly every writer in the world suffers from the opposite problem : lack of a reading public .
As Tim O'Reilly famously pointed out in a 2002 essay on publishing , obscurity is a far bigger threat to most content creators than is piracy .
Authors should be able to choose how their work is available , of course , and not all will want it distributed freely on the Internet .
But plenty of people will .
As someone currently pursuing the tortuous path to publication with a novel of my own , I can vouch for O'Reilly 's statement about obscurity , and I 've also learned more than I wanted to know about literary agents , the big New York houses , the committees that evaluate any novel 's potential sales , and the dangers of being labeled a " male author " in the minds of publishing execs .
Please read my book
Given the difficulty of breaking into print in the traditional way , the Internet looks to many aspiring authors like a powerful new way to distribute content and find an audience ; it has promise , not peril .
While cash is important ( we all need to put diapers on our kids ) , selling paper copies of books certainly is n't the only way to collect , especially in the early stages of a literary career .
Just ask Cory Doctorow , who has made his work freely available for years and has written eloquently of the ways that increased recognition translates into physical book sales , speaking fees , and jobs at schools and universities .
Yes , authors should be in control , but they should n't be afraid .
Business models will no doubt change as they have in other content industries , but writing and writers wo n't disappear so long as demand for the product exists .
In fact , writers should be rejoicing at the huge advantage they have over other media : readers have an " emotional bond " with the medium of paper and have no plans to stop buying it .
Well , yet .
TERROR ALERT * FREEDOM ON THE MARCH * TERROR ALERT
as many of you know , I ( sometimes ) attend class at Florida State University , which is located here in sunny Tallahassee , Florida .
As such , I ’m on the “ Emergency Alert Broadcast ” list .
Here ’s the first one that I got today :
I ’m at work , which is a few miles away .
So unless they ’ve found a nuke , I think I ’ll be ok .
Then I get a second one :
Oh goodness !
That sure does sound seriously .
Although …since when do terrorists label their bombs ?
The answer comes in the third and fourth abuse of the message system :
Now , for the kicker :
Here ’s a map of the campus .
Around C5 you ’ll see the Number “ 20 ” and the number “ 70 ” .
70 refers to the affected parking garage .
The 20 ?
That refers to a FSU PD substation .
So why were they setting up a command post nearby ?
Have n’t used up their command tent quota for the month ?
Also , “ A - Bomb ” ? lol what a nick name .
Bet his new nick is gonna be something like “ dumbass ” or “ gitmo boy ” .
Mr Gillani ( right ) was sworn in by President Musharraf in Islamabad
Key leaders of the coalition kept away from the ceremony in Islamabad , in what BBC correspondent Barbara Plett says is an apparent snub to Mr Musharraf .
Mr Gillani is a leader of the Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) that won the most votes in elections in February .
Two top US officials have meanwhile arrived for talks in Pakistan .
US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte and Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher held talks with Nawaz Sharif , who heads the PPP 's coalition partner , the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz ( PML - N ) .
Officials say they are also expected to meet President Pervez Musharraf and Mr Gillani .
The US has said it expects Pakistan 's new government to continue a crackdown on Islamist militants along the country 's border with Afghanistan .
President Musharraf has been a key ally in the US - led " war on terror " .
Leaders in the new coalition have hinted at a negotiated solution to the Islamist uprising .
' Dictating terms '
Speaking after the meeting , Mr Sharif said he had told the US envoys it was " no longer a one - man show in Pakistan " - referring to President Musharraf .
He said the country would adopt a new strategy against terrorism after the matter had been debated in parliament .
" It is unacceptable that while giving peace to the world we make our own country a killing field , " Mr Sharif said .
Pakistani analyst and former general Talat Masood told AFP news agency the US envoys were " fearful of any softening towards the militants by the incoming government " .
Zaffar Abbas , an editor with Pakistani newspaper Dawn , said the arrival of the US delegation on the day the new prime minister had been sworn in suggested they were " trying to dictate terms " .
" The problem with the Americans is they do n't understand the domestic pressure on the new government , " Mr Abbas told the Associated Press news agency .
" People are expecting this government to explore other possibilities for a solution to what 's happening in the tribal areas , " he said .
Decision on judges
Mr Musharraf administered the oath of office to Mr Gillani in a short , crisp ceremony at the presidential residence in Islamabad .
The Pakistani national anthem was sung , along with verses from the Koran .
The BBC's Barbara Plett says the ceremony caps 24 - hour period that has highlighted the president 's increasing isolation .
Mr Gillani's first move after being elected by parliament on Monday was to order the release of top judges detained when President Musharraf imposed emergency rule in November .
The judges were dismissed as they were about to decide on the legality of the president 's re-election last year .
The PPP nominated Mr Gillani as its candidate at the weekend .
This is the first time in 12 years that the PPP will head the government , a coalition with a substantial majority .
Correspondents say Mr Gillani is much admired within the PPP .
He has resisted pressure from President Musharraf to desert the party , refusing to do any deals with him .
Mr Gillani was sent to jail in 2001 , serving five years following a conviction over illegal government appointments .
The sentence was passed by an anti-corruption court formed by President Musharraf .
His opponents say it was a means of intimidating and coercing their members to join his government .
The City will pick up additional garbage , recycling and organic waste provided you follow a few simple steps .
Excess Garbage
Excess garbage beyond what fits in your bin with the lid closed , must be bagged , tagged and set out beside your Garbage Bin for collection .
Garbage Tags are available for purchase online and at Toronto Shoppers Drug Mart and Canadian Tire locations .
Use a regular garbage bag for excess garbage and ensure that the Garbage Tag is attached to the bag and is clearly visible ( attach it like you would a luggage tag ) .
Note : Garbage bag should not exceed 20 kg ( 44 lbs )
Excess garbage and oversized items are different .
The City will pick up oversized items ( appliances , furniture , carpets , etc. ) on your garbage collection day .
Excess Recycling
Excess recycling should be put in a large clear bag and placed beside the Blue Bin .
Ensure bags can fit back into the recycling bin and are placed 0.5 metres apart .
Extra cardboard should be cut into small pieces , flattened and bundled with string or twine .
Ensure pieces can fit back into the recycling bin .
If you frequently have overflow recycling , please up - size your Recycling Bin .
Excess Organics
When civil servants talk about “ spring ” they mean before Parliament rises in July and by “ the summer ” they usually mean “ before the party conference season ” in September .
But it seems that when a minister tells a Lords Committee “ the end of the summer ” they mean the last day of December .
Well it has been pretty cold recently , so I expect that concentrated their minds !
This “ summer ” event which can be reported today , is the publication of the Crown Prosecution Service guidance on what should be considered before bringing prosecutions under s3A of the Computer Misuse Act , when amendments to it come into force — probably April 2008 ( for reasons that I discussed last July ) .
What is at issue is so - called hacking tools , and the problem arises because almost every hacking tool you can think of from perl to nmap is dual use — the good guys use it for good purposes , and the bad guys use it for bad .
The bad guys are of course committing an offence , and the good guys are not … but the complexity surrounds “ distribution ” , if a good guy runs a website and a lot of bad people download the tool from it , has the good guy committed an offence ?
The actual wording of the offence says " supply or offer to supply , believing that it is likely to be used to commit , or to assist in the commission of [ a Computer Misuse Act s1/s3 offence ] " and so we need to know what " believing that it is likely " might mean .
Whilst the law was going through Parliament the Home Office suggested that “ likely ” would be a 50 % test , and they promised to publish the guidance to prosecutors so we ’d all know where we stood .
Anyway , that guidance is now out — and there ’s no mention , surprise , surprise , of “ 50 % ” .
Instead , the tests that the CPS will apply are :
Has the article been developed primarily , deliberately and for the sole purpose of committing a CMA offence ( i.e. unauthorised access to computer material ) ?
Is the article available on a wide scale commercial basis and sold through legitimate channels ?
Is the article widely used for legitimate purposes ?
Does it have a substantial installation base ?
What was the context in which the article was used to commit the offence compared with its original intended purpose ?
which after a good start using words like “ primarily ” and “ deliberately ” ( which would have been a sensible law to have in the first place ) then goes a bit downhill in that prosecutors do n’t know the difference between “ i.e ” and “ e.g. ” and seem to think that software is generally sold (! ) , and rather misses the point of dual use by talking about using the tool in a different “ context ” .
Still , the “ installed base ” test should at least allow people to distribute perl without qualms ( millions of users ) — though do note that these are the tests which will be applied at the “ deciding if you ought to be charged with an offence ” stage , not the points of law and interpretation that the court will use in deciding your guilt .

Gmail Hacks , Tips and Tricks
Note : All tips current as of Firefox 9.0.1
You already know that Gmail beats most email providers with its endless customization capabilities , Google product integration , and a fantastic spam filter .
Take it to the next level with these Gmail power user tips , add - ons , and plugins .
If you 'd like to learn more about other email programs , check out the email category at the Web Directory .
1. Gmail Keyboard Shortcuts
If you havenât already , master the shortcut keys to simplify the way you compose , read , archive , search , and report spam mail .
Some of these may be straight forward , like c for compose , but through the shortcut menu you can learn how to navigate and organize your mailbox entirely with your keyboard .
In the same vein , Gmail users eager to simplify their experience with single keystrokes can check out Launchy : a free , open source keyword launcher that runs in your system tray and opens apps with designated keystrokes .
Launchy is still “ a far cry from Quicksilver for Mac ” according to Gina Trapani at Lifehacker , but Adam Pash of Lifehacker says , “ I ca n't recommend it highly enough . ”
Here is a quick tutorial for one - key Gmail composing through Launchy .
2. Google Code Macros
The Greasemonkey extension for Firefox , familiar to many power users , allows JavaScript functionality on any web page .
Piggybacking off of this capability , the generically - named Macros script enables a number of keyboard shortcuts .
Some of the shortcuts from the original script have now been implemented in the new Gmail ; however , to enable the ones that are no longer functional in this newest version , users only have to install this extension .
Those who have not updated to the newest Gmail can find other Greasemonkey scripts still available to enhance the older version .
3. Bookmark Searches and Emails
With the newest version of Gmail , searches are granted their own URLs which can be bookmarked ; however , those still operating under the old version , on the fence about the changes , can still generate these “ baby ” bookmarks for searches through this form , created by Steve Rubel .
Meanwhile , all messages in Gmail have URLs , too .
While the message is open , simply type CTRL - D to bookmark it .
4. Resize Composition Box
The aptly - named Resizeable Textarea Firefox extension allows you to click and drag the bottom right corner of the text box you ’re typing in without resizing your browser window .
This add - on will operate not only in Gmail , but also in any forum or discussion board where the textbox is too small for an appropriate response â especially one that you may want to read over before sending .
Note that any browser built with the newest Opensource.org web kit will already have this capability .
For more browser info , check out the Internet software category .
5. Change Your Inbox Focus
Everyone knows that you can enter tasks , set appointments , and manage your calendar through your Gmail account .
Now Chrome and Firefox users alike can install the ActiveInbox plugin in order to optimize Gmail for productivity .
Building upon Gmail ’s priority inbox feature , this plugin allows you to sort emails according to tasks , set reminders that can be snoozed or dismissed , and create project folders and sub -folders .
It also enables a note section on emails for important personal reminders .
Additionally , it implements the Previous Conversation Viewer , pulling up a history of emails between you and the sender ( or recipient ) , allowing you to reflect on past comments and respond faster .
6. Streamline Adding Attachments
If you ’ve ever sent an important attachment , chances are that you ’ve also experienced the embarrassing reply message stating you ’ve neglected to attach the aforementioned file .
This Greasemonkey script scans all messages for references to attachments including variations such as “ attached ” or “ attachment . ”
When you click send on a message with such references that is missing an attachment , a prompt will pop up asking you to confirm whether your email is ready to send .
To make matters even simpler , would n’t it be great if you could drag files directly into your email ?
Check out the Firefox extension dragdropupload which allows you to do exactly that if you are running Firefox 3.0 or newer .
Once installed , you can simply click and drag the file â or multiple files at once â from a folder or the desktop and drop them onto the “ Browse ” button to attach .
7. Secure Gmail & Avoid Spam
The Firefox add - on OptimizeGoogle ( which is based on an abandoned add - on called CustomizeGoogle ) enhances both Google searches and your Gmail experience .
Specifically in terms of Gmail , it enables secure browsing in emails and the calendar , hides the counter on your Spam folder , and uses a fixed font for the body of emails .
Ultimately , while securing your experience , it provides a cleaner look to your inbox .
Meanwhile , when using the search engine , this add - on enables URL previews on sponsored links , removes ads , removes click tracking , and adds a counter to search results among other features .
If your primary concern is that irritating and eternally growing Spam counter , however , you may be better off just trying out this Greasemonkey +
Firefox script to keep it out of sight .
8. Automate Frequently Repeated Text
Signature functionality is built into Gmail , but frequently typed phrases can be automated with Firefox extension Signature , which allows you to insert designated text with a keystroke .
Note that , as of right now , Signature is not yet compliant with Firefox 9.0.1 .
Also try the Windows app , AutoHotKey , or the Mac app : TypeIt4Me .
Both allow you to create keystrokes to automate text in virtually any application .
9. POP3 & IMAP Forwarding
“ I recommend using IMAP ( where the mail is both on the server and on your local machine (s ) / device (s ) ) and uploading all your email onto Gmail , ” writes Mark Wheeler , a Gmail power user .
“ You can keep copies on the Google servers and your desktop / laptop / phone so that they are all efficiently accessible and available anytime anywhere .
Do n't have to worry about backups , or disk space ... I have 25,000 emails and have only used 9 % of my space ! ”
To upload old email like Mr. Wheeler did , set up a Gmail IMAP account in your desktop email client .
In the client , establish folders that correspond to your Gmail labels , and drag and drop your non-Gmail into the folders .
If you 're using Outlook with .
PST format or Outlook Express , you will have to convert or export the emails to mBox data file format before the messages will translate .
The process may take some time .
Also , the original dates and times attached to the messages will appear in Gmail as the dates and times that the messages were imported into Gmail .

10 . Mute Conversations
Ever found yourself subscribed to a mailing list and the current conversation has nothing to do with you ?
If you do n’t want to unsubscribe , you can easily stop the friendly spam with the Gmail mute function .
Select a message in the thread and hit the m key to auto - archive all incoming messages in the conversation .
The thread will stay muted until you un-mute it ; it will also un-mute itself if your address appears in the To or CC box .
11 . Keep it All in One Place
The Mail Fetcher allows you to add up to five different accounts and then both receive and send via POP3 without logging out of Gmail .
Unlike a simple forwarding feature , Mail Fetcher allows synchronization of Gmail actions with the home server .
Go to your Gmail Settings and open the Accounts tab , then click Add another mail account .
One caveat of sending from non-Gmail accounts : the recipients may see , “ FROM you@Gmail.com on behalf of you@otherdomain.com , ” especially if the recipients are using a client like Outlook .
Additionally , users can use Google Toolbar and Gmail together to transform a Gmail account into a massive archive of interests .
To do this , simply add the Google toolbar to your browser .
When you happen across text or images you want to save , highlight them and click the Send To Gmail link .
12 . Gmail / Google Notifier and Desktop Plugin
Tired of constantly refreshing your browser for new notifications , install the Notifier widget to check your email ( and Google Calendar , if you 're a Mac user ) .
As with almost everything else under the sun , there 's also a Firefox extension that will serve the same function ( it 's not released by Google ) .
Some users have reported compatibility issues between Google Toolbar , Google Apps and Google Desktop .
Everyone 's configuration is different , so it 's impossible to know , but Maxim Alexeyev created this Google Desktop Plug - In that efficiently replaces Google Notifier for users .
The plug - in also offers multi-username functions as well as Google Apps support .
For those trying to force Gmail Notifier to use SSL , this wikihow tutorial involves hex editing .
Advanced Mac users with Google Notifier may find this comment on the O’Reilly Mac DevCenter helpful as well .
13 . RSS feeds & Podcasts in Gmail
This Greasemonkey +
Firefox script will allow your Google Reader RSS feed to appear directly in your mailbox .
Google Reader and Gmail seem to be moving closer together in functionality and interface and it's likely that they 'll soon be officially integrated .
In the meantime , Gmail users can also turn emails and conversations into a comprehensive RSS feed using this syntax : https://username:password@gmail.google.com /gmail/feed/atom .
Then sign up for a FeedBurner account to host and distribute it .
With an RSS - to - podcast site like AudioDizer.com or one of the many options at NextUp to create text - to - speech files , users can now listen to their Gmail through an iPod or similar device .
This hack is based on a tip from Mike Donaghy .
For more information , check out these podcast resources .
14 . Inclusive and Exclusive Labels
If you have to do a mailbox - wide search , you may already know what folders and labels to leave exempt .
Instead of browsing through hundreds of search results , implement the âlabel : and +label : syntax to modify your search results to either exclude labels entirely ( with the former ) , or search exclusively in a given label ( with the latter ) .
For instance , if you want to avoid your chat conversations , which are automatically filed like emails with a Chat label , add the string - label : Chat before your search terms .
15 . Use Gmail as an External Hard Drive
Use up any vegetating space in a Gmail account with this Windows drive shell extension ( Mac users should check out gDisk ) .
Your Gmail space will then appear in My Computer as an external drive .
When you drag and drop a file to the drive , an email is sent to your Gmail account with the file as an attachment .
Note that this is a fairly old program but seems to have been updated for the latest Gmail version .
16 . Hack Gmail CSS
If you use multiple Gmail accounts , the Gmail HTML Signatures extension for Firefox +
Greasemonkey automates the signature process .
Based on the address you ’re sending from , this extension will automatically insert HTML - formatted signatures .
Do n’t forget : “ Stylish is to CSS what Greasemonkey is to JavaScript , ” according to the Firefox extension page for Stylish .
Cascade those style sheets yourself , or grab them from userstyles.org .
For more web design tips and tricks , check out these web design and development resources .
17 . Better Gmail 2
For an all - in - one solution using Greasemonkey scripts , check out Better Gmail 2 .
This combines several Greasemonkey scripts into one package .
For instance , users can allow HTML in signatures , force a secure connection , convert labels into folders and make the spam folder invisible .
This suggestion comes highly recommended from CNet .
18 . Â Pre-label & Sort Mail
Many email providers allow you to append your address with + something .
For instance , you can give all of your OS / 2 user group buddies your address as you + OS2@gmail.com .
The incoming emails about IBM ’s late great OS will then be pre-labeled , and you can establish filters to sort them .
The + something system also allows you to stop spam before it starts .
If inappropriate emails with a designated + something address , you can remove the address .
You ’ll also be better equipped to determine where the spam got started .
Gina Trapani at Lifehacker suggests sorting your Gmail according to the Trusted Trio system : Follow Up for messages that need a response ;
Hold for messages you ’re waiting on feedback for ; and Archive for closed messages you may need to refer to later .
Since Gmail has an archive function built - in , Trapani suggests merely creating two labels â Follow Up and Hold ; if desired , add numbers to get the two folders to display in the order you ’d like .
Check out the full explanation of the Trusted Trio system .
19 . Emulate a Mail Client & Control Mailto : Scripts
For those who ca n’t decide between a full - fledged mail client and browser - based Gmail , SimpleMail strikes that perfect balance with a three - paned mail view , which appears to work well with the latest versions of Firefox .
Mailto : links are used on most websites , and typically prompt Outlook or Apple Mail to open as the default mail client regardless of how frequently you use those programs .
This Greasemonkey script forces all such scripts to open a new composition window in Gmail .
20 . Backup your Gmail
If you ’re using a desktop or smartphone mail client , you already have some backups of your email .
But what if you ’re all web - based ?
What if Gmail servers were destroyed or damaged ?
Avoid the frenzy that would inevitably result from such a scenario and check out this Gmail backup tutorial here and the Google Apps backup tips here .
Windows users can find a tutorial ( for experienced users ) for command line Gmail access & nightly backup here .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Following a January surge in refinancing activities , mortgage rates rose this week in the lackluster housing market , but are likely to decline , Freddie Mac reported Thursday .
" Refinancing activities , which had surged to a 12 - month high in January , according to Freddie Mac 's monthly refi-share report , are likely to ebb following this recent rise in rates , " said Frank Nothaft , Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) vice president and chief economist in a statement Thursday .
Nothaft noted that long - term fixed mortgage rates trended up for a third week , bringing 30 - year and 15 - year fixed - rate mortgages back to last November 's levels .
The government - sponsored loan buyer said 30 - year fixed - rate loans averaged 6.24 % for the week ending Thursday , up from 6.04 % last week .
Last year at this time , the 30 - year rate averaged 6.18 % , Freddie Mac said .
Freddie Mac also said 15 - year fixed - rate loans averaged 5.72 % , up from 5.64 % last week .
A year ago , the 15 - year rate averaged 5.92 % .
Rates on five - year adjustable - rate mortgages ( ARMs ) averaged 5.43 % , up from 5.37 % last week .
A year ago , the 5 - year rate averaged 5.93 % .
One - year Treasury - indexed ARMs averaged 5.11 % , up from 4.98 % last week .
At this time a year ago , the 1 - year ARM averaged 5.49 % .
CAPITALISM without bankruptcy , it is said , is like Christianity without hell .
With recession looming , the air in America 's bankruptcy courts is thick with brimstone and the coals are being heated in readiness for the many sad souls whose sin was to borrow too much .
After several heavenly years , in which bankruptcies fell to record lows , going bust is back .
How bad will things get ?
If the debt markets are to be believed , companies could be in at least as much trouble as they were in the previous two downturns , in the early 1990s and at the start of this decade , after the dotcom bubble burst .
A leading indicator is the spread between yields on speculative “ junk ” bonds and American Treasury bonds .
A year ago , the spread was only about 280 basis points ; the long - term average is around 500 points .
This month the spread exceeded 800 points for the first time since March 2003 , reaching 862 on March 17th .
The bankruptcy rate ( in the previous 12 months ) for high - yielding bonds has so far edged only modestly higher , to 1.28 % from a record low of 0.87 % in November .
But most forecasters expect it to rise sharply over the coming months .
For instance , Moody's , a ratings agency , predicts that the default rate will rise to 5.4 % by the end of this year , mostly due to problems in America .
( Moody 's also expects a rise in European bankruptcies this year , but only to 3.4 % , thanks to lower levels of borrowing and less exposure to economic weakness . )
That is a relatively optimistic prediction , for it would merely return the bankruptcy rate close to its long - term average after an abnormally trouble - free period , and it assumes only a mild recession in America .
But if there is a severe recession , the default rate “ could go to double figures , ” admits Kenneth Emery , head of corporate - default research at Moody's .
Other forecasters are much gloomier .
FridsonVision , a research firm , publishes a default - rate predictor based on the percentage of bonds trading with a spread of at least 1,000 basis points .
On March 19th this was forecasting a default rate on high - yielding American corporate bonds of 8.55 % by the end of February 2009 , compared with Moody 's forecast for American bonds of 6.8 % for that date .
Martin Fridson , the firm 's founder , admits this forecast is risky , because it relies on prices set in a market that has been hit by the liquidity crisis .
Indeed , some contrarians believe that today 's corporate - bond spreads say more about the shaky health of the financial markets than they do about the condition of corporate borrowers .
As liquidity returns , they predict , corporate - bond prices will soar , making this the buying opportunity of a lifetime .
Mr Fridson concedes that the difference between corporate - bond spreads and actual default rates is unusual and hard to explain : on the previous occasions when spreads have exceeded 800 points , the default rate was already 9.43 % in 1990 and 5.44 % in 2000 .
That said , the huge amounts of “ covenant lite ” debt issued in the credit boom of 2005 - 07 , which gives lenders much less power to demand their money back than in the past , may have delayed the moment of default for many underperforming firms .
So FridsonVision looked at the ten firms in which spreads exceeded 1,000 points by the smallest amounts .
If these were merely victims of irrational pessimism in the market , they ought to be in relatively good shape .
In fact , the analysts found plenty of reasons to worry .
The companies included household names such as Beazer Homes , Ford and Rite Aid , all of which are “ exhibiting classically distressed behaviour of downsizing amid recurring losses . ”
A look at the firms with distressed debt shows that problems are rapidly moving beyond the long - term sick ( airlines , cars ) and the industries immediately affected by the crisis ( home builders , mortgage lenders , monoline insurers ) .
Craig Dean of AEG Partners , a restructuring - advisory firm , says he is now seeing troubled companies in retailing , restaurants , manufacturing and food processing .
As defaults rise , the new rules governing Chapter 11 of America 's bankruptcy code will face their first test .
Long admired as the world 's best system for allowing corporate liabilities to be restructured while giving firms a decent chance of staying in business , the rules were tightened in 2005 to deter firms from staying in Chapter 11 too long and to stop the managers of bankrupt firms from paying themselves too much .
One result may be that firms will try to restructure without going into Chapter 11 , or at least do much more preparation before they enter it , says Mr Dean .
But perhaps the biggest difference this time will be the effects of the huge market for credit derivatives and other credit - related securities , which often dwarf the amount of debt that a firm has issued , says Henry Owsley of Gordion , another restructuring adviser .
The interaction between underlying debt and credit derivatives will complicate bankruptcy and near - bankruptcy no end , he says .
A big concern for company bosses will be the role of speculative investors , especially hedge funds .
They can use derivatives to pursue complex strategies that may not be in the best interests of the firm that has issued the underlying debt , says Henry Hu , a law professor at the University of Texas , Austin .
In a bankruptcy , a hedge fund could use the voting rights attached to different securities to maximise the overall value of its holdings in the firm at the expense of other investors .
Imagine , for instance , a hedge fund that owns debt secured against a company asset .
It may prefer to force the firm into liquidation in order to win that asset rather than engage in a restructuring negotiation that will keep the firm alive .
Meanwhile , it can boost its returns by short selling its unsecured debt and its equity .
Or suppose that a hedge fund owns credit - default swaps as well as a firm 's debt .
If the fund makes enough money from the pay - out of the credit - default swaps , it may prefer to use the voting rights on its debt to ensure that the firm goes bust rather than negotiate a way to avoid bankruptcy .
So far there is little hard evidence that hedge funds are doing this .
But in recent papers written with his colleague Bernard Black , Mr Hu reports credible rumours and other evidence of what they have dubbed “ debt decoupling ” , both in and outside of bankruptcy .
Such activity is only likely to increase .
“ When there are more restructurings and bankruptcies , there is a lot more potential for mischief , ” says Mr Hu .

Much of what people do is done in the name of God.
Irishmen blow each other up in his name .
Arabs blow themselves up in his name .
Imams and ayatollahs oppress women in his name .
Celibate popes and priests mess up people 's sex lives in his name .
Jewish shohets cut live animals ' throats in his name .
The achievements of religion in past history -- bloody crusades , torturing inquisitions , mass - murdering conquistadors , culture - destroying missionaries , legally enforced resistance to each new piece of scientific truth until the last possible moment -- are even more impressive .
And what has it all been in aid of ?
I believe it is becoming increasingly clear that the answer is absolutely nothing at all .
There is no reason for believing that any sort of gods exist and quite good reason for believing that they do not exist and never have .
It has all been a gigantic waste of time and a waste of life .
It would be a joke of cosmic proportions if it were n't so tragic .
Why do people believe in God ?
For most people the answer is still some version of the ancient Argument from Design .
We look about us at the beauty and intricacy of the world -- at the aerodynamic sweep of a swallow 's wing , at the delicacy of flowers and of the butterflies that fertilize them , through a microscope at the teeming life in every drop of pond water , through a telescope at the crown of a giant redwood tree .
We reflect on the electronic complexity and optical perfection of our own eyes that do the looking .
If we have any imagination , these things drive us to a sense of awe and reverence .
Moreover , we cannot fail to be struck by the obvious resemblance of living organs to the carefully planned designs of human engineers .
The argument was most famously expressed in the watchmaker analogy of the eighteenth - century priest William Paley .
Even if you did n't know what a watch was , the obviously designed character of its cogs and springs and of how they mesh together for a purpose would force you to conclude " that the watch must have had a maker : that there must have existed , at some time , and at some place or other , an artificer or artificers , who formed it for the purpose which we find it actually to answer ; who comprehended its construction , and designed its use . "
If this is true of a comparatively simple watch , how much the more so is it true of the eye , ear , kidney , elbow joint , brain ?
These beautiful , complex , intricate , and obviously purpose - built structures must have had their own designer , their own watchmaker -- God .
So ran Paley 's argument , and it is an argument that nearly all thoughtful and sensitive people discover for themselves at some stage in their childhood .
Throughout most of history it must have seemed utterly convincing , self - evidently true .
And yet , as the result of one of the most astonishing intellectual revolutions in history , we now know that it is wrong , or at least superfluous .
We now know that the order and apparent purposefulness of the living world has come about through an entirely different process , a process that works without the need for any designer and one that is a consequence of basically very simple laws of physics .
This is the process of evolution by natural selection , discovered by Charles Darwin and , independently , by Alfred Russel Wallace .
What do all objects that look as if they must have had a designer have in common ?
The answer is statistical improbability .
If we find a transparent pebble washed into the shape of a crude lens by the sea , we do not conclude that it must have been designed by an optician : the unaided laws of physics are capable of achieving this result ; it is not too improbable to have just " happened . "
But if we find an elaborate compound lens , carefully corrected against spherical and chromatic aberration , coated against glare , and with " Carl Zeiss " engraved on the rim , we know that it could not have just happened by chance .
If you take all the atoms of such a compound lens and throw them together at random under the jostling influence of the ordinary laws of physics in nature , it is theoretically possible that , by sheer luck , the atoms would just happen to fall into the pattern of a Zeiss compound lens , and even that the atoms round the rim should happen to fall in such a way that the name Carl Zeiss is etched out .
But the number of other ways in which the atoms could , with equal likelihood , have fallen , is so hugely , vastly , immeasurably greater that we can completely discount the chance hypothesis .
Chance is out of the question as an explanation .
This is not a circular argument , by the way .
It might seem to be circular because , it could be said , any particular arrangement of atoms is , with hindsight , very improbable .
As has been said before , when a ball lands on a particular blade of grass on the golf course , it would be foolish to exclaim : " Out of all the billions of blades of grass that it could have fallen on , the ball actually fell on this one .
How amazingly , miraculously improbable ! "
The fallacy here , of course , is that the ball had to land somewhere .
We can only stand amazed at the improbability of the actual event if we specify it a priori : for example , if a blindfolded man spins himself round on the tee , hits the ball at random , and achieves a hole in one .
That would be truly amazing , because the target destination of the ball is specified in advance .
Of all the trillions of different ways of putting together the atoms of a telescope , only a minority would actually work in some useful way .
Only a tiny minority would have Carl Zeiss engraved on them , or , indeed , any recognizable words of any human language .
The same goes for the parts of a watch : of all the billions of possible ways of putting them together , only a tiny minority will tell the time or do anything useful .
And of course the same goes , a fortiori , for the parts of a living body .
Of all the trillions of trillions of ways of putting together the parts of a body , only an infinitesimal minority would live , seek food , eat , and reproduce .
True , there are many different ways of being alive -- at least ten million different ways if we count the number of distinct species alive today -- but , however many ways there may be of being alive , it is certain that there are vastly more ways of being dead !
We can safely conclude that living bodies are billions of times too complicated -- too statistically improbable -- to have come into being by sheer chance .
How , then , did they come into being ?
The answer is that chance enters into the story , but not a single , monolithic act of chance .
Instead , a whole series of tiny chance steps , each one small enough to be a believable product of its predecessor , occurred one after the other in sequence .
These small steps of chance are caused by genetic mutations , random changes -- mistakes really -- in the genetic material .
They give rise to changes in the existing bodily structure .
Most of these changes are deleterious and lead to death .
A minority of them turn out to be slight improvements , leading to increased survival and reproduction .
By this process of natural selection , those random changes that turn out to be beneficial eventually spread through the species and become the norm .
The stage is now set for the next small change in the evolutionary process .
After , say , a thousand of these small changes in series , each change providing the basis for the next , the end result has become , by a process of accumulation , far too complex to have come about in a single act of chance .
For instance , it is theoretically possible for an eye to spring into being , in a single lucky step , from nothing : from bare skin , let 's say .
It is theoretically possible in the sense that a recipe could be written out in the form of a large number of mutations .
If all these mutations happened simultaneously , a complete eye could , indeed , spring from nothing .
But although it is theoretically possible , it is in practice inconceivable .
The quantity of luck involved is much too large .
The " correct " recipe involves changes in a huge number of genes simultaneously .
The correct recipe is one particular combination of changes out of trillions of equally probable combinations of chances .
We can certainly rule out such a miraculous coincidence .
But it is perfectly plausible that the modern eye could have sprung from something almost the same as the modern eye but not quite : a very slightly less elaborate eye .
By the same argument , this slightly less elaborate eye sprang from a slightly less elaborate eye still , and so on .
If you assume a sufficiently large number of sufficiently small differences between each evolutionary stage and its predecessor , you are bound to be able to derive a full , complex , working eye from bare skin .
How many intermediate stages are we allowed to postulate ?
That depends on how much time we have to play with .
Has there been enough time for eyes to evolve by little steps from nothing ?
The fossils tell us that life has been evolving on Earth for more than 3,000 million years .
It is almost impossible for the human mind to grasp such an immensity of time .
We , naturally and mercifully , tend to see our own expected lifetime as a fairly long time , but we can't expect to live even one century .
It is 2,000 years since Jesus lived , a time span long enough to blur the distinction between history and myth .
Can you imagine a million such periods laid end to end ?
Suppose we wanted to write the whole history on a single long scroll .
If we crammed all of Common Era history into one metre of scroll , how long would the pre-Common Era part of the scroll , back to the start of evolution , be ?
The answer is that the pre-Common Era part of the scroll would stretch from Milan to Moscow .
Think of the implications of this for the quantity of evolutionary change that can be accommodated .
All the domestic breeds of dogs -- Pekingeses , poodles , spaniels , Saint Bernards , and Chihuahuas -- have come from wolves in a time span measured in hundreds or at the most thousands of years : no more than two meters along the road from Milan to Moscow .
Think of the quantity of change involved in going from a wolf to a Pekingese ; now multiply that quantity of change by a million .
When you look at it like that , it becomes easy to believe that an eye could have evolved from no eye by small degrees .
It remains necessary to satisfy ourselves that every one of the intermediates on the evolutionary route , say from bare skin to a modern eye , would have been favored by natural selection ; would have been an improvement over its predecessor in the sequence or at least would have survived .
It is no good proving to ourselves that there is theoretically a chain of almost perceptibly different intermediates leading to an eye if many of those intermediates would have died .
It is sometimes argued that the parts of an eye have to be all there together or the eye wo n't work at all .
Half an eye , the argument runs , is no better than no eye at all .
You can't fly with half a wing ; you can't hear with half an ear .
Therefore there can't have been a series of step - by - step intermediates leading up to a modern eye , wing , or ear .
This type of argument is so naive that one can only wonder at the subconscious motives for wanting to believe it .
It is obviously not true that half an eye is useless .
Cataract sufferers who have had their lenses surgically removed cannot see very well without glasses , but they are still much better off than people with no eyes at all .
Without a lens you can't focus a detailed image , but you can avoid bumping into obstacles and you could detect the looming shadow of a predator .
As for the argument that you can't fly with only half a wing , it is disproved by large numbers of very successful gliding animals , including mammals of many different kinds , lizards , frogs , snakes , and squids .
Many different kinds of tree - dwelling animals have flaps of skin between their joints that really are fractional wings .
If you fall out of a tree , any skin flap or flattening of the body that increases your surface area can save your life .
And , however small or large your flaps may be , there must always be a critical height such that , if you fall from a tree of that height , your life would have been saved by just a little bit more surface area .
Then , when your descendants have evolved that extra surface area , their lives would be saved by just a bit more still if they fell from trees of a slightly greater height .
And so on by insensibly graded steps until , hundreds of generations later , we arrive at full wings .
Eyes and wings cannot spring into existence in a single step .
That would be like having the almost infinite luck to hit upon the combination number that opens a large bank vault .
But if you spun the dials of the lock at random , and every time you got a little bit closer to the lucky number the vault door creaked open another chink , you would soon have the door open !
Essentially , that is the secret of how evolution by natural selection achieves what once seemed impossible .
Things that cannot plausibly be derived from very different predecessors can plausibly be derived from only slightly different predecessors .
Provided only that there is a sufficiently long series of such slightly different predecessors , you can derive anything from anything else .
Evolution , then , is theoretically capable of doing the job that , once upon a time , seemed to be the prerogative of God .
But is there any evidence that evolution actually has happened ?
The answer is yes ; the evidence is overwhelming .
Millions of fossils are found in exactly the places and at exactly the depths that we should expect if evolution had happened .
Not a single fossil has ever been found in any place where the evolution theory would not have expected it , although this could very easily have happened : a fossil mammal in rocks so old that fishes have not yet arrived , for instance , would be enough to disprove the evolution theory .
The patterns of distribution of living animals and plants on the continents and islands of the world is exactly what would be expected if they had evolved from common ancestors by slow , gradual degrees .
The patterns of resemblance among animals and plants is exactly what we should expect if some were close cousins , and others more distant cousins to each other .
The fact that the genetic code is the same in all living creatures overwhelmingly suggests that all are descended from one single ancestor .
The evidence for evolution is so compelling that the only way to save the creation theory is to assume that God deliberately planted enormous quantities of evidence to make it look as if evolution had happened .
In other words , the fossils , the geographical distribution of animals , and so on , are all one gigantic confidence trick .
Does anybody want to worship a God capable of such trickery ?
It is surely far more reverent , as well as more scientifically sensible , to take the evidence at face value .
All living creatures are cousins of one another , descended from one remote ancestor that lived more than 3,000 million years ago .
The Argument from Design , then , has been destroyed as a reason for believing in a God .
Are there any other arguments ?
Some people believe in God because of what appears to them to be an inner revelation .
Such revelations are not always edifying but they undoubtedly feel real to the individual concerned .
Many inhabitants of lunatic asylums have an unshakable inner faith that they are Napoleon or , indeed , God himself .
There is no doubting the power of such convictions for those that have them , but this is no reason for the rest of us to believe them .
Indeed , since such beliefs are mutually contradictory , we can't believe them all .
There is a little more that needs to be said .
Evolution by natural selection explains a lot , but it could n't start from nothing .
It could n't have started until there was some kind of rudimentary reproduction and heredity .
Modern heredity is based on the DNA code , which is itself too complicated to have sprung spontaneously into being by a single act of chance .
This seems to mean that there must have been some earlier hereditary system , now disappeared , which was simple enough to have arisen by chance and the laws of chemistry and which provided the medium in which a primitive form of cumulative natural selection could get started .
DNA was a later product of this earlier cumulative selection .
Before this original kind of natural selection , there was a period when complex chemical compounds were built up from simpler ones and before that a period when the chemical elements were built up from simpler elements , following the well - understood laws of physics .
Before that , everything was ultimately built up from pure hydrogen in the immediate aftermath of the big bang , which initiated the universe .
There is a temptation to argue that , although God may not be needed to explain the evolution of complex order once the universe , with its fundamental laws of physics , had begun , we do need a God to explain the origin of all things .
This idea does n't leave God with very much to do : just set off the big bang , then sit back and wait for everything to happen .
The physical chemist Peter Atkins , in his beautifully written book The Creation , postulates a lazy God who strove to do as little as possible in order to initiate everything .
Atkins explains how each step in the history of the universe followed , by simple physical law , from its predecessor .
He thus pares down the amount of work that the lazy creator would need to do and eventually concludes that he would in fact have needed to do nothing at all !
The details of the early phase of the universe belong to the realm of physics , whereas I am a biologist , more concerned with the later phases of the evolution of complexity .
For me , the important point is that , even if the physicist needs to postulate an irreducible minimum that had to be present in the beginning , in order for the universe to get started , that irreducible minimum is certainly extremely simple .
By definition , explanations that build on simple premises are more plausible and more satisfying than explanations that have to postulate complex and statistically improbable beginnings .
And you can't get much more complex than an Almighty God !

Tim Sanders ' story is not a unique one .
Not at all .
The VA is already overwhelmed by the growing backlog of claims it currently has , and the agency is nowhere near prepared to deal with veterans ' needs for decades into the future thanks to the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Bush Administration 's record on veteran 's issues could hardly be any worse .
What 's more , if Bush had his way these problems would only get much worse after he leaves office .
It 's worth noting that based on McCain 's record , which is completely at odds with his mouth , should he ever manage to succeed Bush , it 's a safe bet that they will .
Something seems wrong with the laws of physics .
Spacecraft are not behaving in the way that they should
MIGHTY oaks from little acorns grow .
In the 1840s an astronomer called Urbain Le Verrier noticed there was something wrong with the orbit of Mercury .
The main axis of the planet 's orbital ellipse shifts each time it goes round the sun .
That was well known , and is caused by the gravitational pull of Venus .
Le Verrier , however , realised that the orbit was shifting too fast .
The excess was a tiny fraction of a degree .
But it was a disturbing departure from the purity of Newton 's majestic clockwork — a departure that was explained only 70 years later , when Einstein 's general theory of relativity swept Newton away by showing that gravity operates by distorting space itself .
Even Einstein , however , may not have got it right .
Modern instruments have shown a departure from his predictions , too .
In 1990 mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , California , which operates America 's unmanned interplanetary space probes , noticed something odd happen to a Jupiter - bound craft , called Galileo .
As it was flung around the Earth in what is known as a slingshot manoeuvre ( designed to speed it on its way to the outer solar system ) , Galileo picked up more velocity than expected .
Not much .
Four millimetres a second , to be precise .
But well within the range that can reliably be detected .
Once might be happenstance .
But this strange extra acceleration was seen subsequently with two other craft .
That , as Goldfinger would have put it , looks like enemy action .
So a team from JPL has got together to analyse all of the slingshot manoeuvres that have been carried out over the years , to see if they really do involve a small but systematic extra boost .
The answer is that they do .
Altogether , John Anderson and his colleagues analysed six slingshots involving five different spacecraft .
Their paper on the matter is about to be published in Physical Review Letters .
Crucially for the idea that there really is a systematic flaw in the laws of physics as they are understood today , their data can be described by a simple formula .
It is therefore possible to predict what should happen on future occasions .
Gravity 's rainbow
That is what Dr Anderson and his team have now done .
They have worked out the exact amount of extra speed that should be observed when they analyse the data from a slingshot last November , which involved a craft called Rosetta .
If their prediction is correct , it will confirm that the phenomenon is real and that their formula is capturing its essence .
Although the cause would remain unknown , a likely explanation is that something in the laws of gravity needs radical revision .
Dr Anderson and his team have , of course , gone through painstaking efforts to rule out conventional physical explanations and systematic errors .
Their model takes into account both general relativity and all known gravitational effects of the sun , the moon , the planets and large asteroids .
Effects stemming from the Earth 's atmosphere , from ocean tides and from the solar wind of charged particles were all found to be too small to explain the spacecrafts ' extra velocity .
And to rule out computer bugs , independent groups verified the calculations using several different versions of the modelling software .
Furthermore , because the effect is present in data from five vehicles — Galileo , the Cassini mission to Saturn , the MESSENGER craft sent to Mercury , and the NEAR and Rosetta missions to study asteroids and comets — the team thinks it is unlikely to be caused by the spacecraft themselves .
Each has a unique design , so a systematic machine - related error is unlikely .
Dr Anderson is no stranger to anomalous behaviour by spacecraft .
In the early 1970s Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 were sent to fly past Jupiter and Saturn .
Once their missions were accomplished , they carried on into the outer reaches of the solar system .
He and his colleagues noticed soon afterwards that the sibling crafts ' trajectories were deviating from those predicted by Einstein .
Both Pioneers act as though an extra force beyond mere gravity is tugging at them from the direction of the sun .
Thirty years later , no explanation for this has been found .
Each year the Pioneers fall a further 5,000 km behind their projected paths .
Hundreds of scientific papers have been written on the Pioneer anomalies , many of them trying to find explanations beyond the current laws of gravity .
Dr Anderson himself points out that several features of the Pioneer anomalies and the slingshot anomalies suggest they may have a common explanation .
Both , for example , involve small objects .
By contrast , the data on which Newton and Einstein built their theories were from stars , planets and moons .
In addition , the spacecraft in question are all travelling in types of orbit not usually seen in natural systems .
Not for them the closed ellipses of Mercury and the other planets ; at the whim of their masters in Pasadena they are following much more unusual hyperbolic curves .
What it all means is not yet clear .
Perhaps there is some overlooked explanation within the laws of physics .
But Le Verrier thought that must be so for his discovery , too .
He and later astronomers spent decades looking for the missing planet within the orbit of Mercury which , they were convinced , explained what was going on .
They even gave it a name : Vulcan .
But it was n't there .
There is a good chance that modern physics is in a similar situation .
It would be nice , therefore , to believe that somewhere , the contemporary equivalent of a bored patent clerk is thinking about the problem , and that when he has thought hard enough , a new reality will emerge .
The leglike pectoral fin for walking is the clue that this newly found fish is an anglerfish , even though it does not have a lure on its head for attracting prey .
Its flat face and forward - looking eyes are just two of a host of reasons why University of Washington professor Ted Pietsch thinks the fish found in January probably represents a new family of vertebrate animals .
While diving in the harbor of a small island in Indonesia recently , husband and wife Buck and Fitrie Randolph , with dive guide Toby Fadirsyair , found a strange fish and took some pictures .
The oddball creature looks like an anglerfish , but different .
Its eyes , unlike those of nearly all fish , point forward and may allow the fish to gauge depth the way humans do .
The flat fish has tan- and peach - colored stripes and rippling folds of skin that obscure its fins .
About the size of a human fist , it is soft and pliable enough to slip into narrow crevices of coral reefs — perhaps why it 's never been seen before .
The divers could not find the fish in any reference books , so they consulted an expert .
" As soon as I saw the photo I knew it had to be an anglerfish because of the leglike pectoral fins on its sides , " said University of Washington fish expert Ted Pietsch today .
" Only anglerfishes have crooked , leglike structures that they use to walk or crawl along the seafloor or other surfaces . "
Anglerfishes are found the world over and typically have lures growing from their foreheads that they wave or wiggle to attract prey .
The newly found fish has no lures so it burrows into a reef to find food .
" Several times I saw these fish work themselves through an opening that seemed much smaller than the fish , sometimes taking a minute or more to get all the way through , " says David Hall , an underwater natural history photographer who was able to dive with Maluku Divers and take additional photos of the newfound creature .
" They must have pretty tough skin to keep from being scraped and cut , but there is no evidence of superficial injury or scars in my photographs . "
With its unusual flattened face , the fish 's eyes appear to be directed forward , something Pietsch says he 's never seen in 40 years studying the structure , classification and habits of fishes .
Most fishes have eyes on either side of their head so that each eye sees something different .
Only very few fishes have eyes whose radius of vision overlaps in front , providing binocular vision , a special attribute well developed in humans that provides the ability to accurately judge distance .
Whether the new fish represent a new family will entail DNA testing and a close examination of a specimen , says Pietsch , whose anglerfish work is currently funded by the National Science Foundation .
Scientists have already described 18 different families of anglerfishes and this is probably a 19th , Pietsch says .
Families are large groupings ; for example , all dog species belong to the larger family that includes wolves and coyotes .

Willie Nelson To Sell High - Tech Atmospheric Water Generators
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
I think it ’s safe to call Willie Nelson a pioneer in environmentally - friendly practices .
Ecorazzi previously reported on Willie ’s participation in Farm Aid , commitment to bio-diesel , and now , after canceling his bottled water line because he could n’t stand the plastic bottles , Willie ’s making the clean water industry a whole lot cleaner .
WaterTechOnline.com is reporting that Willie Nelson has partnered with Ed Russell to produce Willie Nelson ’s Water From Air , the Gulf Coast distributor of Wataire International atmospheric water generator units .
So what exactly is an atmospheric water generator ?
Ok here we go , according to Russell , “ the units generate water from the atmosphere , pulling moist air through a HEPA filter , and working much the same way a typical dehumidifying unit does , except that the newly generated water is pushed through a sediment filter , pre- and post - carbon filters , an ultrafine filter , and finally ultraviolet ( UV ) light before it is stored .
Stored water is recirculated in the UV chamber to retain its potability . ”
And that my friends his how you make some fine , eco-friendly , non-plastic wasting , environmentally sound aqua !
Willie also has plans to team up with fellow country musician Merle Haggard to open a California - based Wataire distributorship in the future .
Russell says that Nelson ’s interest in the Wataire units is because “ he ’s totally green ” — and we totally agree .
Everybody repeat after me : WILLIE NELSON ROCKS !
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Crude - oil futures rallied more than $ 2 Wednesday to end at a record closing price of $ 110.87 a barrel as government data showed a surprising drop in U.S. inventories .
Crude oil for May delivery rose $ 2.37 , or 2.2 % , to close at $ 110.87 on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Earlier it surged to a new intraday high of $ 112.21 a barrel .
The benchmark contract had been up less than $ 1 before the data came out .
Also , gains were seen in petroleum - products futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The nation 's stockpiles of crude fell to 316 million barrels in the week ended April 4 , the Energy Information Administration reported .
This was down 3.2 million barrels on the week .
Analysts surveyed by energy information provider Platts had been looking for an increase of 2.7 million barrels .
" The hefty fall in crude oil stockpiles was a major shock for a market which was expecting the opposite , " said Martin Slaney , an analyst at GFT Global Markets U.K. Ltd. , in e-mailed comments .
" As we head into driving season in the U.S. the tumbling inventories data is particularly significant . "
Chris Lafakis , an analyst at Moody 's Economy.com , called last week 's reduction in inventories " supportive of record oil prices . "
Crude 's previous all - time high record was $ 111.80 hit on March 17 .
Also Wednesday on Nymex , May reformulated gasoline rose 2.38 cents to $ 2.7742 a gallon and May heating oil gained 12.43 cents to $ 3.2345 a gallon , while May natural gas futures rose 35.9 cents to $ 10.056 per million British thermal units .
Weekly data on U.S. gas in storage are due out on Thursday .
Crude inventories in detail
The unexpected drop in crude inventories came from sliding imports , the government 's data showed .
U.S. oil imports averaged 8.9 million barrels a day last week , down nearly 1.4 million barrels a day from the previous week , the EIA reported .
" While imports will probably rebound next week , oil prices will nonetheless go up in the interim , " said Lafakis .
The EIA also reported crude inventories at Cushing , Okla. , the delivery point for crude traded on the Nymex , were unchanged at 17.5 million barrels .
Meanwhile , U.S. gasoline supplies fell 3.4 million barrels in the latest week , while distillate supplies , which include heating oil and diesel , dropped 3.7 million barrels .
Analysts surveyed by Platts had been anticipating declines of 2.3 million barrels for gasoline stocks and 1.3 million barrels for distillates .
U.S. refineries operated at 83 % of their operable capacity last week , up from the previous week 's 82.4 % .
In a separate report , the American Petroleum Institute said U.S. crude inventories rose by 6 million barrels in the week ended April 4 , reaching 315.5 million barrels .
The API , an association of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry , calculates inventories based on different criteria .
Distillate stocks fell to 112.8 million barrels , down 177,000 barrels , while gasoline stocks rose by 1.8 million barrels to stand at 219.2 million barrels , the API said .
Weak demand
Crude 's new record came even as the EIA is forecasting lower energy demand in the U.S .
EIA said in a monthly report released on Tuesday that consumption of liquid fuels and other petroleum products is projected to grow by 40,000 barrels a day in 2008 , a downward revision of 100,000 barrels a day from the previous monthly forecast .
After accounting for increased ethanol use , U.S. petroleum consumption actually could fall by 90,000 barrels a day .
EIA also forecast gasoline prices could surpass $ 4 a gallon in the upcoming driving season .
" There is a significant possibility that prices during some shorter time period , or in some region or sub-region , will cross the $ 4 per gallon threshold , " EIA said in the monthly report .
West Texas Intermediate crude , or the underlying product of the Nymex crude futures , is expected to average $ 102 in March , EIA said in the report .
The annual average WTI price , which was $ 72 per barrel in 2007 , is projected to average $ 94 per barrel in 2008 , but ease to about $ 86 per barrel in 2009 .
People who handle explosives usually have heavy - duty tasks to perform – dislodging rocks , demolishing old buildings , or triggering an avalanche .
Now explosives can be used for delicate tasks , too , like making it possible to place holograms in steel .
Nearly everybody carries holograms around on light things , like money or tickets for a concert , because they protect against forgery .
They take a great deal of effort to produce , and are almost impossible to copy , because the image is created not only by the interaction of different colors and contrasts , but also by the surface structure .
Different pictures can be seen , depending on the direction from which the light is shining .
Holograms are normally produced with the aid of laser beams , starting by creating a prototype from photosensitive material such as Fotoresist .
However , this template is too soft to be able to act as an embossing or injection - moulding tool for holograms .
Consequently , the filigree relief pattern is copied onto a harder material such as nickel by means of electroplating .
Mounted on a roller , this nickel shim transfers the hologram onto a plastic film of the kind that can be seen on concert tickets .
Mould insert with explosive - stamped holographic structures in its inner ring .
© Fraunhofer ICT
Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology ICT in Pfinztal have now adopted a more radical method .
The scientists are using explosives to impress holograms in steel .
With the right dosage , explosives enable a template to be copied with far greater accuracy than by conventional methods .
The ‘ explosive embossing ’ method achieves a resolution in the two - figure nanometer range .
“ Nobody believed such a thing could be possible , ” raves ICT project manager Günter Helferich .
Almost any structure , be it wood , leather , textiles or sand , can be rapidly and accurately impressed on metal in perfect detail with the aid of a sheet explosive .
The scientists are now working with industrial partners to create steel tools with holographic structures – as a ‘ stamp ’ for applying holograms to plastic parts .
The challenge is tremendous :
The structures that have to be imprinted into the steel are so tiny that they cannot even be discerned under an optical microscope .
The experts have optimized the method to the desired image sharpness through numerous series of experiments .
The advantage of this method over electroplating is that it does not produce a soft nickel piece that quickly wears out , but a hard steel stamp .
Steel treated in this way is also in demand in the plastics industry :
Many plastic parts are designed to look decorative and attractive , particularly if they are placed in elegant surroundings .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
It 's midnight on the streets of Atlanta , and bar owner Rufus Terrill patrols his neighborhood with a rolling crime fighter of his own creation .
Meet " Bum - bot , " as Terrill describes it ; others in his neighborhood call it simply , " Robocop . "
This former BBQ smoker is armed with a water gun to chase off bums and drug dealers in downtown Atlanta .
It 's a barbecue smoker mounted on a three - wheeled scooter , and armed with an infrared camera , spotlight , loudspeaker and aluminum water cannon that shoots a stream of icy water about 20 feet .
Operated by remote control , the robot spotlights trespassers on property down the street from his bar , O'Terrill's .
Using a walkie - talkie , Terrill belts out through the robot's loudspeaker , " That 's private property .
You guys need to get out of here . "
Terrill is chasing out unsavory - looking characters from a street corner that resembles a drug dealer 's dream at night .
More than 20 suspicious people were seen huddling in the dark in the front driveway and side parking lot on this night .
Some were seen openly making drug deals .
Watch " Bum - bot " in action »
But during the day , it 's where young children frolic on a nearby playground at a the Beacon of Light Daycare Center in downtown Atlanta .
It has become a nightmare for day care operator Lydia Meredith .
" This whole square is enveloped with homeless people and drug dealers , defecating , urinating , prostituting -- the whole nine yards .
And the overflow of that behavior , we get to cleanup every morning , " she says .
Meredith says people often toss used syringes and condoms onto the playground .
Terrill , an engineer by trade , is also a board member at the day care center .
Tired of cleaning up after the shady characters , he decided to take action .
That 's when he built his downtown Darth Vader of sorts .
" He 's a neighborhood vigilante , " says Meredith , " and when he came up with this -- you know , I call it Robocop -- I said , ' Praise God . ' "
The daycare center is a block from a homeless shelter .
Meredith has a security guard at the center who leaves in the early evening .
" They know when the guard leaves , " she says .
" They know when the cleaning crew leaves and then here comes the drug dealers to prey on the homeless people . "
Anita Beatty , the director of the shelter , is suspicious of the barbecue - smoker robot .
" I just think the whole ' Robocop ' spraying people is a little freaky .
We really need some police protection in this neighborhood .
I think it 's confusing the issue .
I think the issue is homeless people .
They are being confused with the folks who prey on them and sell them drugs , " she says .
Atlanta police patrol the area , but say it 's difficult to stay on top of the large number of people who roam the streets in the area late at night .
Police Major Lane Hagin says the robot is definitely a different crime - fighting idea .
" There 's no problem with the robot going up and down the street or being visible or any of the other things it does -- with the exception of spraying water on people . "
Hagin adds , " Then , it becomes an assault no matter where it happens . "
So far no one has filed charges against Terrill or the robot .
But one homeless man who declined to give his name followed Terrill and his robot down the street and laughingly told him , " I know about you .
I can sue you for assault . "
Terrill says he's not hurting anyone and often sprays the water to the side of loiterers as a ploy to get them to move on .
He 's also not about to back down .
" If you 're throwing condoms out on the side of the playground , if you 're throwing needles , you 're throwing crack pipes out there , I 'm not going to let those kids be out there like that .
I 'm going to stop you . "
Terrill bought his bar four years ago knowing nothing about the restaurant business .
He ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor of Georgia in 2006 .
He 's had ongoing problems with people breaking into his bar and stealing things , but it was the day care center problems that spurred him on to create the robot .
Some of Terrill 's bar patrons say they 've seen a difference in the neighborhood .
Susanne Coe lives nearby .
" I 've seen a marked change simply with this robot that does n't have any power of arrest .
It does scare people and to be honest with you I 'm grateful for it , " she says .
On this night , as Terrill and his robot make their way to the street corner , he shines the robot 's spotlight on the parking lot of the daycare center .
One by one , the shadowy figures stand up , walk away and saunter down the street .
" Ninety - nine percent of the time , when I go up there and once I turn the spotlight on and I talk to them through the speaker , they leave , " he says .

All About Drug Trafficking • Atlanta
An international anti-slavery expert says the problem of human trafficking and slavery in Australia is much worse than official figures suggest .
A recent parliamentary inquiry estimated there are between 300 and 1,000 female sex slaves in Australia .
At a forum in Brisbane today , University of San Francisco spokesman Dr David Batstone said most Australians do not realise the extent of the problem .
He says at another forum on the issue , he heard a report of a restaurant that kept slaves in its basement .
" An audience member said ' I know another restaurant that 's doing that right now .
What do I do about it ? ' , " he said .
" So it gives me - this is anecdotal evidence , or case evidence - that suggests that it 's much broader than the maybe 1,000 or 2,000 that are projected that are probably in Australia . "
' Blood on our teeth '
Meanwhile , World Vision says Australians are eating cheap chocolate produced by child labour .
The charity has launched a national campaign against slavery and human trafficking .
World Vision Australia chief executive Reverend Tim Costello says on a recent visit to the Ivory Coast and Ghana he saw the chocolate industry using child labour .
Speaking in Brisbane today he said the industry had been resisting pressure to clean up its work practices .
" We have silly little guilts .
We say 'oh , I sinned , I ate some chocolate ' , " he said .
" Well there is a real sin .
It 's not putting a pound on , it 's actually child labour giving us cheap chocolate .
" That 's the real sin , that 's the blood on our teeth , that 's [ what ] we have started there . "
The chief executive of Confectionery Manufacturers of Australasia , Trish Hyde , agrees with World Vision that child labour is a serious issue that needs addressing .
But she has countered Mr Costello 's claim that the chocolate industry is resisting improvement .
" Far from resisting pressure to clean up its work practices , there is significant work being undertaken by the industry , " she said in a statement .
" On the ground programs that are raising awareness and changing communities are underway now .
Industry is supporting education for cocoa farmers on safe , responsible labour practices to reduce children 's exposure to potentially hazardous situations .
" This education through farmer field schools also helps farmers get better crop yields , which means farming families are better off . "
NOT long ago , because there is no winter baseball in this country , I was channel surfing in search of amusement and ended up watching a debate of Republican presidential candidates .
Sen. John McCain was attacking Rep. Ron Paul for opposing the Iraq war .
He called Paul an “ isolationist ” and said it was that kind of thinking that had caused World War II .
How old , I asked myself , is John McCain , that he is keeping alive this ancient World War II canard ?
Is it going to pass down to subsequent generations ?
All wars have to be sold , but World War II , within the memory of the pointless carnage that then became known as World War I , was a particularly hard sell .
Roosevelt and Churchill did it well , and their lies have been with us ever since .
Nicholson Baker ’s “ Human Smoke ” is a meticulously researched and well - constructed book demonstrating that World War II was one of the biggest , most carefully plotted lies in modern history .
According to the myth , British and American statesmen naively thought they could reason with such brutal fascists as Germany ’s Hitler and Japan ’s Tojo .
Faced with this weakness , Hitler and Tojo tried to take over the world , and the United States and Britain were forced to use military might to stop them .
Because Baker is primarily a novelist , it might be expected that , having taken on this weighty subject , he would write about it with great flare and drama .
Readers may initially be disappointed , yet one of this book ’s great strengths is that it avoids flourishes in favor of the kind of lean prose employed by journalists .
“ Human Smoke ” is a series of well - written , brilliantly ordered snapshots , the length of news dispatches .
Baker states that he wanted to raise these questions about World War II : “ Was it a ‘ good war ’ ?
Did waging it help anyone who needed help ? ”
His very effective style is to offer the facts and leave readers to draw their own conclusions .
The facts are powerful .
Baker shows , step by step , how an alliance dominated by leaders who were bigoted , far more opposed to communism than to fascism , obsessed with arms sales and itching for a fight coerced the world into war .

Anti-Semitism was rife among the Allies .
Of Franklin Roosevelt , Baker notes that in 1922 , when he was a New York attorney , he “ noticed that Jews made up one - third of the freshman class at Harvard ” and used his influence to establish a Jewish quota there .
For years he obstructed help for European Jewry , and as late as 1939 he discouraged passage of the Wagner - Rogers bill , an attempt by Congress to save Jewish children .
British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain said in 1939 of German treatment of Jews that “ no doubt Jews are n’t a lovable people .
I do n’t care about them myself . ”
Once the war began , Winston Churchill wanted to imprison German Jewish refugees because they were Germans .
What a comfort such leadership must have been to the Nazis , who , according to the New York Times of Dec. 3 , 1931 , were trying to figure out a way to rid Germany of Jews without “ arousing foreign opinion . ”
Churchill is a dominant figure in “ Human Smoke , ” depicted as a bloodthirsty warmonger who , in 1922 , was still bemoaning the fact that World War I had n’t lasted a little longer so that Britain could have had its air force in place to bomb Berlin and “ the heart of Germany . ”
But no , he whined , it had to stop , “ owing to our having run short of Germans and enemies . ”
Churchill was not driven by anti-fascism .
In his 1937 book “ Great Contemporaries , ” he described Hitler as “ a highly competent , cool , well - informed functionary with an agreeable manner . ”
The same book savagely attacked Leon Trotsky .
( What was wrong with Trotsky ?
“ He was still a Jew .
Nothing could get over that . ” )
Churchill repeatedly praised Mussolini for his “ gentle and simple bearing . ”
In 1927 , he told a Roman audience , “ If I had been an Italian , I am sure that I should have been entirely with you from the beginning to the end of your victorious struggle against the bestial appetites and passions of Leninism . ”
Churchill considered fascism “ a necessary antidote to the Russian virus , ” Baker writes .
In 1938 , he remarked to the press that if England were ever defeated in war , he hoped “ we should find a Hitler to lead us back to our rightful position among nations . ”
As Baker ’s book makes clear , between the two World Wars communism , not fascism , was the enemy .
David Lloyd George , who had been Britain ’s prime minister during World War I , cautioned in 1933 , the year Hitler came to power , that if the Allies managed to overthrow Nazism , “ what would take its place ?
Extreme communism .
Surely that can not be our objective . ”
But even more than the communists , Churchill ’s enemy No. 1 in the 1920s and early ‘ 30s was Mohandas Gandhi and his doctrine of nonviolence , which Churchill warned “ will , sooner or later , have to be grappled with and finally crushed . ”

In the 1930s , U.S. industry was free to sell the Germans and the Japanese whatever they ’d buy , including weapons .
Not to lose out , the British and French sold tanks and bombers to Hitler .
Calls by Joseph Tenenbaum of the American Jewish Congress to boycott Germany were ignored .
There was no attempt to contain , isolate , hinder or overthrow Hitler -- not because of naivete but because of commerce .
It was the Depression .
There were Germans trying to overthrow Hitler , but the U.S. and Britain and their industries were obstructing that effort .
Baker shows that the Japanese , as early as 1934 , were complaining that Roosevelt was deliberately provoking them .
In January 1941 , Japan protested the U.S. military buildup in Hawaii .
Joseph Grew , our ambassador to Japan , reported rumors that the Japanese response would be a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor .
Yet according to World War II mythology , America was blissfully sleeping , unprepared for war , when caught by surprise by the dastardly “ sneak attack . ”
( Is n’t it curious that Asians carry out “ sneak attacks , ” whereas Westerners launch “ preemptive strikes ” ? )
A year earlier , Baker shows , Roosevelt began planning the bombing of Japan -- which had invaded China , but with which we were not at war -- from Chinese air bases with American planes and , when necessary , American pilots .
Pearl Harbor was a purely military target , but Roosevelt wanted to bomb Japanese cities with incendiary bombs ; he ’d been assured that their cities would burn fast , being made largely of wood and paper .
Roosevelt evinced no desire to negotiate .
In fact , Baker writes , in October he “ began leaking the news of his new war plan , ” with $ 100 billion earmarked for airplanes alone .
Grew again warned Roosevelt that he was pushing Japan toward armed conflict with the United States , but the president continued his war preparations .
Finally , the night before the Japanese attack , Roosevelt sent a message to Emperor Hirohito calling for talks .
He read it to the Chinese ambassador , remarking that he thought the message would “ be fine for the record . ”
People are going to get really angry at Baker for criticizing their favorite war .
But he has n’t fashioned his tale from gossip .
It is documented , with copious notes and attributions .
The grace of these well - ordered snapshots is that there is no diatribe ; you are left to put things together yourself .
Read “ Human Smoke . ”
It may be one of the most important books you will ever read .
It could help the world to understand that there is no Just War , there is just war -- and that wars are not caused by isolationists and peaceniks but by the promoters of warfare .
Swami Kriyananda is the founder of Ananda Worldwide and served as its spiritual director until his passing in 2013 .
He continues to be a guiding light for Ananda devotees and Ananda ’s development as a whole , and an inspiration to truthseekers throughout the world .
Ananda is dedicated to serving Paramhansa Yogananda ’s mission
From its inception , Swami Kriyananda dedicated Ananda , as he did his own life , to serving Paramhansa Yogananda .
In his Last Will , Testament , and Legacy , Swami Kriyananda expresses this as a guiding principle for Ananda ’s work :
Ananda is not , and never has been , my own work , personally .
I founded it in the name of , and did my earnest best to carry it on in the spirit of , my Guru Paramhansa Yogananda , and of his line of gurus : Jesus Christ , Mahavatar Babaji , Lahiri Mahasaya , and Swami Sri Yukteswar .
The last in this line of gurus is Paramhansa Yogananda .
Should anyone look upon me as his spiritual teacher , I ask that he do so as a representative of our line of gurus , and not as a guru in my own separate right .
Swami Kriyananda ’s role at Ananda
Ananda consciously draws on Swami Kriyananda ’s writings , his lectures , his music , and his own life - example of discipleship to guide its expression of Yogananda ’s mission .
Ananda members study these often to inspire their personal practice of Yogananda ’s teachings and to clarify how to share these teachings through our worldwide work .
Swami Kriyananda explained his role in guiding seekers in their practice of Yogananda ’s teachings as follows :
I am only my Guru ’s instrument .
His power is much greater than mine , though I am aware that through me people have come closer to him .
My desire in teaching is simply to please God and Guru , and to help others .
Yogananda told me that this is my path to salvation .
What is comfortable for me , personally , is the thought that I am your friend in God .
When I teach , it is in a spirit of friendship , of sharing with you , and of serving God through you all .
But I ’m certainly an active link to Yogananda — for those of you who live and work here at Ananda , and who try to follow the things I teach you in his name .
Yogananda himself , while living , urged the newer disciples to look to his close disciples , and not to him alone , for guidance and inspiration .
I recall also how he told Vance Milligan , a young disciple , “ You should mix more with Walter [ which is how he referred to Kriyananda ] .
You do n’t know what you have in him . ”
The truth is , those who think to go straight to God and Guru , without help from others , have not yet learned the humility necessary to advance much on the path .
The wise devotee , rather , knowing how difficult it is at all times to get out of delusion , is eager for any guidance he can get on his journey .
Kriyananda was trained for his role in sharing the teachings of Self - realization by Yogananda himself .
During their time together , Yogananda often told him , “ You have a great work to do , ” and “ Your work in this life is writing , editing , and lecturing . ”
And once , to a small group of monks , Yogananda said , “ If Walter [ Kriyananda ] had come earlier , we would have reached millions ! ”
Today , Kriyananda continues to reach the “ millions ” of seekers that Yogananda foresaw — through his writings , his music , his own life - example of discipleship , and the many students he personally trained in how to practice and how to share Yogananda ’s teachings .
These constitute Swami Kriyananda ’s living legacy that you , too , can draw upon to bring these teachings into a clear focus and to make your journey to Self - realization both deeply fulfilling and deeply enjoyable .
In recent years , light emitting diodes ( LEDs ) have begun to change the way we see the world .
Now , a Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute student has developed a new type of LED that could allow for their widespread use as light sources for liquid crystal displays ( LCDs ) on everything from televisions and computers to cell phones and cameras .
Martin Schubert , a doctoral student in electrical , computer , and systems engineering , has developed the first polarized LED , an innovation that could vastly improve LCD screens , conserve energy , and usher in the next generation of ultra-efficient LEDs .
Next Generation of LEDs
Schubert ’s polarized LED advances current LED technology in its ability to better control the direction and polarization of the light being emitted .
With better control over the light , less energy is wasted producing scattered light , allowing more light to reach its desired location .
This makes the polarized LED perfectly suited as a backlighting unit for any kind of LCD , according to Schubert .
Its focused light will produce images on the display that are more colorful , vibrant , and lifelike , with no motion artifacts .
Schubert first discovered that traditional LEDs actually produce polarized light , but existing LEDs did not capitalize on the light ’s polarization .
Armed with this information , he devised an optics setup around the LED chip to enhance the polarization , creating the first polarized LED .
The invention could advance the effort to combine the power and environmental soundness of LEDs with the beauty and clarity of LCDs .
Schubert expects that his polarized LED could quickly become commonplace in televisions and monitors around the world , replacing widely used fluorescent lights that are less efficient and laden with mercury .
His innovation also could be used for street lighting , high - contrast imaging , sensing , and free - space optics , he said .
Schubert ’s innovation has earned him the $ 30,000 Lemelson - Rensselaer Student Prize .
Just now in Raleigh , Obama took issue with ABC News ' conduct during last night 's debate , and used it to link Clinton to traditional political tactics .
I will tell you it does not get more fun than these debates .
They are inspiring debates .
I think last night we set a new record because it took us 45 minutes before we even started talking about a single issue that matters to the American people .
It took us 45 minutes — 45 minutes before we heard about health care , 45 minutes before we heard about Iraq , 45 minutes before we heard about jobs , 45 minutes before we heard about gas prices .
Now , I do n’t blame Washington for this because that ’s just how Washington is .
They like stirring up controversies and getting us to play gotcha games and getting us to attack each other .
And I ’ve got to say Sen. Clinton looked in her element .
She was taking every opportunity to , you know , get a dig in there ....
That ’s all right , that ’s her right , that ’s her right to kind of twist the knife a little bit ....
Look , I understand though , because that ’s the textbook Washington campaign , because that ’s the politics that ’s been taught to be played , that ’s the lesson that she had heard when the Republicans were doing the same things to her back in the 1990s .
The President of the United States , George W. Bush , remains , disgracing his office for longtime repeated violations of the Constitution , federal laws and international treaties to which the U.S. is a solemn signatory .
In his forthright resignation statement , Eliot Spitzer — the prominent corporate crime buster — asserted that “ Over the course of my public life , I have insisted , I believe correctly , that people , regardless of their position or power , take responsibility for their conduct .
I can and will ask no less of myself . ”
In a recent speech to a partisan Republican fund - raising audience , George W. Bush fictionalized his Iraq war exploits and other related actions , and said that next January he will leave office “ with his head held high . ”
Eliot Spitzer violated certain laws regarding prostitution and transferring of money through banks — though the latter was disputed by some legal experts — and for such moral turpitude emotionally harmed himself , his family and his friends .
George W. Bush violated federal laws against torture , against spying on Americans without judicial approval , against due process of law and habeas corpus in arresting Americans without charges , imprisoning them and limited their access to attorneys .
He committed a massive war of aggression , under false preteneses , violating again and again treaties such as the Geneva Conventions , the UN Charter , federal statutes and the Constitution .
This war and its associated actions have cost the lives of one million Iraqis , over 4000 Americans , caused hundreds of thousands of serious injuries and diseases related to the destruction of Iraq ’s public health facilities .
As the popular button puts it , " He Lied , They Died " .
From the moment the news emerged about Spitzer ’s sexual frolics the calls came for his immediate resignation .
They came from the pundits and editorialists ; they came from Republicans and they started coming from his fellow Democrats in the Assembly .
Speaker Sheldon Silver told Spitzer that many Democrats in the Assembly would abandon him in any impeachment vote .
George W. Bush is a recidivist war criminal and chronic violator of so many laws that the Center for Constitutional Rights has clustered them into five major impeachable “ High Crimes and Misdemeanors ” ( under Article II , section .4 )
Scores of leaders of the bar , including Michael Greco , former president of the American Bar Association , and legal scholars and former Congressional lawmakers have decried his laceration of the rule of law and his frequent declarations that signify that he believes he is above the law .
Many retired high military officers , diplomats and security officials have openly opposed his costly militaristic disasters .
Only Cong. Dennis Kucinich ( Dem. Ohio ) has publicly called for his impeachment .
No other member of Congress has moved toward his impeachment .
To the contrary , Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( Dem. Calif . ) , Rep. Steny Hoyer ( Dem. MD ) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman , John Conyers ( dem. Mich . ) publicly took “ impeachment off the table ” in 2006 .
When Senator Russ Feingold ( Dem. Wisc. ) introduced a Resolution to merely censure George W. Bush for his clear , repeated violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act — a felony — his fellow Democrats looked the other way and ignored him .
Eliot Spitzer came under the rule of law and paid the price with his governorship and perhaps may face criminal charges .
George W. Bush is effectively immune from federal criminal and civil laws because no American has standing to sue him and the Attorney General , who does , is his handpicked cabinet member .
Moreover , the courts have consistently refused to take cases involving the conduct of foreign and military policy by the president and the Vice President regardless of the seriousness of the violation .
The courts pronounce such disputes as “ political ” and say they have to be worked out by the Congress — ie. mainly the impeachment authority .
Meanwhile , the American people have no authority to challenge these governmental crimes , which are committed in their name , and are rendered defenseless except for elections , which the two Party duopoly has rigged , commercialized , and trivialized .
Even in this electoral arena , a collective vote of ouster of the incumbents does not bring public officials to justice , just to another position usually in the high paying corporate world .
So , on January 21 , 2009 , George W. Bush and Dick Cheney will be fugitives from justice without any Sheriffs , prosecutors or courts willing to uphold the rule of law .
What are the lessons from the differential treatment of a public official who consorts with prostitutes , without affecting his public policies , and a President who behaves like King George III did in 1776 and commits the exact kinds of multiple violations that Thomas Jefferson , James Madison , and other founders of our Republic envisioned for invoking the impeachment provision of their carefully crafted checks and balances in the Constitution ?
Well let ’s see .
First , Bush and Cheney are advised not to travel to Brattleboro or Marlboro Vermont , two New England towns whose voters , in their frustrated outrage , passed non-binding articles instructing town officials to arrest them inside their jurisdictions .
Second , George W. Bush better not go to some men’s room at an airport and tap the shoe of the fellow in the next stall .
While one lame - duck Senator barely survived that charge , for the President it would mean a massive public demand for his resignation .
We certainly can do better as a country of laws , not men .

HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - The Houston Rockets beat the Los Angeles Lakers 104-92 on Sunday to claim their 22nd consecutive victory and take sole possession of first place in the Western Conference .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
The winning streak is second only to the Lakers ’ 33 - game run in the 1971 - 72 season .
Sunday ’s win pushed the Rockets to 46 - 20 while Los Angeles dropped to 45 - 21 .
“ These guys , they keep bringing it game after game , and that ’s what we have to do , ” Rockets coach Rick Adelman said .
“ It ’s a great win . ”
Rafer Alston scored a career - high 31 points , picking up the slack for an out - of - sorts Tracy McGrady , who finished with 11 points .
Lakers coach Phil Jackson praised the Rockets defense and team play .
“ They share the ball , their defense is solid .
I ’m sure their three - point shooting has n’t been like that in the past , but Tracy had probably as poor a game as he ’s probably played and they were still able to win , ” he said .
Kobe Bryant hit just 11 of 33 shots to end with 24 points for Los Angeles , which had come into the game tied with the Rockets for the best record in the West .
The Rockets lost All - Star center Yao Ming for the season with a foot injury 10 games ago , while the Lakers played without center Pau Gasol , who injured his ankle in a game against New Orleans .
The Rockets , who last tasted defeat on January 27 against Utah , host the NBA - best Boston Celtics on Tuesday .
“ We had a challenge today -- we had to beat the Lakers to get that ( top ) spot , and we did it , ” said Adelman .
“ Now we have the best team in the East coming in here and that will be our next challenge . ”
The American Nightmare : Illustrating The Subprime Lending and Borrowing Bust
How many times have you heard of those stories of woe and bankruptcy caused by the subprime lending and borrowing crisis , currently in the forefront of real estate market news ?
For me , too many .
Here ’s a typical account that I found in our local newspaper recently .
Well , there ’s more where that came from : you do n’t have to look too far to find more tales of struggle that echo the same theme over and over .
This is the type of stuff that could have repercussions across markets far and wide , and will be touching lives far and wide for years to come .
Ultimately , it all boils down to some typical scenarios that I ’ve decided to illustrate in a graphical fashion .
Following is an illustration that I ’ve kept faithful to the actual stories of people caught up in this subprime lending mess ( who are usually immigrants or lower income families ) .
Everything here is factual .

Do n’t let your future end in an American Nightmare : stay away from those lousy loans !
Sad to say , it ’s already way too late for too many .
A Closer Look At Subprime Borrowing : A Case Study
Better to live in a garage than to live without enough to eat .
– Cristina Plata , subprime mortgage borrower
Now let ’s segue into a case study that reflects how the American Nightmare typically unfolds .
With countless homes dotting the landscapes of California , all priced in the mid to high six figures ( some even hitting $ 1 million ) , all on 5,000 or under square foot patches of ground , all with a maximum of 3 bedrooms and a couple of baths to make you feel like a “ king ” , how can you not attempt to get a piece of the property pie ?
How can you not help but play the real estate market like everyone else before you whose success you ’ve coveted as well ?
Seriously though , this is what a million dollars bought in certain parts of the nation , during the height of the housing bubble .
Some of these homes are found in the outskirts of major cities in Northern California , some in flood plains or in baking desert - like surroundings .
During the height of the crazy real estate market , many new homeowners happily — no , desperately — made their first home buying purchase for such an abode .
This may have been someone like Luis Mapula and his wife Cristina Plata , subprime mortgage borrowers and immigrants with 2 young kids who once lived in a converted garage and who tried to transition to a nice two bedroom house in East San Jose , California .
Back then , this fellow earned $ 54,000 a year working as a fence company construction worker , which by all accounts and especially by national standards , was a pretty decent living .
But through a real estate broker , he found himself owning a ridiculously overpriced typical California home worth $ 543,000 with no money down .
What ’s surprising is that often , these people are n’t even in the market for a house to begin with and instead have been targeted by unscrupulous real estate agents .
Many who are approached for home buying opportunities via these steep loans are people who have never heard of these schemes before , who are not financially savvy , who are the most vulnerable , and who are not familiar with how real estate is typically transacted .
In the end , they are left holding the bag with ruined credit after perhaps struggling to pay for a mortgage that costs over and above their gross monthly pay .
How does this happen ?
Here is the usual chain of events that can happen to an unsuspecting victim .
The Subprime Borrowing Road To Broke
# 1 Questionable real estate professionals begin targeting “ customers ” .
Sleazy agents frequent ethnic community areas to scout out targets .
This would and could happen anywhere !
# 2
If you are reading this list , you ’re an unlikely target .
Targeted individuals and potential victims are often not native language speakers , and are enticed with stories of homeownership and the American Dream .
The agents are relentless about contacting these people , reminding them of the opportunities that can be had .
# 3
This is a case of too many real estate players handling an application .
A number of people work on the homebuyer ’s applications and falsely inflate the buyer ’s income to make them qualify for a house that is way out of their financial reach .
This was how “ liar loans ” were concocted and born .
# 4
Paying your mortgage can become a family affair or a rental business .
The homebuyers are encouraged to make their payments by doing creative things like renting out other rooms or pooling their finances with friends and family who may or may not decide to live under the same roof .

Do n’t look at me , I ’m not the subprime lender !
When the fraud is discovered , usually when the homeowners get into trouble with their payments , the homeowners are then compelled to voice their complaints , which lead to rampant finger pointing among the accused real estate professionals .
Involved agents will blame the subprime mortgage lenders for their “ horrible loan programs that require little or no income documentation with low , teaser interest rates that rise dramatically after two or three years . ”
They ’ll also fault the title companies or appraisers or anyone else they can shift the blame to .
# 6 Fraudsters are playing a psychological game .
Scammers hope that the homeowner gets embarrassed enough not to sue or complain about what has happened to them .
It ’s a case of economic bullying .
Subprime mortgages and high rate loans are designed to help immigrants , low - income families and anyone with poor credit to purchase homes in heated markets .
I find this whole concept quite incongruous , just like any kind of usurious debt scheme .
When the market is heated , I always stay out of it .
That ’s been my philosophy all my life , so I deeply wonder why anyone with no money would want to buy anything when prices are going wild .
I suppose that ’s just how the system works : the types of loans that are made available to you when you lack the funds , become trendy and ubiquitous when demand is great and prices are sky high .
We live in an amazing consumerist society that allows us to buy our dreams even if we are broke .
But if I had no money , I ’d be afraid to see how the dream could possibly end .
Better a garage than live without enough to eat , indeed .

Resolver One Beta 7 and Pricing Plans
We 've just released a new beta of Resolver One .
This is the last beta before our 1.0 release on January 16th .
The changes in this version are :
Added Find option to the toolbar , with appropriate F3 etc accelerator keys .
Added support for remaining font options ( italic , underline , etc ) .
Resolver
One checks for updated versions when it starts up .
Most formatting is now included when exporting to Microsoft Excel format .
Fixed defect : Bloomberg not updating with real - time data
Fixed defect : Numbers input with a leading currency symbol are set to 2 decimal places with strip zeros set , while numbers formatted through the menu option to a currency format have strip zeros cleared .
We 've also announced the pricing details for Resolver One :
The Non-commercial version of Resolver One will be free for personal and open source use
The commercial version will cost $ 199 , but for a short time will be available for $ 99
We also have licensing options for ' Resolver One Financial Edition ' , including connectivity with Bloomberg and Thomson market data feeds , guaranteed level of support etc .
Perhaps more importantly though , Resolver Systems has a Twitter Account .
Changing the Default Browser with IronPython ( and an aside about the registry )
Aargh ...
I 've just spent the morning on one of those tasks that should be easy , but somehow never is .
This blog entry is partly an expression of my frustration , partly an example ( because it mostly works ) and also because I hope that someone , somewhere knows what the problem is ...
We 're trying to functionally test part of an ' aesthetic clean - up ' of Resolver .
Part of this includes adding links to the local documentation and also the online support forum to the help menu .
Launching the default system browser with a URL is easy :
>> > from System .
Diagnostics import Process
>> > Process .
Start ( ' http://www.voidspace.org.uk/' )
But how do you functionally test this ?
We thought an easy solution would be to temporarily switch the system default browser to a little application that writes the arguments it is called with to a file .
Of course , changing the system default browser requires working with the registry .
By the way , before you start on a ' the registry is an evil pile of crud what on earth were they thinking ' trip , Raymond Chen has posted an interesting blog entry on Why are INI files deprecated in favor of the registry ?.
Whatever you think of the implementation ( obscure , opaque binary blob that can only be accessed with obscure and awkward tools - bah ) , the reasoning behind it has some merit .
Notably :
Multiple writers to an INI file can result in data loss .
If two programs try to update a config file simultaneously then one will overwrite the other .
You can't specify granular permissions on parts of a config file ...
Anyway , that aside , working with the registry invariably sucks .
We worked out that the correct registry entry to modify is HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT \http\shell\open\command ( set the default key to the path of the application to call ) along with HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\http\shell\open\ddeexec\Application ( set the default key to the application name without the .exe ) .
The IronPython code that does this is :
import os
from Microsoft .
Win32 import Registry
from System .
Diagnostics import Process
from System .
IO import Path
from System .
Windows .
Forms import Application
launcherPath = Path .
Combine ( os . path .
dirname ( Application .
ExecutablePath ) , " ..\\bin\\TestEcho.exe " )
regNodeCommand = " HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\http\\shell\\open\\command "
regNodeApplication = " HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\http\\shell\\open\\ddeexec\\Application "
keyName = " "
oldDefaultCommand = Registry .
GetValue ( regNodeCommand , keyName , None )
oldDefaultApplication = Registry .
GetValue ( regNodeApplication , keyName , None )
try :
Registry .
SetValue ( regNodeCommand , keyName , launcherPath + ' " % 1 " ' )
Registry .
SetValue ( regNodeApplication , keyName , ' TestEcho ' )
finally :
Registry .
SetValue ( regNodeCommand , keyName , oldDefaultCommand )
Registry .
SetValue ( regNodeApplication , keyName , oldDefaultApplication )
One minor issue is that if you call Process .
Start ( ' http://www.voidspace.org.uk') ( no trailing slash ) , then the default browser gets called with http://www.voidspace.org.uk/
( trailing slash added ) ...
This works - sort of .
First of all , changing these registry entries also causes HKCU \Software \Clients \StartMenuInternet to be set to our executable .
This sets the ' internet ' button on the start menu to our dummy application .
Not a problem , as I do n't know anyone who actually uses this button .
Worse , although it works it also bombs out with an exception : WindowsError :
The system cannot find the file specified .
Searching the google we discovered that lots of other people have had the same problem , with no clear solution .
Possible causes we read about include :
It is a problem that only happens on a few machines ( have n't tried it on another machine yet )
It is something to do with dde , a horrible obsolete technology - but it would explain why we need to set the ddeexec key ( and obviously our little test app knows nothing of dde )
key ( and obviously our little test app knows nothing of dde )
We have n't set all the required registry entries ( found one piece of example code that changes about 15 keys ! )
Reports that this error should only happen with .
NET 1.1 ( ? )
It could be related to a browser ( our application ) that does n't have an associated profile
We will do some more exploring tomorrow .
Trapping which file it is looking for will probably give us a clue , but we could just trap the error and move on ...
Chasing Memory Leaks in Python Applications
When you program in a high - level language like Python ( assuming you are n't hacking on the core or writing C extensions ) , you tend to cheerfully assume that hunting down memory leaks is a problem for other people .
Unfortunately that 's wishful thinking , leave stray references around or caches uncleared and your application will leak memory .
We 've recently spent quite a while tracking down a serious memory leak in Resolver .
When closing documents , no memory was being freed .
For small documents that was n't a problem ( which was why we did n't notice it ) , but for large documents it really is a problem - and as we added larger datasets to our test suite it died with out of memory errors .
We managed to verify pretty quickly that on closing a document we were closing the window correctly and removing all references to it , but the main document itself was being kept alive .
A quick fix was to ' manually ' clear the data associated with the document .
This freed most of the memory but did n't deal with the root problem .
We actually had to resort to stack and heap dump analysis , following references back from the document to see what was keeping the document alive .
Kamil Dworakowski , explains the issue in his blog entry Anti-pattern : static subject to observer mapping .
( He has also promised a blog entry about doing heap dump analysis to follow references with IronPython . )
The real problem is the way that IronPython ' does ' event handling ( so it is a problem specific to IronPython ) .
When you add an event handler ( function or method ) to an event , IronPython wraps this with a delegate ( which is the type of object that .
NET requires its event handlers to be ) .
It then stores a mapping of events to handlers , so that if you remove the event handler again it can compare the Python functions in its mapping and remove the right delegate .
These event handlers for GUI events are often methods on our controller classes .
The controllers mediate between the view and the data model , so they are document observers and hold a reference to the document .
The IronPython internal mapping of event handlers was keeping the controller classes alive , which in turn was keeping the documents alive .
Unfortunately IronPython can't just use a weak reference to the event handler functions .
If you add a function as an event handler ( lambda or otherwise ) , then you may not be keeping an explicit reference to it yourself and a weak reference would cause it to be garbage collected - so it is a difficult problem to solve .
The only answer on our side is to implement proper ' Dispose ' methods on our view and controller classes ( and call these explicitly on document close ) , in which we unhook all the events we have registered for .
Finding all of these was great fun for Kamil .
He would analyse the stack dump , following references around to see which events were keeping the the document alive , and unhook them .
Then do a new dump , see which events are now keeping the document alive - repeat until no more memory leak .
A Year with Python , IronPython and Ruby
Well I guess I 'm a bit late to the retrospective party , but I 've just seen that the TIOBE Programming Community Index has just declared Python the " Programming language of 2007 " .
Over the last year Python has risen 2 % and two places by this metric , which attempts to gauge programming language popularity using search engines .
Although you may question their technique , it is probably useful for tracking trends for individual languages rather better than it ranks languages against each other .
Having said that , Python now stands at position six having overtaken both C# and Perl .
About this time last year , the two rising stars in TIOBE were Ruby and D ( which styles itself as a better C++ ) both were storming up the charts and seemed unstoppable .
My esteemed colleague , Andrzej Krzywda , felt that Ruby was still in the early phases of adoption and would continue to grow .
I felt that the meteoric growth of Ruby was a rush of early adopters , and that it would stabilise .
According to TIOBE , Ruby has actually dropped 0.17 % ( and one position ) since the peak of early 2006 .
D has has also stabilised and the new rising stars are Lua ( used as a scripting engine for World of Warcraft amongst other things ) and Logo !
I have seen recent articles resuscitating Logo as ' actually a fairly capable implementation of Lisp ' , so perhaps this is plausible .
Although TIOBE seems to favour my interpretation , there are other ( and probably better ) metrics .
Book sales is probably a good metric , and at the height of the Ruby growth in December 2005 Ruby Surpassed Python in Book Sales .
In his end of year blog entry A Year in O'Reilly Books ( 2007 ) Tim O'Reilly makes some interesting comments but does n't provide much hard data :
C# continues to gain significantly on Java in terms of book sales .
What 's notably missing from the bestseller lists : books on programming languages ( besides Javascript ) .
The top programming language books in last week 's bookscan report were Learning Python , followed closely by the just - released Head First C#. Books on Java , Perl , PHP , and yes , even Ruby , are well down the list .
The Indeed.com Job Trends shows a relatively flat trend for both Ruby and Python over the last two years .
What I think is happening is that dynamic languages are continuing to gain in popularity .
Both Ruby and IronPython have helped through their high visibility .
Microsoft have made a great deal of the IronPython integration in flagship products like Silverlight , Visual Studio 2008 and their new MVC ASP.
NET framework .
Virtually every .NET developer I speak to these days has heard of it .
Whilst few .NET developers will switch to CPython , some will , and the increased visibility can only be beneficial in general .
It is also encouraging that this year Jython seems to have made significant progress .
Ruby almost certainly is growing , but more incrementally and building on its current base .
The future is bright for dynamic languages in the coming years .
To finish with , here is another interesting metric : Django compared to Ruby on Rails in Google Trends .
This also shows Ruby on Rails having flattened , whilst Django has risen steadily to the point where they have converged .
Whilst the Django term is polluted with Jazz , the trend is an interesting one .
Last and final footnote .
One of the improvements to Firedrop2 that Davy Mitchell has just made , is that the Blog Statistics Page now works !
New Mac Pro Announced
Well , if I had bought a Mac Pro in the last few weeks I 'd be really annoyed right now .
Apple have stolen the thunder from the CES by announcing a new range of Mac Pros .
Yesterday a new Mac Pro with two 3.0GHz quad core Xeon processors and 1 Gb of 667 MHz RAM would have cost me Â£ 2700 .
Today the basic spec of a Mac Pro is two 2.8 GHz quad core processors with 2 Gb of 800MHz RAM , and costs Â£ 1700 !
Very nice , almost affordable and likely to be a high performance computer for quite some time .
New Computer Musings and Other Random Hardware Stuff
I 've just bought a new mouse , a Logitech LX7 .
I 've had bad experiences with wireless mice and keyboards in the past , but we use Logitech gear at Resolver and they have served us well .
Unfortunately the USB receiver with this mouse does n't work ( secondhand from ebay ) , but it does work with my office receiver - and I really like the mouse .
Very high resolution , smooth and a lovely feel .
Whether or not I sort this one out I 'll be going for the same model again .
I 've also just bought a new monitor ( yes another one ) .
I 'm still only using three monitors , but my main one is now a 24 " Acer AL2416WB Widescreen monitor with a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels .
This thing is awesome , it makes my 22 " widescreen look small .
It is wide enough to show two pages of a word document side by side at a decent font size , and it only cost £ 200 .
My colleague Kamil also bought one , and although he does n't exactly say so in his review - he likes it !
I mentioned this to my colleague Jonathan , who is an old - school gamer .
He is looking for a big gaming monitor and would prefer a CRT to an LCD .
He says the black is blacker and the colours are brighter .
This gives a superior ' immersive effect ' when gaming with the lights off !
For gaming the refresh rate is also important , and at least the last generation of LCDs used to show trails when viewed in the dark with lots of movement on screen .
Additionally , CRTs are capable of displaying different resolutions natively , whereas LCD panels have only one ' real ' resolution .
Big( - ish ) quality CRTs must cost more than LCD panels , just because less people want them now - which sounds like buying a valve amplifier .
I will also be replacing my computer at some point in the next year .
My current one has reached the ripe old age of eighteen months old , and in the next few months will gracefully retire as a media - centre for the new living room of the house we hopefully move into later this month .
I have quite a bit of money burning a hole in my gadget fund , and would like a nice specced computer ( I 'll tell you about my gadget fund in a later blog post if I have the time , but the summary is that I have to spend it on essential computer gear or pay tax on it ) .
As always with computers for the geek , I have the choice between building and buying .
The last few times I have priced up building I have always found pre-built computers available for the same ( or even less ) and buying has obvious advantages .
This time however , there are n't many manufacturers making computers with the sort of spec I would like - twin quad core processors with as fast memory as possible .
My boss has given me the sage advice that the sweet - spot for processors is at about the £ 200 mark .
In fact this seems to hold .
Looking at average UK processor prices ( for the Intel Core 2 or Xeon quad - core range which seem to be the best at the moment ) :
Q6600 2.4GHz Quad Core 8 MB Cache - £ 160
Q6700 2.67 GHz Quad Core 8 MB Cache - £ 340
QX6850 3.0 GHz Quad Core 8 MB Cache - 600
So there is a big jump in price from 2.4 to 2.67 and from 2.67 to 3.0 .
Even if it 's irrational , it seems wrong to spend a lot of money and not get a system with a faster processor than my current 2.4GHz AMD dual core .
Important factors in overall computer speed seem to be ( in no particular order ) :
Processor clock speed
Total number of cores
Amount of memory ( the cheapest way to improve performance is to add memory - page faults are very slow ! )
Processor cache size
Front Side Bus ( FSB ) speed
Memory speed
Speed of the hard drive that the OS and virtual memory live on makes a lot of difference ( 15000 rpm drives are available relatively easily now )
Possibly , whether you are running a 64 bit OS or a 32bit OS
For gaming ( which I do a bit of - Team Fortress 2 rocks ) , and some applications , the graphics card matters a lot too .
The latest Edge magazine review for Crysis states that " to get visually the best from this game you need two of the latest graphics card strapped together " - which of course is ridiculous .
It does look good though .
This is all fine , but as soon as you move to a twin - processor and quad core spec , you are seriously reducing the number of motherboards available to choose from .
There are also a few questions that I do n't know the answer to .
Memory type - is there a massive speed advantage to be had by using DDR3 or dual channel RAM ( and are there any retail motherboards that support them for twin Socket LGA771 processors )
Is there any advantage to be gained using ' ECC ' ram ( with an extra byte on the bus for checksum ) , and the same question as above about the motherboards
800 Mhz DDR2 RAM seems to be the fastest that I can find .
In which case does it matter whether you have an FSB speed of 1066MHZ or 1333MHZ if your data can only ever clock 800MHZ ?
( In fact what is the difference between FSB speed on the motherboard / processor and the speed your RAM can run at - I assume that in practise they will both run at whichever is slowest out of these two numbers )
The only two hardware supplies I have found ( but I have n't looked too hard ) that will offer computers at this spec are Dell and Apple .
Apple offer the Mac Pro with two quad - core processors for £ 2700 .
This is with a meagre 1gig of RAM , but can be upgraded much more cheaply than buying the RAM from Apple .
I do n't have this amount of money yet , but am not massively far off ( and it would come with a slower hard drive and of course only 667MHz RAM , but does have a reasonable video card ) .
Buying from Dell gives me much more choice in configuration .
For a fair way south of two grand I can get a computer shell with :
A motherboard that will take two quad - core Xeon processors
One 3.0GHZ Xeon Quad - core with 8MB L2 cache
One GB of DDR 2 at 667MHZ , with 4GB from Crucial for about £ 180
A 73gig 15000rpm Hard drive for the OS
A 160gig second drive which is a little meagre but comes included anyway
This would give me a pretty good system that I can build on .
I 'd need to choose a gfx card of course , which is another minefield ...
As to the question of whether running eight cores will give me much improvement , it will be interesting to see .
Given that most of the time I have many applications open at the same time , it ought to help .
Whilst we 're on about processor cores , I 've found something to do with some of my current spare cycles .
I often leave my computer on overnight , stress testing my network connection of course , and the World Community Grid seems like an excellent use to put those cycles to .
Unlike similar grid computing projects , they have a whole range of different tasks you can donate your computer time to - like climate change prediction and finding dengue and malaria drugs .
This is the first blog entry using the new tagging feature of Firedrop2 implemented by Davy Mitchell .
There are now tags ( as well as categories ) at the bottom of each entry , as well as in the RSS .
Currently only in SVN , but I 'll do a new release soon .
This is something I 've wanted for ages .
More on the Eee
Some updates on the Eee .
It turns out I was wrong about the eee wireless not remembering pass - phrases , I was just using the wrong application .
' Wireless Networks ' just shows you available Wifi networks and does n't remember keys / pass - phrases .
The ' Network ' application does remember them .
Also , not only is a Huawei E220 USB modem driver available , it comes with the OS !
I was able to plug the modem into USB and setup a connection with the network wizard !
This increases the utility of the Eee tenfold .
Apparently the alternative ' advanced mode ' for the OS is n't available yet ( UPDATE there is a communtiy distribution though - see this wiki ) .
You can however customize the ' icewm ' window manager as much as you like .
By following the instructions on this forum thread I 've got a start button and additional workspaces ( desktops ) so far , with plenty more customizations available .
Oh , and it looks like the version of Mono that apt - get installs is ' pre - IronPython ' .
I 'll be looking at installing a more recent version and reporting back ...

The rise and fall of a louse is tragic in the eyes of the louse and in the hearts of scientists who love that louse .
Until recently pubic lice , also known as " crabs " , were riding high .
Studies in the 60s , 70s and 80s reported more of them were taking up residence in their favourite neighbourhoods .
The louse had even overcome its poor reputation with scientists , who believed them to be lazy and slow .
That characterisation was smashed to glorious pieces in 1983 , thanks to a report by Ian Burgess and John Maunder , of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , and Tin Than Myint , of the ministry of health in Rangoon , Burma .
Their study , Maintenance of the Crab Louse , Pthirus pubis , in the Laboratory and Behavioural Studies Using Volunteers , tells how they coated groups of pubic lice with powders that glow different colours under ultraviolet light .
They then gave each group of lice a chance to migrate from its old home on one human body to a new home on another .
The colours let the scientists see what moved where when - and it revealed a surprise .
Pubic lice showed themselves to be neither sedentary nor sluggish .
Nay , says the report , " these observations suggest the converse is true and that these insects are extremely active " .
But devastation visited the pubic louse community .
A 2006 study called Did the Brazilian Kill the Pubic Louse ? , written by NR Armstrong and JD Wilson , of Leeds General Infirmary , wonders at the sudden rarity of pubic lice in the UK and elsewhere .
Published in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections , the study suggests a possible cause :
" The drop in pubic lice in women appears to be most dramatic around 2000 and coincided with the introduction of extensive waxing techniques , such as the ' Brazilian ' , in women in the United Kingdom . "
In this era where more and more animal species face the spectre of extinction , the " Brazilian " study sent alarm through the research community .
Dutch naturalist Kees Moeliker , intrigued that the pubic louse might soon vanish altogether , started a campaign to collect and preserve some specimens for the Rotterdam Natural History Museum , of which he is a curator .
" When the bamboo forests that the giant panda lives in were cut down , the bear became threatened with extinction , " Moeliker explains .
" Pubic lice can't live without pubic hair . "
Moeliker is coming to Britain to collect some specimens .
He will take part in the Ig Nobel Tour for National Science and Engineering Week ( March 6 - 16 ) .
If you have a specimen of Phthiris pubis you 'd like to donate to science , or know someone who has , please bring them to one of the events .

With every syllable of his speech at this year 's CPAC convention , Republican Mitt Romney proves why he was totally unfit to be the next U.S. president .
He was speaking to the far right fringes so it 's no surprise he'd be spewing red meat at them , but he really outdid himself with this one .
Romney says that if he stays in the race he will only be making it easier for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to win -- and since they both want to retreat from fighting terrorists , he can not be a part of helping them win the White House so he 's dropping out .
Sorry Mitt , America is n't buying it anymore .
Your party has made us less safe and the Republican Party is no longer seen as the strong party when it comes to national security or the military .
So again , I say so long , Mittens .
You never stood a chance , do n't let the door hit ya ' on the way out ...
Romney : '' If I fight on in my campaign , all the way to the convention , I would forestall the launch of a national campaign and make it more likely that Senator Clinton or Obama would win .
And in this time of war , I simply cannot let my campaign , be a part of aiding a surrender to terror . "
* Update - Let 's take a look at some of Mittens ' greatest hits !
[ In this in - depth article , Fulton discusses why " the online behavior of our customers is dramatically reducing our sales " , referencing his social design on Microsoft 's Shadowrun to explain how we can dissuade anonymous Internet gamers .
Warning :
This article uses language inappropriate for a professional website .
Unfortunately , the language used is far less offensive than what is commonly encountered in online gaming . ]
Some gamers are fuckwads
Of all the ways I spend my free time , playing games online is the only one I would describe as " frequently barbaric " .
Insults of all kinds , including racist and homophobic slurs , are commonplace .
The women I know who play online avoid anything that would identify them as female -- including voice communication -- in order to avoid the unwanted , and frequently negative , attention .
And that 's just how players are intentionally insulting -- what some people do while playing online can also be aggravating .
Cheating , team - killing , entering a game but not playing , quitting before the game is over , and more , are all relatively common .
Common enough that it was deemed worthy of a Penny Arcade comic , speculating about why normal people become fuckwads online .
So what ?
Why do I care ?
Some gamers might be thinking " If he 's so thin - skinned that he can't take the online banter , maybe he should n’t play online . "
Unfortunately , many people do just that -- they stop playing online .
Even more gamers go online a few times and then never play again .
This is n't just my personal speculation ; I have seen convincing data from two different sources that the biggest problem with online gaming is the behavior of others .
The biggest problem is n't the cost ; it is n't connectivity issues , or even the quality of the games -- it is how people are fuckwads online .
To make this concrete , here 's a thought experiment for you : imagine you go to a new restaurant , and decide to try the meatloaf .
A big guy at the next table overhears you , looks at you , and yells : " Meatloaf ?
What kinda newb are you ?
Hey everybody , this r-tard just ordered the meatloaf !
God , I 'm glad you 're not at my table . "
Laughter breaks out at the tables around you , as they crane their heads to look at the newb .
The restaurant staff is nowhere to be found , and you 're not entirely certain they 'd do anything anyway -- you can tell this is normal behavior at this place .
How good or cheap would the food have to be to get you to go back there ?
Who would you bring there ?
The vast majority of the world population would n't go back there , and would warn everyone they knew to avoid it .
So again , why do I care ?
Because the online behavior of our customers is dramatically reducing our sales , and continues to stunt the growth of our industry .
Non-gamers simply do n’t love games enough to put up with the crap they get online .
The reason they would consider playing online is to have fun with other people -- and right now , playing games online with strangers rarely delivers that for anyone outside the hardcore demographic .
Are these problems even solvable ?
Short answer : yes .
Social environments and culture can be designed .
Just like good game design creates fun gameplay , good social design creates fun social experiences .
Unfortunately , online games seem to have allocated very few resources to designing the social environment .
But honestly , I do n't believe that resource constraints are the source of the problem -- I think that most people do n’t believe that social problems can be solved .
A common belief that I ’ve heard used as justification for not addressing the social environment of games is that " jerks will be jerks " .
Essentially , many people believe that :
1. Behavior is determined by personality , and
2 . You ca n’t change people ’s personality
While I ( mostly ) agree with the second point , it is moot because the first point has been consistently contradicted by 60 years of social psychological research .
Human behavior is complex and determined by many factors .
Personality is certainly one factor , but it is a surprisingly small factor .
The largest determinant of behavior is the perceived social environment .
This is the good news , because both the social environment and the perception of it can be controlled .
But me just saying that I disagree with a belief is n’t an argument ; some proof is in order .
Evidence about the effect of the social environment on behavior comes from two main sources : real - world observation and academic studies from social psychology .
( Although perhaps I should add " cartoonists " to those two sources .
The Penny Arcade comic showing a normal person becoming a total fuckwad when in multiplayer gaming situation -- anonymous , with an audience -- was pretty accurate , if a bit simplified . )
“ Currying ” or “ partial application ” ?
Consider this piece of the Haskell Standard Prelude :
-- curry converts an uncurried function to a curried function ; -- uncurry converts a curried function to a function on pairs .
curry :: ( ( a , b ) -> c ) -> a -> b -> c curry f x y = f ( x , y ) uncurry :: ( a -> b -> c ) -> ( ( a , b ) -> c ) uncurry f p = f ( fst p ) ( snd p )
This is formally , pedantically correct .
Surprisingly , it 's also useful from time to time , mostly when composing functions that return pairs .
But since most Haskell functions are already curried , it 's not as heavily used as other Prelude functions such as flip .
Dylan has a different idea .
It uses curry ( \+ , 1 ) to mean ( λ x → 1 + x ) .
The same thing ( partial application as a function ) has been done in Python and C++ , but without the misleading name .
Some people do n't like this .
They consider the Dylan usage a reckless abuse of words .
Early versions of SRFI - 26 proposed calling partial application curry , to which Dave Mason said :
It would also be really nice at ICFP or other places where Schemers and Haskell types get together if the Schemers do n't look like complete idiots when they misuse the term `curry ' because of this SRFI 's poor choice of name .
I used to think this was silly .
Curried functions exist to make partial application easy , and other tools for partial application accomplish the same goal in a different way .
( The practical difference is that they specify partial application at the call site , while curried functions specify it at the function 's definition . )
Why use two different words ?
Is there ever a time when the distinction matters ?
There is : when you 're designing a language , you have to think about these things .
While considering a partial application feature in my pet lisp , I found myself needing to talk about several terse ways of obtaining partial application .
Should I use curried functions ?
A currying function ?
A partial - apply function ?
A macro like op ?
I needed to talk about all of these at once .
But most users do n't , and it 's futile to try to force people to make distinctions they do n't care about .
They just want partial application , and if they get it from a function like Dylan 's , they will inevitably adopt the short , distinctive name curry for it .
The abuse of the term might be a problem in other contexts , but in a language without curried functions , it is not likely to confuse .
And since partial application is so often useful , I did decide to include it in my pet lisp .
I used op , and built it into the Form Without A Name .
That way it does n't require a name of its own , so the unwieldiness of “ partial application ” is not a big problem .
Which is a good thing , because I use it a lot .
Terse partial application makes functional programming easier , which means it is used more often than its lambda equivalent .
I 'm glad I went to the trouble of adding it .
And I wo n't be upset when users call it “ currying ” .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain , looking to chart an independent course on U.S. foreign policy , called on Wednesday for a more vigorous international diplomacy and a new effort to rebuild frayed relations with allies .

Distancing himself from the sometimes unilateral diplomatic approach of President George W. Bush , McCain said the United States needs to live up to its responsibilities as a world leader and become a “ model citizen ” in the global community .
“ The United States can not lead by virtue of its power alone , ” the Arizona senator , back from a trip to Iraq , the Middle East and Europe , said in a speech to the World Affairs Council in California .
“ Our great power does not mean we can do whatever we want whenever we want , nor should we assume we have all the wisdom and knowledge necessary to succeed .
We need to listen to the views and respect the collective will of our democratic allies , ” McCain said .
McCain , who has been criticized by Democrats for hewing too closely to the policies of Bush , his fellow Republican , acknowledged the damaged U.S. image around the globe after five years of the Iraq war .
“ Leadership in today ’s world means accepting and fulfilling our responsibilities as a great nation .
One of those responsibilities is to be a good and reliable ally to our fellow democracies , ” he said .
McCain slammed both of the two Democrats seeking to become their party ’s candidate in the November election , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , for advocating quick withdrawals from Iraq .
He also signaled he would have a more hands - on approach than Bush in working for peace between Israel and the Palestinians .
“ I would devote every effort , including personal deep engagement and involvement in the Palestinian - Israeli peace process , ” McCain said in response to a question after the speech .
“ It is too important ... for us not to give it the highest priority . ”
‘ WE CAN ’T TORTURE ’
McCain restated his opposition to torture and said the United States should close the military prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba , where it holds terrorism suspects .
“ America must be a model citizen if we want others to look to us as a model , ” he said .
“ How we behave at home affects how we are perceived abroad .
We ca n’t torture or treat inhumanely suspected terrorists we have captured . ”
The Bush administration has admitted using waterboarding -- a simulated drowning technique widely regarded as torture -- in some instances .

McCain has clinched the Republican nomination , while Clinton and Obama are still battling one another on the Democratic side , and the speech in Los Angeles was his second major policy address in two days after one on Tuesday on the U.S. housing crisis .
Obama , back on the campaign trail after two days of vacation , criticized McCain for not offering specific approaches to easing turmoil in housing markets .
McCain had said he was open to a variety of approaches .
“ He said that the best way to address the fact that millions of Americans are losing their homes is to just sit back and watch it happen , ” Obama said in Greensboro , North Carolina .
“ We have been down this road before .
It ’s the road that George Bush has taken over the last eight years , ” he said .
McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said Obama ’s “ blatant mischaracterizations are n’t the new politics he ’s promised America , they ’re the old attack and smear tactics that Americans are tired of . ”
McCain rebuked Obama , an Illinois senator , and Clinton , a New York senator , for supporting relatively quick withdrawals of troops from Iraq .
“ We have incurred a moral responsibility in Iraq , ” he said .
“ It would be an unconscionable act of betrayal , a stain on our character as a great nation , if we were to walk away from the Iraqi people and consign them to the horrendous violence , ethnic cleansing , and possibly genocide that would follow a reckless , irresponsible , and premature withdrawal . ”

A recent guest post on TechCrunch reignited my interest in the space between web apps and desktop apps .
Matthew Gertner wrote :
Single - site browsers ( SSBs ) aim to bring the best of the desktop to web applications .
Rather than running programs in normal web browsers like Firefox or Safari , wedged in a tab between New York Times articles and TechCrunch posts , each app is given its own dedicated browser , which is customized to include many of the desktop features that users know and love .
Enter Mozilla Prism — a package that allows you to create a dumbed - down web browser that works for just that application .
From the recent 0.2 release announcement :
Prism is an open source cross-platform prototype of functionality that lets users split web applications out of the browser and run them directly on the desktop .
A web application like GMail , Google Calendar , Zoho , Buzzword , Tada List , Basecamp — pretty much anything that is Ajax - heavy and does n’t fit the traditional browser document model — is a good candidate for turning into a Prism application .
While still in the early stages , the benefits for a SSB application like Prism are clear :
Some web apps are more “ RIA ” than “ web site ” , so having them run in a separate thread is very handy .
For example , you can Alt - Tab ( Cmd - Tab ) between your browser and your Prism app , and if your browser crashes then your Prism app remains unaffected .
( ) between your browser and your Prism app , and if your browser crashes then your Prism app remains unaffected .
Removing the clutter of the browser chrome allows the application ’s user interface to shine .
Beginner users ( Hi Mum ! ) could have their Start Bar or OS X dock pre-populated with a bunch of Prism apps that they simply click on to use — no more educating them about browser tabs , bookmarks and the like .
It ’s possible to create a Prism app from any web site or web application .
If you wanted to run the SitePoint Marketplace as its own application , you could do so ( although the marketplace is probably not the best suited example , given that it relies on browser functionality such as the back button ) .
But if you wanted to , you could — you do n’t need to wait for the site owner to create something for you .
Of course , there are downsides to this approach — the bugginess of the current release aside .
Advanced users are most likely to be impacted .
For one , none of your regular Firefox extensions are available .
That means that if you have any Greasemonkey scripts that you rely upon , you wo n’t be able to use them from within your Prism app .
Actually , it is possible to install Firefox extensions to your Prism app , via the Tools >
Add - ons menu , in the bottom right of the application ’s window .
By default , Prism grabs the favicon from the web site upon which your Prism app is based .
This is pretty small and pixelates when enlarged , although it ’s possible to use your own custom , much prettier icon .

This is pretty small and pixelates when enlarged , although it ’s possible to use your own custom , much prettier icon .
The application still does n’t quite feel like a native desktop app , because of the limitations of HTML , CSS and JavaScript in defining user interface elements .
The biggest disadvantage , of course , is that a Prism app wo n’t run offline ( unlike platforms such as Adobe AIR and Google Gears ) .
It really is just a stripped - back browser .
Creating a Prism application
Creating a Prism app is dead easy :
Download and install Mozilla Prism Launch Prism and specify a web site ’s URL , icon and a couple of other settings , and click OK Your Prism app ’s launch icon will appear in your Start Menu , OS X dock or Desktop .
The Google Mail and Google Calendar applications reach the desktop
Additionally , if you ’re running Firefox 3 ( still in beta )
Prism is also available as a Firefox extension that adds a “ Convert Website To Application ” menu option making Prism app creation even simpler still .
Mozilla Prism 0.2 is available for download , for desktopifying any web site that you choose .
What do you think — is a hybrid platform like Prism useful , or does it just produce the worst of both worlds ?
When Staten Island Mall shoppers saw a mother beating her 3 - year - old son Tuesday afternoon , some followed her to " make sure she did n't leave , " reports the Staten Island Advance .
Eventually , the police arrested 33 - year - old Yesenia Hausler with felony assault and endangering the welfare of a child .
Hausler apparently became angry when her son either wanted to play with a new toy or wanted to buy a new toy , and punched and slapped him so hard there were handprints on his body .
One witness said , " I could n't believe it .
I was shocked .
I wanted to go home and take my kid out of school and just hug her . "
According to court papers , Hausler told the police , " The only reason that this is a problem is because I am in this country .
In my country , you can hit your kids . "
The Advance points out that Hausler has been an American citizen her whole life , growing up in Puerto Rico .
Her husband , who has custody of the child ( the couple has two older children , too ) suggested she could be suffering from post - partum depression , " ( My ) wife needs a little bit of help .
We know that .
Maybe she needs more than a little bit of help .
I know she needs therapy . "
But unbeknown to the consumer , the powers at the major toothbrush makers were not content .
The ’60s , ’70s and ’ 80s had been devoted to improving bristle design , according to Dr. Paul Warren , a dentist and the vice president for global professional and scientific relations at Procter & Gamble Oral Care , which makes Oral - B toothbrushes .
But as intelligent as the bristles had become , pursuing plaque into the nooks and crannies of the oral cavity , they still were n’t quite bright enough to outsmart human nature and its marked tendency toward indolence .
“ They were great , ” Dr. Warren said of the engineered bristles , “ but people still were n’t brushing brilliantly . ”
Image Samuel Heath 's Novis bracket is an ingeniously simple British - made open - sided chrome device with slots for four brushes .
So newfangled handles began to be developed , not only to make toothbrushes easier to clutch but also to encourage people to brush properly  that is , to practice something called the “ modified Bass technique . ”
Rather than scrubbing back and forth as if they were sawing firewood  the default mode  they were supposed to hold the brush at a 45 - degree angle to the teeth , wiggling it up and down starting at the gum lime , as uncomfortable and counterintuitive as that may have felt .
While Dr. Warren , not unexpectedly , makes Procter & Gamble ’s efforts sound like unalloyed public service , the profit motive may also have been involved .
“ These new products cost as much as $ 6 ” when they were introduced , Mr. Dair said .
“ There ’s only so much you can do to a Popsicle stick to have it be the perception of a $ 6 product . ”
Smart Design created the 1993 Wondergrip toothbrush , a child ’s model for Johnson & Johnson .
It drew inspiration from the Oxo line of oversize rubber - handle kitchen utensils , which Smart Design had come up with in the ’ 80s .
“ It was a blockbuster , ” Mr. Dair said proudly .
“ That toothbrush was one of the first that did n’t fit .
We broke the mold with that one . ”
Dr. Warren acknowledged that when Procter & Gamble introduced its own line of fat - handle toothbrushes , also in 1993 , there were complaints .
“ Yes , you began to get consumers saying , ‘ This is handy , but it does n’t fit into my bathroom holder , ’ ” he said .
“ There was thought about that , and Oral - B developed a toothbrush holder , almost like a cigar case , you could leave on your counter or pack in your suitcase if you were traveling .
If people wrote , they ’d be sent back a toothbrush holder .
I do n’t know whether we still have them . ”
