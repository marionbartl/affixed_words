New Yorkers with suddenly dashed European travel plans were not the only ones in town inconvenienced by the eruption of a volcano 2,800 miles away .
All across this fair city , thousands of people , some of them highly paid television and radio newscasters , found themselves tumbling down the vowel - and - liquid - consonant - lubricated slopes of Eyjafjallajokull , the mountain ’s 16 - letter , six - and - a - half - syllable , 47 - Scrabble - point name .
We know this because we went into the Times Square subway station and asked them to say it .
“ I , a fiat like , la Joe , cuckle ” Shmuel Rosenthal said , slowly , as if reading an entire sentence .
“ EE - ya - FEE - ya - la - jo - COOL , ” a man named Gael Laincy offered .
Wrong , and wrong .
Judy Boykin , a tourist from Martinsburg , W.Va. , in a pink floral print coat with an American flag pinned to her lapel , got it partly right .
“ There ’s something that ’s not pronounced , ” she said , adding , “ Al Roker could n’t do it this morning . ”
But then she wound up and unleashed , seemingly to her own surprise , “ Jaffalakackle ! ”
Nope .
Here ’s the lowdown from a native speaker at the Icelandic consulate , who would give only her first name , spelling unknown but pronounced Becca .
Take a deep breath .
EY - ya - fyat - lah - YOH - kuht
The “ EY ” rhymes with the word “ bay . ”
The “ k ” is softer than an English “ k , ” almost like a hard “ g . ”
And the “ t ” at the end kind of sticks for a second and pulls away with a hint of a glottal “ l . ”
EY - ya - fyat - lah - YOH - kuht
Say it soft and it ’s almost like , “ Hey , ya fergot La Yogurt . ”
“ The first problem for Americans is , you see this long word and do n’t know where to begin , “ said Joan Maling , a professor emerita of linguistics at Brandeis University .
“ You do n’t know how to divide it up . ”
It ’s simple .
“ Eyja ” is the Icelandic word for island .
“ Fjalla ” means mountain .
“ Jokull ” is glacier .
Of the 12 people we approached in the subway , only Patrick Gullmarsvik got it nearly right .
He is from Sweden .
Most non-Icelandic speakers , of course , just call the thing the volcano , and , when reading news accounts , let their mind ’s narrator glide silently over those 16 letters .
( This may be for the best , international - respect - wise , since as our colleagues at The Lede noted Friday , Icelanders find our manglings of the name endlessly amusing . )
Officials at the Icelandic consulate said that most callers worried about their travel plans did not attempt to bruise their tongues on the offending word .
These more practical souls were represented in our survey by a woman named Sophia Williamson , who was shown a flashcard with both the spelling and the pronunciation guide .
“ Sorry , I do n’t have time for this , ” she said and headed for the nearest office building .

A series of audiotapes recorded at workshops held by the Ontario Progressive Conservative Campus Association show that the Conservative party is trying to take over student organizations – by any means necessary .
The workshops are held in cities across the province , with topics ranging from how to win a student union election to how to combat and remove funding for progressive student organizations such as the Ontario Public Interest Research Group ( OPIRG ) and the Canadian Federation of Students ( CFS ) .
Even more disturbing is that these trainings are being organized with the support and resources of Canada ’s governing party , evidenced by the participation of Conservative MP Peter Braid and his campaign manager , Aaron Lee-Wudrick .
In one audiotape , workshop facilitator Ryan O’Connor , former executive of the University of Waterloo Federation of Students , encourages participants to establish multiple front groups on campuses for the Conservative party , even if the members are all the same .
Co-facilitator Aaron Lee-Wudrick illustrated this point with an example of his own : “ We had a front group like that : the Campus Coalition for Liberty .
It was really just a front for the conservatives , but it gave us like two voices .
Two organizations support this , the Young Tories and the Campus Coalition for Liberty , which is the same thing … ”
They pointed out that multiple campus clubs consisting of the same handful of Conservative party members could create the impression of a large campus movement , with the added bonus of each front group receiving its own funding from the student union .
The Ontario PC Campus Association knows a thing or two about meddling in student politics .
Years ago , it was revealed that since the year 2000 , the Ontario PC Party and its Campus Association have operated a “ Millennium Leadership Fund ” to get Conservatives elected to student unions .
Since the Association has never disclosed which candidates they funded , students have relied on circumstantial evidence to identify candidates on the receiving end of this secret fund .
In 2004 , a right - wing slate calling itself “ Progress Not Politics ” assumed office at the York Federation of Students .
The owner of the website domain for their election bid was Kasra Najatian , a Queen ’s University student who was president of the Ontario PC Campus Association .
Shortly after taking office , the “ Progress Not Politics ” executive hired the previous president of the Ontario PC Campus Association .
This person was none other than Ryan O’Connor , one of the facilitators for the recent workshops on how to take over a student union .
With student union elections happening at York University this week , these latest revelations raise questions about whether the Progressive Conservative party is again interfering in elections for the York Federation of Students .
Over the past few months , a couple of student groups have suddenly appeared at York University to condemn the student union on a wide range of issues .
They have allied themselves with pro-life groups and pro-Israel groups on campus ; exactly the organizations participants were encouraged to work with in these workshops .
One of these ostensibly non-partisan clubs even organized a rally that included Progressive Conservative MPPs Peter Shurman and Lisa MacLeod as speakers .
The students involved in these groups have coalesced around a slate “ York Forward ” which is contesting the YFS elections this week .
When questioned about these latest revelations , representatives of York Forward quickly responded by flatly denying any association with the Ontario PC Campus Association .
Perhaps Ryan O’Connor ’s membership in the York Forward group on Facebook is purely coincidental .
But his comments on one audiotape suggest a more ominous explanation : “ Sometimes you ca n’t attach the Tory name to it , and you have to be sensitive to that . ”

So everyone knows about Faisal Shahzad by now .
He made a lame attempt to detonate a bomb in Times Square last Saturday night .
He parked an SUV which contained a bomb that did n’t really have a snow ball ’s chance in hell of detonating properly , right in the heart of Times Square .
As an aside , he parked that SUV exactly one block away from where I was hanging out two nights earlier .
As a New Yorker , these attempts are personal .
Back to Shahzad .
Once he was arrested , fifty three hours after he attempted to detonate the bomb , a couple of troubling and confusing narratives emerged .
The first wave of reporting on this story after his arrest came with questions about how he was able to get on the plane .
The criticism over this continues as I write this .
I can not be more perplexed by this attitude .
Color me stupid , but I see fifty three hours between attempting to set off a bomb , to being hauled off in handcuffs as a giant victory .
I take great comfort in how this was handled and I slept like a baby last night , with the knowledge that NYPD , the FBI , and Homeland Security moved on this so quickly and effectively .
And I must say that this is a refreshing since I ’m used to the perpetrator of an attack on my city never being put into handcuffs .
I know , I know , there ’s one big difference between the Shahzad situation and the Bin Laden circumstances in that , Shahzad was in the US .
Okay , I ’m willing to make a concession for that .
But who sent the anthrax ?
How long did it take to catch that guy ?
And where were the people that are unhappy now , over the fact that Shahzad got on the plane back then ?
I do n’t recall hearing much criticism from them , over the fact that the anthrax sender was never apprehended .
And where were they when we lost Bin Laden on Tora Bora , because we only had him surrounded on three sides ?
Where was the outrage then ?
Good lord , a fucking sheep herder could have pointed out the flaw in that genius plan !
Where were all of those crack journalists then ?
The other confusing issue that I ’ve been hearing is a debate over whether Shahzad should have been read his Miranda rights .
This made me wonder which part of US citizen was confusing to these people .
Are we seriously debating over whether a US citizen should have access to our justice system ?
What I found more confusing is that the crowd that is advocating for denying due process are republicans .
I ’m not sure that they understand their own rhetoric .
Do they distrust the government , or are they so certain the government got the right guy , that they do n’t feel due process is necessary ?
Which is it ?
Do you irrationally hate government , or do you have unquestioning faith in it ?
Is there a republican out there that can help me out ?
My confusion leaves me with the impression that you do n’t believe anything that you say because what you believe in seems to change , based on who you ’re saying it about .
Here ’s the problem with this tactic ;
When you ’re willing to contradict yourself to the point of embarrassment , you end up with a very tiny crowd of people that are willing to keep listening .
In going after Obama like rabid dogs , you ’ve completely eviscerated any credibility you may once have had .
I ’m talking to you , John McCain .
In ten short years you went from a rational republican that occasionally voted his conscience , to a crazy old man that may well lose a primary to a politician that we already know is corrupt .
Peter King and Joe Lieberman , you both get a pass for your hypocrisy because you ’ve both always been self serving fools .
Embarrassing yourselves is a natural state of being for you .
Senators Cornyn and Kyl , you are an embarrassment to your party .
Marco Rubio has added his name to the list of republicans that hate the American justice system .
Regular readers of this blog know that I ’m not shy about spanking Obama when he deserves to be spanked .
But what ’s going here is n’t rational because it has very little to do with Obama .
When you criticize how this whole thing went down , you ’re denigrating New York and I wo n’t have it .
To quote Jon Stewart , “ Go fuck yourselves ” .
This was a victory for America .
It was a victory in that , the community sprung into action minutes after that SUV was parked .
It was a victory in that , the police immediately realized that they were facing a serious situation and acted accordingly .
It was a victory in that , the suspect was apprehended two short days after his attempt .
I ’m sorry for everyone that ca n’t celebrate America ’s victories , because they ’re so embroiled in their petty bullshit , that they are incapable of taking pride in their country anymore .
Exclusive : Karzai to discuss proposal that also offers reinsertion and jobs to former militants with Obama on US visit
Top Taliban leaders could be offered exile outside Afghanistan if they agree to stop fighting the government of Hamid Karzai , a long - expected peace plan by the Afghan government will propose later this month .
The far - reaching proposals , seen by the Guardian , also call for " deradicalisation " classes for insurgents and thousands of new manual jobs created for foot soldiers who renounce violence .
The long - delayed Afghan Peace and Reintegration Programme has emerged just as Karzai prepares to go to Washington for talks with Barack Obama , where the issue is likely to be top of the agenda .
The plan will then be presented later in the month to a gathering of representatives from across Afghanistan called the National Consultative Peace Jirga .
Once agreed upon , the government will be able to start spending around $ 160 m ( £ 100 m ) pledged by the international community to lure fighters away from the conflict .
The document refers to such fighters as " angry brothers " , reflecting the belief that a substantial portion of insurgents are not motivated by strong ideological beliefs .
Little is said in the report about the Taliban leaders managing the war against Karzai 's government .
However , it does say insurgent leaders could face " potential exile in a third country " .
Saudi Arabia has been used in the past for such purposes , and there has been widespread speculation that exile could be offered to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , the leader of the Hizb - e - Islami armed group , which in March sent a peace delegation to Kabul for talks with Karzai .
Western powers are likely to be pleased by the level of detail about the new High Level Peace Council , which will take over from a notoriously chaotic predecessor body accused of reintegrating fighters who subsequently took up arms again .
However , diplomats are worried that the government lacks the capacity to implement a programme that calls for complex activities in around 4,000 villages most affected by the insurgency .
One diplomat said : " For the international community money is not a problem , they will pay whatever it takes .
One gets a sense that there are people on the military side who will do most of the work and then give it some sort of an Afghan face . "
The High Council and its executive body will be in charge of processing fighters who want to live peacefully .
They will initially be put in " demobilisation centres " for a " cooling off " period of 90 days where their needs can be assessed and their personal security assured .
If they agree to lay down their arms and cut ties with al - Qaida they will be entitled to an amnesty against prosecution for any crimes they may have committed .
They will also be issued with a biometric " reintegration card " .
They will then be offered a " menu " of options designed to keep them peacefully occupied , including vocational training in such trades as carpet - weaving and tailoring .
There will also be the option to go through " deradicalisation " training , of the sort pioneered by Saudi Arabia .
However , the report acknowledges the complexity of such programmes , the lack of " adequate experience " in Afghanistan and the likely need to send " highly radicalised " people to other countries for treatment .
Major new institutions will also be set up to manage enormous job - creation schemes .
An Engineering and Construction Corps will focus on labour - intensive work , such as the construction of Afghanistan 's national highway system and other large - scale infrastructure projects .
It also envisages teams of ex-Taliban fighters being rapidly deployed to respond to emergencies such as floods and landslides .
By far the most controversial option is the option for former insurgents to join the Afghan army or police force .
Western embassies and Nato have for months been impatient for the government to produce a reintegration strategy , which is an important part of the counterinsurgency plan being pursued by Stanley McChrystal , the US commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan .
On the other hand , it has been widely reported that Karzai is frustrated at US opposition to high - level peace talks with insurgent leaders .
However , both US and Afghan officials say there is only disagreement on the timing of the talks and , to the frustration of the UK , which wants to see a high - level political accommodation with the Taliban , both sides are determined that there should be no significant compromise .
Last week Ahmed Wali Karzai , the Afghan president 's hugely influential half - brother , told the Guardian that while fighters could surrender and return in peace , the Afghan government would never share power with the Taliban or give in to demands for the country 's constitution to be changed in return for peace .
Speaking at his home in Kandahar , he said : " Give them Uruzgan , Kandahar and Helmand ?
Change the constitution ?
No way , they are a defeated force , they are running , they are hiding , they are defeated . "
His remarks echo those of a senior presidential aide who said Karzai has no interest in a grand deal with the Taliban movement as a whole , but is interested in talking to individuals in order to " chip away at and weaken the insurgency " .
It is thought that the offer to return home to Afghanistan from their sanctuaries in Pakistan and live without the fear of being killed by Nato forces would be enough to encourage people to give up .
However , Harvard analyst Matt Waldman said the Taliban would only be happy with significant change to the current political set - up in Afghanistan .
" From my discussions with Taliban commanders it is clear they are driven to fight by predatory politics , the abuse of power and perception of military aggression .
Until these causes are addressed the fighting will go on . "
Peace plan
• Taliban foot soldiers will be encouraged by provincial and district governors to reintegrate into society .
An initial 90 - day cooling - off period will decide how they can be helped .
• They will vow not to fight against the government , and disavow al - Qaida .
The authorities will hold their biometric profile , including fingerprints and iris scans .
• To help former fighters support themselves , the government will offer vocational training in trades such as tailoring and electrical repairs .
• Thousands of manual jobs in construction and agriculture will be created for reintegrated rebels .
Others may join their local police force or the army .
• The programme will be initially rolled out in the provinces of Kandahar , Helmand , Herat , Baghdis , Nangarhar , Kunduz , and Baghlan .
It will affect 220 districts and around 4,000 villages .
• Insurgent leaders who reconcile themselves with the government may be removed from the UN 's terrorist blacklist and possibly be offered " exile in a third country " .

But here is some more , in case you want to read it .
We are rapidly constructing this summer coding program .
We know what we are doing , but because of timing , we are building the infrastructure , process , and requirements as we go .
It ’s like moving in to a house while the scaffolding is still outside .
The Fedora Project makes it easy to do stuff like this , since the plumbing and stuff are already in place .
( Enough of that metaphor … )
Since mentors have another week , until 14 April , to finish the ideas page , the page is growing and changing until then .
Check back often , put a watch on the page , and immediately begin communicating with the mentors of any ideas that you are interested in .
The best place to talk with mentors is the discussion list .
If you ca n’t participate this year , such as the timing being off for your summer plans or you want more certainty , good luck to you for this summer .
Check back in ; we intend to do this again ( and again ) , and it is going be better after all this learning we ’re doing .
If you celebrate summer at a different time of the year , such as if you are in the stunningly huge population of people in the Southern Hemisphere , do you think we should keep rolling this program to do a summer - for - the - south version ?
Stay tuned , or help organize it .
My reviews & thoughts regarding movies .
Occasionally I will cover documentaries & interesting science videos .
Putin in Wien : Judo , Gas und Heldenehrung » To Live and Love in Palestine Islamophobia : Between Propaganda and Facts I am not a hater or a defender of Islam , I am not a spokesperson of Europe or Austria , of leftist or rightist parties , and religion is far away from my interests .
I sent this article , “ Islamophobia between propaganda and facts ” in response to Professor F.H. from the University of Vienna , who wrote to tell me about his speech in acceptance of a prestigious award for his book about islamophobia in Austria .
Dr. F.H sent me an e-mail saying : “ I have just visited your homepage and thought that you may find this interesting : http://www … ” .
I read the speech of the doctor and I sent him as answer what I wrote below .
I asked him to permit me to publish his speech .
I have not yet received an answer from him .
Even the issue of “ islamophobia ” is not something that I see touches me directly , and until Professor F.H. wrote me , was not something I would have given too much thought .
I think that labeling this complex political issue as “ phobia ” on part of the Europeans rests from its urgency and also belittles the real worries of many people .
Dear F.H. ,
Thank you for your interest in my writing , and for sharing with me the very interesting text of your speech .
I think that it accurately reflects a part of the problem .
I normally do not talk about this subject , and religion is also far away from my interests .
Your speech about islamophobia brought this issue to my attention again .
I think that islamophobia is actually hatred and violence directed against women under the guise of religion and religious differences .
Hopefully , on a day not too distant , a cleansing process similar to what has been forced upon the Catholic Church will take place within Muslim communities too .
On that day , I will be the first one to open my mouth to relate what I have heard from other women and seen myself .
In my view , and from my experience , we are individually and as communities of immigrants responsible for how the peoples of the countries perceive and receive us .
While many people like to think that we come here with rights , it is too often forgotten that we also come here with duties , like respecting the peoples , cultures and customs , the laws and the religion of these countries .
We do not need to forget our culture , which is part of us , and we also have no right to impose our culture and values on the Austrians and the other European peoples .
As foreigners , regardless of out legal status in these countries which have received us very well on average , we must know how to be foreigners and always remember that each one of us is an ambassador for all of us .
The Austrians , and other European peoples , correctly view us as “ other ” and “ foreigners ” , whom they must get to know better before extending us their personal approval or rejection .
This has nothing to do with “ racism ” or “ islamophobia ” but is normal to thinking , adult persons .
Racism , religious discrimination , misogyny and other forms of hatred of the “ other ” are almost always instigated by groups acting for their own political and / or economic interest , building on this perception of “ other ” which is natural to us all .
“ Islamophobia ” , the rejection and hatred of all people and things identified as “ Muslim ” and “ Islamic ” , is exactly one such phenomenon : hatred of the other because of who and what they are not , instigated by interests which try to remain in the shadows .
But also , “ islamophobia ” as you call it , does not happen in a vacuum , it happens in the context of many anecdotal events which are perceived and remembered by the silent majority of Europeans who have seen Muslims living here during the last several decades .
In my experience , Islam is perceived as misogynist by westerners , and the most often discussed trait of Islam among westerners is treatment of women .
Europeans see , and correctly reject in disgust , the miserable conditions in which many Muslim women live and how they are treated .
What are most visible to Europeans in public are Muslim women walking around covered to various degrees , in shabby attire which reflects miserable living conditions .
Covered Muslim women have become the symbol for everything about Islam that is objectionable .
These women at once are the victims of a system of brutal suppression exerted on them by misguided men under the influence of interpretations of Islamic religious literature which are simply wrong , and at the same time they carry the full weight of the rejection of these host societies while being the weakest and most vulnerable members of these Muslim immigrant communities .
While the religion of Islam offers ample material which recommends treating women in the most respectful way , it is true that a morass of customs and a whole culture of hatred based on misinterpretations of the religious texts in ways which are against women exists in most Islamic countries , and that these customs are for the most part followed in Muslim communities throughout the western countries .
The religious literature says that “ the wives of the believers ” should cover ( dress ) themselves in a way which makes them appear as respectable and respected members of society and which will not specifically identify them as “ wives of believers .
In cases where a woman of exceptional beauty fears that she will be harmed because of this , she may cover herself .
These orders were given by God to the Prophet Muhammad ( PBUH ) and to his followers during a time when Islam existed surrounded by pagans not always well - disposed towards Muslims .
In my knowledge , there are no Prophets and Khalifas in our day , but merely men imposing their power upon women by use of raw force and under the pretext of wrong interpretations of Islam , and worse , by disregarding all respect for them .
The introduction of covers like Niqab under the guise of religious duty could be seen as blasphemous .
For Muslim women living in western societies to cover themselves using Niqab , Burqa or even less restrictive attires , has the net effect of bringing social disadvantages upon themselves and their families , so alone on this account the practice should be viewed as being against the Islamic religion .
Cover of any kind should also be seen as unnecessary because all women are protected in their persons and rights by law which are generally respected , and customs respectful towards women which are the cause of pride to many Europeans .
What is much less visible in public , and is never spoken about , is the comportment of Muslim men towards their female relatives and other women .
Two cases in point are a recent case which happened in Vienna about which I wrote ( see here and see here ) , and the case of the woman who was recently fined for driving with a veil in France .
I saw her husband flippantly claiming on TV that there is nothing in law forbidding one to have a mistress or four .
How can these women allow themselves being denigrated in public in such a way , characterized as doxies by the man who is their husband under Islamic religious law ?
Why did the woman seen with him on TV not spit on him ?
Fact is , laws forbidding polygamy in European jurisdictions are routinely circumvented in this way , by declaring the “ other ” wives as mistresses or not at all .
Many Muslim men living here often enough marry several women under Islamic law and not declare these ( illegal ) marriages before the government .
These undeclared wives will then be sent to ask for money from the government , often expressly forbidden by the husband to work even if she would like to .
If the woman objects , she will be subject to violence , threatened with divorce or sent back to her parents , what will render her unmarriable and dishonorable , sealing her fate .
If there are children , the man often keeps them , as they also mean “ income ” from social services .
This process can be repeated .
This practice also bases on a “ convenient ” interpretation of Islamic literature .
Fact is , the Quran allows a man to marry up to 4 women IF he is wealthy and has the means to sustain them .
Also , it must be noted that this practice was originally intended to protect widows and destitute women from social decline or poverty , and not so that lazy men could send women to beg money for them .
Today it is still normal to find Muslim women living in Europe submitted to genital mutilation , for them to be locked in by their fathers , husbands or sons , to be brought up to be servants of their male relatives , to be coerced into polygamous relations , to be engaged by their fathers , as children , to boys in far - away lands and to be shipped off as soon as they arrive at puberty .
Boys on their part are taught to expect that their sisters , mothers and daughters must obey their whims at once .
Woe to the woman of Muslim background who does not submit to this system of suppression and repression , as we must fear being murdered by the family for “ honor ” , and if this is not possible here , to be shipped back to where the family originated and have the deed done by a cousin or uncle , or be forced to marry somebody there .
A personal acquaintance , somebody who has lived for 40 years and prospered here , told me that “ to receive a girl in this society is a catastrophe ” ( because women could learn to think by themselves ) , from another I know that he shipped a daughter aged 14 off to be married to somebody in a catastrophe area .
In the current misguided discussion about Burka , Niqab and other forms of cover , the losers are women in all cases .
The net result of the law proposed in France by that simpleton Sarközy , and similar laws and edicts which will probably follow throughout Europe , will be that most of these women , who must cover themselves in public in order to not fall afoul of their male relatives , will not be able to participate in life beyond the walls of their homes , they will effectively be put under house arrest .
If we wish to eliminate the visible signs of mistreatment and dejection of women within Muslim communities , laws can only be the last step of the process .
The change should come from within the communities , and it should involve not only an abstract change in thinking , but the active disenfranchisement of religious and political figures which in any way or form tolerate , condone or even look the other way when it comes to the dehumanization , mistreatment or suppression of women for any reasons whatsoever .
This should not be limited to the figures within the Muslim communities , but should extend to judges who excuse violence against women because “ such are the customs of the perpetrator ” , as was recently the case in a verdict in Korneuburg if I remember correctly .
I think that visibly taking responsibility for the lacking treatment of women from within Muslim communities will go a long way in conferring these communities , and Muslims in general , more acceptance and respectability from outside and ultimately give us influence in the political process of the country .
Beyond the women issue , what the Austrians ( and other Europeans ) see of us Muslims , and this determines their perception of us , are community markets which are increasingly dominated by Muslim immigrants and which do not meet their expectations of hygiene , a proliferation of Kebab - stands which sell inedible wares and blight the city , favoritism from of the authorities , which are seen as lowering their standards when conceding business permits to immigrants , courts of justice which condone violence against women on part of Muslim men , cover - up on side of the commercial media of crimes perpetrated by Muslim immigrants , vast abuse of the social system on side of mostly Muslim immigrants , gangs of Muslim immigrant youths on the streets who do not care about the customs of the country , who are often involved in violence , harassment of women and petty crime against others .
We must also take responsibility for this , as we can not expect from the common European , Austrian man or woman to understand what causes all these issues , which in sum threaten , to them , to overwhelm the character of this country as a place worthy living in .
To them we are people who have brought problems here which did not exist before .
I think that these issues should be taken care of , in the best interest of everybody .
The FPÖ and their objectionable anti-foreigner stance , the Swiss minaret referendum and other related issues are perfectly valid and legitimate expressions of the worries of an increasing part of the people of Austria and other European countries .
It is wrong to dismiss them as “ racist ” without a second thought , and we do so at our own peril .
The FPÖ , the minaret referendum , and related political issues are at once made possible by decades of constant propaganda demonizing and dehumanizing Muslims , Arabs and anything and anybody related to us , by behavior of immigrant Muslim communities which is objectively and visibly inappropriate when taking in consideration the laws , expectations and values of the Austrians , and by ( perceived ) attitudes and activities of the academic and political agencies of public life which are appropriate towards exacerbating existing conflicts , not to solve them in the best interest of us all .
What the Europeans and Austrians seldom see , are the many immigrants from Muslim countries who have become doctors , engineers , academics , traders , workers and employees , who together with their families have done their best to integrate into and contribute their part to the society of this country , people who often do not rest on religion as the main trait defining their identity .
These people , who do not correspond to the image of retrograde , extremist religious zealots , are seldom shown in the media and are at best given lip service by established political forces .
This shows , in my opinion , that the religious groups which are traded as our representatives on the political scene in this country do not represent our interests well , and that they probably do not understand which are the interests of this community outside their own shortsighted views .
I hold that our common interests should not be represented against Austrian customs as seems to be the case , but within what is considered acceptable by the Austrians who are not of immigrant background .
While the clienteles of FPÖ and similar forces on the “ right ” of the political spectrum complain about what are the most visible activities and attitudes of immigrant Muslim communities , my impression is that the “ left ” of the established political spectrum , out of opportunism , courts out of political opportunism ( securing votes ) groups constituted around a reactionary religious establishment which at once promotes a role of women which is undesirable by Austrian ( actually , any ) standards , which promotes exactly the attitudes criticized by the “ right ” , and which stands in the way of a constructive and lasting integration into a common Austrian culture of Muslim immigrants .
The main outside factor in the generation of “ islamophobia ” is in my opinion a decades old , pervasive , subtle and brutal propaganda campaign which is being waged through all western media with a very definite and clear intention .
The visible political movements of the right , such as FPÖ in Austria , have nothing to do with this campaign ; they are only opportunists picking the ripe fruit falling from this tree of evil .
Without exception , western media portrays Muslims as a mixture of dangerous wild beasts , crazy religious zealots , woman beaters , terrorists , violence - prone idiots , thieves , rabble , backward , uneducated , dishonest desert - dwellers , and with other even less appealing and even more dehumanizing epithets which hugely overstate and exaggerate social problems which we have .
In sum , this relentless campaign of propaganda against Muslims can be characterized as being the second or third stage of genocide if we restrict our view to Europe – see I include a quote from that Wikipedia article , which I think mentions clearly what this campaign of vilification of Muslims is about : … members of the dominant society must perceive their potential victims as less than fully human : as “ pagans , ” “ savages , ” “ uncouth barbarians , ” “ unbelievers , ” “ effete degenerates , ” “ ritual outlaws , ” “ racial inferiors , ” “ class antagonists , ” “ counterrevolutionaries , ” and so on .
In themselves , these conditions are not enough for the perpetrators to commit genocide .
To do that — that is , to commit genocide — the perpetrators need a strong , centralized authority and bureaucratic organization as well as pathological individuals and criminals .
Also required is a campaign of vilification and dehumanization of the victims by the perpetrators , who are usually new states or new regimes attempting to impose conformity to a new ideology and its model of society .
The results of this unrelenting propaganda campaign are impressive , and in sum they have shown themselves as extremely useful for the ruling elites of the western nations , to which Austria ultimately belongs .
Countries which are dominantly Muslim or where sizable Muslim minorities live either are ruled by ruthless and murderous dictatorships which are invariably backed by US or European secret services , or they are the victims of interminable strings of wars , overt and covert genocide , or various stages of civil war .
In these countries , the suppression of women from the social process is part of the warfare of these western - backed criminal regimes against the peoples which they rule by terror .
This is the picture between Morocco in the West and Philippines in the East .
A prime example of such a regime is the wretchedly criminal PA which has been imposed upon Palestine by the zionists .
As a result of this propaganda campaign , the genocide against Palestinians being perpetrated by zionist jews is regularly portrayed as something honorable in character , two wars between Iran and Iraq instigated by the CIA and MI6 were somehow dismissed in the media as “ business as usual between brutes ” , the wholesale destruction of Iraq and Afghanistan and the ensuing genocides perpetrated by the USA against these peoples are portrayed in the media as “ the right thing to do ” , “ our only alternative ” , “ war against terror ” , and other wholesome falsities .
As a result of this campaign , it is possible for Germany to give for free to the criminal operation called Israel six or seven submarines able to launch nuclear weapons ; it is possible for president Sarközy to say that he wants to “ Karcherize ” the banlieus and be applauded as funny instead of being dismissed as the bigoted racist which he is ; it is possible for Austria to support with troops for about 40 years the occupation of the Golan heights , in direct contravention to international law , and defend this as “ peace keeping ” ; it is possible for the USA to account for the disappearance of 5 million Afghanis since the invasion in 2001 with a simple “ accounting error ” claim instead of seeing this as an instance of genocide ; it is possible for the zionists to get away with over 60 years of dedicated genocide against us Palestinians and explain it away as “ nation building ” ; it is possible for the city of Vienna to finance at enormous cost a PR campaign of the city of Tel Aviv which is designed to justify and normalize genocide and cleanse the stench of murder from Israel ; it is possible for Ehud Barak , a criminal accused of genocide and crimes against humanity , to visit Austria and be called a “ friend ” .
Many other similar instances of insane behavior and shows of moral depravity are all made possible by this campaign , and we see them everyday on TV mostly without noticing them .
This campaign of propaganda and perception management works through all media and many institutions of public life : it consists of computer games such as “ Call of Duty 4 ” or “ Amer icas Army ” where Muslim enemies , always portrayed as terrorists brandishing RPGs and AK47 guns can be shot at will ; it consists of out - of - place skits by american actor Eddy Murphy which force the line that Muslims are terrorists ; it consists of the misrepresentation of legitimate political groups in Muslim countries as terrorists ; it happens each time when an Arab or Muslim from far - away lands is called “ radical muslim ” in news programs such as ZIB ; of articles published in zionist newspapers which misrepresent , obfuscate and justify the zionist crimes against Palestinians ; it consists of the vile bigot Sascha Baron Cohen and his “ Borat ” character , and of the director of the University of Vienna who disallowed a speech by Dr. Norman Finkelstein about the zionist crimes in Palestine on his premises of the university .
The most potent weapon of this propaganda campaign is the abstract slander of “ anti- semitism ” , which , while nobody knows exactly what it means , makes everybody shudders at being the target of this accusation , and it effectively silences any criticism of the many crimes of the zionist interests in its tracks .
This unrelenting campaign of vilification and active suppression of Muslims in western media should concern everybody , Muslims , Christians and also the followers of other religions .
To ignore it for much longer will ultimately allow for “ justified ” outright mass murder against Muslims in many western nations , as has been the case in isolated incidents in Thailand , India , and the Philippines .
When that happens , it will be too late , perhaps for decades , to look for a common ground with other population groups .
The campaign is waged by zionist interests , it is designed to vilify , belittle , dehumanize Muslims everywhere in ways not easily identifiable to the casual consumer of media , because they , zionists , perceive Arabs and Muslims ( right or wrong ) in general as a primary “ support group ” of the Palestinian cause , which they must discredit and weaken in order to attain legitimacy for their colonization of Palestine .
In western countries , among them Austria , the campaign also has the purpose of hindering solidarity between Christians and Muslims , as it denigrates the “ other ” side and so prevents us to see that we actually have many common interests when we see beyond outwardly apparent differences .
As interested Muslims , we should concern us with solving to the best of our capacity the existing and most visible problems in our communities , starting with the suppression of women .
Of equal urgency is that we concern us actively with the propaganda campaign waged by zionist interests against us .
We will survive neither as communities nor as individual persons if we do not interest us in these problems affecting us .
In order to be able to counter the vilification directed against us , Muslims must first solve the internal problems which affect these communities .
We should equally take account of the worries of the host societies into which we have come , not by silencing them and denigrating their worries as racism or worse , but by respecting their laws and traditions , by listening to them attentively and doing our best to find the common ground which we have .
Lastly , it is of primary importance for a peaceful and constructive coexistence to unmask zionism as a poisonous , criminal ideology which parasitizes upon judaism just as the Nazi ideology parasitized upon the idea of being German , because no sensible discussion of politics in any context is possible without extensively analyzing the mostly undue influence exerted by zionists in political and social processes .

Hello !
My name is Steve .
I have drawn cats for people all over the world .
I want to draw a cat for you .
Before 17 - year - old Steve Consalvi ran onto the field at Citizen 's Bank Park on Monday , where he was Tasered by a police officer , the teen reportedly called his father for permission to do so .
" He said , ' Dad , can I run on the field ? '
I said , ' I do n't think you should , son , ' " Wayne Consalvi told the Philadelphia Inquirer of the conversation he had with his son .
" This would be a once in a lifetime experience ! "
Steve Consalvi replied to his father , according to the newspaper .
Wayne Consalvi told the newspaper that his son was not drinking and he was n't on drugs .
Steve Consalvi is " a real good student , heading to Penn State , " his father told the Philadelphia Inquirer .
The father also told the newspaper that his son did n't run onto the field as a result of a dare or bet , either .
" I do n't recommend running on the field , but I do n't think they should have Tased him at all , " he told the newspaper .
Steve Consalvi's mother , Amy Ziegler , apologized for his actions and said he regrets running onto the field .
" It was stupid .
It was just absolutely stupid , " she told WTXF - TV .
The Phillies and Philadelphia police are investigating whether a police officer 's use of a Taser to apprehend Steve Consalvi was an appropriate use of force .
Lt. Frank Vanore , a police spokesman , says Commissioner Charles Ramsey reviewed the tape and felt the officer had acted within the department 's guidelines , which allow officers to use Tasers to arrest fleeing suspects .
Vanore says internal affairs is still investigating .
Ramsey told KYW Radio in Philadelphia that he supported the officer 's decision to use a Taser .
" It was inappropriate for him to be out there on the field , " Ramsey said .
" Unless I read something to the contrary , that officer acted appropriately .
I support him 100 percent . "
The department is reviewing whether its officers should be on the field wrangling fans who are n't threatening anyone , Vanore said .
" Should we be on the field at all ?
I think that 's what 's being looked at , " Vanore said .
" I 'm not sure we should be chasing people around the field . "
Vanore said it was the first time he knew of that a Philadelphia officer had used a Taser on a fan on the field .
There have been instances in other cities of police using stun guns on unruly fans in the stands , including last year at an A's game in Oakland , Calif .
Another fan ran onto the field at Citizens Bank Park during Tuesday night 's Phillies game and gave himself up without incident in center field .
The 34 - year - old man was booed by the sellout crowd and charged with defiant trespass , disorderly conduct and narcotics possession .
Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell called the incident " a big mistake . "
" There 's no need to use Tasers on fans who run on the field , " the former Philadelphia mayor told WCAU - TV .
" We should just have enough personnel out there to surround them , take them off the field and put them in jail . "
Pat Courtney , a spokesman for Major League Baseball , said security issues are dealt with at the team level .
He said he knew the Phillies were talking with police about the encounter and that MLB was monitoring the situation , but he declined further comment .
Mary Catherine Roper , an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union in Philadelphia , said she did n't understand why the officer had to use a Taser .
" How long can he really run around out there ? "
Roper said of the fan .
" In this situation , he 's not dangerous , he 's not getting away . "
An expert on police accountability said he could n't comment specifically on the Philadelphia case but said the general rule is that officers should use Tasers only on people who are posing a threat of " imminent harm . "
Merrick Bobb , executive director of a Los Angeles - based nonprofit police oversight group called the Police Assessment Resource Center , said mild resistance usually does n't justify the use of a Taser .
" Usually the resistance has to threaten some harm to the officer in order to justify the use of a Taser , " Bobb said .
Players did n't think the officer 's action was excessive .
" If you 're on the streets running away from a cop , does n't that cop have a right to Tase you because you 're fleeing from a cop ?
So what 's the difference , " Phillies center fielder Shane Victorino said .
St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa agreed the use of a Taser was appropriate .
" If somebody comes up there and does some damage , they 're going to be second - guessing not doing anything , " La Russa said .
" I just think it 's acceptable , because it 's a good deterrent . "
Consalvi , wearing a baseball cap , red T - shirt and khaki shorts , hopped a fence and scurried around the outfield , eluding two security officers in the bottom of the eighth inning against the Cardinals .
One officer used a Taser and the fan went down in a heap .
Several Phillies placed gloves over their faces and appeared to be stifling laughter at the wild scene .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
If asked whether he ’s a believer , Wes , a Christian pastor , wo n’t give a simple answer .
He has struggled with his faith for years .
He ca n’t say whether he believes or disbelieves in any easy way .
Instead , he tries to explain something more subtle , closer to “ both ” and “ neither ” than “ yes ” or “ no . ”
“ The difference between me and an atheist is basically this , ” he says , “ It ’s not about the existence of God .
It ’s : do we believe that there is room for the use of the word ‘ God ’ in some context ? …
I think the word God can be used very expressively in some of my more meditative modes .
I ’ve thought of God as a kind of poetry that ’s written by human beings . ”
Wes — a pseudonym — is one of five men who participated in Daniel Dennett and Linda LaScola ’s recently released study , “ Preachers Who Are Not Believers . ”
LaScola is a social worker and Dennett , a philosopher , is one of the original New Atheists ( and the “ Four Horsemen ” ) , well - known for his vitriol against religion .
Much of their report is subtle and moving .
It allows five Protestant ministers to express their isolation and private wrestling with questions of belief , venturing careful and sometimes complicated explanations .
Unfortunately , though , the authors do n’t seem to be listening .
Instead , they seem intent on catching religion red - handed by exposing hypocrisy at the top .
What these clergymen really have to offer is ultimately not the fact of whether they believe in God or not but , rather , the struggles of honesty , faith , and reason that are a part of so many people ’s lives today .
Yet Dennett and LaScola dismiss the nuance in what their subjects say , foisting a severely restrictive framework onto the ministers ’ carefully thought - out positions .
Even in the title , the study labels them “ not believers , ” though that does n’t really describe them at all .
As one of the men says , “ We are not ‘ un - believers ’ in our own minds . ”
In whose minds , then , do they disbelieve ?
In the mind of Albert Mohler , Jr. , certainly .
The prominent Southern Baptist calls their beliefs “ heresy , apostasy , and hypocrisy . ”
Dennett and LaScola seem to agree with this when they write that the five ministers “ live out their ministries in secret disbelief . ”
“ It ’s not , ” says “ Darryl , ” one of the five , “ that I ’m not a believer .
I do believe in God . ”
He raises the all - important question posed by Augustine : what do you believe when you say you believe in God ?
Or , maybe just as important : what do you disbelieve when you disbelieve in God ?
Dennett and LaScola try to describe the range of possible ( Christian ) answers .
They come up , though , with a curiously limited set of options :
A spectrum of available conceptions of God can be put in rough order , with frank anthropomorphism at one extreme — a
God existing in time and space with eyes and hands and love and anger — through deism , a somehow still personal God who cares but is nevertheless outside time and space and does not intervene , and the still more abstract Ground of all Being , from which ( almost ? ) all anthropomorphic features have been removed , all the way to frank atheism : nothing at all is aptly called God .
This simple framework , however , does n’t make any place or space for some of the most traditional , philosophical conceptions of God in Christian tradition .
Those who have thought about this question seriously —
Anselm , Aquinas , Barth , Boff , and on down to the ministers in this study — have developed sophisticated understandings of God that do n’t seem to fit among the “ spectrum of available conceptions . ”
It begins with a basic confusion of terms .
Dennett and LaScola , for instance , quote Karen Armstrong ’s statement that , “ God is not a being at all . ”
But instead of understanding that to mean
God is more than a being among beings , or that God is Being itself , they take it as a veiled declaration of atheism .
They react as if Armstrong is trying to disguise her true unbelief behind tricky language .
Yet Armstrong is only repeating an old and familiar formula that believers have used for centuries to answer Augustine ’s question .
We ’re told that two other ministers declined to participate in the study because of “ concerns about the term ‘ non - believing . ’ ” Dennett and LaScola seem surprised by this .
“ Though neither of them believed in a supernatural god , both strongly self - identified as believers , ” the authors write .
“ But what do they mean by this ?
Are they perhaps deceiving themselves ?
There is no way of answering . ”
This is preposterous .
There is no reason to assume they ’re deceiving themselves , and it ’s dishonest to suggest there is .
Dennett and LaScola were forced to recognize that their terms were inadequate and misleading , but they proceeded to use them anyway .
There are also , of course , many ways of answering , many ways of believing and not believing .
But the study dismisses all but a few characterizations of belief as untenable .
Most of the preachers “ who do not believe ” make attempts to stake out other points on a spectrum of belief , but they are criticized as “ spin doctoring . ”
With this judgment , and the moral weight it carries , the authors come to the end of their empathy .
Dennett and LaScola are mono( a ) theists : they claim to know exactly what God is and they call it hooey .
For them God is ridiculous , and they insist on their simple definitions even if that means dismissing the accounts of more reasonable beliefs offered by those who hold them .
Dennett and LaScola would say my objection is just “ assiduously ” ambiguous , attempting to confuse the question by making the definition of God more complicated .
They think such complications are really a guise , protecting religion with “ a gentle fog that shrouds the question of belief in God , ” so that “ many people could sincerely say that they do n’t know what they are being asked . ”
But if the question of belief is worth asking , it ’s worth understanding .
Like most things human , it ’s challenging .
If something ’s worth believing in , it ’s worth believing in rigorously .
“ Philosophical theology , ” Dennett has said elsewhere , “ is a pseudo - sophisticated mugs game , full of willful obscurities . ”
But this is as much a premise as a conclusion .
Even if all the theists are really mugs playing a mad game of absurdism and obscurantism , rationally engaging with them requires responding to the most sophisticated among them .
Rejecting a mischaracterized
God that is n’t worth taking seriously is n’t much of a feat .
All of the preachers in the study have struggled , primarily , with denominational dogma that tries to strip down belief much as Dennett does .
They have wrestled not with God so much as with particular doctrines , particular understandings of God , and , especially , with the conventions about what can and ca n’t be discussed openly in church .
Three of them insist that , though they have rejected their denominations ’ dogma , they still believe in God ; they just say it ’s complicated .
The other two seem to accept that they , in fact , are unbelievers , that the line drawn by fundamentalists and the New Atheists is right , and they fall on the side of not believing .
Wherever they end up in their answers to the question of belief , all five of these men have taken belief seriously .
They have not simply accepted or rejected imposed definitions of what faith means .
They have struggled and tried to be honest about it .
To the point that Dennett and LaScola listen and let these men talk about their wrestling with faith , their report deserves our attention .
It rightly calls for more openness , and even empathy , in listening to these men and hearing out their stories .
But then the authors try to stuff these stories into boxes that do n’t fit them .
An honest atheism must come to terms with the God it rejects .
Dennett and LaScola took the time to find these preachers and ask them to speak out — so why do they dismiss the answers ?
Women have been serving in the Iraqi military for at least 30 years .
The women , long denied numerous benefits , have usually occupied administrative posts .
Officials said the Defense Ministry has encouraged the recruitment of women in the military .
They said women would play a key role in the modernization of the Iraq Army .
" Females are the hub of the community , " Iraqi Deputy Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Mohammed Hussein said .
" Now we are looking for women to prove their roles in the Iraq army . "
Officers have been offered courses on how to treat women in the military .
On Feb. 21 , the military conducted a two - day seminar to discuss women as well as human rights issues in the military .
" It is important for us to professionalize women in the army , " Ms. Omran , who deals with health affairs at the Defense Ministry , said .
" Women must accept the important responsibilities given to them .
[ Your ] duty is looking for better ways to do your job . "
The U.S. military has encouraged women in the Iraq Army .
During the February seminar , female U.S. officers urged their Iraqi counterparts to stay in the army despite societal pressure .
At one point , the men in the audience were asked to leave so the Iraqi women soldiers could speak freely .
" Your service in the army is historic , " U.S. Army Col.
Peggy Combs told the Iraqi women .

" We will never divide Jerusalem , " said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his speech commemorating Jerusalem Day on Ammunition Hill on Wednesday .

" Jerusalem Day marks the day the city began positively developing for all its citizens , Jews and Arabs alike .
We will never again make Jerusalem a divided , disunited , and isolated city . "
Jerusalem Day marks 43 years since the establishment of Israeli control over East Jerusalem in 1967 .
" We will continue to build and be built in Jerusalem .
We will continue to develop , plan , and create in Jerusalem , " said Netanyahu in his speech .
" We can not develop in a divided city . "
" We are the generation that had the privilege of seeing Jerusalem united , and we need to impart this privilege onto our children and grandchildren , " said the prime minister .
" The connection Israel has to Jerusalem is extremely deep and it surpasses any connection any other country has to a city .
The connection stayed strong for thousands of years and now it 's stronger than ever . "
In response to Netanyahu 's words , MK Ahmed Tibi ( United Arab List - Ta'al ) said that " there is no greater lie than the unity of Jerusalem . "
" East Jerusalem is a city under foreign occupation , and peace will not established until the occupation ends and East Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine , " he said .
Starting today , Austin - area subscribers to Time Warner 's digital cable can choose from among 10 music - related video channels and 45 radio - style music channels ranging in format from contemporary Christian to rap .
You 'll have to make a special request to get the rap channel , though .
The good folks at Time Warner would n't want Carman fans to accidentally hear Ol ' Dirty Bastard now would they ?
Twenty years and a day after MTV signed on , outlets for music television have grown exponentially even as ownership becomes more concentrated .
Of the channels devoted in some way to music - related programming , from BET on Jazz to our own Austin Music Network , only a handful spend the majority of their day broadcasting wall - to - wall music videos in the manner pioneered by MTV in 1981 .
In recent years , MTV and its gray - templed first cousin VH1 have drastically cut back on airing music videos in favor of more traditional program blocks .
MTV's long - running afternoon request show has morphed into Total Request Live , a postmodern American Bandstand that trades Dick Clark for Carson Daly and screaming girls giving shout - outs to their fave raves for actual music videos .
Then there 's VH1's Behind the Music , a series that has cast ( or recast ) the careers of everyone from AC / DC to the Osmonds in the same rigid rise / fall / comeback mold borrowed from Greek drama .
On MTV 's copycat - spawning The Real World , music assumes a subtler role , underlying every scene with soundtrack - of - a- generation pathos .
The Real World is often cited as ground zero for " reality " TV , but it was PBS '
An American Family , in fact , that introduced viewers to the Loud family 's conflict cavalcade more than 20 years before Puck launched his first snot rocket .
Rather ,
The Real World 's lasting accomplishment can be found in their co-opting the documentary format in a manner rife with marketing opportunities .
Why stop at the soundtrack of a generation when you can market IKEA 's furniture of a generation ?
If it 's rock videos you want , you 'll need MTV2 ( formerly M2 ) and MuchMusic USA , a subsidiary of the Canadian music channel .
With a smaller budget than MTV2 , MuchMusic relies heavily on music videos , performer profiles , and the like .
As such , it vaguely resembles MTV circa 1987 .
MTV2 purports all music all the time , and their range is more adventurous than today 's MTV , but you wo n't get your Jurassic 5 or At the Drive - In fix without wading through gaggles of in - house promos desperately attempting to brand the network as something cooler and less corporate than its parent .
Throw in spots for Miss Cleo 's tarot reading and Aussie Nads hair - removal cream , and regulating the amount of commercial time on TV ô la Canada suddenly does n't sound like such a bad idea .
Then again , these ads do provide real entertainment value , if only as a touchstone for parody .
Even a 30 - minute Time - Life Music " Best of the Eighties " infomercial starring the Chick Who Used to Date the Guy in Warrant can be re-construed as entertainment if there 's nothing better on .
After all , are n't music videos themselves advertisements ?
Just where does one draw the line between what is art and what is commerce ?
And in today 's free - market - as - savior America , does that even matter anymore ?
Silly Symphonies
The history of music accompanied by moving images began long before 1981 .
It was actually Al Jolson 's wildly popular 1927 musical melodramathat forced theaters across the nation to install sound , though tests for such were conducted as far back as the early 1900s .
In addition to the full - fledged movie musicals that followed in the wake of The Jazz Singer , film studios released hundreds of musical shorts promoting artists such as Benny Goodman and Louis Armstrong .
Walt Disney 's series of " Silly Symphonies " shorts culminated with 1940's Fantasia , a sprawling , full - length feature that illustrated eight classical music compositions with some of the most ambitious animation sequences in history .
The most obvious precursor to music video is the " soundie . "
Soundies were short music clips produced between 1940 - 46 for coin-operated projection machines called " Panorams , " viewed for 10 cents a pop .
Panorams were found in bars , nightclubs , and restaurants , and featured a wide variety of artists including Spike Jones , Louis Jordan , and ( smiles , everyone , smiles ) Ricardo Montalban , who performed " He 's the Latin From Staten Island " in 1941 .
More than 1,800 soundies were produced in their time , but wartime restrictions on the manufacture of Panorams ultimately killed off the medium .
In 1960 , an updated take on the Panoram called the Scopitone was developed and popularized in France via campy , sexy clips by French pop stars like Johnny Hallyday .
Unlike the Panoram , the Scopitone showed clips in color and allowed the customer to choose from 36 clips instead of just one .
Scopitones came to America in 1964 , but despite a clip of Debbie Reynolds doing " If I Had a Hammer " Vegas - style , the American distributor of Scopitone machines was out of business by 1969 .
Efforts to introduce video jukeboxes showing MTV - style fare at arcades and amusement parks in the mid-Eighties were met with similar indifference .
Snader Telescriptions were the first music clips developed specifically for television .
Produced by Louis Snader in the early Fifties , local TV stations used the clips to fill odd gaps of airtime .
Most of the 754 clips were recorded live , with no playback or lip- synching , and several featured captivating performances from stars like Nat King Cole ( view examples online at www.tvparty.com/vaultvid.html).
The Big Beat
As rock & roll arrived , the ability of strong visuals to sell a song became apparent when Bill Haley & the Comets ' year - old minor hit , " Rock Around the Clock , " shot to No. 1 after being featured at the beginning of the 1955 film .
Hollywood followed suit with a series of similar films , includingand ( both 1956 ) , the latter of which was little more than musical performances connected by a thin plot and introductions by pioneer disc jockey Alan Freed .
Freed also had the first network rock & roll TV show , The Big Beat , in the summer of 1957 , but it was Dick Clark 's American Bandstand ( which debuted less than a month later ) that successfully demonstrated how youth culture could be marketed without controversy .
Airing each weekday afternoon from the WFIL - TV studios in Philadelphia , Bandstand functioned as a nationwide record hop for teens tuning in to hear the latest songs , learn the latest dances , and see the latest fashions .
Clark was the authoritative moderator , and only clean - cut , well - dressed , mostly ( but not exclusively ) white dancers appeared onscreen .
This undoubtedly helped pacify parents and prospective advertisers .
Although the show 's popularity began waning in the mid-Sixties , American Bandstand stayed on the air until 1989 .
Vestiges of Bandstand could be seen in the Sixties on Shindig , in the Seventies on Soul Train , in the Eighties on Dance Party USA , and in the Nineties and today on MTV's Total Request Live .
The Beatles ' 1964 film A Hard Day 's Night was influential in codifying the visual style of music videos .
Director Richard Lester combined elements of French New Wave cinema ( e.g. , quick cuts , restless camera work ) with the upbeat , buy - now energy of TV commercials .
The impish , unrestrained personalities of the Beatles themselves defined the classic onscreen pop-group persona that persists even today in videos like Blink - 182's " What 's My Age Again ? " and the Dixie Chicks ' " Ready to Run . "
The Beatles ' television equivalents were , of course , the Monkees .
The Prefab Four fused Lester 's visuals with Marx Brothers - style antics and the best songwriters and studio musicians money could buy .
Though their songs and show have stood the test of time , at their height , the Monkees were widely derided for their manufactured image and for not playing their own instruments .
As the Sixties progressed , rock fans demanded more authenticity in their music .
Perhaps as a belated response to this , NBC's The Midnight Special and the syndicated Don Kirshner 's Rock Concert ( both 1973 - 81 ) featured live , non-lip - synched performances by everyone from K.C. & the Sunshine Band to the New York Dolls .
Meanwhile , PBS had WTTW's Soundstage From Chicago and KLRN's ( now KLRU ) Austin City Limits from the corner of 26th ( now Dean Keeton ) and Guadalupe .
Despite focusing on concert performances , clips of lip - synched performances were also screened on shows like The Midnight Special .
More often than not , these clips came from overseas artists , including Queen , David Bowie , and ABBA .
These nascent clips served as stopgap promotional devices in America , because they were much less expensive than touring .
Moreover , countries such as Great Britain already had TV shows that relied heavily on promo clips .
Former Monkee and native Texan Michael Nesmith noticed one such show during a tour of Australia .
Although a video clip program called Nightclubbing was shown on Manhattan cable TV starting in 1975 , and USA Network 's Night Flight began showing an eclectic mix of rock videos and movies in 1980 , Nesmith 's Popclips was the immediate precursor to MTV .
Popclips aired on Nickelodeon in 1980 , and its success got the Warner Amex Satellite Entertainment Company to consider the possibilities of a 24 - hour cable music channel .
Preliminary planning for this channel involved Nesmith , but his artistic vision of music video clashed with Warner Amex 's vision of a heavily formatted and researched album - oriented rock outlet for the eyeballs .
Nez balked and Warner Amex went ahead without him .
One Step Beyond
Before we get caught up imagining how MTV might have turned out under Nesmith , let me relate the thrill of coming home from middle school in 1982 and seeing MTV for the first time .
Back then , as an underage music fan , you did n't take music on television for granted .
In some cases , you stayed up until ungodly hours of the morning to catch whatever morsel the four or five broadcast stations might deign to show .
With MTV , you could watch music 24/7 , committing easy rebellion from the comfort of your couch -- at least until your folks commandeered the TV for St. Elsewhere .
In MTV 's early days , programmers joked that the channel had 300 videos and 30 were by Rod Stewart .
Many were crap -- quickie live shoots from Journey , REO Speedwagon , and Triumph that could only get shown on public access today .
MTV even ran these weird , two - minute filler clips of weather footage set to instrumental music with no explanation whatsoever .
The five original " veejays " -- J.J. Jackson , Mark Goodman , Alan Hunter , Nina Blackwood , and Martha Quinn -- announced what videos were at the top of each hour , conducted mini-interviews , read tour dates , and wore satin baseball jackets emblazoned with the MTV logo .
But there were also plenty of indelible images that still resonate today .
Madness skanking in crew - cut unison out of a barbershop in " One Step Beyond . "
Joan Jett yanking off her trenchcoat and exposing her bikini - clad form in " Do You Wanna Touch Me . "
The snare drum full of milk in J. Geils ' " Centerfold . "
Any early - Eighties teen whose home had cable carrying MTV can probably name 10 more .
Given the rock - radio pedigrees of MTV co-founders Bob Pittman and Les Garland , they probably would 've liked nothing better than just playing what was on AOR radio .
After all , MTV 's target audience was young suburban white guys .
But the dearth of videos , let alone good ones , by established American artists forced MTV to be more adventurous and play British groups like ABC and Depeche Mode .
By 1983 , a second British Invasion was in full effect .
It 's impossible to imagine Duran Duran achieving such success without MTV .
Something you did n't see on early MTV were videos by black artists .
By positing itself in the guise of AOR radio , MTV could systematically deny airplay to artists like Rick James and Grandmaster Flash , because they " did n't fit the format . "
But this refusal smacked of institutionalized racism since MTV was the only game in town .
When rock writer Dave Marsh and others objected , co-founder Pittman characterized them as " little Hitlers " ( see below ) .
Then along came Michael Jackson with the video for " Billie Jean . "
Thriller was already a monster hit and " Billie Jean " a compelling video , yet MTV still hedged on airing it .
CBS Records , Jackson 's label , reportedly threatened to pull all CBS videos from MTV if " Billie Jean " did n't air .
Of course , " Billie Jean " aired , Jackson became the King of Pop , and the video revolution was ignited in earnest .
Today , MTV portrays " Billie Jean " as the video that broke the color barrier , even though the channel itself was responsible for erecting that barrier in the first place .
So much for institutional memory ...
Becoming
In 1983 , 's Stephen Levy wrote , " MTV 's greatest achievement has been to coax rock & roll into the video arena where you can't distinguish between entertainment and the sales pitch . "
This remains MTV 's legacy , but its implications stretch far beyond rock & roll .
With programming supplied free by record companies , MTV spent its early creative energy on establishing an identity , which was crucial as cable expanded viewers ' choices ; " I Want My MTV ! " became an effective rallying bray compelling cable operators to add MTV to their lineup .
Meanwhile , the eye - candy overload in MTV's on - air promos was the video equivalent of the zip - bang jingles produced for Sixties Top 40 radio by Dallas - based PAMS Inc .
Before long , MTV 's branding techniques and visual styles were all over television .
MTV 's status as a visual panoply of texts no longer than five minutes meant rock stars now had to devote considerable energy to their image .
A few artists protested this new order .
After trashing MTV in song on " Seen Your Video , " the Replacements ' 1985 clip for " Bastards of Young " consisted of a single still shot of a stereo speaker playing the song .
But this was an anomaly .
The new reality quickly made a mega-star of Madonna and a mockery of old - guard acts like Toto who did n't have the looks , style , and / or media savvy to re-create themselves at the speed MTV demanded .
Another MTV legacy was bringing viewers closer to the stars in a manner that makes Tiger Beat look tame by comparison .
The channel first introduced this concept with extravagant meet - the - stars contests ( e.g. , " Win a Pink House from John Cougar Mellencamp ! " ) .
Today , a show called Becoming takes lucky fans on an adventure where they actually " become " their favorite pop star .
After the obligatory makeovers , dance rehearsals , and a video pep talk from the stars themselves , fans shoot look - a- like videos that can be frighteningly convincing .
Over at VH1 , Bands on the Run updates the battle of the bands concept by sending four unsigned bands on the road in logo - covered , burglar - magnet vans to compete against one another for prizes including $ 50,000 and a video in heavy rotation on VH1 .
That VH1 pays for two hotel rooms , gas , phone cards , and a $ 20 per - diem veers far from the reality of most indie tours , but the petty squabbles , alcoholic egotism , embarrassing sex , and fart jokes are all right on the money .
Whatever becomes of Real World - style " reality " TV , it 's a pretty sure bet that the need for cheap content will keep cameras pointed toward civilians .
And who can blame viewers for desiring celebrity in an age where even peripheral hangers - on like Kato Kaelin can turn happenstance into paid personal appearances ?
Constant MTV - style exposure to celebrities is bound to make you feel vaguely inadequate just sitting there on the couch .
Free Tacos for Everyone ?
Advertising has always been the economic force behind mass media in America , but MTV transformed advertising into an art form to be analyzed and reviewed as a cultural product .
The artistic pretensions of promotional music videos compelled advertisers to go the extra mile to engage consumers .
Consumers , in turn , now accept the prospect of watching the Super Bowl just for the ads .
The greatest promise ever advertised used to be everlasting life .
The new greatest promise is that the market is the supreme and omnipotent arbiter of human desire .
And let 's face it , buying your way out of everyday boredom is much easier than submitting to a more challenging belief system .
This promise will continue to flourish as long as market forces continue encroaching upon every aspect of our daily lives .
Right now , Blink - 182 is on MTV's Diary , the show that follows pop stars around with cameras to create the sensation of being privy to their everyday lives .
They 've just arrived back home in San Diego from an overseas tour .
Guitarist Tom DeLonge is hungry for Mexican food .
Destination : Taco Bell .
" It 's kind of a California thing , " he says before ordering a sack full of tacos .
Usually , MTV blurs out logos that appear incidentally on its programs , but not this time .
Then the show cuts to a commercial for Taco Bell -- the official fast food of Blink - 182 .
I hope they got reimbursed for the tacos .

This most fateful week in politics will determine the shape of our state , the future character of British politics and how this country chooses to make the massive economic adjustments that lie ahead .
The debates and campaign should have measured up to the nature of these choices .
They did not .
A hesitant , cynical and concerned electorate is hedging its political bets .
On this weekend 's opinion poll evidence , we will wake up to a hung parliament on Friday , with the Conservatives the single biggest party but short of even 300 MPS .
On the other hand , a coalition of Liberal Democrat and Labour MPs , perhaps including the Welsh and Scottish Nationalists , will be able to command a majority if they can find a way to agree .
Politicians can connive in the old system .
Nick Clegg could permit a minority
Tory government to form because it has won the most seats and the highest share of the popular vote .
David Cameron may offer Clegg a few concessions to gain his consent , but he will go to the country again before the pain of his economic measures are felt and as soon as the Lib Dem surge fades .
He will want to win a proper mandate for a fully fledged Conservative government and then refine the first - past - the - post voting system , reduce the number of constituencies by 10 % but in so doing redraw their boundaries to be fairer to the Tories and disqualify Scottish and Welsh MPs from voting on English issues .
The state will become a Conservative fiefdom , with even local police forces directly run by Tory politicians in the name of " democratic accountability " .
The City of London will not be reformed .
Wealth will become ever more concentrated in fewer hands .
Scotland , Wales and many English regions will be devastated by swingeing public spending cuts – almost their sole economic prop for the last decade – and by ongoing de-industrialisation .
The management of an economy burdened by excessive private debt , fragile banks and a faltering economic recovery will be ideological .
The prison population will grow even faster than under Labour as populist social repression intensifies .
There will be some worthwhile improvements – the scrapping of ID cards and aspects of the Big Society programme which has been too quickly dismissed by liberal critics – but in the round Britain will become a meaner , less generous and more unequal society despite David Cameron 's declared intentions .
This will be Murdoch 's Britain , with the BBC to be cut back and Sky 's influence extended .
Government will be in thrall to the right of centre press .
The sale of our companies to the highest foreign bidder will accelerate .
Or there is a second choice .
Labour and the Lib Dems can form a time - limited coalition administration for two years with a negotiated programme of government .
There will be three great aims .
The first will be constitutional reform culminating in a referendum on introducing a proportional voting system and a promise to have a general election immediately afterwards .
The second will be root - and - branch reform of British finance and putting in place a British innovation ecosystem to support wealth and job generation .
And the third will be a deficit reduction programme that is managed not to damage recovery , an issue on which Gordon Brown is right .
Beyond those initiatives , the coalition could introduce the pupil premium to improve the conditions of disadvantaged working - class children .
It will build on the advances of the NHS .
It will not politicise the police service .
It will suspend the introduction of ID cards .
It will start building a less carbon - dependent civilisation .
Above all , it will usher in a world of pluralist politics , coalition government and deliver progressive ideas from a broader strand of opinion than just whatever coterie is around the leadership of the Labour party .
A growing number of the outgoing cabinet would like this to happen .
Lord Adonis , the transport secretary , has made the case in public .
But none of them has yet made the paradigm shift from old politics .
They think that Brown could remain prime minister , for example , arguing that he commands the majority of the MPs in the coalition ; any other outcome would be " unstable " .
There might be an equal number of cabinet seats for the Lib Dems , but Number 10 would remain in Labour control .
The proportional voting system put to the country at the referendum would be the pale version offered by Labour in its manifesto and nothing more radical .
They are desperate to avoid Labour coming third in the popular vote .
They claim a vote for a Lib Dem is to give the election to the Tories .
They want to sustain the Tory - Labour duopoly .
In the next five days , the Labour leadership has to transform its thinking .
It has to prepare itself for the most astonishing 12 hours in its history .
It must start by recognising that no era of new politics can be plausibly ushered in by Gordon Brown .
He will have lost the general election – losing more than 100 seats while the Tories win 70 or 80 and the Lib Dems 20 or 30 .
The country will not accept that having kicked him out he is miraculously back .
Only a monumentally unfair voting system will have given Labour three times the Lib Dems ' parliamentary representation .
Brown can not be part of the future .
Who will lead the coalition ?
Here , Labour must , in British terms , learn lessons in far - sightedness and generosity from people such as Mandela .
On Thursday evening , a group of senior Labour politicians from all wings of the party has to tell Brown to go and offer to deliver Labour to a Lib Dem - Labour coalition led by Clegg .
The deputy leader of the party , Harriet Harman , should immediately open negotiations with the Lib Dems over the programme for government while Labour hammers out who will lead it into the general election of spring 2012 .
Will Clegg accept ?
It is the best and possibly only opportunity his party will have to change the voting system .
To refuse would be to shy away from an historical opportunity .
Would the country accept ?
The two parties together will constitute more than 55 % of the popular vote and a majority in the House of Commons .
It was what the electorate voted for and there is deep wisdom in democracies .
To have anyone else leading the coalition would be illegitimate .
Will the markets worry about weak coalition government and sell the pound ?
Not if the new government is clear and fast in setting out which extra taxes it will raise and what spending it will cut , even if it decides to be measured about the timing of their introduction .
The near - insuperable obstacle is the Labour party .
It has been a beneficiary of the old political duopoly for a long time .
A moment of this type may be beyond it .
Some of the key figures will find it very hard to swallow such a bitter pill or even accept the case for more radical proportional representation .
After all , Labour will have more MPs .
Why is its leader not the prime minister ?
It will worry that Clegg will not make a reliable coalition partner etc , etc .
Labour pays lip service to pluralist politics and the " progressive consensus " , but when the chips are down it believes in its heart that it is the sole progressive party .
These are understandable reactions .
The Labour party , for all its recent history , is Britain 's agent - in - chief of change .
Our health service , our universities , our schools and the best parts of our welfare system bear its stamp .
It carries a willingness to challenge private monopoly power , class privilege , unearned status .
It exists to fight for ordinary and disadvantaged people .
But the lesson of the last 13 years , and the prospect for the next 13 , are inescapable .
The party needs allies , fresh energy and to find its courage again .
There are other values that count – liberty , individual conscience , respect for the community , wariness about too much state – that Labour does not hold dear in the same way as the Lib Dems .
It is this coalition of values and interests that must underpin a great , reforming , transitional , coalition government – and what I believe the country now needs and demands .
On Thursday , use your vote to get it .
If the Labour party even now could change the state and our politics , it would be the greatest achievement in its history .

After living the unvegan lifestyle in Chicago for the better part of a year , I am extremely ashamed to admit that I had never eaten at Kuma ’s Corner until just recently .
Located off the beaten path on Belmont Avenue near the corner of Belmont , California , and Elston , Kuma ’s Corner is not easily accessible to me by either walking or public transportation .
Further , there is a perpetual wait time of over two hours so in addition to knowing someone who has a car , you have to be willing to stake out the significant portion of a day in order to indulge in their renowned hamburgers .
As expected , the wait time at Kuma ’s Corner was about two - and - a - half hours on the Sunday afternoon that myself and two friends decided to go .
The second one sets foot in Kuma ’s , he is in for a largely unique experience .
Intentionally positioning itself as counterculture , Kuma ’s seemingly has a policy of not allowing one to be an employee unless he / she has several conspicuous tattoos .
Our friendly server had sleeves of tattoos on both arms and casually mentioned that the point in which she got her tattoos on her elbows were far and away the most painful moments of her life , easily surpassing the time she broke her back .
To go along with their tattooed staff , Kuma ’s plays very loud metal music .
Now , this unvegan characterizes himself of being tolerant of all forms of music , even dipping into the metal genre to enjoy bands like Tool and Iron Maiden .
However , those bands possess a melodic quality that the music at Kuma ’s did not on this particular day .
For the entire time we were there , the only metal we heard was the type with indistinguishable screaming and heavy power chords on the guitars .
None of the songs sounded particularly different from each other and , although unique , the music definitely detracted from the enjoyment of the overall experience .
Further perpetuating its counter culture , Kuma ’s had a list of rules on the wall , including , “ No we will not turn on ‘ the game . ’
Nor would we want to ” and “ We will never serve any Miller , Coors , or Bud Product .
Or Corona .
So do n’t even ask . ”
Also , there were strict rules against bitching about the wait time ( I ca n’t imagine why anyone would ever be guilty of breaking that rule ) .
After 2.5 hours characterized by intense hunger that was only exacerbated by the death metal and having to watch other customers voraciously gorge on their delectable - looking burgers , our turn finally came to be seated .
We were PUMPED .
When we opened the menu , we were greeted to a list of burgers named after metal bands such as Black Sabbath , Iron Maiden , and Metallica .
All of the burgers had a carefully thought out pattern of ingredients and all of them looked absolutely delicious .
I finally settled on the famous Kuma ’s burger which was a hamburger that came topped with bacon , cheddar , and a fried egg sandwiched between a pretzel bun with a side of waffle fries .
This was sure to be unvegan paradise .
After about 45 minutes more of waiting , the burger came and I was disgusted to see that , in addition to the described ingredients , it was topped with lettuce and tomato .
LUCKILY , the top half of the bun was not attached and the tomato was on top of the lettuce , ensuring that the tomato would not have the opportunity to tarnish the prized burger that I had waited over 9 months in theory and 3 hours in practice to try .
Disaster averted .
After adding some of their homemade spicy ketchup , I was ready to dig in .
When I took my first bite , the wait time and the death metal - induced headache were all but forgotten as I entered into a state of unvegan bliss .
The ingredients complemented each other perfectly as I immediately realized I was eating one of the best burgers of my life .
Three things especially distinguished the Kuma ’s burger from the typical hamburger .
First , the quality of the meat was outstanding .
Kuma ’s clearly went the extra mile in procuring the finest ground beef it could find .
Secondly , the fried egg was exquisite .
From this point forward I will be hard pressed to enjoy a burger to its fullest unvegan extent knowing that it could be made better if topped with a fried egg .
Finally , I had never before eaten a burger with a pretzel bun before but was highly impressed and left to wonder why it is an exception and not the norm .
All of the ingredients on my burger were carefully chosen for the utmost quality and complemented each other perfectly .
The fries were very good , but pretty standard for waffle fries and by no means extraordinary .
As I finished my 10 OZ burger around 4:00 pm , I knew that I would not be eating again for the rest of the day .
It was absolutely outstanding and without a doubt one of the 3 best burgers I have ever eaten in my life .
That being said , I do not know how often I will be making it back to Kuma ’s.
DMK Burger Bar and Rocks also make burgers topped with fried eggs .
While they are not QUITE as delicious as Kuma ’s , they are both within walking distance , do not have a 2.5 hour wait , and do not play music that gives me a splitting headache .
I will almost certainly be back but wish that Kuma ’s had better accessibility and ambiance to complement its delicious burgers .
Stephen Timms , the Labour MP and former minister who was responsible for guiding the Digital Economy Bill through Parliament , was stabbed today in his East Ham constituency .
The 54 - year - old is currently in hospital and a 21 - year - old woman is in police custody and being assessed by mental health specialists .
Timms was attacked at 3.20 pm this afternoon at his constituency surgery , police said .
His condition is not thought to be life - threatening .
Before going into politics , Timms worked for Logica and as a telecoms analyst for Ovum .
He was re-elected last week with a majority of almost 28,000 , up from about 21,000 . ®

Thanks for the tip Robert !
If you want to download songs tracks from video there ’s an easy way to do just that too , using an app that extracts the audio track from the video file in question .
I just went through customs immigration and all that jazz at the Bali / Denpasar Airport , had a burger and beer , and now I ’m waiting to get on the plane for Brisbane .
I ’ve spent six of the last 11 nights in Kuta , Bali , and the other five were spent on Gili Trawangan , the largest of the Gili Islands .
We arrived in Bali around 12:30 in the morning on October 31 .
We found a taxi right away that offered to take us to Kuta for a pretty cheap price , but the guy seemed kinda sketchy so at the last minute we grabbed our stuff from the cab and got the hell away from him .
Luckily Starbucks still had their lights on so we headed to our sanctuary .
When we got to the door , one of the workers told us that they were actually closed , but we told them we had to use their Wi-Fi to find a place to stay so of course they let us sit and figure some stuff out .
While we were in Starbucks , we met two guys from Germany who had just missed their flight to Singapore , so they were desperately trying to figure out a way to make all their connecting flights line up .
They were doing all this on their iPhone , so I let them borrow my computer while Nick checked out where we should stay .
Most of the Starbucks employees were done work , and they were going to make a beer run , and they asked us if we wanted any !!
Of course we said yes , and ten minutes later the Starbucks employee came back with a bag full of beer .
From there things got even better .
It was the end of the night , and food was expiring that day , so they grabbed all their extra food and brought it out for us to eat !!
To make it even funnier , every single Starbucks employee was smoking inside , right in front of signs that read “ We are passionate about our coffee .
Please no smoking . ”
Funny right ?
We eventually left Starbucks at around 2:30 and started walking in the direction we thought was Kuta .
We were going the complete wrong direction , but it did n’t really matter because after a couple minutes we decided to take a taxi .
When we got to Kuta we tried looking for a place to stay but everywhere was booked solid .
We ran into these two girls from Vancouver who took us to their hotel and luckily we found a room for the night .
The place ended up being really nice , but a little bit more money then we wanted to pay , so after two nights we switched to another hotel .
Once we woke up that first day it was Halloween morning .
In Singapore we met two English couples who were also coming to Bali , so we went to the beach in search of them .
After only about five minutes we found Ross , Kirsty , Mandy , Julian , and three of their friends from England .
We had agreed it was a great idea for us to dress up on Halloween , which turned out to be pretty damn hard when you ’re traveling around .
I originally planned to be The Phantom of the Opera , but we could n’t find any white face paint , so I ended up being Zorro , and I have to say , it did n’t turn out that bad .
On Halloween night we went to a bar called Sky Garden , and this place was legendary .
We paid 6 bucks each and we got unlimited Heineken Draft from 9 pm - Midnight .
Mmmmmmm .
The next morning we ran into two more English guys we had met in Thailand , Chris and Ben .
We told them about Sky Garden and they were in 100 % so we went there and did the same thing all over again .
When we got up the next morning we were in surprisingly good shape and tried our hand at surfing .
Unfortunately that did n’t last too long .
We got the boards for super cheap , but one of my fins ended up breaking which was annoying , so I had to head back early , which was n’t the biggest deal because in the hour I was surfing , I only caught about three waves .
The waves were way too big for me , I did n’t pick a big enough board , and it was the first time I ’ve ever surfed , so yeah , I kind of sucked .
That night we got talking with the English guys about stuff to do on Bali , and came up with the plan to leave for an island northeast of Bali called Gili Trawangan .
Gili Trawangan is one of three circular islands in a straight line off the coast of Lombok that are popular amongst backpackers for their laid back and relaxing atmosphere .
We stayed there for a total of 5 nights I think , and all the other English people we met came to the island as well .
At first the weather was pretty bad so we were getting kind of bored , but once the weather got better , the place was beautiful .
Just like most places , we did a snorkel tour around the neighbouring islands , but unlike all the other snorkel tours , this time we saw some pretty awesome sea turtles .
The five nights on Gili Trawangan went by really fast , and we still wanted to hang out in Kuta for a bit before flying to Brisbane , so we spent our last two nights hanging out with three girls from Vancouver and the two English guys .
It was n’t until we got back to Kuta that we realized how much we missed Gili Trawangan .
“ Gili T ” as we were calling it had no cars , no motorbikes , no one trying to sell you stuff , and no police .
If there weather holds up , it ’s a place where you can really just sit around for two weeks and let the time pass .
For such a quiet place , the nightlife was pretty awesome .
Every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday , the party would switch from bar to bar , so all the businesses can cash in on the action , it was pretty cool .
When we went back to Kuta we did the usual and went to Sky Garden for the Freeflow of Heineken before me and Chris helped out the house band with our vocals for the better part of the night .
Our 10 or 11 days in Kuta and on Gili T went by so fast it was ridiculous , and turned out to be two of the best weeks of the trip for me .
Now I ’m in the air heading for Australia ….cya !!
Nicolás no tiene padre .
Lo mataron hace un año .
Él lo vio .
Unos hombres encapuchados se bajaron de una camioneta y le dispararon cuatro tiros delante de él y de su hermana Julia , que no se dio cuenta de nada porque entonces apenas tenía seis meses , pero Nicolás sí se percató de todo .
A sus cinco años recién cumplidos , Nicolás vio a su padre desplomarse en la puerta de su casa , en medio de un charco de sangre , y a su madre llegar gritando su nombre desde la tienda de la esquina : " Nada más oír el primer disparo ya sabía que estaban matando a mi marido .
No me pregunte usted por qué " .
Nicolás se convirtió aquel día en uno de los 10.000 huérfanos de Ciudad Juárez .
Su padre , en uno de los 5.000 asesinados .
Su madre , en una más de los 200.000 juarenses que decidieron poner tierra de por medio desde que , hace tres años , comenzara esta guerra sin cuartel entre las autoridades y los carteles de la droga , todos contra todos , una refriega diaria que ya le ha costado a México más de 18.000 vidas y a Ciudad Juárez un horror diario , un desprestigio infinito .
Dos carteles de la droga utilizan a 450 pandillas para enfrentarse
Los agentes municipales han estado infiltrados por los ' narcos '
" Nunca pregunté a mi esposo en qué trabajaba " , dice la madre de Nicolás
En cuanto oscurece , las calles se quedan desiertas , como en toque de queda
Situada en medio del desierto de Chihuahua , en la línea que separa México de Estados Unidos , la antiguamente llamada Paso del Norte se convirtió a partir de los años ochenta en el símbolo del progreso .
Aquí fueron llegando , a razón de 100.000 por año , riadas de hombres y de mujeres jóvenes , sobre todo mujeres , atraídas por el trabajo seguro de las empresas manufactureras .
Alrededor de la ciudad azotada por el desierto - calor de día , frío de noche- , fueron surgiendo barrios levantados con cartón y latas , sin agua corriente ni saneamiento , sin asfalto ni luz ni escuelas , pero sí con niños , cada vez con más niños , hijos de padres demasiado jóvenes y demasiado ocupados .
Niños que , apenas podían sostenerse en pie , eran abandonados a su suerte durante jornadas enteras , atados en algunos casos a las patas de las camas hasta que sus madres regresaban de la maquiladora .
Hubo gente , como los sociólogos Hugo y Teresa Almada , que ya desde entonces reclamaron a los sucesivos Gobiernos que pusieran atención al problema , que utilizaran el dinero que corría a espuertas para construir guarderías , colegios , bibliotecas , canchas deportivas .
Nadie les hizo caso .
Corrían felices tiempos de abundancia y los narcotraficantes , que utilizaban la privilegiada situación geográfica de Juárez para surtir de marihuana y cocaína a los Estados Unidos , aún no habían sido convertidos en enemigos públicos .
Muy al contrario .
Se paseaban por la ciudad en sus lujosas camionetas del año , gozaban del favor de las prostitutas de lujo , de los cantantes de corridos y , por supuesto , de los políticos .
No necesitaban muchos sicarios para proteger sus cargamentos .
Para eso ya estaba la policía .
" Hubo un día " , cuenta el alcalde de Ciudad Juárez , José Reyes Ferriz , " que la Policía Federal pinchó el teléfono de un mando intermedio de la Policía Municipal porque se sospechaba que andaba en malos pasos .
Al poco , escucharon que un jefe de los narcos llamaba al mando policial y le ordenaba que fuese a una casa de la ciudad , detuviera a un sicario rival que allí se encontraba y se lo entregara en un centro comercial .
Los federales fueron al centro comercial y esperaron .
Efectivamente , al rato apareció una patrulla de los municipales e hicieron la entrega del sicario a la banda enemiga .
Los federales intentaron abortar la operación , pero la banda de narcos consiguió huir con el enemigo capturado .
A los dos días apareció muerto " .
La policía municipal estaba tan infiltrada por el narcotráfico que Reyes Ferriz no tuvo más remedio que llamar a la puerta del palacio de Los Pinos .
Le pidió al presidente Felipe Calderón , ya por entonces embarcado en su guerra contra el narcotráfico , que mandase al Ejército y a los federales para intentar contener la violencia .
Calderón accedió , en una decisión que tanto el presidente de la República como el alcalde de Ciudad Juárez aún consideran acertada , pero que en los últimos días ha sido cuestionada tanto por la secretaria de Seguridad Interna de Estados Unidos , Janet Napolitano , como por buena parte de la sociedad civil de Ciudad Juárez .
Hay quienes , como el médico Miguel García , recurren a los datos para intentar demostrar que los 11.000 uniformados que , entre policías y soldados , patrullan a diario la ciudad no sólo no han mejorado las cosas sino todo lo contrario .
" Desde 1996 a 2006 " , explica el doctor García , " el número de homicidios en esta ciudad se mantuvo estable .
Unos 18 asesinatos al mes .
Haga la cuenta : algo más de 200 al año .
En el 2007 , primer año del Gobierno de Calderón , la cifra se duplicó .
Pero en 2008 ya se contabilizaron 1.600 muertos .
En 2008 , la cifra ya superó los dos mil .
Y en los dos meses y medio que llevamos de 2010 ya han matado a más de 530 personas .
¿ Hasta qué cifra vamos a llegar para que Calderón reconozca que su guerra contra el narcotráfico es un fracaso ?
Lo que está pasando aquí ahora será recordado en el futuro como el holocausto mexicano " .
La conversación con el médico se produce a la hora de la cena en el restaurante del hotel Camino Real , que un día antes aparecía abarrotado por el despliegue de seguridad que necesitó Felipe Calderón para poder visitar Ciudad Juárez , pero que ahora aparece desierto .
El motivo es doble .
Por un lado , las visitas a la ciudad fronteriza se han reducido hasta el mínimo indispensable .
Antes de que Canadá y Estados Unidos aconsejaran a sus ciudadanos no visitar Juárez " salvo que sea estrictamente necesario " , ya los empresarios habían actuado por su cuenta , cambiando sus estancias en la ciudad por viajes relámpago : llegada en el vuelo de la mañana y huida en el avión de la tarde .
La situación de temor se agravó después de que , el pasado sábado y a plena luz del día , dos grupos de sicarios asesinaran a una pareja de norteamericanos y a un mexicano vinculados con el consulado de Estados Unidos en Ciudad Juárez .
El segundo motivo del vacío fantasmal que experimenta el hotel es la hora .
En cuanto oscurece , Juárez se queda desierta como si estuviese vigente un toque de queda .
De hecho , antes de llegar al postre , el doctor recibe no menos de cuatro llamadas de su esposa e hijas .
El motivo queda claro por las respuestas : " Sí , no preocuparos , estoy bien , voy enseguida ... " .
Ni el alcalde de Juárez ni el subsecretario de Seguridad Pública del Gobierno Federal están en absoluto de acuerdo con García .
Tanto José Reyes Ferriz como Monte Alejandro Rubido coinciden en que la actual situación de Ciudad Juárez es consecuencia de dos desgraciadas circunstancias que confluyeron en un mismo punto : la degradación del tejido social de Ciudad Juárez - aquellos niños abandonados por sus padres crecieron e hicieron de las pandillas sus nuevas familias - y la lucha de dos poderosos carteles de la droga por el control de la plaza .
" Juárez " , explica Alejandro Rubido , " siempre estuvo controlada por el cartel de Juárez , el cartel de los Carrillo , y ahora se está disputando la plaza con el cartel de Sinaloa , el cartel de El Chapo Guzmán .
Ambos carteles están utilizando a las más de 450 pandillas que hay en la ciudad y que giran alrededor de dos grandes grupos , Los Aztecas , que trabajan para los Carrillo , y los Artistas Asesinos , que trabajan para El Chapo Guzmán [ el mítico capo al que la revista Forbes lleva dos años situando entre los hombres más ricos del mundo ] .
" Al principio " , continúa el subsecretario de Seguridad Pública , " los utilizaban principalmente para que hicieran de narcomenudistas , pero ahora los emplean como sicarios .
Nos estamos dando cuenta de que los muertos y los detenidos son cada vez muchachos de menor edad " .
Pero , si ya han muerto 5.000 en tres años , ¿cuántos quedan ?
La respuesta del alcalde pone los pelos de punta : " En la cárcel tenemos a 1.200 elementos de Los Aztecas , pero calculamos que en la calle todavía quedan unos 2.000 .
De los Artistas Asesinos y Los Mexicles - que también trabajan para El Chapo - hay unos 200 en la cárcel y unos 1.200 en la calle .
Por eso es tan necesario que el Ejército y la Policía Federal se mantenga aquí y , al mismo tiempo , ir desarrollando las medidas sociales , de restauración del tejido social , que estamos poniendo en marcha con el Gobierno Federal " .
Nicolás ha recuperado la sonrisa que , según su madre , perdió durante una buena temporada .
Ahora juega con su hermana en su nueva casa de El Paso ( Texas ) .
Dos días después del asesinato , su madre decidió hacer las maletas y abandonar Ciudad Juárez .
Su casa se convirtió en una de las 60.000 que siguen vacías o se han convertido en refugio de los maleantes .
-¿Por qué mataron a su marido ?
- Ya le dije que no me preguntara .
Yo nunca quise saber .
Mi marido traía dinero casa .
Era bueno conmigo y con los críos .
Nunca le pregunté en qué trabajaba .
Pero una no es tonta , se imagina cosas .
Por eso le dije antes : cuando escuché los disparos , supe que eran para él .
— An act of vandalism renamed Pinecrest High School in Moore County .
Assistant Principal Herb Hanson said that someone broke and removed the " P , " " E " and " R " signs that spell out the school 's name on the front wall .
The remaining large , green letters spell out " Incest High School . "
Hanson said that Pinecrest High has a tradition and established guidelines for senior pranks , but this one went too far .
He said the missing letters will cost $ 100 each to replace .
The school is investigating the incident as an act of vandalism , Hanson said .
Approximately 2,200 students attend Pinecrest High , which is on Voit Gilmore Lane in Southern Pines .

Abstract
Recent studies have shown that Canada ’s Child Support Guidelines , adapted from the U.S. “ Wisconsin ” model , have serious negative incentive effects on marriage stability .
The source of this outcome is found in the design of the guidelines , which consistently transfer net wealth to the custodial parent .
This paper examines the details of Canada ’s guidelines , and then traces backwards to their source .
It argues that the guidelines are the logical implication of family policy based on feminist theories of the family .
The paper concludes that an institutional view of the family is a better model to base family law on .
Blizzard has had unprecedented success with virtual item sales on the release of the Celestial Steed – a special in - game mount for World of Warcraft that costs the princely sum of $ 25 , € 20 or £ 17 .
According to WOW.com ( via GamesIndustry.biz ) , a seven - hour queue of 140,000 people had formed within three hours of the mount ’s release last week .
That already represented revenue of $ 3.5 million – or more than a million dollars an hour – on sales of what is , essentially , just an art asset for the subscription game .

Three - year - old girl set to become world 's youngest tattoo artist
Most three - year - old girls are just getting to grips with felt pens , but Ruby Dickinson is taking her artistic tendencies a step further .
The toddler is set to become the world 's youngest tattoo artist after learning the trade from her father , Blane , who runs a tattoo parlour in Wales .
Mr Dickinson , 36 , is importing an ink gun from the U.S. that has been specially designed to be used by small hands .
Ruby Dickinson is set to become the world 's youngest tattoo artist after learning the trade from her father , Blane , who runs a tattoo parlour in Wales
Ruby will be getting the miniature tattoo kit for her fourth birthday in October .
Mr Dickinson told North Wales Pioneer : ' Ruby is well aware she is getting the kit , she cannot wait .
She wants to be a tattoo artist when she grows up .
' The aim is to get her to tattoo my leg with a birthday message for my 40th birthday . '
The toddler currently takes tattoo lessons after nursery as well as practising with a toy kit at her father 's shop .
Mr Dickinson hopes to beat Canadian Emilie Darrigade 's record of tattooing part of a butterfly on to her father 's arm when she was five .
Mr Dickinson , 36 , is importing an ink gun from the U.S. that has been specially designed to be used by small hands
According to her father , Ruby is nearly able to draw a complete version of her favourite design - a spider .
' I'm under no illusions that she 'll do a Van Gogh , after all she 's only three - and - a - half , ' Mr Dickinson told The Sun .
' But I 've got 70 per cent of my body covered in tattoos already and it'll only be the size of a 2 p piece , so I 'm not too worried she 'll make a mess of it . '
Mr Dickinson , who runs Inkaholics Anonymous at his home in Penmaenmawr , Conwy , added : ' It 'll be a proud and very special moment for me and for her .
' She really loves it and I 'm pleased I can teach her the skills . '
However , despite hoping Ruby will take up tattooing as a career , the toddler 's father is keen to let her make her own choices .
No ideology survives the collision with real - world politics perfectly intact .
General principles have to bend to accommodate the complexities of history , and justice is sometimes better served by compromise than by zealous intellectual consistency .
This was all that Rand Paul needed to admit , after his victory in Kentucky ’s Republican Senate primary , when NPR and Rachel Maddow asked about his views of the 1964 Civil Rights Act .
“ As a principled critic of federal power , ” he could have said , “ I oppose efforts to impose Washington ’s will on states and private institutions .
As a student of the history of segregation and slavery , however , I would have made an exception for the Civil Rights Act . ”
But Paul just could n’t help himself .
He had to play Hamlet , to hem and haw about the distinction between public and private discrimination , to insist on his sympathy for the civil rights movement while conspicuously avoiding saying that he would have voted for the bill that outlawed segregation .
By the weekend ( and under duress ) , he finally said it .
But the tap - dancing route he took to get there was offensive , tone deaf and politically crazy .

American Mensa has been holding its “ Mind Games ” competition each year since 1990 to select five new games from a group of about 50 or 60 submitted by manufacturers .
Those five winners earn the right to display the Mensa Select Seal .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
The games are selected by a group of Mensans who love to play board games .
They spend a whole weekend learning , playing and evaluating the games submitted , ranking their favorites by the end of the weekend .
Each participant has 30 games assigned to them to rate and vote on .
They are also able to play any of the other games if they so choose .
Mind Games is a crazy - fun weekend of nothing but game playing with people who truly love board games .
I just got back Sunday night from attending this year ’s Mind Games in San Diego , California .
Yes , I ’m sleep deprived .
Yes , I had a great time .
Yes , I plan on buying a bunch of new games .
Yes , I want to go every year , but no , I ca n’t afford it .
Next year ’s Mind Games competition will be held in Albany , New York .
Past winners of the Mensa Select Seal include the familiar ( Taboo , Scattergories , Trivial Pursuit : Genus Edition , Set , Magic : The Gathering , Rush Hour , Apples to Apples , Fluxx , Blokus , TransAmerica , 10 Days in Africa ) and the less familiar ( Traverse , Quiddler , Metro , Curses ! , The Legend of Landlock , Tiki Topple ) .
While there were plenty of so - so games at the competition , the ones that won this year were solid choices .
Without further ado , here are this year ’s Mensa Select winners , in no particular order .
Word on the Street by Out of the Box Games
After playing Word on the Street , I knew it would be one of the winners .
It ’s a fun group game , but it also requires you to think .
To play , make two teams .
On each team ’s turn , they are assigned a category and need to quickly come up with a word fitting that category that uses as many letters that are still on the board as possible .
Those letters are then pulled closer to their side of the board , or off the edge .
The first team that gets at least eight tiles of their side of the board wins .
Dizios by MindWare
I also knew Dizios would do well , since it ’s great for families and has a simple concept .
The idea is to match up the colors along the edges of the swirly colored tiles and gain as many points as possible by building on tiles that have as many dots as possible on them .
The player with the most points at the end wins .
Yikerz ! by Wiggles 3D
This game comes complete with its own sound effects !
You place special magnets on triangular pieces of mouse - pad - like material , trying to stay out of the magnetic field of the other magnets .
The object is to get rid of all of your magnets first , but beware !
If you cause magnets to stick together , or if you push any off the edge , you have to pick those up .
The noise the magnets make when they click together adds to the fun !
Anomia by Anomia Press
This seemingly simple card game will make you laugh and drive you crazy .
You ’ll also find yourself saying , “ Uh.. ” a lot .
It ’s a fast paced game of pattern matching and thinking of words that fit categories .
Fun for many ages and group sizes .
Forbidden Island by Gamewright
This cooperative game was often compared to Pandemic at Mind Games .
It was n’t on my voting sheet and I regret not making time to play it .
Here is the game ’s description from Gamewright ’s website :
Dare to discover Forbidden Island !
Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do - or - die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise .
Your team will have to work together and make some pulse - pounding maneuvers , as the island will sink beneath every step !
Race to collect the treasures and make a triumphant escape before you are swallowed into the watery abyss !
I was pleasantly surprised with Yikerz ! and Anomia winning , though .
Those were two games that I really enjoyed , but they seemed like underdogs .
I ’m pleased that other people enjoyed them as much as I did !
Regardless of which games win , all games played at Mind Games receive very helpful and often detailed feedback from the game - playing folk .
This can help improve the game for future editions or give ideas for future games .
Several of the games submitted contain wonderful pieces and materials , but the directions are lacking .
Helpful suggestions from Mind Games participants can result in a new version of the rules and a very successful game .
Though it was n’t a winner , the game I managed to snag at the end - of - event game giveaway was Zenith , a fun , family - friendly strategy game from MindWare .
Some other games that I really enjoyed but that did n’t win include Simpatico , Fish Stix , AnimaLogic , Letter Roll , Q- bitz , 7 Ate 9 and Rory ’s Story Cubes .
Note to Game Publishers :
You ca n’t earn the Mensa Select Seal if you do n’t submit games .
Please consider submitting .
Even if you do n’t win , you still get invaluable feedback from people who know and love games , and hundreds of game playing folk will know about your game .
Some will buy it when they get home .
Some will take a copy home with them .
It ’s a great marketing opportunity !
I know this has been a topic here and there for awhile now , but with a little digging , I found a few pieces that have n’t popped up in recent posts .
Concept and level artists have been posting some of their work from the Ghostbusters video game , some of which never made it into the final game .
First up are concept levels by Stuart “ Kuran ” Ng .
He posted 8 on his DeviantArt page , but he originally posted 4 of them and 5 others online last Summer .
Besides some levels that never came to be , there are a couple that did make it into the game , including his Graveyard multiplayer level .
I ’m gathering all 16 images here .
( click for full - size images )
You can see a lot of what ultimately made it into the game in those images , some more than others .
More interesting is that some of Kuren ’s concepts made it into the game , or at least , it made it into 3D game form , if not the final game release .
Herod Gilani did multiplayer levels for ThreeWave and once the game came out , like Stuart , he posted some of his work online – some of it is absolutely amazing , but sadly did n’t make it into the final game .
One level is of the Slime - filled , underground railway , which harkens back to some of Kuren ’s art .
I ’ve left out the images on his site from the final game , though they are , as I ’ve said , interesting to compare to Kuren ’s concept work , and should be checked out .
The ones posted are of levels built for potential multiplayer use ;
Herod also posted some of his texture work , which included this game monster ( do n’t have my game - guide with me – ca n’t remember his name , but I did beat the hell out of a lot of them last Friday . )
For those interested , GBNews.com has a great article on all the things we saw online that never made it into the final game .
Some , but not all , of the art above is featured , but more interesting are the collection of YouTube videos which feature things like the panicked crowd AI that got entirely axed , or the cut - scenes that never made the cut .
Es gibt wieder ein neues Datenleck beim Social - Network SchülerVZ .
SchülerVZ ist mit rund fünf Millionen Mitgliedern Marktführer im deutschsprachigen Raum , ein hoher Prozentsatz unserer Schüler ist dort Mitglied und veröffentlicht dort seine / ihre Verlieben und sonstige Informationen .
Uns wurden 1,6 Millionen aktuelle Datensätze von dort aktiven Schülern zugeschickt , das sind rund 30 % aller Nutzerprofile aus dem Social - Network .
Der Fall reiht sich in die von uns im vergangenen Herbst aufgedeckten Datenlecks ein , die SchülerVZ betrafen und damals für großes Aufsehen sorgten .
SchülerVZ hat sich in den vergangenen Monaten bemüht , das verlorene Vertrauen zurück zu gewinnen und mehr in den Datenschutz investiert .
Dazu gab es ein TÜV - Prüfzeichen für Datensicherheit und Funktionalität .
Damit gewinnt man zwar Vergleichstests in Verbraucherschutz - Magazinen und der Computer - Bild , die Sicherheit der Schüler - Daten steht aber immer noch in Frage , wie der neue Fall zeigt .
Eine weitere Parallele zu den Datenlecks im Herbst ist die , dass unser Informant in zwei Mails in den vergangenen Wochen versucht hat , Kontakt mit der VZ - Gruppe aufzunehmen .
Auf beide Kontaktversuche erhielt er keine Antwort und wendete sich dann an uns , um eine Beseitigung der Sicherheitslücken zu beschleunigen .
Wie war das massenhafte Auslesen von Schüler - Profilen möglich , wo doch SchülerVZ seit dem Herbst zahlreiche Maßnahmen getroffen hat , die das verhinden sollten ?
Eine von SchülerVZ nach den Datenlecks getroffene Maßnahme war die Begrenzung der Profilabrufe .
Dies sorgt aber nur gefühlt für mehr Sicherheit , da man gleichzeitig von zahlreichen Accounts parallel Profile abrufen kann , um die Inhalte in einer gemeinsamen Datenbank zu speichern .
Im Herbst hat man auch reCaptchas eingeführt , um ein massenhaftes maschinelles Auslesen extrem zu erschweren .
Diese reCaptchas hat man aber wieder rausgenommen , vermutlich weil sich viele Nutzer dadurch gestört fühlten .
Eine weitere Maßnahme war ein besserer Schutz bei Suchabfragen .
Die uns zugeschickten Daten wurde aber über eine andere Methode gesammelt : Die meisten Nutzer sind in Gruppen angemeldet .
Man kann Basisinformationen von Profilen über eine Gruppenmitgliedschaft abrufen , auch wenn die Profile auf privat gestellt sind .
Die Basisinformationen enthalten Name , Schule , Schul - ID - Nummer und Link zum Bild .
Nachdem diese Methode ( nahezu ) ausgereizt war , wurden dann weitere Profilen per „ Freundesliste “ mit einem zweiten Crawler abgegrast .
Viele Schüler nutzen aber nicht die scharfen Datenschutzeinstellungen , die ihre Profile auf privat stellen und deren Daten sind dann alle abgreifbar und man kann sie speichern .
Dazu gehören die zusätzlichen Informationen Alter , Geschlecht , Klasse , Hobbys , Beziehungsstatus , politische Einstellung , Lieblingsfach , - musik , - filme , - bücher , wie lange man im SchülerVZ aktiv ist und individuelle Selbstbeschreibungstexte .
Doppelungen bei Mitgliedschaften in mehreren Gruppen kann man aussortieren , wenn erstmal alle Daten heruntergeladen sind .
In der Regel gibt es nur einen Schüler mit dem gleichen Namen an einer bestimmten Schule .
Wo ist jetzt das Problem – Facebook ist viel schlimmer beim Datenschutz ?
Es handelt sich überwiegend um Daten von minderjährigen Schülern , die sich über ihr Handeln und die Konsequenzen oft nicht bewusst sind .
Daten von minderjährigen Schülern sollten daher besonderen Schutz genießen und gegen massenhaftes maschinelles Auslesen gesichert sein .
Mit den gesammelten Daten sind Invers - Suchen möglich , die so im System zum Schutz der Privatsphäre von Nutzern nicht funktionieren .
Die VZ - Gruppe bemüht sich zwar , gegenüber der US - Konkurrenz wie Facebook durch mehr Engagement in Datenschutzfragen zu punkten , was im Vergleich zu einem besseren Verbraucherschutz führt .
Und dieses Bemühen muss man auch mal loben .
Aber offensichtlich wurde noch nicht genug in die Sicherheit der Daten von Schülern investiert .
Das ist mittlerweile der vierte uns bekannter Fall von massenhaften Auslesen von Schüler - Daten bei SchülerVZ innerhalb der vergangenen Monate .
Man kann davon ausgehen , dass diese vier Fälle nur die Spitze des Eisberges sind und zahlreiche Datenbanken mit diesen sensiblen Daten existieren könnten .
Wir haben SchülerVZ gestern über den Datensatz und die Sicherheitslücken informiert .
Und anschließend unsere Daten gelöscht .
Unser Informant hat uns dies auch zugesagt .
Update :
Als Hintergrund zum aktuellen Datenleck bei SchülerVZ haben wir ein Interview mit Florian Strankowski von der Leuphana - Universität Lüneburg gemacht , der die Sicherheitslücken entdeckt hat .
Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx - Job very well done
Updated : May 14 , 2010
By now , you have read dozens of reviews of Lucid Lynx , mostly praising the latest Ubuntu release and somewhat recycling the screenshots .
So you might be asking , why should you read yet another ?
Well , you should .
First , it 's Dedoimedo we 're talking here , the most objective and thorough distro reviewer on Planet Earth .
Second , I 'll be showing you such a long and detailed review that wo n't leave you a dot of doubt about what Lucid Lynx can offer .
I will show you how the distribution behaves on both 32 - bit and 64 - bit systems , including very old and very new hardware .
I will have Lucid installed three times , once on T42 running with an ATI card and twice on my brand - newish LG RD510 laptop with Nvidia 9600 GS 512MB card , once on the internal disk and once on a USB - attached external disk .
We 'll also take Lucid on a ride on T61 machine with an Intel onboard card .
Like I said , no one offer so many goodies as I do .
Of course , I 'll show you everything , from Wireless and Bluetooth to Multimedia , Samba sharing , laptop modes ( suspend & hibernate ) , stability , performance , a few words about new themes and styling , dual - boot and complex multi- boot configurations , applications choice , Ubuntu Software Center , Ubuntu One Store , Web camera , third - party and proprietary software , hardware drivers , games , boot times , and much more .
So please , if you 're ready , dive in .
A short philosophical introduction
A common commercial stunt is to release a somewhat flawed product once in a while , take flak for it and then shine through with your next one .
That 's what Microsoft did , although not intentionally , with Vista .
Similarly , this may be also be the case with Karmic , which was good , but not better than Jaunty .
Which makes Lucid all the more anticipated .
Lucid has so much at stake .
It 's upping the ante after a relatively disappointing last autumn release .
It 's being good and stable , since 10.04 is the LTS release that will make or break Ubuntu reputation for the next three years .
And there 's always Windows and Mac to take into account , the arch - enemies so to speak .
Now that I 've teased your mind , let us begin .
Live session experience
Nouveau is ...
An interesting concept , but I 'm not sure what to think .
I tried Lucid on my three laptops , one after another .
On the two non-Nvidia laptops , the new Nouveau driver offered me the Ubuntu splash in high resolution .
On RD510 with a proper Nvidia card , the open - source driver would not let me reach the desktop one out of three times .
After trying the low - graphics mode , I was able to boot into the live session .
My advice to anyone considering Nouveau as a choice on machines with Nvidia cards - do n't .
You did not waste your money on a proper card to be trying 2D stuff .
You want the official , proprietary drivers .
We 'll talk more about graphics drivers for all three brands later .
Now , the live desktop is ...
Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx sports the dark Ambiance theme as the default , with aubergine wallpaper .
The theme looks somewhat Mac - like , including the top panel icons and the system fonts .
But this is far from being a bad thing .
In fact , the untrained eye might get confused and believe you 're using Mac.
Since Apple is the king of visual when it comes to operating systems , this is a great achievement .
I did talk a bit about the new theme in my Color of stability article , but since , I 've grown really fond of it and even backported the theme to my Jaunty and Karmic installations .
Lucid radiates [ sic ] a rich , expensive feel and using the live desktop is a pleasure .
In the true spirit of the change , the window buttons are moved to the left , although you can easily change this , as I 've shown you in the Color article .
In fact , I do prefer the traditional placement of buttons on the right .
Wireless & Bluetooth
Worked without an issue on all three machines .
Really , there 's nothing more to add .
Web camera
Worked great , no issues .
Visual style & social impact
Let 's talk a little more about the theme changes and the branding .
It 's obvious that Lucid aims for the consumer market , trying to goad Windows and Mac users into the fold of free software , with just a bit of proprietary stuff .
To this end , the desktop has been redesigned , but additional elements have been integrated to make Lucid modern and spicy .
In today 's world , modern and spicy means you have a Twitter account and you have lots of imaginary friends on Facebook and whatnot .
Pretty much the right third of the top panel is reserved to mail , chat and blogging utilities , all neatly integrated into the system .
You can even use a temporary broadcast account to see who 's in your e-vicinity .
In general , the functionality combines Empathy multi-protocol instant messaging software , Evolution mail client and Gwibber micro-blogging software , blended into the desktop .
If you have friends and like to be online , chatting or tweeting , then you have the whole array of tools ready for you .
I have no friends , so it 's out of the question .
Ubuntu One
You 're also entitled to a free 2GB Ubuntu One account , which is similar to Dropbox , as I 've shown you in my PCLinuxOS 2010 review just a week ago .
This application will create a folder in your home directory and sync files within with a remote server , offering you with combined backup slash mobility .
There 's even a Firefox plugin available .
Branding
Applications have been modified to blend better into the overall desktop theme .
For example , here 's Firefox with the Ubuntu start page .
The emphasis is on soft grays with a tad orange .
Looks quite decent , somewhat a - la Moblin scheme .
Samba sharing
No issues here , either .
And that 's all .
I left the exploration of multimedia , laptop modes and the choice of applications for after the installation .
But I was seriously pleased .
Bottom line :
If not for the Nouveau problem , the live session would have been perfect .
Other than that , everything worked on all machines .
There were no application crashes or kernel crashes .
9/10 .
Time to install the distribution .
Installations
Before I decided I would commit Lucid to internal hard disk on RD510 I tried installing the distribution to an external disk first .
Recently , I bought a 640 GB WD Passport and had it partitioned and formatted with GParted , as a part of my grand plan to extend the basic four boots to a total of ten boots !
Each disk has its own GRUB , so it 's just a matter of setting the right boot priority in BIOS .
If the external disk is plugged in , its array of distros will boot ; if it 's disconnected , we 're back to three Jauntys and one openSUSE on the internal hard disk .
Ah , I 'll be telling you my WD Passport and 10 - boot saga in a separate story .
Now , I already had Karmic and Fedora installed on the external disk , working well , so I decided to add Lucid to the array .
For the first installation , I left the internal disk alone , except the swap .
Here 's the armada of disks and partitions at my disposal :
The installation remains simple as always .
Little has changed , except some visual polish and branding .
In just a few quick steps , you 'll be done .
While installing , Ubuntu offers a pleasant slideshow that tells you , in a nutshell , what the distribution offers .
After installing on the external disk and making sure everything worked , I installed locally as well , both on RD510 and T42 .
Ubuntu 10.04 uses GRUB 2 version 1.98 - ubuntu5 , so it 's no longer beta , plus it has a smarter way of finding and enumerating hard disks .
All in all , it worked smoothly .
I also tried the GRUB legacy and GRUB 2 mix , as I 've shown in my GRUB 2 tutorial .
Again , I 'm pleased to report that there were no issues with the setup .
Bottom line :
All installations went well , without any problems .
Even the non-standard installation to an external disk with its own GRUB while using the local swap .
There were no issues whatsoever .
10/10 .
Having fun with Lucid
Time to explore the distribution .
Desktop styling and decoration
I spent the first few minutes arranging the buttons and tweaking the looks to my liking .
Nothing major , I mainly switched to the light theme , but customized it with the dark windows border , which makes most sense to me .
A few screenshots from several installations :
Oh , it 's so much Mac !
But there was nothing major to be done .
Lucid looks right .
The fonts are the right size and shape , the icons are smart and consistent , theme looks good .
Lean back and enjoy .
Graphic drivers
Nvidia
For me , this is one of the most important aspects of desktop usage , full 3D hardware acceleration using Nvidia drivers .
Like previous versions of Ubuntu , there were no issues .
The Restricted Drivers functionality offered the right drivers , even while in the live session , to be honest .
I installed and rebooted .
Jolly good .
The repository offers a fairly new version of the driver , 195.xx version .
I will show you a proper game demo a little later .
ATI & Intel
On T42 , the boot splash was rendered in higher resolution , but that 's hardly of any consequence .
Into the desktop , the 2D driver offers a decent experience .
I will still have to check Compiz and proper 3D stuff on the ATI card , but the sequence to get it done is similar to what I did in this tutorial .
On T61 , Ubuntu froze when booting into the live session , but when I used the nomodeset option , everything worked fine .
Overall , things churned rather well , except the 2D graphic drivers built into the kernel are a bit of annoyance .
Which is why it 's always best to go with Nvidia and use proprietary drivers .
P.S. I 'll be having another installation of Lucid on T60 p , 32 - bit with 2GB RAM and Intel card , so I 'll report my findings in a separate article , including additional experience with Intel graphics card , boot performance and whatnot .
Multimedia
Ubuntu does not ship with proprietary software installed , but it is offered for you when you need it .
One example is the Restricted Drivers , which we 've just seen .
Another is the MP3 playback in Totem .
You will also find MP3 codecs and the Flash Player in the repositories , via Ubuntu Software Center , which too has been revamped to look more professional .
But more about USC later .
Indeed , the installation of codecs and Flash was flawless , on both 32 - bit and 64 - bit machines , without enabling any third - party repositories like Medibuntu or any other hacks .
This is a neat bonus for people who do not feel like hunting for basics like media codecs .
Buy Music
Speaking of multimedia and music in particular , Ubuntu Lucid adds another interesting function to Rhythmbox media player .
This is a wise move and could bring music - conscious people to Ubuntu , as well as provide revenue .
Furthermore , it seems like a good way of weaning Windows users off iTunes and giving them a decent alternative .
The Ubuntu One Store is available in the Rhythmbox menu .
Currently , the collection of available music is not that large , but it 's decent and growing by the day .
This is somewhat similar to inline shopping in Songbird .
I find this quite useful and convenient .
You can buy entire albums or individual songs , for as little as 99 cents .
Very reasonable prices and you do n't have to buy entire albums if you fancy only one or two tracks .
Furthermore , you have secure shopping function built in your desktop .
No need to go anywhere or worry about scams .
You use your Ubuntu One account for authentication and checkout .
It 's a bit like PayPal , inside your music player .
Fast , secure , useful , and well priced .
Music industry , hear , hear , this is how it 's done !
Not by threatening users ; by providing them with instant and cheap gratification for their taste in music .
Furthermore , you also have free music alternatives , Magnatune and Jamendo , which offer literally years of free music tracks .
Ubuntu Software Center
As I 've mentioned earlier , the Software Center has been improved .
It looks better , smarter , more polished , easier to use .
USC looks fun to use and you feel like exploring it .
Another change is the separation of software by more classy white - collar terms .
Instead of terms free or proprietary , which can confuse most people , you have synergistic use of words like provided by Canonical and provided by Canonical partners , which although artsy - fartsy corporate in nature , they do inspire confidence with normal users .
Installations are a one - click deal .
You still have the good ole Synaptic , if you want it .
Performance & Stability
Lucid is fast .
It 's a beautiful surprise .
Compared to previous version of Ubuntu , it 's snappier .
Even the old , aged , abused T42 sprung to life , with applications opening instantly .
Adorned with some moderate - level desktop effects , shading and transparency of the 2D driver , Lucid breezed on the five - year - old hardware .
Memory usage goes between 300MB on a 32 - bit machine to 400MB on a 64 - bit machine , comparable to most modern distributions and way below anything Windows can offer .
Boot times
I already managed 18 seconds on Jaunty on a 5400rpm disk on the slow end of the disk , so any further boost does not seem important to me .
In fact , I still have to do a proper benchmarking on my high - end machines .
But on T42 , I already did that and can say that Lucid makes a big change .
This machine , born in 2004 or 2005 , with a 1.8GHz single processor , 1.5GB RAM and a very slow disk , boots into desktop in just 27 seconds , this including the meager 19 MB / sec I /O operations .
This is less than half it used to take previously !
And much faster than most other distributions .
Imagine what happens on a modern machine .
I 'll report back once I make some additional benchmarks , but I have no doubt I 'll beat the 10 - second record Ubuntu team set .
I repeat , less than 30 seconds to a fully functional modern desktop on 2004 - 2005 laptop hardware .
This is a really phenomenal achievement .
But that 's hardly the end of it .
Now , a teaser screenshot from another machine .
More boot time results :
That 's 15 seconds in the first image .
Nice , eh ?
Which machine model , you may be asking .
Well , you 'll see that in a separate article , dedicated to boot times performance with Lucid .
For now , just an appetizer .
Laptop modes ( sleep & hibernate )
I must say , a perfect 100 % compatibility with all my hardware models .
Applications choice
Overall , Lucid has a simple , decent , balanced choice of programs available .
The only thing really missing is GIMP , which has been removed from the default collection , but it 's available in the repositories .
OpenOffice is at version 3.2 , rebranded with Oracle stamp .
An interesting addition is PiTiVi video editing software .
Wondering what that red car thingie is ?
Wait another week and you 'll discover .
Games
There 's the usual innocent collection of simple arcade and board games available .
But if you 're a hardcore gamer like myself , then you will want something more serious , perhaps Enemy Territory Quake Wars , a phenomenal and beautiful first person shooter which I reviewed a few short weeks ago .
Nvidia card , full detail , works like magic .
Other stuff
Login screen customization
Lucid lets you configure the login menu easily , using a simple wizard .
You can change the time , the re-login delay , as well as additional features .
Micro-problems
Just one tiny little issue that I 've encountered , hardly a fleck that does not spoil the overall impression or the experience .
Icon selection border
This is a tiny issue that will persist until the first reboot .
The last clicked icon will remain marked in a reddish border .
This is gone after you restart your machine once or log out of and in to your session .
And that would be all .
Bottom line : Post - install experience , superb .
9.95/10 .
Conclusion
I 'm utterly pleased with Lucid Lynx .
It is a professional , commercial - grade Linux distribution on par with anything Microsoft and Apple can offer , except it comes for free , a huge bonus .
Lucid Lynx has been done with style , grace and care , and it shows in every little detail .
Hardware support and compatibility are phenomenal .
Performance has been improved compared to previous version and there are no stability issues .
Furthermore , Ubuntu 10.04 sports beautiful new looks that make it a daring rival to Mac 's poshness and leaves the Windows baby - blue sickness a light year behind .
Lucid Lynx offers three years of support for desktop , which means that you can install now and think about upgrading only in 2013 .
This is extremely important for more conservative users , like myself .
This is by far the best Ubuntu release since I started taking interest in the distribution , way back with Dapper in June 2006 .
While you do not get everything out of the box as some other distributions like Mint or PCLinuxOS offer , the overall quality and integration surpasses the slight inconvenience of the extra few minutes of downloads and configurations .
And you still have a better , faster , more secure system than other market rivals , for absolute zero cost .
My RD510 laptop currently sports three Jaunty installations .
I will soon be phasing them out and have them replaced with Lucid .
The long wait for perfect Ubuntu has been worth waiting .
Lucid Lynx is that Ubuntu .
Cheers .

BBC News , Buenos Aires
While Britain has been involved in a number of conflicts since the Falklands War 28 years ago , it remains Argentina 's only war in more than 100 years .
Its defeat - and the issue of the island 's sovereignty - continues to dominate on both a national and a personal level .
A war could have been avoided
Constantino Davidoff , scrap dealer Constantino Davidoff played a small but significant role in a small but significant war .
At the end of March 1982 , a party of Argentine scrap metal merchants landed on the distant and inhospitable South Georgia island - 900 km ( 600 miles ) east of the Falkland Islands .
He was the owner of a company contracted to dismantle a whaling station on the British - owned island .
It was a simple business deal that promised to make him a lot of money - but ended up provoking a war and ruining his life .
I meet Mr Davidoff at his small , neat apartment in the working class Avellaneda neighbourhood , just south of Buenos Aires .
He still deals in scrap metal from a garage below his home .
He is in his late 60s now , wearing a cream - coloured safari suit and dangling a large gold cross around his neck .
His walls are covered in maps of the South Atlantic and framed letters of thanks from Argentine veterans ' groups he has spoken to about his experience .
" I lost everything - my house , my planes , my boats , my company and eventually , my family .
I simply could n't defend my interests after the war .
I was very sick , " Mr Davidoff tells me .
Military invasion
He has been trying to sue the British government for $ 200 m ( £ 132 m ) , but the Argentine courts , he explains , are slow and only told him a couple of years ago that he would have to pursue his claim through the international courts .
He told me he had done everything he could to avoid problems with the British authorities .
At the end of 1981 , he visited the British ambassador in Buenos Aires , spoke to the Falkland Island authorities , signed a deal worth $ 270,000 ( £ 180,000 ) with the Scottish owners of the derelict whaling station and then went back to the British ambassador to ask if there was anything else he might need to do .
His claims are confirmed by the 1983 Franks Committee report carried out by the British authorities into the events leading up to the conflict .
But some in London thought the scrap metal workers were the advance party of an invasion of South Georgia island , by the then ruthless Argentine military government .
It was reported that they had planted the Argentine flag and were singing their national anthem .
British Royal Marines were despatched from the Falkland Islands to find out .
The 39 scrap metal workers were detained .
Argentina sent its troops to rescue them and , while they were about it , invaded the Falkland Islands .
War declared Margaret Thatcher , the British Prime Minister at the time , had no hesitation in dispatching a task force to the South Atlantic , and the two previously friendly countries fought a war in which more than 900 people died before Argentina surrendered on 14 June .
Britain won the military battle but is losing the diplomatic war ...
When the truth is known , then we 'll have justice
Constantino Davidoff
" There were no military among my workers .
And they did n't sing the national anthem or plant a flag .
This was a business deal .
I 'd have been crazy to ruin it .
All it needed was a phone call from the British embassy and I would have withdrawn my workers .
I 'd have cancelled the contract , " Mr Davidoff says .
" A war could have been avoided . "
Mr Davidoff insists that Britain started the war by sending a military contingent to deal with a civilian matter .
He says though , that , despite his legal claim , he does n't bear any ill - will towards the British people .
But like every Argentine I 've met in the more than four years that I 've lived here , and the 20 or so that I 've been visiting , he firmly believes that " Las Malvinas son Argentinas " - the Malvinas are Argentine .
Constant theme Britain is now drilling for oil in the waters near the islands .
But it is not the oil or the fishing rights that upset most Argentines - it is a somewhat idealistic sense of justice .
Argentina has been claiming the Falkland islands , or Las Islas Malvinas as they call them , since 1833 .
More than 700 Argentines were killed fighting for Las Malvinas - the Falklands
They are marked as Argentine territory in every school atlas .
Streets and ice - cream parlours are named after them and there are monuments to the fallen all over the country .
For Argentina , it is a constant theme .
For most in Britain , the Falklands War is an historical footnote .
And London will not negotiate while the 2,000 or so islanders say they want to remain British .
" Britain won the military battle but is losing the diplomatic war , " explains Mr Davidoff .
In February , Latin American and Caribbean nations voted unanimously to back Argentina 's claim , while Buenos Aires has renewed its complaint to the United Nations .
The scrap metal merchant believes that in his lifetime , he will see Argentina 's sky - blue and white flag flying over the islands , perhaps in a power - sharing deal with Britain .
" Argentina has so much to give the islands .
The war did n't end when the white flag went up , " says Constantino Davidoff , leafing through the documents on his dining room table .
" I believe in truth and justice .
When the truth is known , then we 'll have justice . "

Indiana Republican Rep. Mark Souder is resigning from Congress after telling colleagues he had an affair with a female aide .
Souder : ' I am so shamed '
Rep. Mark Souder ( R - Ind. ) is resigning from Congress after telling colleagues he had an affair with a female aide .
" I sinned against God , my wife and my family by having a mutual relationship with a part - time member of my staff , " Souder said in a statement Tuesday .
" I am so shamed to have hurt those I love . "
Advertisement
Souder said his resignation – which will take effect Friday — is " the best decision for my family , the people of northeast Indiana and our country . "
" In the poisonous environment of Washington , D.C. , any personal failing is seized upon , often twisted , for political gain , ” Souder said .
“ I am resigning rather than put my family through that painful , drawn - out process . "
“ Diane and my family were more than willing to stand here with me .
We are a committed family .
But the error is mine , and I should bear the responsibility . ”
Sounder and his wife have three adult children .
Souder ’s staff informed Minority Leader John Boehner ’s staff of the affair on Sunday .
Boehner and Souder spoke on Monday , and Boehner told the Indiana Republican he should resign , according to GOP sources .
“ Boehner has been perfectly clear that he will hold our members to the highest ethical standards , ” said Michael Steel , Boehner 's spokesman .
The news about Souder comes just two months after former Rep. Eric Massa ( D - N.Y. ) stepped down after revelations that he was under investigation by the House ethics committee over allegations that he sexually harassed male staffers .
And Sen. John Ensign ( R - Nev. ) faces criminal and Senate Ethics Committee investigations over his affair with Cindy Hampton , wife of a former top Ensign aide .
Ensign announced the affair last June but has refused calls to leave office .
Souder was an aide to former Sen. Dan Coats ( R - Ind . ) before being elected to Congress .
Coats is running this year to return to the Senate .
A hard - line conservative , Souder recently survived a tough GOP primary in the Hoosier State , edging two opponents who held him under 50 percent .
Souder ’s Republican rivals criticized Souder over his support for the Troubled Asset Relief Program and Cash for Clunkers programs .
Souder was forced to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign funds to beat back the challenge
The Democratic challenger for Souder 's seat is expected to be Dr. Tom Hayhurst , a former Fort Wayne councilman whom Souder beat back in 2006 .
Baby Einstein was founded on the basis of bringing close ties between parents and their little ones .
Founded by Julie Clark , she wanted these products to contain a consistent exploration and bonding time with child and parents .
The multitude of products sold ( based on sounds , language , objects , signs , etc ) were created from the point of view of the infant / toddler , setting this company apart as a rapid hit .
Walls
We will want to start with painting our walls so we can get the basic foundations out of the way before tackling the nightstand and wall stencils .
Now , we are going to paint the top part 2/3 down the wall 100 Acre Morning .
For those who might ask , “ how can I achieve that straight line ? ”
The easiest way to achieve our line is by using a laser level .
Before marking our walls with any painter ’s tape , make sure the wall is dust free .
If we do not take that measure , we run the risk of having our tape pealing off the wall while painting .
There are a number of various kinds of painter ’s tapes to use , but we recommend using Duck blue painter ’s tape .
Another helpful tip , purchase a high quality brush because if we skimp out and decide on that $ 0.79 brush , our paint brushes ’ bristles will be coming out left and right .
It will make our job more stressful as we will be spending all our time removing the bristles from our paint job .
When painting along the painter ’s tape , have the brush going parallel , so we do not run the risk of paint seepage beneath the tape .
Now , after applying the 100 Acre Morning , let it completely dry .
Time could range depending on weather ( temperature and humidity ) .
We suggest removing the painter ’s tape when the paint is slightly tacky .
Be careful when removing it .
Do not rip it off because it could pull the paint off the wall .
Touching up that area could be an issue since we desire a clean paint line .
Once the wall is completely dry , mask off the top section of the line so we can paint the bottom wall Skipping Stone .
Let the lower part of the wall dry before we prepare to do our tree stencil .
Align the bottom of the tree with the dividing paint line .
Paint the tree a Haycorn Brown .
Paint the leaves the English Meadow .
Use Fairy Godmother for our bird .
The small and large grass tuft stencils are colored in English Meadow then overlaid with Fairy Godmother .
Randomly place the grass tuft stencil across the “ grass line ” ( or paint line ) .
If we so choose , we can drop a 1/3 of the way down the paint line to add the stencil shape across the wall .
Assembled Tree Stencil ( PDF ) and Grass Stencil ( PDF )
Furniture
For the nightstand , we will want to take out the drawers so we can paint them separately then put them back together when the different pieces are bone dry .
The nightstand will be painted Fluff and Stuff .
The front of the drawers , we are going to use Fairy Godmother .
For the alphabet stencils , we can purchase them from any arts and crafts store .
Use a large alphabet stencil for the first letter of the baby ’s name , which will be used on the second drawer , too .
For the large letter and the “ is for ” will be painted with Pluto .
The infant ’s name will be etched in the Haycorn Brown .
Now , if the child ’s name is longer than five words , we can easily swap up the stencils to be used on the dresser instead of the nightstand .
The same colors will be used as before .
The dresser will be done in Fluff and Stuff as the drawers in Fairy Godmother .
From the tree stencil ( pdf available under the nightstand ) , we will paint our branch with Haycorn Brown .
We will be adding the leaves to the dresser with our English Meadow .
Our small bird will be painted in a Pluto .
On the bottom drawer , we will add a few tufts of grass in English Meadow and 100 Acre Morning .
Ceiling
Perhaps , we do have a skylight in our room .
If we do , we will be painting the inner walls Fairy Godmother .
If we have any wooden planks in the room , we will dress them up with the Haycorn Brown .
Now , if we want to paint our ceiling to tie it in a cohesive manner , we will use these colors as a general guide .
The Haycorn Brown will be used in sections to break the colors as we will be alternating paint sections on the ceiling in Baby Bee Yellow and Fluff and Stuff .
We can create simple beams ( by using moldings ) like a coffered ceiling ( minus the cross beams ) which will provide depth and a nice contrast in the room .
Having vaulted ceilings , this effect will add accents and create visual interest in the room .
Remember , we do not want to over do it in the room especially if it is small .
It will clash with our design .
The design is simple and we want to retain that design element .
So , if we are working with a small room use smaller moldings just to add that dimension .
Keep that in mind while we decorate our room .
* Tips : If you want easy clean up , try using a latex paint .
It is good for beginning painters and usually is priced cheaper than oil base .
Clean up is a real breeze with only soap and water to the brush .
Unlike oil , it typically covers in one coat .
Now , if you want durability and resistant to wear and tear , oil is a good choice .
It is normally more expensive , sometimes double the price .
If your child has a whim to scribble on the walls , it tends to clean up nicely .
Oil paints can require special brushes , and you will have to use paint thinner to clean the brushes .
Keep in mind , removing oil based paints stains can be more difficult than with latex .
This room is an excellent for a newborn entering into the world of Baby Einstein .
You will share the wonders of what Baby Einstein has to offer as well as incorporating a light and airy Baby Einstein inspired room design .
Enjoy adding personality to the room for your growing infant

The Hart Memorial Trophy is presented annually " to the player adjudged to be the most valuable to his team . "
The winner is selected in a poll by the Professional Hockey Writers ' Association in the 30 NHL cities at the end of the regular season .
The winner of the trophy will be announced at the 2010 NHL Awards , to be held in Las Vegas on June 23 .
The ceremony will be broadcast live from the Pearl Concert Theater inside the Palms Hotel Las Vegas on VERSUS in the United States and CBC in Canada .
Here is a closer look at the finalists : Crosby the playmaker became Crosby the shooter in his fifth NHL season , taking a career - high 298 shots ( fifth - most in the League ) and scoring a career - best 51 goals , one of the few statistical highlights he had yet to achieve .
Crosby earned a share of the Maurice " Rocket " Richard Trophy as the League 's goal - scoring leader , splitting the honor with Steven Stamkos of Tampa Bay .
Crosby led the Penguins and finished second in the NHL scoring race with 109 points , the fourth time in his five seasons he's hit the 100 - point mark .
The litany of Crosby achievements in 2009 - 10 is impressive : *
In the second game of the season , Oct. 3 , he became the sixth - fastest player in NHL history to reach 400 career points , reaching the mark with an assist against the Islanders in his 292nd game . *
On April 8 , he earned his 500th career point , becoming the third - youngest player to reach the mark at 22 years , 244 days ( Wayne Gretzky , 21 years , 52 days ; Mario Lemieux , 22 , years , 172 days ) .*
Crosby led the NHL with three hat tricks , becoming the first Penguin to accomplish the feat since Alexei Kovalev in 2001 - 02 . *
He tied a single - game career high with 6 points ( 1 goal , 5 assists ) Jan. 19 against the Islanders , and he recorded a season - long nine - game point streak from Feb .
12 - March 14 , posting 13 points ( 6 goals , 7 assists ) during the span . *
Crosby led the League with 8 shootout goals and an 80 - percent success rate
It was n't all about scoring with Crosby .
He ranked 11th in the League with a 55.9 - percent faceoff winning percentage and led the NHL with 1,001 faceoff wins , 137 more than second - place Mikko Koivu of Minnesota ( 864 ) .
This is Crosby 's second Hart nomination , and he won the honor in 2006 - 07 .
Other Penguins to capture the Hart are Jaromir Jagr ( 1998 - 99 ) and Mario Lemieux ( 1987 - 88 , 1992-93 , 1995 -96 ) .
Evgeni Malkin placed second in voting for the trophy in 2007 - 08 .
Ovechkin is the two - time defending Hart Trophy winner and made a strong case to retain the honor this season .
Despite tying for second overall in scoring , Ovechkin led the NHL in points per game ( 1.51 ) and goals per game ( 0.69 ) .
He also tied for sixth in assists ( 59 ) and was sixth in power - play points ( 36 ) .
Ovechkin led the League in shots on goal ( 368 ) , even - strength goals ( 37 ) and goals on the road ( 24 ) , and placed second in the League in plus / minus with a plus - 45 , trailing only teammate Jeff Schultz ( plus - 50 ) .
Ovechkin's game also includes a physicality often lacking among the top scorers -- he ranked 29th in the League with 185 hits .
None of the players who finished ahead of him placed in the top 67 scorers in the NHL .
The Capitals were 40 - 8 - 8 when Ovechkin recorded a point and 28 - 3 - 4 when he scored a goal .
He scored his first career penalty - shot goal Jan. 17 against the Flyers , and posted a five - game goal streak from Jan. 31 - Feb.
7 , Washington 's longest of the season .
He joined Wayne Gretzky and Mike Bossy as the only players with four 50 - goal seasons in their first five years in the League , and joined Gretzky , Mario Lemieux , Peter Stastny , Dale Hawerchuk and Sidney Crosby as the only players with four 100 - point seasons in their first five years .
Ovechkin also established himself as a team leader .
On Jan. 5 , when he was appointed team captain , the Capitals were trailing by five points in the Eastern Conference race .
After Ovechkin began wearing the " C , " they went 30 - 4 - 7 and won the conference by 18 points .
The only other Washington Capitals players to finish in the top five in Hart Trophy voting are Olaf Kolzig ( 1999 - 2000 ) and Rod Langway ( 1982-83 , 1983 -84 , 1984 -85 ) .
This is his first career Hart nomination , and it comes on the heels of him winning the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL 's regular - season scoring leader with 112 points .
He had 29 goals and a League - leading 83 assists in 82 games , the fifth - straight season Sedin has n't missed a game .
Sedin became the first player in Vancouver 's 40 - year history to win the Art Ross , and he broke the franchise single - season high in points , passing Pavel Bure ( 110 in 1992 -93 ) .
Sedin also became the Canucks ' all - time leader in assists and now has 434 in nine seasons .
Sedin's 1.37 points per game average was second in the NHL to Ovechkin ( 1.51 ) .
He recorded two 4 - point games and 12 3 - point games this season .
Sedin also placed eighth in the NHL in plus / minus ( plus - 35 ) , and ninth in shooting percentage , scoring his 29 goals on 166 shots ( 17.5 percent ) .
Sedin posted a 10 - game point streak from Dec. 22 - Jan. 11 ( 20 points ) and a nine - game streak from Dec. 2 - Dec. 18 ( 16 points ) .
He also had two seven - game assist streaks and two six - game assist streaks .
On Dec. 12 against Minnesota , Sedin became the fifth player in Canucks history to accumulate 500 career points .
He passed Thomas Gradin to become the highest - scoring center and fourth - leading scorer in franchise history when he recorded his 551st career point with an assist March 13 against Ottawa .
He was the NHL's First Star for December ( 25 points in 15 games ) , Second Star for January ( 25 points in 13 games ) and Third Star for March ( 24 points in 15 games ) Sedin also dispelled notions that he could not score without linemate and twin brother Daniel playing on his wing .
With Daniel out for 19 games due to injury , Henrik had 10 goals and 19 points .
Sedin is bidding to become the first Canuck to win the Hart .
Roberto Luongo placed second in 2006 - 07 , Markus Naslund was second in 2002 - 03 and fifth in 2003 - 04 and 2001 - 02 , Todd Bertuzzi was fifth in 2002 - 03 , and Kirk McLean was fourth in 1991 - 92 .

Part three of our review of manifestos for the election takes a look at the Conservative 's offerings .
By far the most concerning item in the manifesto is the Conservative policy on state pensions .
At present men have to work five years longer than women to get a pennons despite the fact that they 've put in more hours at work on average and thus contributed far more in taxes on average .
On top of this , male life expectancy is rather poor in the UK ( a fact which even the manifesto even touches on ) and as a result your average woman can expect to receive some £ 81,000 in pension payments in her life , compared with £ 55,000 for a man .
Such is the unfairness of this situation we even have excellent groups such as PARITY campaigning for pension 's equality and even Labour finally agreed to end this sexism one day far into the future .
So what 's the Conservative policy here ?
Are they going to equalise retirements ages as soon as possible and live up to their promise of " change " ?
Well actually , the manifesto promises change , but change that makes the problem even worse !
They propose raising the retirement age to 66 in 2016 , but only for men .
Women will continue to be able to retire at 60 right up until 2020 .
Thus we 'll have a six year difference in retirement ages instead of the present five and £ 49,000 paid to men compared to £ 81,000 for women .
By my calculations the total sum the Tories will be denying men over the four years is a staggering nine billion pounds .
Further still , David Cameron suggests the money is going directly to women so that they all get a full pension , I do n't think I 've ever seen a more sexist idea .
Obviously such a policy instantly rules anyone interested in equality out of voting for the Tories , which is perhaps a shame given that its proposals do contain a few positives .
The first thing of note is the more incisive language used in the document .
There 's no sexist terminology anywhere to be found .
For example the two party manifestos I 've reviewed so far focus on the trafficking of women for sex , whereas Conservatives address " people trafficking " which is far more appropriate given forced labour is a massively larger problem .
As most people know , the issue of women trafficked for purposes of prostitution has been blown out of all proportion by Labour .
The Conservative 's plans in eduction also appear quite reasonable from an equality perspective .
They recognise how broken and the current system is , not to mention how devalued qualifications have now become and appreciate the need to focus on core subjects such a maths and science .
They also promise more challenging activities for especially gifted pupils , as well as help fro the least able .
The Conservative perhaps do n't ' realise but this is in fact a gender , given that boys dominate both extremes of the intelligence spectrum .
More significantly , they specifically mention the issue of false allegations against teachers and promise to protect staff .
Further help from the falsely accused can be found in the section on crime , with the Conservatives promising to remove innocent people from the government DNA database and instead replace them with convicted criminals .
Other positives include numerous polices from helping those in the armed services , most notably policies helping them after leaving , and also support for married couples thus helping to remove the current financial incentives for divorcing .
Finally there 's a commitment to shared maternity leave , which is certainty preferable to Labour 's 4 weeks for fathers and 52 for mothers .
However , overall the document is something of a disappointment .
Whilst you fell the party has their heart in the right place , the generally feeling you get from the manifesto is that while the Conservatives mostly understand what 's important , they really do n't seem to quite have the right solutions yet and still seem out of touch .
The polices on marriage are commendable for example , but you get the feeling the Conservatives just want to push the clock back to a different era .
The party recognises more needs to be done in terms of contact after separation even recognising that we have " some of the worst rates of family breakdown in the world " , yet there 's no actual commitment to shared parenting .
Yes they mention false accusations , but why restrict such polices to the teaching profession when the issue can ruin anyone 's life regardless of their profession ?
The problem is n't schools in this instance , it 's society as a whole and the lack of punishment and prosecution of the crime .
Similarly there are also concerns with the Conservative 's " Big Society " theme .
Concerns about government bureaucracy , waste and interference are sound , but the Conservative approach also brings concerns .
For example they want to see charities proving public services , but in some areas that 's already the case to some extent .
Take domestic violence for example , do we really want to hand even more power to gender feminist organisations such as Women 's Aid and Refuge so they can continue to deny help to male vicitms and pretend most of them are making it up ?
In conclusion , it 's a decent enough document for the most part , but the pensions policy is so horrific it essentially cancels everything else out .
It shows us the traditional Conservative way of hurting men is still alive and well .
Whereas the Labour party hates men due to it 's gender feminist influence , Conservatives harm men through chivalry .
The pensions policy shows they expect men to work even harder and longer than women for less reward .
It sends out the message that men are an expendable resource to exploit , rather than people deserving of equal treatment and you have to fear that such an attitude will find it 's way into other areas of policy .
It 's all very well coming up with decent education and civil liberties polices , but no one is going to take your seriously if your idea of pensions reform is to ring - fence women 's income whilst his taking £ 9 billion from men to fund it .

A 13 - year - old Yemeni girl who was forced into marriage died five days after her wedding when she suffered a rupture in her sex organs and hemorrhaging , a local rights organisation says .
Ilham Mahdi al Assi died last Friday in a hospital in Yemen 's Hajja province , the Shaqaeq Arab Forum for Human Rights said , quoting a medical report .
She was married the previous Monday in a traditional arrangement known as a " swap marriage " , in which the brother of the bride also married the sister of the groom , it said .
" The child Ilham has died as a martyr due to the abuse of children 's lives in Yemen , " the non-governmental organisation said .
Her death was a " flagrant example " of the results of opposing the ban on child marriage in Yemen , which was leading to " killing child females " , it said .
The marriage of young girls is widespread in Yemen , which has a strong tribal structure .
The death of a 12 - year - old girl in childbirth in September illustrated the case of the country 's " brides of death " , many of whom were married off even before puberty .
Controversy heightened in Yemen recently over a law banning child marriage in the impoverished country through setting a minimum age of 17 for women and 18 for men .
Thousands of conservative women demonstrated outside parliament last month , answering a call by Islamist parties opposing the law .
A lesser number of women rallied at the same venue a few days later in support of the law , the implementation of which was blocked pending a request by a group of politicians for a review .

Writer - Director Andrew Niccol ( Gattaca ) is in negotiations with new Regency to pick up his new script I ’m Mortal .
According to Heat Vision , the film , which Niccol will also direct , “ is set in the not - too - distant future where the aging gene has been switched off .
To avoid overpopulation , time has become the currency and the way people pay for luxuries and necessities .
The rich can live forever , while the rest try to negotiate for their immortality .
The protagonist is a poor young man who comes into a fortune of time , though too late to help his mother from dying .
He ends up on the run from a corrupt police force known as “ time keepers . ”
Because time is the commodity , parents in the film can end up looking as young as their children .
Hit the jump for my thoughts on the premise as well a refresher on Niccol ’s other projects .
I think Niccol has come up with some really thoughtful sci-fi ideas in the past ( he also wrote The Truman Show ) , but I could n’t help but think of two things : 1 ) this sounds like an idea Karl Pilkington of The Ricky Gervais Show would have ; and 2 ) the South Park episode where Cartman is dying and the doctor says he needs , “ His time : he ’s running out of it–he needs … more time . ”
But I have faith Niccol can pull it off because I love Gattaca , The Truman Show is a film still referenced because of its concept , and I ’m one of the few people who likes Lord of War even though it ’s not one of his sci - fi movies .
However , I ’m Mortal may not be Niccol ’s next film .
He ’s also signed on to write and direct an adaptation of Stephanie Meyer ’s ( the author of the Twilight books ) upcoming novel The Host , which is about “ a not - so - distant future * in which well - meaning alien parasites called “ Souls ” have arrived on Earth and taken hold of what ’s left of the human race .
We also reported in February of last year that he was making a movie called The Cross starring Orlando Bloom , Vincent Cassel , and Olga Kurylenko , which also takes place in the near future and is about a man ( Bloom ) who ’s trying to cross a mysterious border and another man ( Cassel ) who ’s trying to stop him .
* Waiting for the movie that is in the “ somewhat distant but not too distant because I do n’t want to travel that far ” - future .
To view this movie without sound , is to make love without a toilet .

The Israeli Embassy reopened in Wellington today , after an eight - year absence from New Zealand .
The embassy closed in 2002 for financial reasons , and the Canberra - based ambassador was accredited to New Zealand .
Plans to reopen the embassy were first announced last May , with the new ambassador - designate , Shemi Tzur , named in November .
The embassy opened its new doors on The Terrace in Wellington 's CBD today .
Its location was not made public until after the opening , when contact details were posted on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 's website .
Israeli officials had been looking for a new site for the embassy in Wellington for some time , but told 3 News last month they had failed to find a building with security to protect against the threat of attack .
Mr Tzur arrived in Wellington earlier this month .
Mr Tzur would need to present credentials from the Israeli president to New Zealand 's Governor - General before he officially became the ambassador .
The ceremony , involving a traditional Maori challenge and a military guard of honour , would take place at Government House in Wellington on May 7 .
Mr Tzur had participated in Middle East peace talks in the 1990s , and had held diplomatic posts in South Africa , Turkey , Australia , Fiji and Uzbekistan .
He had previously been the Israeli ambassador to Cyprus , Finland and Estonia .
A new group , No Israeli Embassy in Wellington ( NIEW ) , said earlier this month it would protest outside the new embassy .
" Wherever the embassy goes , it 'll be a noisy neighbourhood .
We intend to have a frequent presence and make our objections known , " spokesman Alastair Reith said .
NIEW was protesting the treatment of Palestinians by the Israeli government , including bulldozing houses and building Israeli settlements on the West Bank , Mr Reith said .
They were also protesting the theft and forgery of foreign passports by Israeli spies .
Fake British , Irish , French , German and Australian passports were believed to have been used by Mossad agents to enter and leave Dubai to kill Hamas military commander Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
Relations between Israel and New Zealand chilled after two reported Mossad agents , Eli Cara , 50 , and Uriel Kelman , 31 , were caught and jailed for trying to illegally obtain New Zealand passports in 2004 .
A third suspected Mossad agent was a former Israeli diplomat based in Europe , Zev William Barkan , 37 , who stole the identity of a tetraplegic Aucklander to fraudulently obtain his passport .
Police also sought a fourth person .
Helen Clark , who was prime minister at the time , said there was no doubt the men were Mossad operatives and suspended high - level diplomatic relations for more than a year until Israel apologised in 2005 .

It Gets Weirder :
A notebook was found at the scene .
The notes inside translate to :
16:30 be at the agreed place .
18:30 swallow capsules , after effect protect metals wait for the mask sign
Well , they swallowed " capsules , " so obviously that 's what killed them , right ?
The problem is the note seems to imply they were waiting for something to happen after the capsules took effect , which means if they were poison , the two guys did n't know they were .
Also , the men had a coupon to return the water bottle when they were finished with whatever they were doing , which also seems to imply they did n't plan on dying on that hill .

Toxicology tests could not be taken due to the victims ' organs not being properly preserved ( they were apparently left in storage too long , but we like to think the investigators took the idea of heart volleyball and ran with it ) .
So , what in the hell convinced them to go out to a hill , strap on radiation protection and swallow some strange capsules ?
What effect were they waiting for ?
What were the masks protecting them from ?
Was there some third party who convinced them to do all of this , saying the pills would , what , make them travel back in time ?
Or give them super powers ?
Was it all part of some 60s Brazillian version of Punk'd ?

Most people read something they do n’t like about consumerism or social reality and immediately dismiss it so they can continue living in fantasyland .
When these same people have convinced themselves that they are actually doing good for society by living in this manner , questioning them becomes a mortal sin and worthy of shouting things like ‘ racist ’ and ‘ fascist ’ instead of having an open intellectual discussion about what we take for granted in life .
While I typically do n’t like to play devil ’s advocate with people , recently there was a case where I could n’t resist .
One individual I know questions what I write and what I send him to read on occasion , indicating it ’s more about fear than the reality I profess .
So I decided to take him up on it : was he afraid of what I was sending him , projecting that fear onto me ?
And could I successfully question his lifestyle choices to get my point across where it hits home ?
The conversation went something like this : I sent him a recent article from this site .
Within two minutes , he told me it was “ all bullshit ” .
I told him he had n’t read it yet and dismissed it anyway ; he told me everything I write and read is about fear .
So I took him up on it .
What am I afraid of ?
To paraphrase :
Me :
The article is about how technology is used in contexts that may not make the most of our bright minds .
Do you not agree with that idea ?
Friend : I do my own thing …
Me : Your own thing involves buying Macs , stereo equipment , and hoping the assets you ’ve built during your life will yield enough income on their own so you do n’t have to work much .
Accurate ?
Friend : Sure , but I also make good consumer choices .
I have n’t eaten much outside a Whole Foods in years [ note : yes , he said this ] , I keep to myself , and I recycle .
Me : But you still consume .
No matter how much you recycle or how much organic food you eat , you ’re not doing much to change anything .
You ’re just consuming .
And now you ’re all but admitting that you ’re happy to do it .
Are you saying there ’s nothing more noble about your life than living like a monkey in a lab ?
HDTV and all ?
Friend :
Of course not .
Why do you think I want to advance my education by taking full time graduate courses ?
When I get out , I do n’t want to use the degree in a typical fashion ; I want to help people … people in the third world ; work for a charitable organization ; the disenfranchised here at home .
Me :
So you admit that you do n’t do much but consume , and to feel better about that , you ’re going to try helping the disenfranchised … ?
You could instead try to live the change you want to see in the world , so to speak .
Unless that change is to have more people end up like you live now .
Let ’s face it , there is n’t much noble about that .
Friend : I ’ll work for a government organization ; they help people .
What ’s wrong with this country is people like you who do n’t want to help anyone .
Me : I think people like me – people who work full time , pay taxes , and take care of a family – are happy to help other people with volunteer hours , charitable donations from the more wealthy among us if they choose to partake in those activities .
When you say government organizations , people like me end up with their hair standing on their neck because we ’re absolutely horrified of how government typically tries to “ help ” people .
We did n’t really come to a conclusion , but there ’s nothing wrong with that – arguing for the sake of doing so in a well - tempered manner can yield great knowledge about the people you know .
What ’s difficult is arguing with them to begin with , because “ going there ” – trying to find out people ’s true motives and what they want – is something few want to discuss .
If you do get around to that , it gets emotional quickly and people begin speaking in generalities to take the focus of the discussion off of them .
Most people feel when one digs into issues of motivation , that they are being judged or accused of something .
This defensive attitude is typical of people who ca n’t back up their actions ( or inaction ) with ideas or purpose .
Floating along aimlessly , consuming , and then claiming one ’s life will be useful in the form of “ helping people ” is all too typical of people with no real set of values or goals .
A more noble approach may be to , for example , strengthen one ’s own community and help people who need it and are deserving closer to home .
Just because we live in the developed world does not mean that , by default , materialism can keep us happy and our aim should be to spread that to as many others as possible .

Some games are played for fun , some are played for power , but this game is played for ultimate stakes .
In the underground world of ultimate poker , only one person walks out a winner , but win or lose , sometimes winning just is n't enough .
The bitter cup of defeat was tasted by Labour 's senior ranks when they made their way to the shadow cabinet room in the House of Commons .
Some of them had to ask for directions .
Not so David Miliband .
He could remember the way .
That did n't make the destination any more pleasant for the man who had just ceased to be foreign secretary .
" I 'd last been in that corridor six weeks before the 1997 general election and we were on the march .
It 's a very depressing room .
You know then , you 're out .
It reeks of the absence of power .
Just reeks of it .
And there are n't enough seats around the table for everyone .
That hit hard . "
Then he strikes a more upbeat note for Labour after the party 's second - worst defeat since 1918 : " What 's interesting is that it was n't a funeral at the shadow cabinet meeting .
It was a group of people determined to fight back . "
Miliband was the first to declare that he wanted to head that fightback and became the early bookies ' favourite , not always a good omen , to win the contest to be Labour 's next leader .
There has been a paradoxical cheerfulness in the party 's depleted ranks of MPs .
He finds it explicable : " The polls had us third for a significant part of the election campaign .
That 's a near - death experience .
If you 're in a car crash and you think it 's going to do for you , but actually break your leg , a bit of euphoria is understandable .
We 've got to be clear that now is not a time for euphoria . "
In southern England outside London , Labour has shrunk to 12 seats : " It was a bad defeat . "
The scale of the party 's reverse will really be driven home , he thinks , when the Commons meets this week and Labour MPs find themselves greatly outnumbered by the coalition composed of Tories and Lib Dems .
Miliband soon dials up more reasons to be cheerful .
He is an innately optimistic character as well as a clever one , and a man who needs to persuade his party not to despair .
" Our party activists and our voters are amazing people .
In the midst of this barrage of money and media , they stuck with us .
This party is not walking into the history books .
It 's determined to be a 21st - century party .
The fight and the determination and the resilience of the party members , supporters and voters is a great thing .
Also there 's energy because we 've 260 MPs .
That 's a 1992 level of MPs , not a 1983 level . "
The " coalition of contradictions " gives Labour both a responsibility and an opportunity to " forge a progressive alliance within the Labour party of all shades of progressive opinion " .
But he is not among those in his party who complacently assume that they only have to sit back and wait for the Con - Libs to fall apart .
" We underestimate this coalition at our peril .
The Tories have always been about power .
Clegg has revealed that actually he 's about power as well .
After decades of moral sanctimony from the Liberal Democrats , we can now be absolutely clear that when push comes to shove they 're happy to drop child poverty and the job guarantee .
" But the determination they 've both shown is something we underestimate at our peril .
Because there 's no inevitability about the pendulum swinging .
And we are going to have to be very canny about how we position ourselves .
The electorate are n't going to be studying us carefully in this period but they 're going to notice how we behave .
And if we go back to yah - boo politics we 'll make a big error .
" We 've got to be ready for it to fall and we 've got to be ready for it to go long .
It 's very , very important that we have a fighting opposition , not fighting with ourselves but fighting the government where appropriate .
And that we 're an alternative government .
Whoever is elected is going to have to be a credible prime minister . "
That is a strong strand of his pitch for the leadership : as the most senior former cabinet minister in the running , he will give Labour the most authoritative voice .
Before the party can be renewed , it must make an accurate assessment of why it has just lost : " This was a change election and we were not the party of change .
I said in my conference speech last September that ' future ' is the most important word in politics and we did not convince our fellow citizens that we were the party of the future . "
Some blame him and other senior Labour figures for not replacing a very unpopular leader .
The " bottler " label was first , if not really fairly , hung around Miliband 's neck when he did not challenge Gordon Brown in 2007 .
" I was n't ready , " he says , and goes on to defend his subsequent reluctance to try to unseat Brown .
Some members of the last cabinet believe voter aversion to Brown cost Labour as many as 40 seats .
Miliband does not try to dispute that , but he argues it would be a major mistake to ascribe the scale of the defeat entirely to the failings of one man .
" I think anyone who believes that the result was just because of the leadership is kidding themselves .
Gordon spoke very movingly about discovering his own strengths and his own frailties .
But anyone who tells you that all we 've got to do is change the leader and then everything will be fine is wrong . "
Labour failed to win a fourth term because " we all said we needed to renew but we did n't sufficiently .
People felt we were late to the game on issues like political reform .
Antisocial behaviour – we lost focus on that .
Immigration , late to the game with the Australian points system .
Social care , late to the game .
" We were too timid on the role of government in the economy .
We were too slow to see that climate change was not an environmental issue .
It was an economic , security , foreign policy issue .
" We got told that political reform was a middle - class issue and we basically stopped .
We did the freedom of information , human rights act , devolution of Scotland and Wales , London .
But we basically got frightened off .
It was at best half a political revolution .
Maybe a third .
We should have done the House of Lords , for goodness ' sake . "
Many of those failings he ascribes to New Labour being a product of the party 's " searing experiences " in the 1980s which prevented it from being bolder either about challenging the status quo or changing how politics is done : " New Labour was a reaction to the 1980s but it was trapped by the 1980s .
Anyone who thinks that the future is about re-creating New Labour is wrong .
I think we 've got to use this period to decisively break with that .
What I 'm interested in is Next Labour . "
It will not be escaped quite that easily .
He rose as a protege of Blair ; two of his competitors for the leadership were special advisers to Brown .
Miliband is emphatic that this does not mean the wars of the TB - GB era are fated to be replayed by a new generation .
" The whole thing about Blairites and Brownites is just wrong and gone and over because the policy agenda has changed fundamentally . "
He prickles a little when we suggest it is a weakness that the contest is between apparatchiks of the Blair - Brown era .
" David Miliband , Ed Miliband , Ed Balls , Jon Cruddas , Andy Burnham … we 're our own people .
We 're going to treat the electorate as adults and we should be treated as adults . "
He claims to be relaxed that his younger brother has entered the fray to turn this into the first leadership contest involving siblings : " Family is more important than politics .
He 's very talented .
But I love him .
We 're not going to put that love at risk . "
They were close as children , he says believably , but not competitive , he claims less plausibly .
If Ed wins , " of course " David will happily serve under his younger brother .
He does not much like the suggestion that Ed is more accomplished at displaying the common touch : " People have to make their own judgment about the two of us .
It 's better not to talk about it .
It 's better just to do it . "
It is on this subject that the normally fluent former foreign secretary is at his most closed down .
Do they disagree on things ?
" Of course we do .
We 're not twins .
We 're not clones . "
But on what they disagree he will not say .
He expects their mother , a staunch Labour member , to avoid choosing : " She 's not an abstaining type , but I think she 'll be abstaining this time . "
It will not , though , be a case of Labour being offered any leader it likes as long as he 's called Miliband .
Ed Balls is taking " soundings " before deciding to run .
The Miliband brothers certainly love each other a lot more than either of them do the former children 's secretary .
When we suggest they can gang up on that rival , he chooses to laugh rather to deny it .
Another highly likely contender is Cruddas who performed very well in the last deputy leadership contest .
Aware that some on the left , where Cruddas is popular , regard Miliband with suspicion , he says : " He 's taught me a lot , Jon Cruddas .
He 's been talking about housing for a long time .
He 's been talking about community organising for a long time .
He 's fought the BNP .
I think uniting different talents is an important job .
Because it 's not ideologically riven , this party .
There 's enough shades to make it interesting but I do n't see incompatibilities . "
That offers not so much an olive branch to the left as an olive grove .
When it is time to have his picture taken , he points to an oil painting given to him by his wife and asks :
" Do we want these naked women behind me ?
Is that good ? "
The photographer thinks not .
The pictures taken , he tells one of his young sons that he will read him a story , but it will be " nighty - night time at half past six " .
As one of Britain 's youngest foreign secretaries , David Miliband swaggered the world stage in the company of Hillary Clinton .
Now his sway is reduced to deciding on bedtime for his boys .
If and when he and his party wield power again will depend on whether the contest for its leadership really does begin Labour 's renewal .
Where does the Labour Party go now ?
Sunder Katwala , general secretary of the Fabian Society
Labour lost the election – so has spent a week on a rollercoaster ride through the classic stages of the grieving process .
Denial , as the exit polls and new Commons provided an arithmetical hope of staying in .
Bargaining , over a Lib Dem deal and anger at the " vote Clegg , get Cameron " Tory - Lib Dem coalition outcome .
Can Labour arrive at acceptance ?
Parties that lose democraticelections must acknowledge that they deserved to do so .
Will Labour now have a proper debate about its record and future ?
Not if the only question is which Miliband brother to vote for as the next leader .
An open ( and indeed fraternal ) leadership contest is essential , after the 2007 coronation , but concluding this too quickly would be a big mistake .
The Conservatives twice failed to have any proper inquest into election defeats : only in 2005 did Michael Howard provide more time and space .
( That is also why David Cameron , not David Davis , won . )
Labour , too , should run its leadership contest through the autumn – using the party conference as a debating showcase – and take the chance to bring many more people back to Labour to take part .
That will take a different , more open party culture and to restore its instinct for civil liberties too .
We may learn little if , before anybody has properly studied this complex election , everybody just says what they thought already , repeating their favourite leftist or New Labour mantras , about losing C2s over immigration , or failing to inspire with Labour values .
So we must not be frozen in a timewarp debate about whether we stay " New Labour " or not .
New Labour achieved a great deal – but that was a long time ago .
A broad winning majority for the Britain of 2015 , not 1995 , means imagining and mobilising the next left , not trying to reconstruct the last political generation .
Tessa Jowell , MP for Dulwich and West Norwood
We lost the election in the marginal constituencies along the M1 , M2 and M6 , the spinal cords of middle England .
In 2010 there was nothing much to lighten the hearts of those who had flocked to vote for us in the heady days of 13 years ago .
We had huge achievements to our credit – new hospitals , rebuilt schools , renewed infrastructure , rising standards in education and health , all undeniable – but voters do n't thank you for what you 've done ; they rightlywant to know how you will make their future better .
In an adverse economic climate , in the face of a largely hostile press , and against the easy claim that it was time for a change , our account of a Labour future was timid .
We were hearing , but not listening to , people 's fears about migration , immigration and housing shortages .
The election results were spotty , and what stood out were the results of MPs who worked hard in their constituencies , championed local causes , knew their patch intimately , worked to make real lives better , and listened and responded to what local people had to say .
While politics may be becoming more presidential at the top , it 's solid campaigning and community work year round in the constituencies that will hold the line in a bad year and advance the cause in a good one .
From this also come the best ideas for the future , authentic and rooted in real lives .
For the future , how we do politics will be as important as what we do .
But to own the future we must stop and listen , and admit in humility that the answers will be found in the values we have always believed in and articulated in the mouths of the people we hope once again to serve .
Chuka Umunna , newly elected MP for Streatham
I would n't wish Conservative government on my constituents , but we are where we are and opposition gives Labour the chance to refresh and renew , which eluded us in government .
Clearly there is much to be proud of and we must build on our achievements .
But we also made mistakes and lost the election : we need to acknowledge that and explore why , in a cool , calm way , without entering into some factional blame game .
In some respects , the generation of politicians ahead of me came to be defined by their loyalty to one of our last two leaders – now both have moved on .
Unshackled by the travails of office , the leaders - to - be can tell us what they are all about .
As a humble new MP , I 'm excited at the prospect .
There should no rushed coronation , beauty contest or stitch - up .
In Harriet Harman , we have an excellent caretaker leader in place – this affords us the time to have a proper debate , so as many people as possible should throw their hats into the ring .
The scale of transformation required to resolve the economic , democratic and environmental crises is a challenge .
How do we go about tackling them ?
We want to know the answers each leadership candidate is offering .
Moreover , the contest gives us a golden opportunity to become a mass membership party once more .
Anyone joining now will be able to participate in the contest .
To those who left the party over the years – in some cases drifting to the Lib Dems in the hope of finding something more progressive – we should say : come back and shape the future direction of the Labour party so you feel at one with it again

The Labour party has a real opportunity .
We can't shirk the fact that we lost but , for all the slick Clegg / Cameron rhetoric , this will be a socially conservative government , made up of people who wo n't use the public services they are cutting and are not really concerned with fairness and equality .
Many Liberal Democrat voters feel betrayed .
We should encourage them to join us and build a much broader coalition .
We must do better at defending our record in government and explaining it in language people understand .
We all have policies that we did n't agree with , but overall the Blair / Brown governments did much good .
Where were the big arguments about childcare and family - friendly working in the election campaign ?
We need to build on the best of the last 13 years and politely park the worst .
I fear the leadership election will be quickly styled as yet another battle between the " modernisers " and the " dinosaurs " , with pressure for us to start second - guessing where the Tory / Libs will go and become a " Cameron - lite " party .
That would be a disaster .
I 'd like to see an end to the idea that we can run everything like a private market .
People want high - quality , flexible , local , accountable public services , good enough to be used by all .
Personally I want policies that genuinely help the poorest children .
I am sceptical about the pupil premium , which does n't address the fact that about 80 % of a child 's life chances are determined by their circumstances outside school .
Labour began as a party of aspiration .
That is still so , but it needs to be explicitly married to progressive values .
CIGARETTES will be sold in plain packages from January 2012 as Kevin Rudd introduces the world 's most draconian anti-smoking laws in a move likely to spark a legal challenge from big multi-national tobacco companies .
The new laws will prohibit the use of tobacco industry logos , colours , brand imagery or promotional text of tobacco product packaging .
Brand names and product names will have to be displayed in a standard colour , font style and position under the new laws , The Australian reports .
The government is planning the measure to cut the attractiveness of the packaging to young people to further cut smoking rates .
The measure has been strongly opposed by tobacco companies who have forshadowed legal action , arguing plain packaging breaches trademark law and amounts to confiscation of property .
The move is part of a Rudd Government plan to cut smoking rates to 10 per cent or less of the adult population by 2018 .
' I am becoming more radical with age , " says Nawal El Saadawi , laughing .
" I have noticed that writers , when they are old , become milder .
But for me it is the opposite .
Age makes me more angry . "
This is a startling admission .
It is hard to imagine how El Saadawi – the Egyptian writer , activist and one of the leading feminists of her generation – could become more radical .
Wearing an open denim shirt , with her hair pulled into two plaits , she looks like the rebel she has always been .
It is only the pure white hair , and the lines that spread across her face as she smiles , that give away the fact that she is 79 .
She has , she tells me , " decided not to die young but to live as much as I can " .
El Saadawi already seems to have lived more lives than most .
She trained as a doctor , then worked as a psychiatrist and university lecturer , and has published almost 50 novels , plays and collections of short stories .
Her work , which tackles the problems women face in Egypt and across the world , has always attracted outrage , but she never seems to have balked at this ; she has continued to address controversial issues such as prostitution , domestic violence and religious fundamentalism in her writing .
This has come at considerable cost .
In 1972 , her non-fiction book Women and Sex ( which included criticism of female genital mutilation ) led to her losing her job as director general of public health for the Egyptian ministry of health .
In 1981 , her outspoken political views led to her being charged with crimes against the state and jailed for three months – she used the time to write Memoirs From The Women 's Prison on a roll of toilet paper , with an eyebrow pencil smuggled in by a fellow prisoner .
In 1993 she fled to the US after death threats were issued against her by religious groups .
Her work continues to be explosive .
Her play , God Resigns in the Summit Meeting – in which God is questioned by Jewish , Muslim and Christian prophets and finally quits – proved so controversial that , she says , her Arabic publishers destroyed it under police duress .
And recently her criticism of religion , primarily on the basis that it oppresses women , has prompted a flurry of court cases , including unsuccessful legal attempts both to strip her of her nationality and to forcibly dissolve her marriage .
As El Saadawi prepares to talk about her life at a PEN literary festival on Friday , she is unrepentant .
" It 's all worth it , " she assures me .
" If I went back I would do it all again .
That is what I have learned from my experiences , that I was on the right track . "
Her energy , she insists , comes from the 10 to 15 letters she receives every day from people who say their lives have been changed by her writing .
" A young man came to me in Cairo with his new bride .
He said , I want to introduce my wife to you and thank you .
Your books have made me a better man .
Because of them I wanted to marry not a slave , but a free woman . "
El Saadawi is " a novelist first , a novelist second , a novelist third " , she says , but it is feminism that unites her work .
" For me feminism includes everything , " she says .
" It is social justice , political justice , sexual justice . . .
It is the link between medicine , literature , politics , economics , psychology and history .
Feminism is all that .
You cannot understand the oppression of women without this . "
She says she has been a feminist " since I was a child .
I was swimming against the tide all my life . "
Her eight brothers and sisters " were totally different .
Some of my sisters are now veiled and they think I am very , very radical .
They love me , and we see each other , but we do n't visit much . "
In her first autobiography , A Daughter of Isis , she recalls her outrage when she began to realise daughters were not considered equal to sons .
When her grandmother told her , " a boy is worth 15 girls at least . . .
Girls are a blight , " she stamped her foot in fury .
In that same book she writes about the horror of female circumcision .
" When I was six , the daya ( midwife ) came along holding a razor , pulled out my clitoris from between my thighs and cut it off .
She said it was the will of God and she had done his will . . .
I lay in a pool of blood .
After a few days the bleeding stopped . . .
But the pain was there like an abscess deep in my flesh . . .
I did not know what other parts in my body there were that might need to be cut off in the same way . "
Later , while working as a doctor , she saw for herself the terrible physical damage female genital mutilation could cause ; she campaigned for 50 years , she says , for it to be banned in Egypt .
A ban was finally instituted in 2008 , but she says the practice " still happens – it is even increasing .
Some religious leaders talk against it , but others are for it . "
Circumcision was n't the only horror El Saadawi faced as a child .
Brought up in a middle - class Egyptian household , she was expected to become a child bride , but refused ; she blackened her teeth and dropped coffee over one would - be suitor who came to call .
" When I was a child it was normal that girls in my village would marry at 10 or 11 , " she says .
" Now , of course , the government is standing against that because it is unhealthy .
And it happens much less .
But we are having a relapse again , because of poverty and religious fundamentalism . "
El Saadawi 's desire to study was so great that her parents were eventually convinced she would benefit from university .
She believes that her radical views were formed , at least in part , by training as a doctor .
" When I dissected the body it opened my eyes , " she says .
" Also , I think I have the gene of my grandmother who was a rebel .
My sisters and brothers took another gene . "
At medical school she fell in love with a fellow student , Ahmed Helmi , who was engaged in the fight against the British occupation of the Suez .
They married and had a daughter – but divorced when he came back from the fighting embittered and turned to drugs .
She later married a lawyer , who " said to me you have to choose between me and your writing .
I said my writing . "
In her second volume of autobiography , Walking Through Fire , she describes how he refused to grant her a divorce , announcing that , " It is the man who decides to divorce and not the woman " ; in desperation , she threatened him with her scalpel .
For the last 45 years she has been married to the novelist , doctor , and former long - term political prisoner , Sherif Hetata , with whom she had her second child , a son .
El Saadawi 's daughter , Mona Helmi , has followed in her footsteps , becoming a writer and poet .
In 2007 , Mona became the target of controversy when " she wrote a beautiful article on Mother 's Day , " says El Saadawi .
" She asked , ' What present can I give to my mother – shall I give her shoes ?
A dress ?
The gift I will give is to carry her name . ' "
The article was signed Mona Nawal Helmi .
" They took her to court – they said it was heresy because in the Qur'an women should take the name of the father not the mother . "
Although Mona won the case , El Sadaawi says that this , and another court case in 2002 – brought by a lawyer who sought to have El Sadaawi forcibly divorced on the basis of apostasy ( abandonment of religion ) – has left her bruised .
" I feel I am betrayed by my country .
I should be awarded the highest prize in Egypt for what I have done regarding injustices against women and children , and for my creative work . "
But she says her writing has given her an alternative sense of identity .
" Home to me is the world because my books have been translated into more than 30 languages .
People feel they know me and the minute they talk about my life or books I feel at home .
Home is where you are appreciated , safe and protected , creative , and where you are loved – not where you are put in prison . "
She still refuses to tone down her work .
" I am very critical of all religions , " she says .
" We , as women , are oppressed by all these religions . "
It is religious extremism , she believes , that is the biggest threat to women 's liberation today .
" There is a backlash against feminism all over the world today because of the revival of religions , " she says .
" We have had a global and religious fundamentalist movement . "
She fears that the rise of religion is holding back progress regarding issues such as female circumcision , especially in Egypt .
In a bid to address this , she has helped to found the Egyptian chapter of the Global Solidarity for Secular society .
She believes religion should be a personal matter , and approves of France 's ban on all religious symbols , including the hijab .
" Education should be totally secular .
I am not telling people not to believe in God , but it should be a personal matter which should be done at home . "
Despite the fact that her sisters wear the veil , she refuses to accept it as a free choice .
" What do we mean by choice ?
It is pressure , but it is hidden pressure – she is not aware of it .
I was exposed to different pressures from my sisters .
We are all the products of our economic , social and political life and our education .
Young people today are living in the era of the fundamentalist groups . "
El Saadawi says that she is dismayed by the relaxed attitude of young women who do not realise what previous generations of feminists have fought for .
" Young people are afraid of the price of being free .
I tell them , do n't be , it is better than being oppressed , than being a slave .
It 's all worth it .
I am free . "
And , she adds , there are more battles for her on the horizon .
" A new university opened in Egypt and I was asked to teach , but the top people said no .
They are afraid .
So that is the next thing .
I will work towards teaching in Egypt . "
A fighter to the last .
Ten years ago , an audience with Christopher Lloyd was as hard to score as plutonium .
He did n't do print , he did n't do radio , and , unless pressed , he steered clear of chat shows .
An appearance on Wogan in 1991 went down in the annals of difficult TV : Lloyd was perfectly courteous , but so bashful as to be near mute .
" I was just very shy , " he says .
" I was never anxious to do talk shows as I did n't know what to say .
And I do n't feel I have any inherent interest . "
He speaks thoughtfully ; his voice generous , humorous , kind .
" But as I 'm getting older I feel I want to be able to share whatever I know , if it means something to someone . "
And it 's only recently the legacy of his best - known work has really become apparent .
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the first of the three Back to the Future films , in which he played the wild - eyed inventor Doc Brown .
Photos of fan events and crew reunions show him gamely grinning away , looking aptly ageless – he 's still only 71 .
" I 've met people who say those films changed their lives .
I 'm so proud to have been part of a creative enterprise that had such an effect . "
In last year 's Call of the Wild 3D , Lloyd played another life - affirming mentor : a recently bereaved Montana old timer whose granddaughter comes to stay and gets rehabilitated from her city hang - ups by granddad 's care , an affectionate wolf and a spot of sled - racing .
It 's a sweet , old - fashioned film , but hardly a stretch – Lloyd has been a Broadway staple for 40 years , and is prepping for a Death of a Salesman revival .
He 's one of the most recognisable , memorable American character actors of the late 20th century .
But for the past decade he 's made almost nothing but low - profile family films .
Why ?
" Well , I do n't really plan it , " he says .
" The jobs come and I take a look at them .
I liked this one particularly because I 've played a lot of characters that are way out there .
Grandpa
Bill is n't wacky , he 's just a decent , well - grounded man . "
It 's an answer that shows how much more akin to this chap Lloyd is than he was the scene - stealing likes of Doc or Fester Addams or Judge Doom .
He 's a man of mellowness , not ego – far from bitter at the lack of meaty roles , just gently getting on with what he 's offered .
In 2008 his house in rural California fell victim to the forest fires .
A TV news crew raced to the scene .
Lloyd was n't raging ; he was soft - spoken , full of humility .
Until recently he also had a place in Montana .
He , too , hears the call of the wild .
" There 's something overwhelming about being in raw nature .
It 's got an aura about it is that is really kind of majestic and spiritual .
It 's good medicine . "
These days , Lloyd likes hiking and fly - fishing .
Between jobs in the 70s , he bicycled through Italy with a friend , then got the ferry to Greece and clopped round for six months by horse and cart .
He once cycled solo up the coast from San Diego to Seattle ; another time from the west coast to Nova Scotia .
He likes , he says , to go it alone , despite having four long marriages behind him .
" When travelling I like not being tied to someone else 's rhythms .
I 'm somewhat of a solitary person . "
In London a few years ago on a break from a shoot , he hired a barge to journey up the Thames .
" I do n't remember exactly where I went , but it was just beautiful popping along at about five or six knots . "
So he 's not really into speed ?
" It does n't sound like that , does it ? " he says , laughing .
" I got a few speeding tickets when I was young , but I 'm a little more like the turtle than the hare . "
Lloyd is that rare thing : an iconic actor who 's no showboat .
It 's easy to picture him on that barge , gliding peaceably along , unhurriedly in search of lost time .
Call of the Wild is out now on DVD from Icon Home Entertainment
I 've uploaded a package named rad to Hackage for handling reverse - mode automatic differentiation in Haskell .
Internally , it leverages a trick from Andy Gill 's Kansas Lava to observe sharing in the tape it records for back propagation purposes , and uses type level branding to avoid confusing sensitivities .
I 've tried to keep the API relatively close to that of Barak Pearlmutter and Jeffrey Mark Siskind 's fad package , but I could n't resist making a couple of minor tweaks here and there for generality .
I still need to go through and finish up the remaining unimplemented fad combinators , figure out a nice way to build a reverse - mode AD tower , validate that I did n't screw up my recollection of basic calculus , and provide a nice API for using this approach to get local reverse mode checkpoints in an otherwise forward mode AD program , but I am quite happy with how things have progressed thus far .
[ Edit : I 've uploaded minor bug fixes for exp and ( ** ) ]
Oleg Kiselyov's Iteratee .
I still do n't really understand how it works , but it 's saved my life a couple of times when I 've needed to do something like read 60,000 files quickly and did n't have time to figure out why the normal Haskell file access approaches were so slow .
Also Brian O'Sullivan 's Attoparsec , which in my experience does perform much better than Parsec on things like large flat - file databases .
And now you can combine the two .
Conal Elliott 's Vector - space packages up a lot of linear algebra functions very nicely , and also got me a little closer to feeling comfortable with type families .
Statistics ( again by O'Sullivan ) has been handy because I 'd prefer to work in Haskell than in R .
HXT and Criterion are n't " hidden gems " , but in my opinion they deserve to be more widely used .
Although a week ago Palm ’s CEO Jon Rubinstein still believed that “ Palm can survive as an independent company ” ( FT ) , Palm was already up for sale and it was pretty obvious they would quickly find a buyer .
And they did .
The company announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with HP , under which HP will purchase Palm at an enterprise value of approximately $ 1.2 billion .
The transaction has been approved by the HP and Palm boards of directors .
“ The combination of HP ’s global scale and financial strength with Palm ’s unparalleled webOS platform will enhance HP ’s ability to participate more aggressively in the fast - growing , highly profitable smartphone and connected mobile device markets , ” according to the press release .
The companies claim that Palm ’s webOS will allow HP to take advantage of features such as “ true multitasking ” and “ always up - to - date information sharing across applications . ”
Under the terms of the merger agreement , Palm stockholders will receive $ 5.70 in cash for each share of Palm common stock that they hold at the closing of the merger .
The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions , including the receipt of domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and the approval of Palm ’s stockholders .
The companies informed that the transaction is expected to close during HP ’s third fiscal quarter ending July 31 , 2010 .
Palm ’s current chairman and CEO , Jon Rubinstein , is expected to remain with the company .
According to HP ’s executive vice president Todd Bradley , Palm ’s OS provides an ideal platform to expand HP ’s mobility strategy and create a “ unique ” HP experience spanning multiple mobile connected devices . ”
“ And , Palm possesses significant IP assets and has a highly skilled team .
The smartphone market is large , profitable and rapidly growing , and companies that can provide an integrated device and experience command a higher share .
Advances in mobility are offering significant opportunities , and HP intends to be a leader in this market , ” he said .
Jon Rubinstein said : “ We ’re thrilled by HP ’s vote of confidence in Palm ’s technological leadership , which delivered Palm webOS and iconic products such as the Palm Pre .
HP ’s longstanding culture of innovation , scale and global operating resources make it the perfect partner to rapidly accelerate the growth of webOS . ”
42 men interviewed describe similar accounts of being extensively tortured while in captivity at a Baghdad prison , secret until recently .
28 Apr 2010 | InfoShop News
Dozens of men corroborate extensive torture toward false confessions during their prolonged , indefinite detention in a Baghdad prison — kept secret for months — after village raids from September through December 2009 by the Iraqi government , interviews with Human Rights Watch ( H.R.W. ) reveal .
The men were kidnapped during raids in Sunni Arab areas in Nineveh .
The prison was discovered in March after families had been searching for missing relatives since October .
The government has since vowed to shut the prison down and released 75 captives , while transferring 275 others to “ regular jails ” , Ned Parker reported at the Los Angeles Times last week .
More than 100 were tortured , regularly beaten , electrocuted , suffocated , put in stress positions for hours , repeatedly raped , extorted from , one Iraqi official familiar with the prison said .
“ Detainees in a secret Baghdad detention facility were hung upside - down , deprived of air , kicked , whipped , beaten , given electric shocks , and sodomized , ” H. R. W. said in a statement yesterday after interviewing 42 of the men at the Al Rusafa Detention Center on 26 April 2010 :
They were among about 300 detainees transferred from the secret facility in the old Muthanna airport in West Baghdad to Al Rusafa into a special block of 19 cage - type cells over the past several weeks , after the existence of the secret prison was revealed .
The men ’s stories were credible and consistent .
Most of the 300 displayed fresh scars and injuries they said were a result of routine and systematic torture they had experienced at the hands of interrogators at Muthanna .
All were accused of aiding and abetting terrorism , and many said they were forced to sign false confessions … .
All the detainees interviewed described the same methods of torture employed by their Iraqi interrogators .
The jailers suspended the detainees handcuffed and blindfolded upside down by means of two bars , one placed behind their calves and the other against their shins .
All had terrible scabs and bruising on their legs .
The interrogators then kicked , whipped and beat the detainees .
Interrogators also placed a dirty plastic bag over the detainee ’s head to close off his air supply .
Typically , when the detainee passed out from this ordeal , his interrogators awakened him with electric shocks to his genitals or other parts of his body .
During the interrogations , security officials mocked the detainees and called them “ terrorists ” and “ Ba’athists . ”
To stop the torture , detainees said , they either offered fake confessions or signed or fingerprinted a prepared confession without having read it .
Even after they confessed , many said , torture persisted .
The detainees told Human Rights Watch of other torture methods as well .
They described how interrogators and security officials sodomized some detainees with broomsticks and pistol barrels and , the detainees said , raped younger detainees , who were then sent to a different detention site .
Some young men said they had been forced to perform oral sex on interrogators and guards .
Interrogators also forced some detainees to molest one another .
Security officials whipped detainees with heavy cables , pulled out fingernails and toenails , burned them with acid and cigarettes , and smashed their teeth .
If detainees still refused to confess , interrogators would threaten to rape their wives , mothers , sisters , or daughters .
The interrogation sessions usually lasted three or four hours and occurred every three or four days .
Exceprts from the detainees ’ testimonies to H.R.W. :
Detainee A was captured with 33 others in Mosul on the night of September 17 , 2009 : “ The interrogators would tie my arms behind my back and blindfold me before they would hang me upside down and beat me .
They would suffocate me with a bag until I passed out and would wake me with an electric shock to my genitals .
Even after they forced me to confess that I killed ten people , the torture never stopped .
Ten days before I was transferred out on April 8 , I endured a horrific beating for speaking to an inspection team from the Human Rights Ministry .
After they left , the prison staff beat me so badly that I urinated blood . ”
Detainee B is a pediatrician who saw one of his cellmates dragged out for a torture session on 18 Jan 2010 .
When they brought him back to the cell , the doctor noticed swelling above his liver and suspected internal bleeding and told the guards that the man needed immediate medical attention .
The guards took the tortured man out but returned him an hour later saying that he was fine .
He died in the cell an hour later .
Detainee C was arrested in September in Mosul : “ The torture sessions lasted for hours on end .
The guards would come into our cell and grab three or four detainees at a time .
They would walk us to the interrogation room to begin the abuse .
They would beat us for hours and so badly that we could not stand up so they would have to drag us back to our cells .
They would let us recover for three days before the cycle of torture began anew . ”
Detainee D , a formal general in the Iraqi army and now a British citizen , who is in a wheelchair , was arrested on Dec. 7 , after he returned to Mosul from London to find his son , who had been detained .
His jailers refused him medicine for his diabetes and high blood pressure .
“ I was beaten up severely , especially on my head , ” he told Human Rights Watch .
“ They broke one of my teeth during the beatings . …
Ten people tortured me ; four from the investigation commission and six soldiers . ….
They applied electricity to my penis and sodomized me with a stick .
I was forced to sign a confession that they would n’t let me read . ”
Iraqi soldiers arrested Detainee E , a 21 - year - old , on Dec. 19 at his home in Mosul : “ During the first eight days they tortured me daily .
They would put a bag on my head and start to kick my stomach and beat me all over my body .
They threatened that if I did n’t confess , they would bring my sisters and mother to be raped .
I heard him on the cellphone giving orders to rape my sisters and mother . ”
During one torture session , the man , who was blindfolded and handcuffed , was stripped and ordered to stroke another detainee ’s penis .
After he was forced to the floor , the other detainee was forced on top of him .
“ It hurt when it started to penetrate me .
The guards were all laughing and saying , ‘ He ’s very tight , let ’s bring some soap ! ’
When I experienced the pain , I asked them to stop and that I would confess .
Although I confessed to the killings , I mentioned fake names since I never killed anyone .
So the torture continued even after I confessed because they suspected my confession was false . ”
One of the guards also forced him to have oral sex .
Detainee F was arrested with his brother in Mosul on Dec. 16 .
His interrogators strung him upside down and severely beat him with his eyes blindfolded and his hands tied behind his back .
He suffered broken ribs from the beatings and urinated blood for days .
The interrogators threatened to rape his wife if he did not confess .
One time he was stripped naked and told to penetrate another naked inmate lying on the floor or that he would otherwise be raped by two male guards .
Detainees G and H , father ( 59 ) and son ( 29 ) respectively , were arrested at their house in Mosul on September 30 .
Both endured sessions in which interrogators hung them upside down and beat them .
During one session the father was stripped naked in front of the son , and the son was told they if he did not confess they would rape his father .
The father was told that if he did not confess they would kill his son .
The son was subsequently sodomized with a broomstick and the guards ’ fingers .
Detainee I , 24 , was arrested on September 30 in Mosul .
He still has severe leg injuries and wets his bed after he was sodomized numerous times with a broomstick and pistol .
During one session , an interrogator told him that they would rape his mother and sister if he did not confess .
During another beating , interrogators hit him so hard that he lost several front teeth .
“ The revelations could further polarize Iraqis , still coming to grips with the scars of the sectarian conflict between 2005 and 2007 , ” Sam Dagher reports at The New York Times .
In Nineveh , Iraq Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki — a Shiite — is already “ largely perceived as a sectarian leader with a personal vendetta against anyone associated with the former Sunni - led government of Saddam Hussein ” .
“ This breeds extremism , ” Sheik Abdullah Humed , a Nineveh tribal leader , said .
“ In our country a man who is raped will commit suicide , and how do you think he will do it ? ”
After the discovery of the secret prison at Muthanna , I wrote about how this is not foreign element of the Iraqi government — the conduct and systematic cover - up and denial .
It is system replicated from the U.S. government exported to Iraq .
The Obama Administration is de facto immunizing murder , torture , humiliation , threats against children by the C.I.A. and the lawyers who criminally violated their licenses by justifying it .
This along with the Bush Administration ’s secret prison in Lithuania , the government ’s current ‘ black jail ’ in Afghanistan and immigrant jail in New York City .
Mr. Dagher adds :
“ Abu Ghraib was a picnic ” compared with the secret prison , said Sheik Abdullah Humedi Ajeel al - Yawar , one of the most influential Sunni Arab tribal leaders in the northern province of Nineveh , where the detainees were rounded up by Iraqi soldiers based on suspicions that they had links to the insurgency and brought to Baghdad with little due process .
Abu Ghraib is the prison at which American guards tortured Iraqi prisoners , severely damaging Iraqis ’ trust in the United States … .
“ America is the symbol of democracy , but then you have the abuses at Abu Ghraib , ” Mr. Maliki said .
“ The American government took tough measures , and we are doing the same , so where is the problem and why this raucousness ? ”
The U.S. State Department documented over 500 cases on torture in Iraq prisons in 2009 .
Contradicting his own Human Rights Ministry , PM Maliki denies the existence of secret prisons , calling the center at Muthanna a “ transit site under the control of the Ministry of Defense , which used it for a ‘ specific period ' ” , Mr. Dagher reports .
The prime minister also denies the existence of torture at the facilities , countering the testimonials to H.R.W. as a political conspiracy — that his opponents visited the prison and told the captives to start “ rubbing matches on some of their body parts ” .
Iraqiya , a secular alliance headed by former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi , defeated the prime minister ’s State of Law bloc 91 - 89 in the initial counting of the votes of the March 7 election .
Since then , two Iraqiya members ’ elections to Parliament have been overturned and the Justice and Accountability Commission is moving to exclude nine more winning MP’s .
Mr. Allawi is calling for a “ caretaker government ” to rule on an interim basis and new elections , Ernesto Londoño reports at The Washington Post .
The new prime minister must be appointed by more than half of the 325 ministers of Parliament .
“ Because of the closeness of the election , negotiations to form a new government are widely expected to be protracted and acrimonious , ” Mr. Londoño reports .
PRINCETON , N.J. —
When Tim Howard was 6 or 8 , his career path was already being MapQuested by a coach who perhaps did not know about tactics but did understand proportion .
“ It was like , ‘ Get in goal , you ’re the biggest , ’ ” Howard said .
He has since joined the elite ranks of the United States ’ most prized and dependable soccer export .
There are nearly as many Americans ( three ) starting regularly in goal in the English Premier League as there are Englishmen ( five ) .
When the two countries meet at the World Cup on June 12 , the United States will not be widely considered to have an advantage at any position except one —
Howard in net .
In England , American goalkeepers have become as reliable as tea time .
The theories for this are plentiful and speculative : Americans grow up playing sports that require use of the hands .
The population of 300 million is bound to produce a high number of terrific athletes .
The 6 - foot - 3 Howard , for instance , was a formidable basketball player at North Brunswick High School in New Jersey .
Bob Bradley , the United States coach , does not subscribe to the good - hands theory .
He believes more in the ancestry of role models .
In this view , Gianluigi Buffon ’s impenetrability as Italy won the 2006 World Cup can be directly traced to the magnificence of Dino Zoff , who captained Italy ’s 1982 World Cup - winning team at 40 .
Tuesday 's release of the S&P / Case - Shiller ( CSI ) home price indices for January 2010 ( browse the dashboard ) reported that the non-seasonally adjusted Composite - 10 price index declined slightly since December further indicating that the government sponsored housing bounce has drawn to a close .
It ’s important to remember that the CSI data is lagged by two months and that today ’s results represent the trend of prices paid from home sales closed between November - January of 2009 .
Now that the strongest selling months have been reported , look for all remaining CSI releases until early spring to continue to indicate notable price weakness coming from typical seasonal declines as well as extra-seasonal declines as a result of reduced demand from activity that was “ stimulated ” forward into the summer and early fall by the tax sham .
Also , looking at the 1990s - era comparison charts below its obvious that even after the main downward thrust has been reached , the housing markets have a long tough slog ahead with the ultimate bottom likely many years out … .
Or if we are currently experiencing the Japanese model … decades out .
Further , is important to remember that the 90s housing recovery played out against the backdrop of a truly unique period of growth in the wider economy fueled primarily by novel and ubiquitous technological change ( cell phones , internet , personal computers , telecommunications , etc ) .
Today , we may not be so lucky .
The 10 - city composite index declined 0.04 % as compared to January 2009 while the 20 - city composite declined 0.70 % over the same period .
Topping the list of regional peak decliners was Las Vegas at - 55.78 % , Phoenix at - 50.86 % , Miami at - 47.19 % , Detroit at - 42.47 % and Tampa at - 41.96 % .
Additionally , both of the broad composite indices show significant peak declines slumping - 30.23 % for the 10 - city national index and - 29.63 % for the 20 - city national index on a peak comparison basis .

A railway enthusiast has had a lucky escape after narrowly avoiding an express train travelling at around 70 miles per hour .
The man was filming the Oliver Cromwell steam train in Thurston in Suffolk , when another train sped through the station from the opposite direction .
It almost clipped the train spotter , who seemed unfazed by what happened .

A while ago , I read this article on coroutines in C .
One of the main downfalls of this technique is that since it uses the static keyword , it makes it much harder to write recursive coroutines , and nigh - impossible to have multiple coroutines using the same function .
Examples
Let ’s first look at an example of how it can work .
One way of efficiently computing Fibonacci numbers in a language like Haskell is to construct an infinite list of the Fibonacci values .
fibs a b = a : fibs b ( a + b )
Since Haskell is lazily evaluated , such an infinite list is fine until you attempt to compute the whole thing .
So , as long as you just say something like take 10 $ fibs 1 1 it will only compute how many you need .
One important use of Coroutines is as iterators .
Consider the Haskell example from above .
If we assume that we have such an infinite list of values , we may want to iterate over the list , inspecting the values as we go .
The following C code achieves this using some helper macros we ’ll describe below .
int fibs ( int a , int b , CoroutineState * s ) { initializeCoroutineState ( s , FibState , mystate ) ; mystate -> a = a ; mystate -> b = b ; yield ( s , mystate -> a ) ; recur ( s , fibs ( mystate -> b , mystate -> a + mystate -> b , s -> next ) ) ; finalizeCoroutine ( s ) ; return 0 ; }
Now , if we wanted to print out the first 10 of these values :
s = createCoroutineState ( ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i ++ ) { printf ( " %d " , fibs ( 1 , 1 , s ) ) ; }
The yield method is similar to Python ’s yield key word .
It returns a value , but also records where the yield was called so that the next time the function is executed it can begin again from that point .
Another example of how coroutines can be used as iterators is as iterators over a binary tree .
Consider the following tree :
4 2 6 1 3 5 7
A standard way to traverse this tree is a post - order traversal .
Consider the following code which traverses this tree and prints it out :
void print ( Tree * t ) { if ( t -> left ) print ( t -> left ) ; if ( t -> right ) print ( t -> right ) ; printf ( " %d " , t -> value ) ; }
Building a post - order iterator is slightly more complex .
It involves creating a stack and pushing wrapped tree - nodes onto the stack .
When one is popped , it is marked as ‘ visited ’ and then pushed onto the stack , followed by its right child then left child .
However , we can use coroutines to achieve the same thing while staying true to the original traversal code :
int treePostOrderIterator ( Tree * t , CoroutineState * s ) { initializeCoroutineState ( s , TreeIteratorState , mystate ) ; mystate -> tree = t ; if ( mystate -> tree -> left ) recur ( s , treePostOrderIterator ( mystate -> tree -> left , s -> next ) ) ; if ( mystate -> tree -> right ) recur ( s , treePostOrderIterator ( mystate -> tree -> right , s -> next ) ) ; yield ( s , mystate -> tree -> value ) ; finalizeCoroutine ( s ) ; return 0 ; }
How it works
When I was learning to program , I learned that switch statements were just conditional structures that were equivalent to a series of if statements .
While you can almost always get away with thinking about them this way , they are n’t actually .
Instead , think of switch statements as parameterized gotos .
One of the less objectionable uses of goto is as a means of breaking out of nested loops .
So , obviously goto can jump out of scopes .
In fact , it can be used to jump into and out of any scope inside of a single function .
The same is true of the cases of a switch statement .
This is what makes Duff ’s device possible .
In order to facilitate recursion and having multiple coroutines running at once , we need to pass a mutable state parameter .
This is an object of type struct CoroutineState .
typedef struct CoroutineState CoroutineState ; struct CoroutineState { void * state ; /* Pointer to a struct representing the internal state of the coroutine .
We need this since we have to reinstate the scope whenever the function is re-intered .
*/ long current ; /*
The line number of where the coroutine should return .
Used in ' yield ' and ' recur ' */ unsigned char done ; /*
A marker to show that a recurrence is completed */ CoroutineState * next ; /*
The next in the stack of states */ CoroutineState * parent ; /* NULL if actually the parent , pointer otherwise */ CoroutineState * tail ; /*
Only the parent is guaranteed to know the tail */ } ;
Basically this struct stores everything needed to reinstate the coroutine when it is next called .
This includes the line number it should begin executing on , a pointer to the user ’s saved values , and a stack containing the recursive calls .
Every coroutine begins with an invocation of the initializeCoroutineState macro .
This is a macro that takes three parameters .
The first is a CoroutineState object , the second is the type defining the user ’s saved values , and the last is the variable name to use to refer to this state .
# define initializeCoroutineState( coroutineState , UserStateType , userStateVar ) \ UserStateType *userStateVar = ( UserStateType * ) coroutineState -> state ; \ switch ( coroutineState -> current ) { \ case 0 : \ if ( coroutineState -> state == 0 ) { \ coroutineState -> state = ( void * ) malloc ( sizeof ( UserStateType ) ) ; \ bzero ( coroutineState -> state , sizeof ( UserStateType ) ) ; \ } \ userStateVar = ( UserStateType * ) coroutineState -> state ; \
Note that there is a switch statement embedded here .
This switch statement jumps to the appropriate line in the execution .
Every coroutine ends with finalizeCoroutine(s ) which indicates that after this point the execution of the function should proceed normally .
It also says that when this function returns that the coroutine is complete and should be removed from the stack .
This is indicated internally with s-> done =1 ; .
# define finalizeCoroutine(s ) \ } \ s-> done = 1 ; \ free(s -> next ) ; \ s-> next = 0 ;
Now , to the meat of the matter .
yield needs to return the value the user wants to yield , but also record where this occurred so that the switch statement from above will jump to here .
It also needs to reinstate any variables that the user had in scope .
Unfortunately there ’s no good way of doing that in C , so we have to do it manually .
Thus the need for the helper struct .
Before the return in the following macro , we ’re just manipulating the stack so that we can record where we are .
Notice coroutineState -> current = __LINE__ ; .
__LINE__ is a macro that evaluates to the current line number in the program .
So , here we ’re recording the line number and then after the return , we have case __LINE __ : .
This will cause the coroutine to begin executing after the return the next time it ’s called .
# define yield ( coroutineState , value ) \ do{ \ CoroutineState * parent = coroutineState ?
coroutineState \ : coroutineState -> parent ; \ coroutineState -> current = __LINE__ ; \ parent -> tail = coroutineState ; \ free( coroutineState -> next ) ; \ coroutineState -> next = 0 ; \ return value ; \ case __LINE__ : 1 ; \ } while (0 )
The last macro is perhaps the most interesting .
It ’s the one that allows things like the infinite list iterator and the binary tree iterator .
Basically , there are times when you want to have a recursive call and have the coroutine state stored along with having a return value bubble up .
The while loop is responsible for executing until the coroutine called below it is completed .
# define recur( coroutineState , func ) \ do{ \ CoroutineState * parent = coroutineState ?
coroutineState \ : coroutineState -> parent ; \ coroutineState -> next = createCoroutineState ( ) ; \ coroutineState -> next -> parent = parent ; \ parent -> tail = coroutineState -> next ; \ while (!coroutineState->next ->done ) { \ CoroutineState * parent = coroutineState ?
coroutineState \ : coroutineState -> parent ; \ typeof ( func ) tmp = func ; \ coroutineState -> current = __LINE__ ; \ if ( ! parent -> tail -> done ) \ return tmp ; \ case __LINE__ : 1 ; \ } \ } while ( 0 ) \
Using it
In order to get this to work , you have to do one extra thing .
You need to create a struct which you use to store your state rather than use local - variables in your functions .
This is necessary since we ’ll be re-entering the functions later and that state would be lost .
So , just put all the variables you would want to use into the struct .
Then use this struct in the initializeCoroutineState and then whenever you use a local variable .
If you would normally return a computed value ( not the result of a recursive call ) then just say yield ( value ) ;
If you are doing a recursive call and intend for the coroutine to proceed down the recurrence , just wrap it in a recur(s , yourRecursiveCall ( ) ) .

New York City and a group of contractors have agreed to pay up to $ 657 million to more than 10,000 workers who alleged that rescue and cleanup efforts around the World Trade Center made them sick .
The settlement , announced Thursday night , sets up a system to compensate thousands of firefighters , police officers , contractors and volunteers based on the severity of their medical problems .
" This settlement is a fair and reasonable resolution to a complex set of circumstances , " New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement .
The awards would range from $ 3,250 to seven figure sums .
By agreeing to the settlement , the plaintiffs release the city and its contractors from any future damage claims .
Mr. Bloomberg commissioned a task force in 2006 to develop a coordinated plan for responding to the massive health problems associated with the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
That panel projected roughly 43,000 people might ultimately seek treatment for exposure to the dust and smoke that permeated lower Manhattan after the towers toppled .
AN attorney representing the family of a seven - year - old girl who was shot to death during a raid in Detroit said the police operation was flawed and was influenced by TV production concerns .
Aiyana Jones was shot and killed as she slept on a living room sofa after an officer 's gun went off as police searched the house for a suspect .
Attorney Karri Mitchell told The Detroit Newsthat the police “ were excited ; they were on TV ” .
“ They did n’t have to throw a grenade through the front window when they knew there were children in there , ” the attorney said .
The raid was being filmed for an episode of The First 48 , a reality crime show broadcast by A&E , according to Detroit police spokesman John Roach .
He said investigators were examining the TV crew ’s footage of the incident to help determine what occurred .
Police said officers went to the house with a valid search warrant to arrest a suspect in the murder of a 17 - year - old high school student , myFOXdetroit.com reported .
Police reportedly threw a “ flash grenade , ” which emits a blinding flash and loud noise to disorient suspects , through a downstairs window .
Police said they entered the home at 12.40 am ( local time ) on Sunday and a woman had responded with " some level of physical contact " .
Aiyana 's father , Charles Jones said : " They came into my house with a flash grenade and a bullet .
" They say my mother resisted them , that she tried to take an officer 's gun .
My mother had never been in handcuffs in her life .
" They killed my baby , and I want someone to tell the truth . "
Police later said the officer and the grandmother may have just collided in the confusion , The Detroit News reported .
Police Assistant Chief Ralph Godbee said the shooting was being investigated and all information was preliminary .
The officer was put on paid administrative leave , he said .
Police do not believe the gun was fired intentionally .
The Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality called the girl 's death " the pain of pains " and held a candlelight vigil on Sunday evening at the home .
Planet Earth has not ( yet ) been destroyed by today 's terrifying Boobquake experiment - one Indiana student 's response to Iranian cleric Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi 's insistence that immodestly dressed women provoke earthquakes .
Sedighi recently declared : " Many women who do not dress modestly ... lead young men astray , corrupting their chastity and spread adultery in society , which increases earthquakes . "
Well , Jennifer McCreight decided to put this to the test , and attempt a critical mass of immodesty primarily involving a load of women flashing a Richter - tempting amount of jub .
She declared : “ On Monday , April 26th , I will wear the most cleavage - showing shirt I own .
Yes , the one usually reserved for a night on the town .
I encourage other female skeptics to join me and embrace the supposed supernatural power of their breasts .
Or short shorts , if that 's your preferred form of immodesty .
With the power of our scandalous bodies combined , we should surely produce an earthquake . ”
McCreight 's picture speaks for itself , and thousands of other females have thrown their weight behind the effort to either provoke a major catastrophe or prove that Iranian clerics have a poor grasp of the fundamentals of plate tectonics .

RAWALPINDI , PAKISTAN ( BosNewsLife ) –
The government of Pakistan ’s most populous province announced an investigation Sunday , March 21 , into reports that a Christian man was burned and his wife raped by local police and Muslim religious leaders for refusing to convert to Islam .
“ The matter will be investigated and the culprits will be arrested , ” Punjab ’s Minister of Law Rana Sanaullah told BosNewsLife .
Meanwhile , doctors at Punjab ’s Holy Family Hospital in the city of Rawalpindi warned that their patient , 38 - year - old Arshed Masih , would not be able to survive with 80 percent of his body burned .
Masih was attacked Friday , March 19 , in front of a Rawalpindi police station near the capital Islamabad by at least three police officers and five Muslim religious leaders , according to several Christian and hospital sources .
The officers are also suspected of having raped his wife , 33 - year - old Martha Masih , in the police station where the couple was held for questioning , said Police Superintendent Moin Shah .
“ The victimized family will get justice , ” he told BosNewsLife .
WIFE TREATED
Martha Masih was still being treated for injuries at the Holy Family Hospital Sunday , March 21 , said Medical Officer Nasir Javed .
The attacks were allegedly instigated by the couple ’s Muslim employer , businessman Sheikh Mohammad Sultan , because he was upset they refused to embrace Islam .
Sultan could not immediately be reached for comment , but witnesses said they had seen him near Friday ’s burning incident .
It was not clear whether he had actively participated in the attack .
Masih worked as a driver and his wife as a domestic servant for the businessman since 2005 , Christians said .
In January , Sultan and religious leaders allegedly asked Arshed to convert to Islam with his whole family .
After he refused , they reportedly threatened him with “ dire consequences ” .
RISING TENSIONS
This week tensions rose after the businessman reported a theft of 500,000 Pakistani Rupees ( 5,952 $ ) , according to a document seen by BosNewsLife .
The Christian family members were not named as suspects in the so - called ‘ First Information Report ’ from police .
Sultan offered the couple to drop the case if they convert to Islam or “ else that both would not see their children again , ” according to sources familiar with the situation .
However , “ Arshed refused to convert and stood firm in his faith .
Arshed`s wife was raped by the police and he was burned alive , ” Friday , March 19 , local Christians said , speaking on condition of anonymity because of security fears .
Their three small children , ranging in age from 7 to 12 , were reportedly forced to view the rape and burning incidents :
A BosNewsLife reporter saw them sleeping on the floor of the hospital near their parents , after the family was apparently expelled from the servant quarters of the businessman ’s estate .
WIDER CONCERNS
The attacks have underscored wider concerns among human rights groups over attempts by Muslim militants in the country to force minority Christians to embrace Islam .
Pakistan ’s Federal Minister for Minorities Shahbaz Bhatti , a Christian , refused to comment saying only he was “ busy ” , although he pledged to call back later .
Punjab Minister Sanaullah had earlier denied the attacks took place , saying Masih “ had burned himself ” , but later hastily announced his government ’s investigation after a BosNewsLife report on the cases Saturday , March 20 .
Life for All and other Christian advocacy groups said they would organize protests Monday , March 22 , to “ demand compensation for the family ” and that “ the culprits will be arrested immediately . ”
Monday ’s rallies were to be held in the Chandni Chowk area of Rawalpindi at 1400 hours local time and in the city of Lahore ’s Youhanabad area at 1600 hours .

+ Rovers Home Spotlight On Mars - Image Retracing a Rover 's Steps out of Victoria Crater
Image and Caption
This movie shows the wheel tracks left by the Opportunity rover as it climbed uphill out of Victoria crater .
The rover entered and exited the crater at the alcove called " Duck Bay " leaving two sets of wheel tracks on the steep hill , which is inclined at about 23 degrees .
The rock cliff in the center of the movie behind the tracks is called " Cape Verde " and is about 6 meters tall ( 20 feet tall ) .
That 's about twice the height of a basketball hoop .
Victoria crater spans about 800 meters ( half a mile or more than the length of eight football fields ) in diameter .
Its rock layers hold clues to the environment during the period when the rocks were formed and altered .
Scientists were drawn to this spot because of this cross-section of exposed rock layers .
The scalloped edge of the crater and other features indicate that the crater was once smaller than it is today , but wind erosion has widened it over time .
The images used to create this animation were taken on the three days Opportunity spent driving out of the crater on Aug. 24 , 26 and 28 , 2008 ( Sols 1630 , 1632 and 1634 ) .
Opportunity explored Victoria for more than two years and is on a path to a much larger crater named Endeavour , which is about 25 times wider than Victoria .

Now , I ’m not speaking about books dealing with the aesthetics of the task , or with essays about the craft and critical analysis of examples of it — and we have several very fine volumes in that vein ( Charles Baxter ’s Burning Down the House and John Gardner ’s The Art of Fiction come to mind ) — no , I ’m talking about straight how - to books , most of which claimed to offer shortcut advice , practical instructions on “ writing your say the genre , ” and even in some cases “ secrets ” of the novelist ’s or story writer ’s or poet ’s trade .
That day , with Delores , I stood among the titles , amazed .
Stack upon stack of them .
“ These sell really well , ” she told me .
“ You would n’t believe how many people want to be writers out there . ”
I said , “ Damn . ”
That was what came out of me .
We were looking at 50 different titles — a lot .
More than I would ’ve believed existed .
And in the next moment , she offered me $ 10,000 to write one .
“ Really , ” she said .
“ These kinds of books sell better than the fiction books . ”
“ Well , ” I said .
“ Lordy . ” I picked one up and put it down , picked up another and turned it in my hand and put it down .
“ Lordy . ”
“ Ten thousand dollars , ” she said .
“ And I ’ve heard you lecture .
You could knock one of these off in a few days , I ’ll bet . ”
I was not — am not — in a position to take that amount of money lightly when it is offered to me , even for something I would never have thought of unless it came to me in this fashion .
I have a family to support , children in college .
So for an instant I was speechless .
She stared , quietly waiting for my answer .
“ You ’re serious , ” I got out at last .
“ Absolutely . ”
“ Well , ” I said , stalling for time .
I was appalled .
I ’d forgotten the discomfort of the new shoes .
“ I ’m — well , I ’m working on this novel , you know .
And I ca n’t imagine when I ’d have the time to do it . ”
“ If you ever get some time — I mean it .
Give me a call . ”
“ Um , ” I said .
And I felt myself deciding to go ahead and express something of my astonishment .
“ You know , I ’m not really much in favor of this kind of thing .
I had a conversation with a woman a year or so ago about her writing , and I asked what she was reading .
Turns out that all her reading was in how - to books about writing her novel .
She said she ’d read them all , that they seemed to have been written for her , and her novel . ”
“ See ? ” Delores said .
“ And how was her writing ? ”
“ It read as though it had been composed by one of those electronic calculators .
An adding machine . ”
Delores smiled .
“ Well , they do sell well , these books .
And if you ever want to write one , let me know . ”
I ’d completely forgotten about the shoes .
Take a cursory look online .
Amazon.com lists 4,470 titles under the heading of How to Write a Book .
There , mixed with titles like How to Write a Chick Lit Novel and How to Write and Sell Your Novel are titles like How to Manage Your Home Remodel .
Of course it ’s the how to phrase that makes the listing what it is and where it is , but in fact , in terms of the expectations and the implied message , these books belong together , and according to the prevailing wisdom of our time , constructing a novel or a poem or a play is no different than building a back deck on your house .
Not yet ready to let go of my all time favorite show , I 'm doing a complete series rewatch and hope you 'll join me .

Fabian Ronisky thought he was on track last summer to become a high - powered corporate lawyer .
He was an intern at a leading firm in Los Angeles , earning about $ 3,000 weekly .
But the firm did n't offer him a permanent job .
So Mr. Ronisky , a 25 - year - old student at Chicago 's Northwestern University School of Law , spent the fall sending 50 resumes to law firms and government agencies , to no avail .
Now , just days shy of graduation and with $ 150,000 of student loans , he plans to move back to his parents ' home in San Diego and sell music and movies online .
" I wanted to use my education , " he said .
" But times change . "
Mr. Ronisky is one of about 40,000 law - school students who will graduate this spring and enter one of the worst job markets for attorneys in decades .
This year 's classes have it particularly bad , according to lawyers and industry experts .
Though hiring was down last year as well , they said 2009 graduates applied for jobs before law firms had felt the full brunt of the downturn .
The situation is so bleak that some students and industry experts are rethinking the value of a law degree , long considered a ticket to financial security .
If students performed well , particularly at top - tier law schools , they could count on jobs at corporate firms where annual pay starts as high as $ 160,000 and can top out well north of $ 1 million .
While plenty of graduates are still set to embark on that career path , many others have had their dreams upended .
In its World Economic Outlook , the International Monetary Fund says only a new Chinese monetary policy can guarantee a global economic recovery .
It also warns Japan to invest more .
The United States prepares to hit China ’s aluminium export to send Beijing a strong signal .
Beijing ( AsiaNews / Agencies ) – China should allow market forces to set the value of the yuan , whereas Japan should enhance its economic stimulus measures , said the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in its semi-annual World Economic Outlook , which was released on Wednesday .
In the meantime , the US Commerce Department said that it was close to deciding what to do in relation to China ’s currency , a major thorn in US - China relations .
For the IMF , Japan ’s “ tentative ” economic recovery is an exception in a region that is leading the global rebound , fuelled by consumer spending and investment in China and India .
For the Washington - based fund , policy makers in several countries should embrace stronger exchange rates .
“ Currencies of a number of emerging Asian economies remain undervalued , substantially in the case of the renminbi , ” the IMF report said .
The Group of 20 emerging and developed nations , whose finance chiefs meet tomorrow in Washington , should also discuss coordinating policies to strengthen the global recovery , the IMF said .
Equally , it ’s “ essential ” for China to respond positively to the demands of the rest of the world for a new currency policy .
Currently , the yuan is pegged at 6.83 against the US dollar , and this since July 2008 .
For Western economists and analysts , such a fixed rate has allowed China to remain highly competitive .
It has also allowed China to accumulate huge holdings in US securities that have been steadily growing in value ; any change in the exchange rate , as envisaged by US president Barack Obama , could reduce their value by as much as a third .
However , the situation has also led to a long - standing row between Beijing and Washington .
Although both sides can harness good arguments , a solution still seems far away .
In any event , the United States remains China ’s main export market , whilst Washington needs Beijing ’s support at the United Nations to stop Iran .
In the meantime , the US Commerce Department could decide this week whether to launch a groundbreaking investigation into charges that China is subsidising exports of moulded aluminium extrusions , a material that is used in the automobile and construction industries , by undervaluing its currency .
US producers filed a petition recently calling for an investigation into whether Beijing subsidises exports of aluminium extrusions by undervaluing the yuan .
If the department finds in favour of the petitioners , it could impose countervailing duties to offset losses by US companies .
Pity Gregor Mendel .
Far enough ahead of his peers that his work was n't appreciated in his own lifetime .
When the world was finally ready to deal with his results , the scientific community almost instantly went to work demonstrating that Mendel 's Laws were wrong — or at least applied to such a narrow subset of inheritance that it was nearly impossible to generalize them .
Yet , despite all these problems , most of the phenomena associated with inheritance , including the majority of exceptions to his eponymous Laws , continue to be termed Mendelian inheritance .
Why does the scientific world celebrate Mendel 's achievement despite the fact that his work languished and then was quickly left in the dust ?
If we look at the history of his ideas ( as we 're about to do here ) , one key factor seems to be the fact that other researchers quickly linked his laws to the underlying biology .
But perhaps more significantly , we'll see that , even if his laws were wrong , they provided some testable predictions that helped organize an otherwise mystifying field .
It 's OK to be wrong in science , as long as you 're wrong in ways that lead to fruitful research .
Gregor Mendel
In a recent trip through the history of science , Chris Lee pointed out that Einstein used recently developed math to deal with problems that had been annoying scientists for decades , if not centuries .
The law that resulted , in the sense that " nothing moves faster than light " can be considered a law , was little more than a happy side effect of tying together things like electromagnetism , the nature of light , and the structure of the universe .
Mendel 's work was nothing like that .
The people who thought about inheritance had found it pretty vexing , but not a lot of people thought about it , and the field was such a black box that there were n't even the equivalent of outstanding issues to neatly package together , as Einstein did .
At the time that Mendel set to work , the only other scientific field that might immediately benefit from an understanding of inheritance — evolutionary biology — was still largely trapped in Darwin 's brain , kept there by his general dislike of making waves .
Mendel 's insights vs. Mendel 's Laws
The claim that science is either physics or stamp collecting may be hyperbole , but , in a lot of ways , pre-Mendelian biology was a lot closer to stamp collecting than physics .
The only thing that merited the status of theory — cell theory — was descriptive , not quantitative , and a lot of biology simply involved cataloging species .
The Linnaean classification system provided this process with some structure , but the implication of this system — a branching tree of life — was n't fully grasped or accepted , and no mechanism for producing one had withstood any scrutiny .
Mendel was n't a stamp collector .
He spent two years developing true - breeding plant lines , and learned how to control the fertilization of seeds in the process .
He developed a precise scoring system for a variety of traits , and then set about breeding and analyzing tens of thousands of offspring .
By grouping the offspring together based on their appearances — their phenotypes — Mendel was able to begin to recognize patterns in the appearance of traits .
In some types of crosses , two traits would appear in roughly equal numbers ; in others , the ratio would be closer to 3:1 .
Eventually , he realized that these patterns could be created through the inheritance of pairs of genetic factors , which we now call genes .
The statistical power of these numbers ( along , perhaps , with some observational bias ) was absolutely necessary for recognizing some of the ratios that helped him formulate his ideas .
With smaller numbers of offspring , random chance would probably have obscured the ratios that Mendel recognized .
His achievement in recognizing them is all the more remarkable in that the statistical test we now use to identify results produced by chance was n't developed by Fisher until over 50 years after Mendel did his work .
The other key insight was that units of inheritance are discrete and they remain discrete across generations .
So , a tendency to yellow pea pods would n't be diluted or blend ( as many biologists , including Darwin , suspected ) , even if it were to remain hidden for years in plants that produced green ones .
Because of dominant traits , what we saw with our eyes when looking at a plant might only be a partial indication of the full genetic legacy they carried — looks not only could be deceiving , they often were .

Really , it 's no surprise that Mendel 's work was n't widely recognized ; biologists of the time probably did n't know what to make of it .
Mendel attempted to generalize his findings into laws , which governed inheritance of genes in organisms that have two copies of them .
Germ cells obey the law of segregation , in that they only carry one of the two possible copies of the gene , and the genes follow the law of independent assortment , which suggested that individual genes would end up in those germ cells through an essentially random process .
Breaking the law
With his laws in hand , Mendel turned to other plants in an attempt to see just how general they were .
One of them obeyed the law ; the other cross turned into a technical nightmare of low fertility and phenotypes that did n't fall into a neat dominant / recessive pattern .
So even Mendel realized that his ideas were not likely to be complete .
In a world where biologists were n't really experimentalists and most thought there had to be some sort of blended inheritance , not even the successful experiments went over well .
Mendel ended up being promoted to abbot two years after his publication , effectively ending his scientific career .
In the intervening 35 years , anyone who attempted to take the same sort of experimental , big - numbers approach to inheritance would have been lucky to find a species and set of genes that obeyed Mendel 's laws , for all the reasons we 're about to go into .
Even as experimental biology became more common , the conceptual leap that Mendel made remained a significant barrier ; one of the three people once credited with rediscovering Mendel 's ideas has since been removed from that list by science historians , who have become convinced that he did n't actually understand what he was doing .
Nevertheless , people eventually saw the sorts of patterns identified by Mendel , and quickly recognized he had beaten them there .
But , with his laws being examined by the scientific community , it took less than a decade for researchers to start to identify some serious limitations to the patterns of inheritance seen by Mendel .
Some of these will be familiar to anyone with a high school biology education : incomplete dominance , environmental influences , and so forth .
But the basic insight Mendel had — that genes were more or less invariant across generations , even if the traits they promoted would sometimes be impossible to detect — could be used to explain all of these exceptions .
His experimental approach also turned out to be key in understanding a different phenomenon , which we now call linkage .
Before the decade of rediscovery was gone , researchers had found that , in many cases , there were large deviations from Mendel 's law of independent assortment .
For some pairs of genes , the specific versions ( called alleles ) inherited from a parent tended to continue to be inherited together ; once separated , they tended to remain separate .
Thomas Hunt Morgan , working with the fruit fly , used Mendel 's approach of controlled matings and massive number of offspring to characterize linkage .
He show that patterns of linkage were consistent and the frequency of reassortment was more or less additive , allowing the locations of genes to be mapped .
Eventually , this enabled him to demonstrate that the linkage seen through genetic crosses had a direct relationship with the order of genes on a chromosome .
The Simon Wiesenthal Center has recently been doing some scaremongering over the growing White Nationalist presence on social media websites like Twitter , Facebook , MySpace , and YouTube .
According to “ Digital Terrorism and Hate 2010 , ” there has been a 20 % increase in “ hate - affiliated web pages ” over last year .
White Nationalist “ micro- blogging ” is becoming more popular .
The New York Times even describes Stormfront as the “ old - line media of online racism . ”
I found this report interesting because it coincides with my own agenda .
Back in October , I said I wanted Occidental Dissent to evolve into a popular multicontributor blog like Lew Rockwell.com .
We have since accomplished that goal .
It is not an unusual for half a dozen writers to post new content here on any given day .
The next goal I have set for OD is to start exploiting social media to get our message out .
We already have a ton of new readers finding us through Facebook since I installed that share widget .
I count that as one of my better decisions .
Twitter and YouTube are still a mystery to me .
I ’m researching both at the moment .
We ’re learning how to do podcasts with Radio Free Virginia .
I also want to learn more about Digg , Reddit , delicious and the other social bookmarking sites .
We are going to start posting our material there to piss off the resident White liberals .
With the growth of social media , it is easier than ever before to run around the mainstream media and directly connect with our audience .
In the future , I can only see this trend continuing .
The MSM will never again monopolize the distribution of information like they did in earliest days of television .

A MOTHER and her two six - year - old twins were found with cocaine stuffed down their underwear as they tried to board a plane bound for London , Nigerian police said Saturday .
A spokesman for Nigeria 's Drug Law Enforcement Agency said the woman and her husband were arrested after the find .
" Although the man was not found with any drugs , his wife and two children , who are twins aged six years , were found with cocaine hidden in their underwear , " the spokesman said .
The woman was carrying more than 3kg of cocaine while her children carried a total of around 700 grams , he said .
Narcotics agents detained the family as they were about to board a London - bound jet at Lagos 's Murtala Mohammed International airport on March 28 .
" We have released the twins to other family members because they are minors and innocent while their parents will soon be taken to court for drug trafficking , " the spokesman said .

Editor 's Note : Celebrated research and author of THE CHINA STUDY T. Colin Campbell PhD recently made an AMAZON .COM book review of the new Atkins diet book called THE NEW ATKINS FOR A NEW YOU .
You can read his review below , and you can click to go to his review on Amazon.com , and vote up the review if , like us , you agree and find it highly useful .
Although the authors of this book certainly promote a message that they believe is scientifically valid and useful and although a very large number of people agree with them , I take exception , for several reasons .
With minor exceptions this book represents nothing more than an extension of the arguments for the Atkins diet .
Thus my comments relate to what I believe to be wrong with those arguments .
There are numerous instances where the authors ' misuse scientific evidence .
Of course , they will disagree because they are claiming quite the opposite , namely , that their book highlights a growing body of scientific evidence now supporting the Atkins diet , a position also publicized on the Atkins website .
Trivializing and marketing the science began early with the Atkins group , starting with Dr. Atkins himself who had no use for the scientific method .
According to his widow , he was proud that he never published a single peer - reviewed scientific paper .
This is dramatically contrary to professional scientists in this field who have published at least dozens , even hundreds of papers that , MOST IMPORTANTLY , are subjected to critical review by peers .
Thus , Atkins ' enthusiasts rely much more on personal testimonials and anecdotal reports for their arguments .
This kind of evidence need not be entirely dismissed but , without systematic and transparent organization of scientific research that is critiqued by qualified peers , it is very hard to validate claims .
The give and take of peer review , for example , is absolutely demanded for claims being made about personal health , especially when these claims are intended for large segments of the public .
More specifically , the authors try to convince the readers into believing that the science ' establishment ' has finally begun to validate this diet on a wide scale , but this is simply not true .
The authors , for example , highlight in the introduction that " in the last few years more than fifty basic and applied studies have been published which , in addition to validating the safety and effectiveness of the Atkins Diet , also provide new insights into ways to optimize the Atkins lifestyle . "
For most readers , this implies , according to the authors , that there are 50 studies that document the superiority of the Atkins diet over other dietary strategies that can be considered for a long - standing dietary lifestyle .
But , in Chapter 1 they somewhat paradoxically say that there are 7 studies ( only ) lasting 6 months to 2 years that compare the Atkins diet with " other common weight loss strategies " , a time considered by them to be long - term .
But , in reality , this time still falls far short of the lifestyle of many years that they advocate for using this diet .
They illustrate a so - called long - term effect by citing a study done in Kuwait that highlights the magnitude of the health benefits that can be achieved with a " low carb " diet ( < 20 g / day , later adjusted to 40 g / day ) .
This study certainly improved clinical lipids and lowered body weight ( an average loss of 60 pounds ) .
But the authors of this new book fail to tell the readers that this Kuwaiti diet was extremely low calorie , containing only about 970 calories per day for subjects weighing , on average , 235 pounds with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 39 .
Any diet this low in calories , regardless of its nutritional composition , will reduce body weight like this .
Omitting this information , the authors of this new book then go on to state that , with coaching of the subjects for a year , " this diet outperformed that of any of the randomized groups in the other seven studies . "
Knowing nothing about the other 7 studies , the reader must then accept at face value the superiority of the Atkins diet alleged by the authors .
This is an unacceptably superficial way to compare the findings of these studies .
The reader is entitled to know whether the weight losses of these several different studies were compared on an absolute or relative scale ?
Whether severe calorie restriction was part of these other studies ?
Whether these comparisons were statistically significant ?
Whether the baseline weights for these studies were different ?
Whether there were consistent changes in the various lipid biomarkers ?
Without this information , it is not acceptable to make such a brash and sweeping conclusion that the Atkins diet " outperformed " any other diet group .
I know something about these other studies said to confirm the superiority of the Atkins diet , especially the study that the authors list first in their book and repeatedly cite in their list of references .
This is a study by Gardner et al at Stanford University that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2007 .
The flaws in this report are serious and are often repeated in other studies on the Atkins diet .
Of even more concern was the rapid and widespread media recognition quickly given to the findings of this Gardner et al study .
Major headlines were published across the country in a way to lead most people to believe that the Atkins study had finally made the grade as a superior diet .
Now , in this new book , the findings of this Gardner et al study appear once again , this time being repeatedly cited as evidence of good science .
Because the Gardner et al study had serious flaws and was destined to create major media comment , it therefore required critique at the time it was published .
Conventionally in science , after publication of a study , this is initially done using a widely accepted , letters - to - the - editor format that might be considered as an extension of the peer - review process .
Four of us in the profession therefore duly submitted our letters to the editor of JAMA to point out these flaws and to seek the investigators ' comments .
Most of the time , such letters , after some modest peer review , are routinely published , but not in this case .
In my letter , the flaw that I found especially repugnant -- and obvious -- was their comparison of the Atkins diet results to the low fat , plant - based diet of Dean Ornish pejoratively called " extremely low " by the researchers .
The original Ornish diet -- and other similar diets -- contains only 10 - 12 % fat like other whole food , plant based diets but Gardner et al inappropriately tested a grossly distorted " Ornish diet " that contained 29 % fat !
To add further insult , they called this falsely fabricated diet " extremely low in fat " .
The distortion of the diet was even more serious because the Gardner version of the ' Ornish ' diet contained 18 % protein , which is 70 - 80 % higher than the amount recommended and which is usually found in Ornish type diets .
Fat and protein together comprised 48 % of the Gardner version of the diet , rather than the 20 - 22 % usually seen in whole foods plant - based diets .
In the Gardner study , there actually were two more diets being compared and , together , these four diets were nutritionally very similar ( at least when compared with a truly low fat , whole food plant - based diet ) , thus severely limiting the ability to detect meaningful and statistically significant differences .
Nonetheless , a non-significant slightly lower body weight was observed for the Atkins diet and this made headlines as if it was really important .
I have published many papers from our laboratory and have served on several science journal editorial review boards .
Never have I witnessed such unprincipled behavior as that of the JAMA editor when he denied all four of our letters , especially a letter from Dr. Ornish whose study was being so grossly misrepresented .
Readers had a right to hear a response from the investigators but this was not forthcoming , thanks to the JAMA editor .
It was as if someone had wanted these Gardner findings published and publicized , regardless of its flaws .
It is as if the funding of the study , the design of the study , the interpretation and discussion of the results , the pre-publication review of the manuscript , the refusal to publish our post- publication letters and the media reporting of the findings were script from a well - designed marketing plan .
Now , three years later , the authors of this new book , who seem oblivious to the flaws of this study , herald it as important evidence helping to prove the superiority and widespread applicability of the Atkins diet .
This practice of Atkins diet researchers of making improper diet comparisons like this has occurred far too often .
As a result , unsubstantiated claims are repeatedly made and dressed up as good science .
Even more confounding in this history is the repeated misuse of terms and words that define high and low amounts of fat and carbs .
New words ( like ' carbs ' ) with nebulous meanings are created .
Improperly defined benchmarks of ' high ' and ' low ' dietary levels of fat and carbohydrate are used that greatly confuse comparisons with other dietary strategies .
Atkins himself seems to be the first to have developed the now widely used term ' carb ' .
I am of the strong opinion that this was a contrived marketing word that was originally meant to question the recommendations being made at that time to consume more whole vegetables , fruits , legumes and grains .
Generalizing the so - called nutritional advantage of ' low carb ' diets had the effect of diminishing the health value of these plant - based foods because these are the only whole foods that contain carbohydrates .
Even though more recent attempts are being made to distinguish ' bad ' carbohydrates from ' good ' carbohydrates by superficially ' counting carbs ' ( as if these are entities that can be counted ! ) , this still stigmatizes the exceptional health value of a whole food , plant - based diet .
Virtually anyone of any scientific substance during the past half - century has known that relatively simple ( ' bad ' ) carbohydrates like sugar and refined flour , cause health problems .
But this does not mean that we can generalize this large and complex class of nutritionally valuable carbohydrates , as found in whole plant based foods , into a single class called ' carbs ' , then demonize the superior nutritional value of these high carbohydrate foods .
I have many other concerns with this book as to its scientific credibility , too many to document here .
Their discussion on protein , however , merits attention because of the not so obvious but nonetheless pivotal role of this nutrient when justifying the Atkins diet .
The authors ' protein discussion not only sends the wrong message and is extremely superficial , but also it is factually wrong .
For example , they emphasize that the RDA ( about 8 - 10 % of total diet calories ) for protein " reflects the minimum , not the optimal , amount of protein an average healthy person needs . "
Wrong .
The RDA is not and was never meant to be the minimum amount of protein needed .
The RDA is about 2 standard deviations above the minimum daily requirement ( MDR ) so as to insure that the minimum requirements of virtually all people are being met .
( If all people theoretically consumed the RDA level of protein , about 98 % of them would be consuming in excess of their needs ! )
The authors ' perception that the RDA is a minimum requirement encourages , in effect , a higher than necessary consumption of protein .
This is a clear bias favoring higher protein consumption ( meaning animal - derived protein ) that then extends to further comments by the authors that plant protein is , in effect , not as good as animal protein ( 1 ) because it is " incomplete " and ( 2 ) because it does not " satiate " as well , thus suggesting , in the authors ' view , the need for still more oil / fat to this already high fat diet .
And finally , they recommend 20 - 25 % dietary protein , then claim somewhat defensively , that this is not a high protein diet .
This is nonsense .
The present range of dietary protein for the vast majority of the population is about 11 - 22 % of calories ( average of 17 % ) , with three - fourths of this protein provided by animal - based foods .
The Atkins recommendation for dietary protein is triple that of the RDA , high by anyone 's standard ( except for these authors ! ) .
A whole food plant - based diet of mixed vegetables , fruits , legumes , grains and tubers can easily provide the RDA of about 8 - 10 % dietary protein , based on long established experimental evidence ( since 1943 ) that this is more than enough protein .
Increasing protein above the RDA of 8 - 10 % up to an average of 17 % is generally obtained by consuming increasing amounts of animal - based foods .
Furthermore , increasing dietary protein from about 10 - 12 % to 20 % , for example , eventually increases risk for most people for a large number of diseases and conditions too numerous to discuss here .
These include serious diseases like cancer , heart disease , osteoporosis and certain autoimmune diseases , as well as an overwhelming number of explanatory mechanisms .
The authors mentioned none of these health problems associated with the high dietary protein of the Atkins diet .
Like a house of cards , a diet ever higher in animal protein - based foods , usually along with higher dietary fat ( the typical Atkins recommendation ) leads to early death and disability resulting from the diseases that kill most of us in the U.S. before our time .
The major problem with this book goes well beyond the numerous specific errors committed by these authors .
It is the misguided Atkins diet paradigm into which this book is inserted that is a much more ominous problem .
Most people agree that there are health problems with the standard American diet ( SAD ) , which , on average , is 17 % protein and 35 % fat ( totaling 52 % ) , leaving 48 % for carbohydrates .
The Atkins diet rightly recommends reducing the ' bad ' carbs but primarily by replacing these ' carbs ' with increasing protein ( 30 % ) and fat ( 40 % ) ( totaling 70 % ) thus compromising an already low intake of highly nutritious carbohydrate - rich plant - based foods .
Within 10 years or less , I predict that most people using the Atkins diet will either quit or experience serious health problems , although many may see more health benefits than adverse health effects in the short run .
The nomadic Masaai of eastern Africa who consume large amounts of meat , milk and eggs , incur like old American men , extensive atherosclerotic lesions in spite of their extensive walking .
The same decreased consumption of ' bad ' carbs advocated by Atkins ' people , can be easily accomplished by a whole food , plant based diet but not by increasing fat and protein but by increasing the consumption of whole food , plant - based diet that contains the countless antioxidants and complex carbohydrates ( e.g. , fiber ) .
This simultaneously avoids excessive intakes of protein , fat and bad ' carbs ' ( like sugar and refined flour ) while enhancing the intake of the highly nutritious whole food , plant - based foods .
There is far superior to replacing the ' bad ' carbs with fat and protein , mostly from animal - based foods , that contain little or no antioxidants and complex carbohydrates .
Finally , the authors in this book are committed to finding scientific evidence that encourages people to consume foods of personal choice ( good marketing strategy ! ) , generally meaning high fat , high protein based meats , milk and eggs .
This pleases many people who like to hear good things about their bad habits , but this is a strategy that can seriously bias scientific objectivity .
It should be noted that fat , salt and sugar are acquired tastes and , for fat and salt , there is convincing evidence showing that within a month or so , these addictions can be reversed while new and healthier taste preferences emerge .
This brings me to my final question , namely , why do many Atkins - oriented people personally accustomed to high fat , high salt and high protein diets adamantly refuse both to personally try a whole foods , plant - based diet and even refuse to learn about its extraordinary health benefits ?
A partial reason for this may be that they do n't realize that taste preferences can markedly change .
It is irresponsible for scientists and would - be scientists to dismiss health - promoting scientific evidence merely to please companion readers and listeners ( is this because of the lure of money ? ) .
I deeply honor , above all else , people having the right to choose but I strongly reject withholding information that may assist their making wise choices for themselves .
I was initially inclined to give a 2 ranking for this book -- to acknowledge the authors ' effort to encourage people to reduce their consumption of ' bad carbs ' ( to use their words ) , but the remedy offered by these authors is so seriously misguided that I finally decided that a score of 1 is actually too generous .

Jehovah 's Witness , 15 , crushed by car dies after refusing blood transfusion because of his faith
Tragic : Joshua McAuley survived a car crash but died after refusing a blood transfusion because of his faith
A schoolboy died after refusing a blood transfusion following a car crash because he was a Jehovah ’s Witness .
Joshua McAuley , 15 , suffered life - threatening injuries to his legs and abdomen after being pinned against a shop front by an out - of - control car as he went to buy sweets .
He survived the crash in Smethwick , West Midlands , and remained conscious , but lost a massive amount of blood and was airlifted to hospital for a transfusion .
But Joshua died six hours later , after he refused to consent to the operation because of his faith , church representatives said .
Under medical law , doctors are required to decide whether a child under 16 is
competent enough to consent to or refuse medical treatment without the need for parental permission or knowledge .
Sources at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS
Trust suggested doctors followed this law , known as the Gillick competence test , before deciding Joshua was able to make his own decision .
It is unclear whether either of the boys ’ parents were at the hospital at the time .
Last night members of his congregation described how he told doctors ‘ no blood , no
blood , no blood ’ after he was flown to Selly Oak Hospital , in Birmingham .
As a Jehovah ’s Witness from a devout family , Joshua followed the belief that blood is sacred and transfusions are prohibited by the Bible .
Hospital staff are thought to have begged the teenager to change his mind , but he
refused .
Collision : Joshua was trapped between the car and the shop and was airlifted to hospital
Out of control :
The car crashed into a shop in Smethwick , West Midlands , on Saturday .
Joshua was flown to Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham but died later
Clive Parker , an elder at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah ’s Witnesses where Joshua and his family worshipped , said : ‘ I believe he was conscious enough after the accident and he made a stand on the blood issue .
He made the choice personally . ’

Joshua , who was about to start his GCSEs at the local Shireland Academy , went to
buy sweets while out preaching to residents at 11.15 am on Saturday , when the accident happened , friends said .
Firemen battled to free Joshua , as others trapped inside the shop feared the building would collapse .
Paramedics gave him pain relief and emergency treatment at the roadside , before
flying him to hospital .
Four other pedestrians were hurt in the crash – one seriously .
The 28 - year - old male driver , from Birmingham , has been bailed pending further
inquiries , West Midlands Police said .

SEOUL - A North Korean firing squad publicly executed a factory worker for sneaking news out of the reclusive communist country via his illicit mobile phone , Seoul - based radio said Thursday .
The armaments factory worker was accused of divulging the price of rice and other information on living conditions to a friend who defected to South Korea years ago , Open Radio for North Korea reported on its website .
The man , surnamed Chong , made calls to the defector using an illegal Chinese mobile phone , the broadcaster said , citing a North Korean security agency official it did not identify .
The report did n’t say when the phone calls were made .
The execution took place by firing squad in late January in the eastern coastal city of Hamhung , according to Open Radio for North Korea , a broadcaster specializing in the isolated country .
The station broadcasts into North Korea , which tightly controls news .
South Korea ’s Unification Ministry , which handles relations with North Korea , and the National Intelligence Service , Seoul ’s main spy agency , said they could not immediately confirm the report .
Mobile phone use in authoritarian North Korea is tightly restricted , though the country introduced an advanced network in partnership with Cairo - based Orascom Telecom in 2008 .
North Koreans who manage to make illegal international mobile phone calls mostly use networks in neighbouring China .
Open Radio for North Korea said it believes more than 10,000 North Koreans living near the border with China illicitly possess Chinese mobile phones .
Ha Tae - keung , the broadcaster ’s chief , said it was not known to whom in South Korea the information passed on by Chong was eventually delivered .
The North Korean defector said to have received the calls , only identified by the common Korean family name of Kim , may have worked for South Korean government officials , researchers or news outlets , Ha said .
Ha said neither the executed man nor the defector has worked for Open Radio for North Korea .
North Korea has long been regarded as having one of the world ’s worst human rights records , including public executions , political prison camps and torture .

British driver Hamilton won the world title in 2008
The roads minister of Victoria in Australia has used strong language to criticise Lewis Hamilton after his road car was impounded by Melbourne police .
Minister Tim Pallas made the comment on the day that Victoria launched a new road safety campaign .
The Formula 1 racing driver , who was arrested on Friday , is expected to be charged with improper use of a vehicle .
Mr Hamilton , who was in the country for the Australian Grand Prix , has apologised for his " over- exuberance " .
' Nanny state '
Mr Pallas criticised the 25 - year - old British racing driver on the day that Victoria launched a Don't Be a Dickhead road safety campaign .
Asked whether Lewis Hamilton met that description , he said : " OK , I 'll say it .
He 's a dickhead . "
But Australian driver Mark Webber has defended his fellow competitor , saying his homeland had become a nanny state , with ridiculous parking and speeding rules .

Hamilton was arrested hours after he recorded the quickest time in Friday 's Australian Grand Prix practice .
His time of 1:26.801 was 0.25 seconds quicker than McLaren team - mate and current world champion Jenson Button .
As Hamilton drove away from the circuit to his team 's hotel , police constable Scott Woodford said his rear wheels were skidding as he accelerated .
" Given that Melbourne 's on the world stage with a lot of interstate and international visitors , we would expect drivers to observe road rules , " he said .
A Victoria police spokesman said the Mercedes was seen to " deliberately lose traction " .
McLaren 's 2008 Formula 1 world champion admitted : " I was driving in an over - exuberant manner and , as a result , was stopped by the police .
" What I did was silly , and I want to apologise for it . "

It is not the first time Hamilton 's driving has put him in trouble with the police .
In 2007 , his car was impounded in France after he was caught speeding .
Earlier this month , Hamilton insisted there would be no " wild side " to his character emerging following his decision that his father Anthony should no longer manage his career .
" I do n't think so , " Hamilton remarked at the time .
" I am who I am .
I do n't think anybody has stopped me from being who I wanted to be .
" When I arrived in the sport , I did n't go out and buy a million different cars , I took my time .
" Maybe I might buy one car this year , who knows .
But that 's not being wild .
" I 've still got the same girl , I race for the same team and I 've still the same dedication and determination . "

Do you know your IQ , that little number that ’s supposed to measure how smart you are ?
Forget it .
Individual intelligence is old news , collective intelligence ( CI ) is the future .
And it ’s already here .
Google lets you access the collective records of the world via internet searches .
Wikipedia assembles the shared knowledge of humanity in an ever refined research tool that anyone can access .
Oh , these systems have their limits , to be sure , but they allow an individual to quickly leverage the expertise of millions in just a few seconds .
That ’s incredible , and that ’s the promise of CI .
The Center for Collective Intelligence at MIT was formed in 2006 by Thomas Malone and his colleagues .
CCI tries to answer a guiding question : how can people and computers be connected so that collectively they act more intelligently than any individual , group , or computer has ever done before ?
Thomas Malone addressed the World Economic Forum in Switzerland earlier this year and explained the nature of collective intelligence , how we may track it , and how it could help solve problems like climate change .
Check out his talk in the video below .
Collective intelligence can include distributed computing .
We ’ve seen how a complex problem can be solved by using millions of connected computers working in tandem .
So too can any task be divided among a set of human peers .
You do this all the time at work , or at home with your family .
CI takes the same phenomenon and spreads it among thousands or millions .
Linux , the operating system , is an example of CI – it was built and is continually updated by the collective work of its users .
Similarly , OpenWetWare is a synthetic biology resource maintained by a group of users , generally with expertise in the field .
Future CI may rely on cultivating expertise ( among billions of humans , there is likely to be at least one expert in every possible field ) .
It could also harness the statistical genius of a collective of average people ( among billions of humans , there ’s bound to be at least a few people who have a great idea about a problem ) .
The great advantage of CI as opposed to IQ , is that CI is growing rapidly , probably exponentially .
Individual intelligence is hard to measure – there are many critiques of IQ testing based on racial bias , economic bias , the limited scope of what kinds of skills are tested , and how such tests are applied .
Still , it seems that the average IQ is slowly growing at a rate of 3 points per decade – the so - called Flynn Effect .
Again , there ’s debate over what causes the Flynn Effect ( genetics , socialization , nutrition , etc. ) , but the trend is there .
It ’s just too slow to really matter .
A slight rise in individual intelligence can’t compare to the effect of hundreds of millions of people going online in the next decade .
Internet connectivity is increasing quicker than biology could every hope to keep up with .
Another reason why CI will dominate IQ is that individual intelligence is subsumed by the collective .
An expert or genius can participate in a group task as easily as an average person .
Collective intelligence reflects the group work of the smart , the average , and the dull .
While this may seem to average out , a wise application of CI will be able to filter out the dross while saving the best work – no matter where it comes from .
To this end , CCI at MIT is working to understand and guide collective intelligence .
Their research includes way to measure CI , studies of how CI is already used in organizations , and tracking how individuals interact in a group .
They ’ve even started a Handbook of Collective Intelligence – it ’s written and edited as a wiki of course .
CCI at MIT is also working on applications for collective intelligence : they ’re looking into how groups may generate solutions to climate change , make accurate predictions about the future , or find ways to improve healthcare .
Collective intelligence can also take the form of collective art or creativity .
Do you play a massively multiplayer online role playing game ( MMORPG ) ?
Games like World of Warcraft allow millions of users to create a shared entertainment experience within a controlled virtual environment .
Little Big Planet and similar games actually have users build levels for other users to explore .
The best levels get shared and enjoyed more – CI creates a better video game .
CNN has an interesting story about how this trend is extending into other artistic media like music and film .
Kim - Ung
Yong might be the world ’s smartest man , his IQ is reportedly 210 .
Marilyn Vos Savant may have an IQ of 186 or even 230 ( depends on how you measure it ) .
But these are just the brightest stars in a Milky Way of intelligence .
As many average computers can be harnessed into doing the work of a supercomputer ( or many such supercomputers ) , so too will we harness our individual minds for a shared goal through the internet .
In fact , CI is really a combination of both these trends .
Distributed computing and distributed human problem solving will become one and the same as man and machine become more connected .
Every bit of intelligence ( human or artificial ) will be needed to solve humanity ’s grand challenges and take advantage of our growing technologies .
So jump in any time , guys .
Edit a wiki , join a distributed computation project , start a tech blog …wait .
Um , ignore that last one .
We ’ve got it covered .
Promise .

In what is being hailed as a major victory for workers in the biotech and nanotech fields , a former scientist with pharmaceutical firm Pfizer has been awarded $ 1.37 million for being fired after raising the alarm over researchers being infected with a genetically engineered " AIDS - like " virus .
Becky McClain , a molecular biologist from Deep River , Connecticut , filed a lawsuit against Pfizer in 2007 , claiming she had been wrongly terminated for complaining about faulty safety equipment that allowed a " dangerous lentivirus " to infect her and some of her colleagues .
The Hartford Courant describes the virus as " similar to the one that can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome , or AIDS . "
Health experts testified that the virus has affected the way McClain 's body processes potassium , which they say causes McClain to suffer complete paralysis as often as a dozen times per month , the Courant reports .
McClain 's lawsuit ( PDF ) asserted that Pfizer had interfered with her right to free speech , and that she should have been protected from retaliation by whistleblower legislation .
Pfizer challenged her assertion , claiming McClain only started complaining about safety problems once her employment was terminated , the Associated Press reports .
Pfizer also claimed to have investigated McClain 's claims about safety violations and found them to be untrue , according to the New London Day .
On Thursday , a jury in a US District Court in Connecticut disagreed with Pfizer , granting McClain the $ 1.37 million , as well as punitive damages , meaning the total amount could be much greater .
The WorkersCompensation.com
Web site says the ruling is being " considered the first successful employee claim in the biotech and nanotech industry . "
Workers ' rights advocates are pointing to the McClain lawsuit as " evidence that risks caused by cutting - edge genetic manipulation have outstripped more slowly evolving government regulation of laboratories , " reports the Courant .
McClain 's lawsuit says she was exposed to the experimental virus repeatedly between 2002 and 2004 , and when she lodged complaints about it , her supervisor said he would " falsify her future performance reviews and he told her they would be negative , and he threatened her in an aggressive fashion following the plaintiff 's repeated complaints regarding safety .
He forcibly backed the plaintiff into a wall during one encounter . "
' TOO BIG TO NAIL ' A report at CNN about a separate legal matter involving Pfizer states that the Department of Justice considered Pfizer to be " too big to nail " in an investigation of the company 's illegal marketing of the painkiller drug Bextra .
CNN reports that , if Pfizer had been prosecuted over the drug , the company would have been excluded from doing business with Medicaid and Medicare .
But because federal officials considered the company too big to be exempted from working with the government health programs , a dummy corporation -- Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc. -- was set up , and that dummy corporation then pleaded guilty to the crime .
" P&UCI sold no drugs and had no real employees , and its creation was simply a figleaf to allow a Pfizer entity to take the rap without harming Pfizer itself , " explains Jim Edwards at the Bnet business blog .
Pfizer is the world 's largest drugmaker , with annual revenue around $ 44 billion .

Eric King reports the breaking news that in a letter obtained by Ted Butler , the DOJ's Antitrust department is considering launching an investigation into silver market manipulation by JP Morgan .
Should an announcement of a full formal probe of manipulation by JPM follow , it would be tantamount to a confirmation of what numerous individuals have been claiming over the years , that JP Morgan , the LBMA , the CFTC , various banks , and even that kindly old grandpa who was so much against derivatives except when he was about to lose money as a result of regulation that he is spending the whole weekend telling his investors in Omaha to run , not walk , to Borsheim's , and buy all their massively overpriced trinkets ( you ca n't be a quadrillionaire without first being a trillionaire ) , are nothing but a borderline criminal cabal that traffics in wealth extraction courtesy of a few monopolist players .
As Eric King discloses in its letter the Anti-Trust division announces that " it will carefully consider the issue of silver market manipulation by JP Morgan and other traders .
Generally the CFTC investigates these types of market manipulations .
However , the suggestion that JPMorgan Chase may be signaling other traders , warrants further analysis .
The DOJ will carefully consider the issue you raise , and you can be assured that if we conclude that silver traders have engaged in anti-competitive conduct , we will take appropriate enforcement action . "
Ted Butler , always cutting to the point , says : " It 's about time a major government organization stepped up to end what has been a very serious crime in progress that has basically covered two decades ... [ JP Morgan 's ] level of concentration only exists in the silver markets .
Concentration is the hallmark of manipulation or a monopoly .
Our markets are supposed to be free markets , they are not supposed to be controlled by anybody .
Right now the silver market is a monopoly , the chief monopolist is JP Morgan , and the only entity that can step up to JPM is the Antitrust division of the DOJ ...
If you want to put it into perspective , more important and more serious than what is currently happening with Goldman Sachs .
This is a crime in progress , this is an allegation of current market manipulation .
This is as serious as you get .
You do n't get bigger than market manipulation . "
And , as a scheduled daily reminder to Christine Varney : if you are evaluating JP Morgan for being a silver market monopolist , maybe you can also consider Goldman Sachs for monopolizing the entire global fixed income market ( mostly OTC but also cash ) .

Fruit importer Chiquita Brands International “ knowingly provided material support to a terrorist organization ” by paying protection money and providing weapons to a Colombian rebel group , a lawsuit filed in a Florida court this week alleges .
Three US citizens who survived a five - year hostage ordeal at the hands of Colombia ’s notorious FARC paramilitary group , along with the family of a fourth man who was killed by FARC rebels , say Chiquita owes them damages because it paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to FARC for a decade beginning in 1989 .

Chiquita “ knew that FARC was a terrorist organization and that it kidnapped , killed and terrorized thousands of people in Colombia , ” the complaint ( PDF ) states , “ but [ they ] ignored these risks in order to further their own narrow business interests in growing and exporting bananas in Colombia . ”
The complaint goes on to say that Chiquita “ knowingly provided currency or monetary instruments , weapons ( including arms and ammunition ) , and other forms of material support and resources and transport of munitions ” to FARC .
Marc Gosalves , Thomas Howes , and Keith Stansell , employees of defense contractor Northrop Grumman , were traveling by plane in Colombia in 2003 when they were shot down by FARC rebels , who immediately killed the plane ’s pilot , Thomas Janis , and a Colombian guide accompanying them .
Gosalves , Howes and Stansell spent five years as FARC hostages before being released in 2008 .
All three are parties to the lawsuit , as are five members of Janis ’ family .
Chiquita was fined $ 25 million in 2007 for having paid $ 1.7 million to AUC , a right - wing paramilitary group at odds with FARC .
This would suggest that Chiquita played both sides of the long - running military conflict in Colombia .
ADVERTISEMENT
Chiquita Brands says it was “ an extortion victim in Colombia , paying left - and right - wing groups to protect its employees , not to promote violence , ” reports the Business Courier in Cincinnati , Ohio , where Chiquita Brands is headquartered .
But the lawsuit suggests Chiquita ’s involvement with FARC may have been more pro-active than simply paying protection money .
The suit alleges that the company created dummy corporations and falsified its payroll records to hide payments to FARC , and used its network of local transportation contractors to funnel weapons to the group .
Chiquita has a long and sordid history in Colombia .
The most notorious incident took place in 1928 , when the company was still known as United Fruit Company .
Colombian troops massacred an unknown number of UFC workers — believed to be in the thousands — during a protest over bad work conditions on the company ’s plantations .
Moscow , Russia ( CNN ) -- Russia has put an end to the adoption of children by American families until rules covering them can be hashed out with U.S. officials , a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday .
" Further adoptions of Russian children by the American citizens , which at present has been suspended , will only be possible in case such an agreement is reached , " said spokesman Andrei Nesterenko .
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow said there 's not too much reason for concern .
" I would say to American families that are in the process of adoption , not to worry too much , " said John Beyrle , U.S. ambassador to Russia .
" We 're working on this and we really do n't think that this will have any long - term effect on the ability of American families to adopt here . "
State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said officials are seeking to clarify the Foreign Ministry 's comments .
" The Russian government has not informed us of any suspension , " he said .
" We have not been informed of any change in Russian policy regarding adoptions . "
A State Department team is heading to Moscow next week to work out an arrangement that would allow adoptions to continue , a senior U.S. official told CNN .
A firestorm was created last week when 7 - year - old Artyem Saveliev 's American adoptive family put him on a solo , trans -Atlantic flight from the United States to Moscow .
They hired a Russian driver to deliver the boy from the airport to the Russian Ministry of Education .
Russian officials allowed CNN to see a copy of a letter addressed to the Ministry of Education and signed by Artyem 's adoptive mother , Torry Hansen , which the little boy carried when he arrived .
" To Whom It May Concern , " the letter reads , " This child is mentally unstable .
He is violent and has severe psychopathic issues / behaviors .
I was lied to and misled by the Russian Orphanage workers and director regarding his mental stability .
...
After giving my best to this child , I am sorry to say that for the safety of my family , friends and myself , I no longer wish to parent this child .
As he is a Russian National , I am returning him to your guardianship and would like the adoption disannulled [ sic ] . "
The abandonment of Artyem comes after the Russian media focused intense attention on several previous cases in recent years of abuse involving adopted Russian children in the United States .
Not surprisingly , some Russians are calling for an end to the practice of foreign adoption .
Russian officials have made public appeals for a temporary freeze of American adoption of Russian children until a proposed bilateral treaty has been signed to allow monitoring of children after they are brought to the United States .

If you 're wondering why I 'm wearing dark sunglasses , a fake moustache , and a baseball cap ( featuring the logo of professional curling team , The Floating Stones ) , I 'm on the lam .
I 'm dodging black remote - controlled helicopters , pasty - white systems administrators , and the combined forces of many daemons to bring you some of the best - kept secrets of UNIX ® power users .
Don your aluminum foil hat and read on .
Save the environment variables
Most UNIX users amass settings in shell startup files , such as . bashrc ( for the Bash shell ) and .zshrc ( for the Z shell ) , to recreate a preferred shell environment time and again .
Startup files can create aliases , set shell options , create functions , and set environment variables .
Essential environment variables include HOME ( which points to your home directory ) , PATH ( which enumerates directories in which to search for applications ) , and MANPATH ( which lists directories in which to search for man pages ) .
To see which environment variables are set in your shell , type printenv .
Consult your shell 's man page for a complete list of available environment variables .
Like the shell , you can customize many other UNIX applications through environment variables .
For example , the Java™ subsystem requires that you define JAVA_HOME to point to the root of a Java run time .
Similarly , the suite of Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) utilities mandates the use of AWS_CREDENTIAL_FILE to point to a file with valid private key credentials .
Individual applications provide environment variables , too .
The trick is discovering the variables .
Luckily , the work need not involve breaking and entering ; instead , simply consult the man page of the utility at hand and look for a separate section titled , " Environment Variables . "
For example , the pager utility less defines a number of useful environment variables :
The environment variable LESS stores command - line options , reducing what you type each time you invoke the pager .
For instance , if you read a good number of log files , put the following in a shell startup file : export LESS='-- RAW-CONTROL -CHARACTERS
--squeeze-lines -- ignore - case '
The options interpret control characters ( usually syntax coloring ) , reduce runs of blank lines to a single line , and ignore case in string matches , respectively .
If you work with code , try these options : export LESS='-- LINE - NUMBERS -- quit - if - one - screen -- quit - on - intr '
The environment setting named LESSKEY points to a file of key bindings .
You can use key bindings to customize the behavior of less , say , to match the behavior of another pager or editor .
, say , to match the behavior of another pager or editor .
Like the shell , less can maintain history between invocations .
Set LESSHISTFILE and LESSHISTSIZE to point to a file of persist commands and to set the maximum number of commands to record , respectively .
Another good application of environment variable can be found in the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) .
GCC defines a variety of environment variables to customize its operation .
LIBRARY_PATH , as its name implies , is a list of directories to search for libraries to link to ; COMPILER_PATH works much like the shell 's PATH but is used internally by GCC to find subprograms used during the compilation process .
If you write code and build binaries for a single platform , you may never use these environment variables , However , if you cross - compile the same code for a number of platforms , such variables are essential for accessing the varied headers and libraries for each platform .
You might set variables to one collection of values for one kind of machine and set the values to another collection for a system of an alternate flavor .
In fact , you can take a cue from GCC : Maintain many sets of environment variables per application and switch from one pool to another depending on the work at - hand .
One approach is to keep an environment initialization file in each project directory and source it as needed .
For instance , many Ruby developers use such a solution to switch between Ruby versions , changing environment variables PATH , GEM_HOME , and GEM_PATH as needed to hop from one version to another .
Dotting the landscape
Much like environment variables , many Linux® and UNIX applications provide a dot file — a small file whose name begins with a period — for customizations .
However , unlike environment variables that capture a handful of flags or a relatively tiny amount of information , a dot file can be much more extensive , even complex , with its own peculiar syntax rules and even its own programming language .
A dot file is a convenient place to keep options and settings , because ( per UNIX heritage ) file names that begin with a dot do not appear in a standard directory listing .
( Use ls - a to see these so - called hidden files . )
Except for its special name , a dot file is a plain text file .
A dot file is usually found in your home directory , but some utilities look for a dot file in the present working directory , too .
If an application supports more than one dot file , the program typically applies precedence rules to favor one file over another .
In general , a " local " dot file — one found in the current working directory — has highest precedent , followed by one in your home directory and then by a system - wide configuration .
None , one , or all of these files can exist , and it's up to the application to treat the files as mutually exclusive or incremental .
In the former case , the first dot file found in the precedent chain is definitive .
In the latter case , the configuration might cascade or be reconciled into a final result .
An example of a simple dot file is less 's key bindings file , located in $ HOME /. lesskey .
Each line in the file is a pair ( a keystroke and a command ) resembling something like the snippet below :
\r forw - line
forw - line e forw - line j forw - line ^E forw - line ^N forw - line k back - line y back - line ^Y back - line
At the other extreme , consider fetchmail .
The utility picks up e-mail from multiple remote sources and delivers the messages locally .
The operation of the utility is controlled solely through $ HOME /. fetchmailrc .
( See the man page for its many options . ) cron , git , vi , and many other commands recognize dot files , too .
Again , read the man page for the application to learn what you configure in a dot file .
Some dot files are rich enough to warrant a separate man page , such as crontab .
Shhh . . . secrets about SSH
Secure Shell ( SSH ) is a rich subsystem used to log in to remote systems , copy files , and tunnel through firewalls — securely .
Since SSH is a subsystem , it offers plenty of options to customize and streamline its operation .
In fact , SSH provides an entire " dot directory " , named $ HOME /.ssh , to contain all its data .
( Your .ssh directory must be mode 600 to preclude access by others .
A mode other than 600 interferes with proper operation . )
Specifically , the file $ HOME /.ssh / config can define lots of shortcuts , including aliases for machine names , per -host access controls , and more .
Here is a typical block found in $ HOME /. ssh / config to customize SSH for a specific host :
Host worker HostName worker.example.com IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_worker
User joeuser
Each block in ~/.ssh / config configures one or more hosts .
Separate individual blocks with a blank line .
This block uses four options : Host , HostName , IdentityFile , and User .
Host establishes a nickname for the machine specified by HostName .
A nickname allows you to type ssh worker instead of ssh worker.example.com .
Moreover , the Identity File and User options dictate how to log in to worker .
The former option points to a private key to use with the host ; the latter option provides the login ID .
Thus , this block is the equivalent of the command :
ssh joeuser@worker.example.com
-i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_worker
A powerful but little - known option is ControlMaster .
If set , multiple SSH sessions to the same host share a single connection .
Once the first connection is established , credentials are not required for subsequent connections , eliminating the drudgery of typing a password each and every time you connect to the same machine .
ControlMaster is so handy , you 'll likely want to enable it for every machine .
That 's accomplished easily enough with the host wildcard , * :
Host * ControlMaster auto ControlPath ~/.ssh/ master-%r@%h : %p
As you might guess , a block tagged Host * applies to every host , even those not explicitly named in the config file .
ControlMaster auto tries to reuse an existing connection but will create a new connection if a shared connection cannot be found .
ControlPath points to a file to persist a control socket for sharing .
%r is replaced by the remote login user name , %h is replaced by the target host name , and %p stands in for the port used for the connection .
( You can also use %l ; it is replaced with the local host name . )
The specification above creates control sockets with file names akin to :
master-joeuser@worker.example.com :22
Each control socket is removed when all connections to the remote host are severed .
If you want to know which machines you are connected to at any time , simply type ls ~/.ssh and look at the host name portion of the control socket ( %h ) .
The SSH configuration file is so expansive , it too has its own man page .
Type man ssh_config to see all possible options .
And here 's a clever SSH trick :
You can tunnel from a local system to a remote one via SSH .
The command line to use looks something like this :
$ ssh example.com - L 5000:localhost:3306
This command says , " Connect via example.com and establish a tunnel between port 5000 on the local machine and port 3306 [ the MySQL server port ] on the machine named ' localhost . ' "
Because localhost is interpreted on example.com as the tunnel is established , localhost is example.com .
With the outbound tunnel — formally called a local forward — established , local clients can connect to port 5000 and talk to the MySQL server running on example.com .
This is the general form of tunneling :
$ ssh proxyhostlocalport : targethost : targetport
Here , proxyhost is a machine you can access via SSH and one that has a network connection ( not via SSH ) to targethost .
localport is a non-privileged port ( any unused port above 1024 ) on your local system , and targetport is the port of the service you want to connect to .
The previous command tunnels out from your machine to the outside world .
You can also use SSH to tunnel in , or connect to your local system from the outside world .
This is the general form of an inbound tunnel :
$ ssh user@proxyhost - R proxyport: targethosttargetport
When establishing an inbound tunnel — formally called a remote forward — the roles of proxyhost and targethost are reversed :
The target is your local machine , and the proxy is the remote machine .
user is your login on the proxy .
This command provides a concrete example :
$ ssh joe@example.com - R 8080:localhost:80
The command reads , " Connect to example.com as joe , and connect the remote port 8080 to local port 80 . "
This command gives users on example .com a tunnel to Joe 's machine .
A remote user can connect to 8080 to hit the Web server on Joe 's machine .
In addition to -L and - R for local and remote forwards , respectively , SSH offers - D to create an HTTP proxy on a remote machine .
See the SSH man page for the proper syntax .
Rewriting with history
If you spend a lot of time at the shell prompt , recording shell history can save time and typing .
But there are a few annoyances with history , if left unmodified : History records duplicate commands , and multiple shell instances can clobber each other 's history .
Both complications are easily overcome .
Add two lines to your . bashrc :
export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth shopt -s histappend
The first line removes consecutive duplicate commands from your shell history .
If you want to remove all duplicates independent of sequence , change ignoreboth to erasedups .
The second line appends a shell 's history to your history file when the shell exits .
By default , the Bash history file is named ( yes , a dot file ) ~/~/.bash_history .
You can change its location by setting ( yes , an environment variable ) HISTFILE .
If you want to save a shell 's most recent 10,000 commands in a history file with 100,000 entries , add export HISTSIZE=10000 HISTFILESIZE=100000 to your shell startup file .
To see a shell 's history , type history at any prompt .
Saving a history of commands is of little use if you cannot recall it .
That 's the purpose of the shell ! , or bang , operator :
!! ( " bang bang " ) repeats the last command in its entirety .
( " bang bang " ) repeats the last command in its entirety .
!:0 is the name of the previous command .
is the name of the previous command .
!^ is the first argument of the previous command .
!:2 , !:3 , and so on , ending with !$ are the second , third , and eventually the last argument of the previous command .
is the first argument of the previous command . , , and so on , ending with are the second , third , and eventually the last argument of the previous command .
!* is all the arguments of the last command , except the command name .
is all the arguments of the last command , except the command name .
!n repeats the command numbered n in history .
repeats the command numbered in history .
! handle repeats the last command that begins with the string of characters in handle .
For example , ! ca would repeat the last command that began with the characters ca , such as cat README .
repeats the last command that begins with the string of characters in .
For example , would repeat the last command that began with the characters , such as .
!? handle repeats the last command that contains the string of characters in handle .
For example , !?READ would also match cat README .
repeats the last command that contains the string of characters in .
For example , would also match .
^original ^substitution replaces the first occurrence of original with substitution .
For example , if the previous command was cat README , the command ^README^license.txt would yield a new command cat license .
txt .
replaces the first occurrence of with .
For example , if the previous command was , the command would yield a new command .
!: gs/original / substitution replaces all occurrences of original with substitution .
( !:gs means " global substitution . " )
replaces all occurrences of with .
( means " global substitution . " ) !- 2 is the penultimate command , ! - 3 is third most recent command , and so on .
You can even combine history expressions to yield sigil soup such as !
- 2:0 - R !^ !- 3:2 , which would expand to the command name of the penultimate command , followed by - R , the first argument of the previous command , and the second argument of the third most recent command .
To make such cryptic commands more readable , you can expand history references as you type .
Type the command bind Space : magic - space at any prompt , or add it to a startup file to bind the Space key to the function magic - space , which expands history substitutions inline .
Expand -o- Matic
With so much code available on the Internet , you 're likely to download dozens of files every day .
And chances are , all those files are packaged differently — a ZIP file here , a RAR file there , and tarballs galore , albeit each one compressed with a different utility .
Remembering how to decompress and expand each package format can be taxing .
So , why not capture all those tasks in a single command ?
This function is widely available in many sample dot files :
ex ( ) { if [ -f $ 1 ] ; then case $ 1 in *.tar. bz2 ) tar xjf $ 1 ; ; *.tar.gz ) tar xzf $ 1 ; ; *.bz2 ) bunzip2 $ 1 ; ; *.rar ) rar x $ 1 ; ; *.gz ) gunzip $ 1 ; ; *.tar ) tar xf $ 1 ; ; *.tbz2 ) tar xjf $ 1 ; ; *.tgz ) tar xzf $ 1 ; ; *.zip ) unzip $ 1 ; ; *.Z ) uncompress $ 1 ; ; *.7z ) 7z x $ 1 ; ; *) echo " '$ 1 ' can not be extracted via extract ( ) " ;; esac else echo " '$ 1 ' is not a valid file " fi }
This function , ex , expands 11 file formats and can be extended if you deal with some other package type .
Once defined — say , in a shell startup file — you can simply type ex somefile , where somefile ends with one of the named extensions :
$ ls source $ tar czf source .
tgz source $ ls - 1 source source .
tgz $ rm - rf source $ ex source .
tgz $ ls - 1 source source .
tgz
By the way , if you ever misplace something you downloaded today , run find to discover it :
$ find ~ - type f - mtime 0
The command - type f looks for plain files , and - mtime 0 looks for files created since midnight of the current day .
Many more secrets
There are a lot more expert secrets to be discovered .
Search the Web for " shell auto - complete " to learn more about automatic completion , a feature that provides context - sensitive expansions as you type a command .
Also , search for " shell prompts " to learn how to customize your shell prompt .
You can make it colorful ; you can show your current working directory or Git branch ; you can also show the history number — a convenient reference if you recall history a good deal .
For working examples , search Github for " dot files . "
Many experts post their shell configurations on Github .
Now , if you 'll excuse me , I have to find my wig and bronzer .
It 's not easy to hide when you resemble Groucho Marx .

The BBC's Will Grant in Caracas says Mr Putin is perhaps Venezuela 's most important visitor since US President Bill Clinton in 1999 .
Our correspondent says the Venezuelan government is sending a message that it now has other powerful friends who share common bonds in energy , military hardware and international relations .
We are prepared to begin drawing up the first project for a nuclear power generator , obviously for peaceful purposes ...
We are n't going to make an atomic bomb
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
The Russian leader gave Mr Chavez a multi-million - dollar down payment for oil exploration rights in the Orinoco River Belt .
Mr Chavez added : " Russia offers help so that Venezuela can have its own industry for the use of outer space .
" We could install a satellite launcher here and a factory .
We are already doing so with China , but Russia is offering to support Venezuela build its own [ space ] industry . "
In a televised speech ahead of Mr Putin 's arrival , Mr Chavez said : " This is a truly important day for the country and for Latin America .
It is a visit of great importance .
We are forging , like steel , a new multi-polar world . "
At a joint news conference after their meeting , the Venezuelan leader said : " We are prepared to begin drawing up the first project for a nuclear power generator , obviously for peaceful purposes .
" We are n't going to make an atomic bomb , " he added .
Venezuela has recently suffered widespread power cuts and is looking to nuclear power as a solution .
US state department spokesman P J Crowley said that " to the extent that Venezuela is going to expend resources on behalf of its people , perhaps the focus should be more terrestrial than extraterrestrial " .
The US has expressed concern at Venezuela 's purchase of weapons from Russia .
However , no new deals have yet been announced .
Mr Chavez insisted : " We are not building an alliance against the United States .
We do n't care what Washington thinks . "
Mr Morales was expected to seek Russian loans to purchase military hardware and to discuss gas and oil exploration in Bolivia .

Try not to Panic , but There are Zombie Hookers in Florida .
Broward County , Florida , noted in 19990 for banning sales of the 2 Live Crew album , As Nasty as They Wanna be has another sex controversy – Zombie Hookers .
My intern , Ben ’s grandmother , who lives in West Palm , says it ’s just a couple of undead girls and they mostly stick to the cemetery .
“ They ’re really doing wonders for cleaning up prostitution in town ; although now I need a new accountant . ”

It ’s hard to believe that there ’s a crack whore crazy enough to have sex in a graveyard ; and it ’s even harder to believe that a john would follow her there .
That ’s a B - movie murder scene waiting to happen .
So we ’re skeptical about this WPBF report about purportedly human sex activity in West Palm ’s Evergreen Cemetery .
Rather , it sounds like we ’ve got a group of zombie hookers on our hands .
If that ’s the case , a little B - movie research will tell you that the best strategy is to simply let them be .
This is a transaction between consenting adults — horny men ; hungry zombies .
He gets laid .
She gets a tasty post - coital snack .
Everybody ’s happy .
So stay away , pitchfork - wielding mobs .
You do n’t want to provoke the undead .

( CNN ) -- A Rhode Island high school that fired all its teachers in February has reached a tentative agreement with the school 's teachers union to rehire them , the union announced Sunday .
The school board of the Central Falls School District , outside Providence , had voted to fire 93 staff members from its high school -- including teachers , administrators and other personnel -- over low student performance .
The deal between the union and the school district allows teachers to return to work for the 2010 - 2011 school year without having to reapply for their jobs , though the union said Sunday that " teachers will need to recommit to their jobs and interview with the new principal . "
The agreement , which must still be ratified by teachers , includes measures to improve student achievement , including a longer school day , targeted professional development for teachers and more after - school tutoring , the statement from the Central Falls Teachers Union said .
The school district and union have been working with a mediator since March .
" There has always been agreement on these points : that we all want what is best for our students , and that significant changes are needed at Central Falls High School , " teachers union president Jane Sessums said in the statement .
" Working together , we and the district have arrived at a solid , forward - looking agreement that provides support for our students and the tools our teachers need to help them succeed . "
A teacher ratification vote on the deal is scheduled for Monday afternoon .
In a move that drew national attention , the Central Falls school board had voted 5 - 2 to approve a plan by the school district 's superintendent to fire its high school staff , including the principal , three assistant principals and 77 teachers .
The vote came after the high school , which draws students from an impoverished enclave of Rhode Island , graduated just 48 percent of its seniors last year .
Of Central Falls ' 800 students , 65 percent are Hispanic and for most of them , English is a second language .
Half the students are failing every subject , with 55 percent skilled in reading and 7 percent proficient in math , officials said earlier this year .
President Obama publicly endorsed the school board 's vote .
" Our kids get only one chance at an education and we need to get it right , " he said in March .
But the move outraged the school 's teachers , who argued that they 'd accepted most terms of a plan by the school district 's superintendent to improve student performance .
The plan approved by the school board in February allowed teachers to re-apply for their jobs but stipulated that no more than 50 percent would get rehired .
The firings would have gone into effect at the end of this school year .
" From the start , my principal concern was not who would be working at the high school , but whether the new school leadership team would have the flexibility it needed to improve student achievement , " Central Falls superintendent Fran Gallo said in the statement provided by the teacher 's union .
" Today 's agreement provides this flexibility . "
Rhode Island officials applauded the tentative deal .
" I 'm glad both sides have ... [ reached ] this agreement , " Rhode Island Education Commissioner Deborah Gist said , according to the union 's statement .
" Now it 's time to move forward and work together to make Central Falls High one of the best in Rhode Island . "
A recent study provides intriguing information about the neural dynamics underlying behavioral changes associated with the development of new problem solving strategies .
The research , published by the Cell Press in the May 13 issue of the journal Neuron , supports the idea of " a - ha " moments in the brain that are associated with sudden insight .
Our daily lives are filled with changes that force us to abandon old behavioral strategies that are no longer advantageous and develop new , more appropriate responses .
While it is clear that new rules are often deduced through trial - and - error learning , the neural dynamics that underlie the change from a familiar to a novel rule are not well understood .
" The ability of animals and humans to infer and apply new rules in order to maximize reward relies critically on the frontal lobes , " explains one of the researchers who led the study , Dr. Jeremy K. Seamans from the Brain Research Centre at the University of British Columbia ( UBC ) and Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute .
" In our study , we examined how groups of frontal cortex neurons in rat brains switch from encoding a familiar rule to a completely novel rule that could only be deduced through trial and error . "
Specifically , Dr. Seamans with colleagues from UBC and collaborator Dr. Daniel Durstewitz from the Central Institute of Mental Health in Germany were interested in determining whether networks of neurons change their activity in a slow gradual way as an old strategy is abandoned and a new one is learned or whether there is a more abrupt transition .
Using sophisticated statistical techniques to study ensembles of neurons in the medial frontal cortex on a trial - by - trial basis as rats deduced a novel rule in a specially designed task , they found that the same populations of neurons formed unique network states that corresponded to familiar and novel rules .
Interestingly , although it took many trials for the animals to figure out the new rule , the recorded ensembles did not change gradually but instead exhibited a rather abrupt transition to a new pattern that corresponded directly to the shift in behavior , as if the network had experienced an " a - ha " moment .
Taken together , these findings provide concrete support for sudden transitions between neural states rather than slow , gradual changes .
" In the present problem solving context where the animal had to infer a new rule by accumulating evidence through trial and error , such sudden neural and behavioral transitions may correspond to moments of ' sudden insight , ' " concludes Dr. Durstewitz .
The researchers include Daniel Durstewitz , University of Heidelberg , Mannheim , Germany ; Nicole M. Vittoz , University of British Columbia , Vancouver , Canada ; Stan B. Floresco , University of British Columbia , Vancouver , Canada ; and Jeremy K. Seamans , University of British Columbia , Vancouver , Canada .
Facebook Inc. execs have called an all - company meeting today to discuss widespread criticism of the social network 's privacy policies .
In an e-mail to Computerworld this morning , a Facebook spokesman confirmed that the company will hold a meeting later today to discuss privacy issues , but he would not say whether executives are looking to make significant changes to the popular site 's highly contentious privacy policies .
" We have an open culture , and it should come as no surprise that we 're providing a forum for employees to ask questions on a topic that has received a lot of outside interest , " said Andrew Noyes , the Facebook spokesman .
Noyes would not comment on whether Facebook also plans to announce any changes to the policy today , or if officials are working on new privacy tools .
The blogosphere , though , is heating up quickly with rampant conjecture about today 's meeting , since it comes on the heels of the latest brouhaha from critics about privacy protections on the site .
Last month , Facebook unveiled a bevy of tools aimed at extending the social network 's reach across the Web by letting user information be shared with third - party Web sites .
That move stirred up a hornets ' nest of controversy from critics who said that users should n't have to share personal information with other Web sites unless they opt into the program .
The moves gained the attention of Congress , whose criticism prompted a meeting between Facebook officials and the staff of Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y . ) .
And yesterday , a coalition of European data protection officials called the Facebook changes " unacceptable . "
In an interview with Computerworld last week , Ethan Beard , director of the Facebook site 's developer network , defended Facebook 's policies and even said users love the changes that the company has made .
Related Blogs Mitch Wagner : Solve your Facebook privacy problem in under a minute
" People are actively opting in to engage with the social Web , " said Beard .
" The response from users speaks very , very loudly that they love what we 're doing .
I think there 's a lot of other talk that 's not coming from users necessarily .
There 's been a lot of interest from the media , from organizations and officials . "
Ezra Gottheil , an analyst at Technology Business Research , however , said that Facebook is looking down the barrel at some significant user pushback unless the privacy issues are resolved .
" Facebook is increasingly perceived as having a privacy problem .
For Facebook , that 's a problem , " he added .
" Their reputation is at stake .
I think we 'll see changes coming . "
According to Gottheil , without any changes to Facebook 's privacy policies , users may become increasingly open to jumping ship to another social network .
He said the problem must be fixed quickly and noted that today 's meeting could mark the beginning of a more acceptable policy .
" Right now , they 're leaving a gigantic market opportunity for someone to come along and make a new and better Facebook with better and more transparent privacy controls , " he said .
" There are no clear alternatives right now , but reputations can deteriorate quickly .
Like BP .
Just one big leak , one big news story , and they could be in trouble . "

A new Resident Evil 7 making of video has gone behind the scenes of the recent horror game to reveal its development and some of the things we never got to see , like the Baker family dog , a breath - holding mechanic and the original CG movie created to sell the tone .
You can watch the video up there for all the details but here are three of the best bits :
The Bakers nearly had a dog called Diane
Koshi Nakanishi , director :
" In the early stages we were trying all kinds of new ideas but there were a lot of things that did n’t make the cut .
For example , looking back now one of the things I wish we could have kept was that the family used to have a pet dog .
I forget its name , I think it was Diane , and it was part of the dinner scene , I think .
For one reason or another we had to cut it , which is a shame .
Thinking back now I wish we could have kept that . "
There were zombies that reacted to breathing
Jun Takeuchi , executive producer :
" We prototyped a few concepts , one of which was , we were going to have zombies which would react to human breathing and to get past them you had to hold down a button to hold your breath .
There would be a limit to how long you could hold it , with a breath gauge that would go down as you held the button , and if you did n’t get past them in time then the zombies would find you and grab you .
It was a really fun idea but we found people tended to tense up and hold their breath for real making it very tiring to play .
It was a great idea on paper but we ditched that because we thought doing that for 15 hours would give people hypoxia . "
Capcom started with a pitch movie to set tone and tested it on their western office
Masachika Kawata , producer :
" When the project officially kicked off in February 2014 , the first thing Takeuchi - san wanted to do was make a kind of ' pitch movie ' that would show off the concept .
So he quickly put together this very short CG movie which was not focused on the Resident Evil - ness of the game but the new horror style we could make with the tools available .
We thought the movie was so good that we sent it over to our western office and they loved it .
They sent us back a reaction video that they ’d taken and in that video one of the younger staff members in particular had her face twisted in fear .
That really motivated us because it told us we were were on the right track . "
In interesting to see how the change in style came around , especially Capcom 's own acknowledgement that previous instalments had ' lost their identity . '
Hopefully ' Part Two ' and beyond will dish out some more secrets .
Notes : Aprihop is an American IPA brewed with Pilsner and Crystal malts .
It 's massively hopped -- in the continuous fashion , of course ! -- and the flavor is complemented by the addition of apricots .
After fermentation , the beer is dry hopped with irresponsible amounts of Amarillo hops .
The beer has a hoppy aroma , with the apricots playing a supporting role .
The flavor is rich with late hop flavors , and its bitterness is tempered by just the right amount of malt sweetness and fruity undertones from the apricots .

Israeli security forces clashed with some 100 young protesters as they attempted to demolish a house in the West Bank settlement of Hashmonaim on Thursday .

The forces arrived in the settlement in the early morning and succeeded in razing two illegally built structures , but faced enormous opposition before they were able to demolish a third .
The owners of the 3 - story building in question had apparently invested some NIS 2 million in the property .
They tried to show the security forces proof that the house had been built legally , but their attempt was rejected .
The family barricaded themselves inside the building for a few hours , leading the troops eventually to evacuate them by force .
Six settlers and three Israel Defense Forces soldiers were lightly injured earlier this week during clashes that erupted when troops arrived to dismantle a synagogue at the illegal West Tapuah outpost in the West Bank .
Seventeen settlers were arrested in the scuffle , including a woman who pushed an IDF soldier off the roof of the building .
But the troops made no attempt to move the adjacent trailer homes , bringing accusations that the government is not serious about meeting U.S. demands to dismantle dozens of unauthorized outposts .
The Palestinian Authority has repeatedly said that any attempt by Israel to continue building settlements would negate upcoming peace talks , and has demanded a U.S. guarantee that Israel abide by a construction freeze declared last December .
WASHINGTON ( 31 March 2010 ) -- About 1.6 million people -- mostly women and children -- die each year from indoor air pollution caused by cooking and heating with wood , dung , coal or crop waste , according to the World Health Organization .
Justin Henriques , a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow at the University of Virginia and co-executive director of Least of These International ( LOTI ) , thinks he might have an answer to help solve the problem .
The IEEE student member will present findings on his biogas digester system at the IEEE Green Technologies Conference , 15 - 16 April , at the Gaylord Texan Resort and Convention Center in Grapevine , Texas .
Early registration has been extended to Friday , 2 April .
http://www. ieeegreentech .
org
Speaking on the ScienceNews Radio Network show Promise of Tomorrow ( http://www. promiseoftomorrow. biz / bizradio / 032110 / 032110 . htm ) , Henriques explained how his team updated 1930s biogas digester technology to allow the units to convert animal waste into enough methane gas daily to sustain a household of eight .
The difference from previous attempts to utilize such fuel sources , he said , is the compact size , ease of construction , sustainability through easily available materials , low cost and rapid installation via a pre-packaged system .
The fuel Henriques and the LOTI team used in Western Kenya was a mixture of cow manure and water .
" Through that anaerobic fermentation process , you actually kill most of the pathogens that would cause sickness from the manure in the first place , " Henriques said on the program .
The conference will explore emerging technologies in renewable energy , alternative fuel , alternative vehicle power sources and technologies to promote energy conservation in the home and business .
It will also look at the social , economic and political impacts of renewable energy sources , as well as the social and economic impact of new technologies .
IEEE -USA and Oncor , the largest regulated electric delivery business in Texas , are cosponsors of the IEEE Green Technologies Conference .
Oncor Senior Vice President Jim Greer , who oversees asset management and engineering , will be a keynote speaker on 16 April and discuss his company 's Smart Grid Initiative .
Representatives from the following universities , among others , are participating : the University of Tokyo ; Birla Institute of Technology , India ; the University of the West Indies at St. Augustine , Trinidad and Tobago ; Southern Illinois University ; University of Southern California ; Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi ; and the University of Texas at Arlington .

I hate these parties !
And I hate corsets !
I 'm so progressive , clearly what I need is a place to go that is n't Victorian England !
Like Edwardian England !
LINDSAY DUNCAN
What a peculiar thing to say !
You 're a peculiar girl !
Just in case any audience members forgot they are watching a Tim Burton movie , the main character does n't fit in !
LEO BILL
Mia , I 'd like to marry you even though you 're so peculiar and I am not !
Oops , nosebleed , excuse me .
Suddenly , MIA sees a CARTOON RABBIT checking his pocket watch .
MIA WASIKOWSKA
Oh my goodness !
A CGI creature that apparently has been created to in no way resemble an actual rabbit !
I must follow it .
She DOES .
She falls down a hole for a few minutes in order to force the film 's running time up to feature - length .

MIA finally lands in a room .
There 's black and white checkerboard patterns , stripes , swirls , all of the usual TIM BURTON SHIT .
MIA WASIKOWSKA
Huh .
Looks like " brilliant " and " imaginative " director Tim Burton has taken visuals from the Disney cartoon and made them slightly darker .
Such a visionary .
MIA finds a regularly - sized key that fits only in a tiny door .
She drinks a potion to shrink enough to fit through the door , then drinks a potion to grow enough to grab the key , then shrinks again to open the door , giving the player 10 points from ROBERTA WILLIAMS for solving the puzzle .
MIA WASIKOWSKA
Fantastic .
The key fit in my hand when I was normal sized , then I shrank and the key that still fit in my hand also fit in the door .
Ten minutes in and the movie has already stopped caring .
MIA encounters a bunch of CGI BULLSHIT .
CGI MATT LUCAS
I look like a CGI Stewie Griffin with an actual human 's face pasted onto it !
Is n't that whimsical , yet kind of creepy and dark ?
CGI TALKING FLOWERS
And look , we 're in the movie for a little while !
We were also in the cartoon !
So audience members with a sense of nostalgia that outweighs all of their other senses should be having an emotional reaction to this which could easily be misconstrued as enjoyment !

I 'm not rebooting the " Conan " franchise , am I ?
SUDDENLY some random BULLSHITS bust up the party .
MIA runs away and encounters JOHNNY DEPP dressed as the offspring of CARROT - TOP and MADONNA .
MIA WASIKOWSKA
Holy shit Depp , look at you .
If Tim Burton asks you to play dress - up for him one more time I think you should call the police .
JOHNNY DEPP
Mia !
You 've returned to kill the unassailable Jabberwocky !
MIA WASIKOWSKA
Well , I have no character motivation other than bored apathy , so , sure , why not ?
I think this is all a dream , so I 'll go along with whatever the plot requires of me , giving Burton a great excuse not to have to use his brainythink .
JOHNNY DEPP
Great !
Well , we 've got a lot of movie left , maybe we should do something exciting to add some freshness to this classic story .

So , how long do we have to wait before we can admit that the Tim Burton of the 80's and 90's is dead and that everything with his name attached these days is pretty much a pile of dog excrement scored by Danny Elfman ?

Seriously , where 's American McGee when you need him ?
MIA returns to the SURFACE .

Goldmans boss Lloyd Blankfein thanked clients for their support US bank Goldman Sachs has seen its profit for the first quarter of 2010 nearly double .
The bank reported net earnings of $ 3.46 bn ( £ 2.25 bn ) for the three months to March , up from $ 1.8 bn a year ago .
Goldman also revealed that it paid its employees about $ 5.5 bn in compensation , equivalent to 43 % of its revenue .
Earlier , the UK's Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) announced a formal enforcement investigation into the bank regarding recent fraud allegations .
' Spectacular figures '
The results were ahead of Wall Street expectations , with revenue coming in at $ 12.8bn , up 36 % on the year , and beating forecasts of $ 11bn .
The firm 's net earnings were up 92 % from a year earlier .
BBC business editor Robert Peston described the results as " another spectacular set of figures " .
In light of recent events involving the firm , we appreciate the support of our clients and shareholders
Lloyd Blankfein , Goldman Sachs chief executive
How US media has reacted Goldman 's $ 5.5 bn pay pot is spread across the bank 's 33,100 employees , implying an average of $ 166,000 each .
However , the proportion of compensation to revenues was lower than a year ago , when the bank set aside 50 % of revenues for remuneration .
Like other US investment banks that have already reported , Goldman 's revenues were dominated by its debt trading business , accounting for 58 % of the broker 's total revenues .
" In light of recent events involving the firm , we appreciate the support of our clients and shareholders , and the dedication and commitment of our people , " chief executive Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement .
UK inquiry
The FSA 's earlier announcement followed claims made by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) in the US that Goldman had defrauded investors during the sub - prime housing crisis .
The FSA 's decision to investigate Goldman ... is another embarrassment for the world 's most successful hedge fund
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert 's blog On Friday , the SEC issued civil charges against Goldman , alleging that it failed to disclose conflicts of interest during the marketing of sub - prime mortgages in which investors lost $ 1bn .
The SEC said Goldman failed to disclose " vital information " that one of its clients , Paulson & Co , had helped to choose which securities were packaged into the mortgage portfolio .
These securities were sold to investors in 2007 .
Goldman has strongly rejected the SEC 's claims as wrong " in fact and law " .
The FSA has said it will liaise closely with the SEC in its review .
Goldman has said it will co-operate with the FSA .
It is unusual for the FSA to announce the beginning of a formal investigation .
It is understood that the investigation process typically takes months , if not years .
[ an error occurred while processing this directive ]
The enforcement division of the FSA will now have powers to demand that Goldman provide it with documentation such as records of transactions and records of telephone calls .
If the watchdog finds Goldman at fault , it could impose a fine on the bank .
Lawsuit ' bandwagon '
Bruce Packard , banking analyst at Seymour Pierce , said : " It seems like it is just starting .
" I 've always been slightly surprised that investors have n't gone after the investment banks in the way they did after the internet bubble . "
On Sunday , Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for the FSA to launch an inquiry into Goldman Sachs .
" Hundreds of millions of pounds have been traded here and it looks as if people were misled about what happened , " he said .
" I want the Financial Services Authority to investigate it immediately . "
In addition to the regulatory actions against Goldman , the German government and insurance company AIG have both said they are considering bringing private legal cases over money they lost on sub - prime debt that the firm sold to them .
" I expect everybody will jump on the bandwagon now , " said Richard Bove , equity analyst at Rochdale Securities , who thinks that the cost to Goldman of defending lawsuits could be enormously expensive over the next few years .
Despite this , Goldman seems optimistic about defending these cases , saying it has set aside only $ 21 m of cash to cover the cost of " litigation and regulatory proceedings " .
In contrast , rival JP Morgan , who is concerned about possible lawsuits over mortgages it sold to the government agencies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , said it had provisioned $ 2.3 bn in the first quarter .
' Incredibly arrogant '
However , Mr Bove says he doubted that the bad publicity would cause Goldman to lose any customers , because in his view , the Wall Street firm is simply too dominant .
" The services it provides in the trading sector are not easy to replicate , " he says .
" There is no other company that could jump up and take its place . "
He added that the firm had " done a horrendously bad job over PR .
They have come across as incredibly arrogant [ but ] clients still do business with them . "

After its previous bandwidth provider had to take the site offline due to concerns over an aggressive Hollywood injunction , today The Pirate Bay is fully back in operation with a surprising new supplier .
From a few hours ago , in a move intended to " stand up for freedom of expression " , the Swedish Pirate Party became the site 's new host .
Following an injunction obtained by several major Hollywood movie studios , yesterday Pirate Bay bandwidth provider CB3ROB Ltd. & Co. KG took the decision to take the site offline while it digested the legal implications .
That meant that for several hours The Pirate Bay , for the first time in many months , was taken offline .
An insider at the site told TorrentFreak that people should n’t worry , and that the site would soon return .
By start of play this morning that promise had been kept .
In most corners of the globe , the world ’s most resilient BitTorrent tracker was living up to its name by coming back online with a new and as yet unnamed host .
Now the identity of the site ’s ISP has been revealed , and it is a somewhat of a surprising revelation .
“ Today , on 18 May , the Swedish Pirate Party took over the delivery of bandwidth to The Pirate Bay , ” says the Party ’s Rick Falkvinge in a statement .
“ We got tired of Hollywood ’s cat and mouse game with the Pirate Bay so we decided to offer the site bandwidth , ” he adds .
“ It is time to take the bull by the horns and stand up for what we believe is a legitimate activity . ”
The Pirate Party say they will provide bandwidth to the site ’s homepage and search engine .
“ The Pirate Bay is a search engine , and as such it is not responsible for the results , ” notes Falkvinge .
The Party adds the attempts at censoring The Pirate Bay “ is an attempt to silence one of today ’s most important opinion makers in matters of civil liberties and rights on the web , ” adding that it is “ nothing less than political censorship , and something that any democratic - minded person must reject . ”
With a general election coming up in Sweden , the Pirate Party ’s move is also an attempt to reiterate what the Pirate Party stands for .
“ It feels great to get an opportunity like this to demonstrate that we put our money were our mouth is , ” Falkvinge told Torrent Freak .
“ We ’re not your run -of - the - mill politician who commissions reports and spends 8 hours a day avoiding blame .
We ’re people committing our own resources and time to the values we believe in . ”
“ The only thing we have in common with today ’s politicians is that you can vote for us , and I hope this demonstrates how we are prepared to take responsibility for civil liberties and the future of the net in a very direct way , ” he added .
Meanwhile , a Pirate Bay insider remains vague about the exact location (s ) of the Pirate Bay servers , and ensured Torrent Freak that nothing is as it seems .
The important thing though , is that the site is fully functional again .
Some scientists have created a brilliant way to get attention for their desktop telescopes .

The Liberal Democrats have set out plans to reopen thousands of miles of railway tracks and stations .
The scheme would be funded by cutting capital spending on roads by £ 3 bn .
Its new Rail Expansion Fund would lead to the biggest expansion of the rail network since the Victorian era , the party claims .
Research group the RAC Foundation said it would be a waste of taxpayers ' money when only 7 % of UK journeys were made by train , compared to 90 % by car .
However , Lib Dem transport spokesman Norman Baker said the plan would " make our railway great again " .
Councils and transport authorities could bid for money from the Rail Expansion Fund to improve , reopen or establish services .
Although exact decisions on which services could be expanded would not be made until bids were received , the Lib Dems have drawn up a list of schemes which could be suitable for early delivery .
High speed rail is hugely important , but it is only part of the 21st - century rail network Britain needs
Norman Baker , Lib Dem transport spokesman
These include the electrification of lines from Manchester to Liverpool , Leeds and Preston ; from Birmingham to Bristol and Basingstoke ; and between Leeds and York .
New or reopened stations could be funded in Ilkeston , Kidlington , Wantage , Corsham , Tavistock , Middlewich , Ashington , Blyth , Washington and Skelmersdale .
New lines could link Southport with Preston , Bournemouth with Ringwood and the Midlands main line with the Birmingham - Derby route .
And track could be reopened between Exeter and Okehampton ; Tavistock and Plymouth ; Penrith and Keswick ; and Galashiels and Carlisle .
The policy announcement by the Lib Dems comes a month after the government outlined its plans for a new high - speed rail network , featuring 250 mph trains , which would include a new line between London and Birmingham , with future extensions planned to northern England and to Scotland .
At the time , the Conservatives said that if they were elected to power , they would start work on the project in 2015 - two years earlier than the government 's plan .
Revitalise railways
But in launching the Lib Dems ' plans for the railways , Mr Baker criticised both of their major rivals .
Mr Baker said : " Labour has allowed the railways to wither on the vine and punished passengers with huge fare hikes while more polluting forms of transport have got cheaper .
" All the while , the Tories have been sharpening the axe they will take to the transport budget .
" High speed rail is hugely important , but it is only part of the 21st - century rail network Britain needs . "
The Lib Dems would cut the government 's major roads project for the years up to 2013 / 14 by 90 % and divert almost £ 3.5 bn to rail , according to Mr Baker .
Some £ 480 m - currently intended for projects like motorway widening and hard shoulders - would go towards the Lib Dems ' existing policy of cutting rail fares .
The remaining £ 2.95 bn would go into the Rail Expansion Fund .
RAC Foundation Prof Stephen Glaister said : " To start cutting the roads budget to expand rail services is unlikely to be the best use of scarce taxpayers ' money either in financial terms or by way of serving the vast majority of the population .
" The public liability does not just end once new lines are constructed .
Rail services are heavily subsidised by the Exchequer . "
Prof Glaister said building roads could also help the environment because steadily moving traffic produced less carbon dioxide than cars stuck in traffic jams .

( MADRID ) - French President Nicolas
Sarkozy threatened to pull his country out of the euro currency group to force Germany to help Greece with its debt crisis , El Pais newspaper reported Friday , quoting Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero .
Sarkozy made the threat at a Brussels summit of EU leaders last Friday that sealed a rescue package , Zapatero told a meeting with leaders of his Socialist Party on Wednesday , the newspaper reported .
Germany , Europe 's biggest economy , has been the most reluctant euro nation to help the Greek government .
However the French president demanded " a commitment by everyone , for everyone to help Greece , each according to his means or France would reexamine its situation in the euro , " Zapatero was quoted as saying .
" Sarkozy banged his fist on the table and threatened to withdraw from the euro , which twisted the arm of Angela Merkel , " the German chancellor , a Socialist official who heard Zapatero 's account was quoted as saying .
The Brussels summit finally agreed a 110 - billion - euro ( 140 - billion - dollar ) three - year package of loans and credit guarantees for Greece , which had risked defaulting on its huge debts .
" France , Italy and Spain put up a common front against Germany and Sarkozy went so far as to threaten to break the traditional Franco - German axis , " according to another person at the meeting .
France and Germany are traditionally considered the central motor of EU initiatives .
Spain and Portugal also face major debt problems and Zapatero announced new austerity measures on Wednesday .
El Pais said the Spanish leader has used increasingly dramatic rhetoric in recent days to convince his party of the gravity of the crisis facing the euro .
Pulling an image out of a person 's brain is a feat that is hard to believe , but Dr. Jack Gallant of the UCB psychology department seems to have gone this accomplishment one better .
In a recent experiment , Dr. Gallant claims to have made it possible to reproduce video images from human brain activity .
Would you post your thoughts on Youtube ?
Although this research has not yet been peer reviewed , Dr. Gallant and his colleague Shinji Nishimoto have used fMRI to scan the brains of two patients as they watched videos .
According to the Times Online :
" A computer program was used to search for links between the configuration of shapes , colors and movements in the videos , and patterns of activity in the patients ’ visual cortex .
" It was later fed more than 200 days ’ worth of YouTube internet clips and asked to predict which areas of the brain the clips would stimulate if people were watching them .
" Finally , the software was used to monitor the two patients ’ brains as they watched a new film and to reproduce what they were seeing based on their neural activity alone .
" Remarkably , the computer program was able to display continuous footage of the films they were watching — albeit with blurred images . "
For example , in one scene which featured Steve Martin wearing a white shirt , the software recreated his shape and torso but missed other details , like his facial features .
“ Some scenes decode better than others , ” said Gallant .
“ We can decode talking heads really well .
But a camera panning quickly across a scene confuses the algorithm .
This appears to be the first instance in which video scenes were recovered ; previous work has been done to recover spatial memories seen in the hippocampus via fMRI .
This capability has been presaged in science fiction .
Fans may recall the movie The Final Cut , starring Robin Williams and Mira Sorvino .
In the film , a special implant makes it possible to record the internal images that a person sees and remembers .
Robin Williams is a " cutter " who provides edited versions of a person 's internal images - a " rememory " .
Also , fans of the sci - fi series Farscape may recall the Aurora Chair ; employed throughout the Peacekeeper military .
It peels back the layers of the mind one by one , until all thoughts and memories are exposed and displayed on a screen attached to the chair ( see video ) .

DAKAR , Senegal — President Umaru Yar ’Adua of Nigeria , whose chronic ill health sapped initial promises of reform and led to a constitutional crisis in his country , died Wednesday night , the information minister said in a brief interview .
He was 58 .
“ He has died , ” said the minister , Dora Akunyili , adding that Mr. Yar ’Adua had expired at the presidential villa in the capital , Abuja .
Mr. Yar ’Adua suffered from kidney and heart ailments , and his health had been one of the country ’s top concerns for weeks , ever since he departed at the end of November for emergency treatment in Saudi Arabia .
He did not transfer power when he left .
In the following months , Nigeria , already racked by low - level civil wars over oil and religion , was left in limbo .
There was no center of authority , and a peace plan Mr. Yar ’Adua had enacted for the violence - plagued oil - producing south seemed in danger of falling apart .
The leader of the Haqqani Network claimed that the US air campaign against the Taliban and al Qaeda has been seriously impacted after a suicide attack on a CIA base in Afghanistan at the close of 2009 .
Siraj Haqqani , the leader of the Haqqani Network , a Taliban subgroup that operates in eastern Afghanistan , claimed that “ the accurate drone - strike operations against the mujahideen decreased 90 percent ” during an interview with Abu Dujanah al Sanaani for the newly established Al Balagh Media Center .
A translation of Siraj ’s interview was provided by Flashpoint Partners .
Siraj described the Jordanian al Qaeda operative and double agent who killed seven CIA personnel and his Jordanian intelligence handler at Combat Outpost Chapman in Afghanistan ’s Khost province on Dec. 30 as a “ big hero . ”
The suicide bomber lured CIA officials to a meeting by claiming to have information that would lead to Ayman al Zawahiri , al Qaeda ’s second in command .
“ [ S ] ome of the most senior officials in the American intelligence , the CIA – the best among the intelligence groups – were killed ” in the suicide attack , Siraj said .
“ And those killed in the American intelligence are the group responsible for chasing after the mujahideen in the region , and in particular the mujahideen leaders , and they worked for year in this field to the extent that they had influence in some of the neighboring countries , including Iraq , and after the demise of this group the backbone of the enemy broke and the accurate drone - strike operations against the mujahideen decreased 90 percent … ”
Siraj said the CIA “ created error in using spies , ” meaning that its attempt to turn Jordanian jihadi Abu Dujanah al Khurasani , who is also known as Humam Khalil Muhammed Abu Mulal al Balawi , into a double agent to be used to attack al Qaeda , had failed .
Khurasani was detained by Jordanian intelligence for running an online jihadi forum , and sent to Afghanistan to penetrate the inner circles of al Qaeda ’s leadership .
But instead al Qaeda used Khurasani to strike back at the CIA .
Siraj also said that the suicide attack not only killed senior , experienced CIA officials , but the event created a “ loss of trust in spies as their efficiency shortened due to security problems in the region . ”
While Siraj ’s claims may be dismissed as Taliban propaganda , at look at the high value targets killed in the months before and after the suicide attack at Combat Outpost Chapman lend some weight to his words .
A comparison of the high value targets killed between August and December 2009 and those killed between January and mid-April 2010 shows a marked decrease in the killing of leaders and operatives of the highest importance .
From Aug. 1 , 2009 , to Dec. 31 , 2009 , the US carried out 22 airstrikes inside Pakistan .
During this time period , eight high value targets were killed .
Of those eight high value targets killed , seven were top - tier al Qaeda , Taliban , or allied movement leaders .
Those leaders are : Baitullah Mehsud , the overall leader of the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan ; Saleh al Somali , the leader of al Qaeda ’s external network ; Abdullah Said al Libi , the top commander of the Lashkar al Zil , al Qaeda ’s Shadow Army ; Mustafa al Jaziri , a senior Shadow Army military commander who sat on al Qaeda ’s military shura ; Zuhaib al Zahib , a senior Shadow Army military commander ; Tahir Yuldashev , the leader of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan ; and Najmuddin Jalolov , the leader of the Islamic Jihad Group , a breakaway faction of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan .
From Jan. 1 , 2010 to April 15 , 2010 , the US has carried out 28 airstrikes in Pakistan .
This is six more strikes over a period that is six week shorter .
Eight high value targets were killed during this time period .
Yet only two of the high value targets killed can be considered top - tier leaders : Sadam Hussein Al Hussami , a senior operative in al Qaeda ’s external operations network who was involved in the suicide attack at Combat Outpost Chapman ; and Qari Mohammad Zafar , a leader of the al Qaeda and Taliban - linked Fedayeen - i- Islam wanted by the US for attacking the US Consulate in Karachi in 2006 .
Granted , the air campaign in Pakistan is not only aimed at killing top al Qaeda , Taliban , and allied movement leaders .
The strikes also focus on hitting al Qaeda external operations network and groups based in Pakistan that are conducting attacks inside Afghanistan .
These targets are also important but receive far less attention than the top terrorist leaders .
It can not be said with certainty that the suicide attack on the CIA base at the end of the year has caused a significant decrease in the quality of high value targets killed in the Predator and Reaper strikes .
Other factors may contribute to this drop - off : a switch from targeting high value targets to the support networks , al Qaeda and Taliban purges of suspected spies , a decrease in quality of intelligence from the region , and better enemy operational security .
But the data does support the contention that there has been a significant decrease in top Taliban and al Qaeda leaders killed since the beginning of 2010 .

The cabinet under David Cameron will feature five Liberal Democrats including Nick Clegg
David Cameron is preparing for his first cabinet meeting as prime minister as he puts the finishing touches to his historic coalition government .
The Tory leader will announce a string of junior government posts , which will include further Lib Dem appointments .
He began the business of government on Wednesday evening with a first meeting of the new National Security Council .
It followed a press conference in the No 10 garden with deputy prime minister and coalition partner Nick Clegg .
The two men joked together as they set out what they wanted to achieve with their unprecedented power sharing arrangement - which Mr Cameron said could mark a " seismic shift " in British politics .
In addition to Mr Clegg , four other Lib Dems will be sitting around the cabinet table when the ministers gather at 0900 BST .
They are Vince Cable , who is business secretary ; Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Laws ; Energy and Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne ; and Scottish Secretary Danny Alexander .
ID cards
There are expected to be 20 Liberal Democrat ministers at all levels across many departments , meaning nearly half of the parliamentary party will be members of the government .
The majority of cabinet ministers carry on with the briefs they held in opposition but there was a return to frontline politics for former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith , who becomes work and pensions secretary .
Theresa
May was a surprise appointment as home secretary and she has already spoken of the challenges ahead as she tries to square the conflicting priorities of the coalition partners and deliver their jointly agreed programme .
She told BBC News : " We will be scrapping ID cards but also introducing an annual cap on the number of migrants coming into the UK from outside the European union . "
She said there was a " process to be gone through " to decide the annual limit .
The coalition government was committed to introducing elected police commissioners and cutting police paperwork to " give the police more time on the streets , " she added .
On the DNA database , she said : " We are absolutely clear we need to make some changes in relation to the DNA database .
For example one of the first things we will do is to ensure that all the people who have actually been convicted of a crime and are not present on it are actually on the DNA database .
" The last government did not do that .
It focused on retaining the DNA data of people who were innocent .
Let 's actually make sure that those who have been found guilty are actually on that database . "
National Security
One junior government post was revealed on Wednesday evening , when Dame Pauline Neville - Jones took her seat as security minister at the first meeting of the National Security Council .
The body , made up of senior ministers , military chiefs and the heads of the security services , discussed the military situation in Afghanistan .
It was also briefed on the UK's wider strategic and security position .
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg , Chancellor George Osborne and Foreign Secretary William Hague were among those who attended the Downing Street meeting .
The council was set up on Wednesday to co-ordinate the efforts of government departments and agencies to safeguard UK security .
A Downing Street spokesman said : " The prime minister this evening chaired the first meeting of the newly established National Security Council .
" The prime minister began the meeting by paying a full tribute to the UK's armed forces and expressed his personal admiration and gratitude for their dedication and sacrifice .
" He then received briefings on the political and military situation in Afghanistan , including from his new National Security Adviser , Sir Peter Ricketts , and from the Chief of the Defence Staff [ Sir Jock Stirrup ] .
The prime minister was then updated on the wider UK security situation . "
The Labour Party has meanwhile started the process of choosing a new leader after the resignation of Gordon Brown , who stood down as prime minster on Tuesday when it became clear that the Lib Dems had decided to join the Tories in a coalition .
Former Foreign Secretary David Miliband became the first potential candidate to announce plans to stand , saying he hoped others would follow suit .
He has the backing of heavyweight figures including former home secretary Alan Johnson and acting Labour leader Harriet Harman , both of whom have ruled themselves out of the running .
Backbench Labour MP
John Cruddas , who came third in Labour 's 2007 deputy leadership contest , has also said he is thinking about standing .

For Clapton , the tragedy is run through with feelings of guilt about how reluctant a father he had been when his son was alive .
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has signed a bill targeting a school district ’s ethnic studies program , hours after a report by United Nations human rights experts condemned the measure .
State schools chief Tom Horne , who has pushed the bill for years , said he believes the Tucson school district ’s Mexican - American studies program teaches Latino students that they are oppressed by white people .
ADVERTISEMENT
Public schools should not be encouraging students to resent a particular race , he said .
“ It ’s just like the old South , and it ’s long past time that we prohibited it , ” Horne said .
Brewer ’s signature on the bill Tuesday comes less than a month after she signed the nation ’s toughest crackdown on illegal immigration Ã¢â‚¬â€ a move that ignited international backlash amid charges the measure would encourage racial profiling of Hispanics .
The governor has said profiling will not be tolerated .
The measure signed Tuesday prohibits classes that advocate ethnic solidarity , that are designed primarily for students of a particular race or that promote resentment toward a certain ethnic group .
The Tucson Unified School District program offers specialized courses in African - American , Mexican - American and Native - American studies that focus on history and literature and include information about the influence of a particular ethnic group .
ADVERTISEMENT
For example , in the Mexican - American Studies program , an American history course explores the role of Hispanics in the Vietnam War , and a literature course emphasizes Latino authors .
Horne , a Republican running for attorney general , said the program promotes “ ethnic chauvinism ” and racial resentment toward whites while segregating students by race .
He ’s been trying to restrict it ever since he learned that Hispanic civil rights activist Dolores Huerta told students in 2006 that “ Republicans hate Latinos . ”
District officials said the program does n’t promote resentment , and they believe it would comply with the new law .
ADVERTISEMENT
The measure does n’t prohibit classes that teach about the history of a particular ethnic group , as long as the course is open to all students and does n’t promote ethnic solidarity or resentment .
About 1,500 students at six high schools are enrolled in the Tucson district ’s program .
Elementary and middle school students also are exposed to the ethnic studies curriculum .
The district is 56 percent Hispanic , with nearly 31,000 Latino students .
ADVERTISEMENT
Sean Arce , director of the district ’s Mexican - American Studies program , said last month that students perform better in school if they see in the curriculum people who look like them .
“ It ’s a highly engaging program that we have , and it ’s unfortunate that the state Legislature would go so far as to censor these classes , ” he said .
Six UN human rights experts released a statement earlier Tuesday saying all people have the right to learn about their own cultural and linguistic heritage , they said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Brewer spokesman Paul Senseman did n’t directly address the UN criticism , but said Brewer supports the bill ’s goal .
“ The governor believes … public school students should be taught to treat and value each other as individuals and not be taught to resent or hate other races or classes of people , ” Senseman said .
Arce could not immediately be reached after Brewer signed the bill late Tuesday .
Burns Strider , of the American Values Network , makes a good point .
Why is Fox funding research to discredit a minister for believing in social justice ?
This past week , Glenn Beck publicly revealed that his staff is moving beyond simply twisting the news for ideological ends to now funding opposition research and internet attack campaigns with the stated purpose of destroying the personal credibility of pastors who dare to question statements made by FOX commentators .
By now , many people are probably familiar with Glenn Beck 's statement from a couple of weeks ago that any church that talks about " social or economic justice " is not of Christ but is instead spreading Nazi or communist propaganda , and that Beck 's listeners should leave those churches .
( Funny , Beck 's own Mormon faith uses those terms throughout its website . )
There was an immediate response from pastors around the country citing the overwhelming call for economic and social justice in Scripture ... and Rev. Peg Chemberlin , president of the National Council of Churches , provided a wonderful summary of the Scriptural case on the Huffington Post .
But the pastor who quickly rose to the lead of the Catholic , mainline , and evangelical rebuke of Glenn Beck was Rev. Jim Wallis , President of Sojourners .
And so with no scriptural or theological arguments to fall back upon , Glenn Beck apparently decided that his only option is to try to destroy Rev. Wallis personally .
Personal attacks are n't uncommon from partisan commentators , but what is especially troubling about this most recent development is that Glenn Beck is n't just planning to throw insults ; he said that he has been using his FOX staff to research everything that Rev. Wallis has ever said or done and to dig up dirt on the people who work with the pastor .
I know Rev. Wallis both professionally and as a friend .
I 've watched him coach my son in Little League baseball and prayed with him for the strength and success of our great nation .
Beck 's attacks are contextually fictitious to the point of being imaginary .
It 's quite sad , actually .
He 's about to overcook my grits .
But Rev. Wallis continues to take the high road , speaking out for the power and calling of social justice , refraining from personal attacks , and reminding us that Dr. King stood down injustice and promoted social justice by confronting , not attacking .
But that is all for another time .
Why is FOX funding research to discredit an American minister ?

Hertzfeld was part of the original design team for the Apple Macintosh , co-authoring the crucial " QuickDraw " graphics system and later building tools to make open - source software easier to use .
He 's been at Google since 2005 , and it sounds like he 'd disagree with Fortune 's ranking of it as the world 's fourth - best employer .
When Wired 's Steve Levy asked Hertzfeld about the " rigid standards and processes " at Google for a cover story on hacker culture ( not online now online ) , Hertfeld said of the company ,
I can't exercise my creativity in a way that gives me joy , which is my basic approach ...
My relationship to my work is that of an artist to his work .
Ouch .
Hertzfeld did go on to say his code can have a " big impact " on the world because of Google 's size , but that only applies to the innovations he can get through all the internal barriers at Google , like a system he created for grouping Google News search results .
And the company is , as we 've written before , big on barriers :
Not only is it very tricky for even geniuses to get hired , but there are also barriers to working once you 've arived .
Legendary programmer Ken Thompson , for example , was required to prove his mettle at a programming language he himself co-invented before Google would deploy his programs .
He never bothered , at least not by the time the book Coders at Work was published :
Peter Seibel : I know Google has a policy where every new employee has to get checked out on languages before they 're allowed to check code in .
Which means you had to get checked out on C [ which you co-created ] .
Thompson : Yeah , I have n't been .
Seibel :
You have n't been !
You 're not allowed to check in code ?
Thompson : I 'm not allowed to check in code , no ... I just have n't done it .
I 've so far found no need to .
Thompson has since invented an entire programming language for Google called Go , so the company did come around to trusting at least some of his code .
But based on Hertzfeld 's experience , it sounds like the company , despite swaddling employees in nice perks , has more tweaking to do before it lives up to its goal of become the preferred workplace of " the world 's best engineers . "

An exploding manhole on West 40th Street in Midtown shot flames three stories high at 1:40 p.m. Monday , and at least one other manhole cover blew off , fire officials said .
No injuries were immediately reported .
After the explosion , a firefighter yelled : “ It ’s not Disneyland , people .
Get the hell out of the way . ”
The manholes are on 40th between Seventh and Eighth Avenues , on the southern side of The New York Times building .
Both issued thick gray smoke .
Fire officials said the cause was not immediately clear .
Researchers from Royal Holloway , University of London have found that pregnant and postnatal women , while wanting to do the best for their baby , do not follow medical advice without question and are more likely to adopt practices their mothers and grandmothers carried out during their pregnancies .
The study by Professor Paula Nicolson and Dr Rebekah Fox from the Department of Health and Social Care at Royal Holloway is published in the Journal of Health Psychology and explores three recent generations of women 's experiences of pregnancy , questioning those who gave birth in the 1970s , 1980s and 2000s .
The women who were interviewed said they knew their mothers and grandmothers had their best interests at heart when they offered them advice .
For the older women questioned , the advice from their female relations was their main source of information .
The 1980s and 2000s group , however , had to reconcile what they heard from older generations with direct advice from their doctors , midwives and health visitors as well as the numerous health messages on the web and self - help books .
Professor Nicolson says , " It is much to the credit of contemporary women that despite the unprecedented pressures from the media , medicine and the ' pregnancy police ' that they are still able to filter - in the advice that really suits them from all these sources .
Each of the three generations found ways to ' resist ' what they considered inappropriate pressures from advisors and were more likely to follow advice given to them from their mothers and grandmothers even if it went against the medical professions advice .
" Women tend to discuss the advice they are given with their female relatives and this leads to resistance to some types of advice .
For example , despite being advised to cut down on caffeine during pregnancy one woman we questioned said she continued to drink tea because her grandmother told her it relieved her morning sickness . "
Professor Nicolson says women who take notice of general public health information about what is a healthy lifestyle , i.e not smoking , taking regular exercise , not taking drugs and drinking alcohol in moderation are those who are most likely to be in - tune with their bodies and can therefore ' use ' guidelines but not be constrained by them .
She added : " Taking all the guidelines too seriously leads to anxieties .
Lack of self - confidence also can lead to worry about ' doing the wrong thing ' which is potentially more harmful than taking the odd glass of wine or eating soft cheese . "

We 've assembled a list of trusted local lawyers that you can use to find the right Miami bankruptcy attorney to help you stop wage garnishment , prevent creditor harassment , get debt relief , and protect your property .
Types of Bankruptcy
A bankruptcy attorney can help you determine if the process is right for you or if other debt relief options are better suited to your needs .
If bankruptcy is appropriate for your situation , your lawyer will help you decide whether Chapter 7 bankruptcy ( often used by individuals or small business owners ) , Chapter 13 bankruptcy ( where debt repayment plans are established to help you get back on track ) , Chapter 11 ( business reorganization ) or some other form of Florida - specific bankruptcy process is best for you .
Why File For Bankruptcy ?
People wind up filing for bankruptcy for many reasons , often involving outside forces or unforeseen expenses : Medical debt and unexpected health care costs can quickly spiral out of control , credit card debt can accrue due to business expenses or needing to use a credit card during periods of unemployment and low cash flow , investments in the stock market , real estate or other financial vehicles might suffer due to a financial crisis , or a supply chain shutdown can cause debt to cascade in times of pandemic ( such as the coronavirus / COVID - 19 outbreak ) or due to oil price fluctuations .
In any of these situations , a bankruptcy attorney can help you find the best course of action .
IN DEFENSE OF GOVERNMENT ….
President Obama hosted a town - hall event in North Carolina yesterday at a Charlotte factory where they develop advanced battery technology .
The event was primarily devoted to talking about the economy , and it was well timed — the president spoke shortly after the encouraging monthly job numbers were released .
Towards the end of the Q&A , an attendee asked Obama about health care reform and taxes , and the president proceeded to deliver an answer that lasted … just over 17 minutes .
This led to some mockery from the media — for the record , I kind of liked the lengthy response , but I probably like in - depth discussions more than the typical political reporter — and Obama , at the end of his soliloquy , conceded , “ Boy , that was a long answer .
I ’m sorry . ”
What I found more interesting , though , was the president ’s remarks in defense of government itself .
He was talking about the need for an improved national electrical grid ( “ smart grid ” ) and the role government can and must play in tending to infrastructure needs .
Obama told his audience that work on the grid “ is an investment that only government , working with the private sector , can help to make . ”
“ You ’re hearing a lot of talk these days about government , and government is ‘ terrible , ’ and ‘ bureaucrats , ’ and ‘ they ’re taking over ’ and all this stuff .
Look , I do n’t want government any more than is necessary , but there are some things that Bob or any CEO ca n’t invest in .
Bob is not going to build the roads to get to Celgard .
No company is going to make investments for a public good .
None of you would expect a private company to fund our military or our firefighters .
There are just some things that you ca n’t do on your own , and the private sector is not going to do — it ’s not profitable because if Bob was the guy who had to build the road , he ’d have a whole bunch of other people driving on that road that were n’t paying for it .
So it ’s not a good investment for him .
“ That ’s where government comes in .
The same is true when it comes to something like the electricity grid .
We ’re going to have to help create that infrastructure , just like broadband lines , just like a whole bunch of basic 21st century infrastructure , so we ’ve got the platform in order to succeed and compete economically .
That ’s what the Chinese are doing .
That ’s what the Indians are doing .
That ’s what the Germans are doing .
That ’s what the United States is going to have to do . ”
I ’m always glad when the president does this .
One of Obama ’s larger , thematic tasks is changing the way people perceive the role of collective action through their government .
The right ’s response to his presidency is a hysterical attack on the very notion of government action , which makes it all the more important for the president to make statements like these .
Americans need a reminder that when it comes to some key policy challenges , the only sensible solution is for the country to use the government as a tool to act in the public ’s interest , taking steps businesses wo n’t take , and that individuals ca n’t take on their own .
In other words , more of this , please .

TEHRAN , April 23 ( UPI ) -- China inaugurated a missile plan in Iran last month , even as the United States and its allies were pressing Beijing to support a new round of tough economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic over its nuclear program , Jane 's Defense Weekly reports .
It 's a military relationship that goes back two decades and , in light of Russia 's reluctance to provide the Iranians with advanced air - defense missile system to counter possible U.S. or Israeli airstrikes , is set to expand .
Advertisement
Robert Hewson , editor of Jane 's Air -Launched Weapons , reported that the factory for assembling and producing Iran 's Nasr - 1 -- Victory 1 -- anti-ship missile was opened March 7 .
The Nasr is identical to China 's C-704 anti-ship missile , Hewson says .
Iran 's burgeoning defense industry , much of it controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps , has been producing Chinese - designed anti-ship missiles such as the C - 801 since the early 1990s .
The C -704 , developed by China Aerospace Group , targets ships of 1,000 - 4,000 tons displacement and is the equivalent of the U.S. AGM - 119 anti-ship missile .
With a range of 106 miles and a 240 - pound warhead , the C - 704 has a kill probability of 95.7 percent .
The Iranians , possibly with Chinese assistance , have even developed improved versions such as the Noor , an upgraded version of China 's C - 802 , with a longer range than the original and over - the - horizon capabilities .
Indeed , Hewson observed that " Iran has gone further than China in fielding the C - 802 , taking what was previously a land - and ship - launched weapon and producing an air - launched version that can be carried by Mi-17 helicopters and fast - jet types . "
Over the years Iran has developed a range of anti-ship missile systems from the Chinese weapons that gives the Islamic Republic 's regular navy and the IRGC 's naval arm the capability to exert a considerable degree of control over waters in the Gulf and the Persian Gulf .
This is the area from which U.S. naval forces would strike if hostilities erupt .
On Saturday , the IRGC concluded its annual three - day Great Prophet exercises in the Strait of Hormuz , the choke point gateway to the Gulf and a key energy artery , in a show of defiance against the United States .
The Nasr is a medium - range weapon that can be launched from warships or shore batteries and its development and planned mass production has been trumpeted by Tehran at a time when Iran 's military forces are making preparations to counter possible attacks .
" In a methodical and deceptively modest manner China has helped Iran take charge of all its surrounding waters and this work between the two nations continues , " Hewson reported .
" Follow - on versions of the Nasr are being developed to include an air - launched variant .
" There are other cooperative tactical missile programs under way and China 's design bureaus have displayed several ' export only ' weapons ( such as the C - 705 lightweight cruise missile ) that would seem set to follow the established route into Iran , " Hewson added .
" With such a solid relationship established between the two countries it is not difficult to see why China has been reluctant to commit to the Western push for sanctions against Iran . "
China , ever hungry for energy sources to fuel its expanding economy , imports around 12 percent of its oil from Iran and seeks to secure Iranian natural gas through overland pipelines -- another reason it has shown little enthusiasm for new U.N. sanctions on Iran .
Hewson said no Chinese envoys were seen at the opening of the Nasr factory conducted by Iran 's hard - line defense minister , Brig .
Gen. Ahmad Vahidi , but the event marked " another milestone in the continuing military / industrial bond between the two countries . "
Hewson observed that unlike Russia , China " has been very successful in offering Iran technology and capabilities that are actually wanted , as opposed to those that might be ' nice to have . '
" A path has been found through the factions within Iranian officialdom ( and its armed forces ) to deliver products that build trust in Beijing .
In return , China gains influence with Tehran that can be parlayed into access to Iran 's natural resources . "
While these Chinese - origin systems have provided Iran with invaluable missile technology , this has had little or no impact on the development of its ballistic missile capabilities .
" Iran 's strategic weapons can only ( ultimately ) involve it in a losing battle with the United States , ' Hewson concluded , " but its tactical weapons have already altered the regional balance of power in a much more practical way . "
It is now available for businesses .
Microsoft has said that Office will range in price from a limited , free Web version supported by ads to a full - blown version that costs $ 500 , both to be available to consumers in June .
Most analysts say they think Microsoft will hold on to its near monopoly on productivity software .
Richard Williams , the senior software analyst at Cross Research , said that most companies would continue to choose Office because it was familiar and safe .
“ This is not the cycle that will take away from Windows or Office , ” he said .
“ Most of the people calling the shots and paying the bills are in their 40s , and grew up with Microsoft . ”
Nonetheless , a host of businesses are chipping away at Microsoft either by offering free versions or by recommending to clients that they buy fewer copies of Office .
“ I think Office has run away from its users , ” said David Girouard , the president of Google ’s business software group .
“ Every company ought to have a few copies of it , but it has nothing to do with what most people need . ”
Users of the new version of Office will be able to share and work on the same documents and presentations over the Internet rather than e-mailing files back and forth to each other .
Microsoft has created a way for people to flip from the PC to online versions of Office to give users the best of both worlds .
If many of those functions sound familiar , it is because Google , Adobe and smaller companies like Zoho have been giving away Web - based apps that do much the same thing .
But the rival products have hardly made a dent in the sales of Office — a product used by 500 million people .
Over the last three years , Microsoft ’s share of the office software market has remained static at 94 percent , according to the research firm Gartner .
Adobe ranks second in office software revenue with almost 4 percent of the market , leaving scraps for about eight other companies .
Microsoft ’s business software group brought in $ 19 billion last year .
The last team to qualify for a Champions League spot in the Premier League outside the conventional top 4 ( Liverpool , Arsenal , Chelsea and Manchester United ) was Everton back in ’05 .
The five year trend is set to be broken once again as Tottenham and Manchester City faceoff this Wednesday for a place in the Premier League elite and a chance to play against some of Europe ’s finest teams next year .
Manchester City hosted Aston Villa for a thriller at the Eastlands and Tottenham played host to a much weaker Bolton side .
With Shay Given injured Marton Fulop , on loan from Sunderland , filled in for the injured keeper for the Citizen ’s most crucial game of the year .
City started off the match on the wrong foot as Carew scored a goal 16 minutes into the first half .
City continually pressed a tried creating chances but the Villa defense was resilient not giving any room for City to work with .
City would finally tie it up on a penalty given up by a sloppy tackle on Adam Johnson by Warnock .
Two minutes later Adebayor scored after a counter which started when Carew rattled the crossbar giving all City fans a scare .
Aston Villa ’s hopes of playing Champions League football next year were all but finished after a great run by Wright - Phillips which was completed by an even better shot by Craig Bellamy .
With Aston Villa out of the race Manchester City would look for Bolton to do their dirty work for them as Tottenham , who ’ve been having a great run at home recently hosted the Wanderers .
At White Hart Lane the Hotspurs were keen to end their 20 year drought of finishing underneath the top 4 .
Transfer recently have suggested that Modric and Gareth Bale were leaving at the end of this year .
Their performances today indicated to us that they ’ll really need to stay if they really want to compete in Champions League football next year .
Tottenham started the match the same way they ended it , taking and creating chances against an inferior Bolton side which struggled to take any shots on goal .
The Suprs would go up on a cracking strike from Tom Huddlestone , who ’s hoping to earn his place on the England squad this summer .
Gareth Bale continually impressed today weaving between Bolton defenders creating and taking chances of his own .
It ’s quite a shock to see how Bolton came out of this match only one goal down as Tottenham controlled the possession and made the most of it by creating chances .
Tottenham fan ’s were given something to think about as the match came to an end as the keeper Gomez began limping in what appeared to be a groin injury .
With Tottenham and Manchester City set to square off on Wednesday at the Stadium of Light , which team has the upper hand ?
We ’d love to hear from you , so leave a comment and make sure you check out our preview for Wednesday ’s game this Tuesday as the Premier League reaches its climax and we brace ourselves for the World Cup .

Europe 's Ariane 5 rocket has made its 50th flight from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana .
The rocket lifted away from the launch pad at 2201 GMT , carrying two telecommunications satellites with a combined mass of almost eight tonnes .
After failing on its very first mission in 1996 , the Ariane 5 has developed into a highly reliable vehicle with a dominant role in the launcher market .
About half the world 's large commercial comms satellites now launch on Ariane .
Friday 's dual payload included the SES Astra 3B spacecraft , which will deliver TV and broadband services to Europe and the Middle East , and the ComsatBW - 2 platform which will provide secure data links for the German armed forces .
The 5.4 - tonne Astra 3B was the first to be deployed by Ariane some 27 minutes into the flight ; the 2.4 - tonne ComsatBW - 2 was released six minutes later .
Ariane 's departure ended two frustrating months for the rocket 's operator , Arianespace .
The mission had been postponed three times since late March .
The previous launch attempt in early April even got to within a minute of blast - off before the countdown sequence was halted .
Inquiries set up to investigate the delays and quality control issues in the rocket 's preparation resulted in a regulator that maintains pressure in the vehicle 's super - cold ( cryogenic ) hydrogen and oxygen propellant tanks being exchanged .
The generic Ariane 5 launcher went into full commercial service in 1999 , and was followed a few years later by the beefed - up version , the ECA , which is capable of lofting nearly 10 tonnes of payload into a geostationary transfer orbit ( GTO ) some 36,000 km above the Earth .
The rocket has two solid boosters to lift it off the ground , a cryogenic main stage to do most of the work of getting into orbit , and an upper - stage to place the satellites in the target orbit , or GTO .
Friday 's mission marked the 36th consecutive successful launch for an Ariane 5 .
Highlights in the vehicle 's 14 - year - history include the launch of Europe 's flagship Herschel and Planck space telescopes last year ; the bloc 's 2 bn - euro Envisat Earth - observation spacecraft in 2002 ; and its " Jules Verne " robotic supply ship that went to the International Space Station ( ISS ) in 2008 weighing more than 20 tonnes .
European ministers have approved a programme to upgrade the rocket .
This " mid- life evolution " should enter service later this decade and give the vehicle a GTO capability of 13 tonnes .
Despite the late start to its 2010 launch campaign , Arianespace promises to fly six further Arianes this year , including a second ISS freighter called " Johannes Kepler " .

Finnish M24
All content copyright © 7.62x54r.net
Return to Models Introduction
One of the earliest Finnish rebuilding programs was undertaken by the Civil Guard .
The rifles were designated M24 and are the same basic pattern as the Russian M91 .
The funding for these rifles was raised by the Civil Guard Auxiliary known as the Lotta Svard and they are often known as  Lotta Rifles .
New barrels were purchased from the Swiss firm SIG and from three German firms .
The SIG barrels are marked " Schweiz - Industrie Gesellschaft Neuhausen " on the right of the chamber above the woodline .
The German barrels are marked " Bohler - Stahl " on the bottom of the barrel with no distinction between makers .
All M24 barrels are undated and have the Civil Guard crest of an S topped with three fir sprigs in a shield on the chamber .
All German barrels and the majority of Swiss barrels are heavier than the standard M91 barrel and have a " step " near the muzzle to accommodate a standard bayonet .
The SIG unstepped , or " straight " , barrels as pictured above are rare .

Variations M24rv
The Civil Guard cut down a small number of M24s to carbine length at the depot level to create the M24rv , which was patterned after the Army 's M27rv .

Sights M24s have the same type sights as the Russian Konovalov design of 1908 .
The primary difference is the Finns remarked the rear sight bases in meters utilizing the existing notches .
Occasionally an extra notch is cut at the rear of the base and is marked 2 ( 200 meters ) .
Typically the numbers are placed on the right side of the base which was left blank by the Russians , but there are lots of variations in the manner of the numbering and how the existing Russian numbers were treated .

Teacher Feature ...
The Blueberry Story :
The teacher gives the businessman a lesson by Jamie Robert Vollmer
" If I ran my business the way you people operate your schools , I would n't be in business very long ! "
I stood before an auditorium filled with outraged teachers who were becoming angrier by the minute .
My speech had entirely consumed their precious 90 minutes of inservice .
Their initial icy glares had turned to restless agitation .
You could cut the hostility with a knife .
I represented a group of business people dedicated to improving public schools .
I was an executive at an ice cream company that became famous in the middle1980s when People Magazine chose our blueberry as the " Best Ice Cream in America . "
I was convinced of two things .
First , public schools needed to change ; they were archaic selecting and sorting mechanisms designed for the industrial age and out of step with the needs of our emerging " knowledge society " .
Second , educators were a major part of the problem : they resisted change , hunkered down in their feathered nests , protected by tenure and shielded by a bureaucratic monopoly .
They needed to look to business .
We knew how to produce quality .
Zero defects !
TQM !
Continuous improvement !
In retrospect , the speech was perfectly balanced - equal parts ignorance and arrogance .
As soon as I finished , a woman 's hand shot up .
She appeared polite , pleasant -- she was , in fact , a razor - edged , veteran , high school English teacher who had been waiting to unload .
She began quietly , " We are told , sir , that you manage a company that makes good ice cream . "
I smugly replied , " Best ice cream in America , Ma'am . "
" How nice , " she said .
" Is it rich and smooth ? " " Sixteen percent butterfat , " I crowed .
" Premium ingredients ? " she inquired .
" Super - premium !
Nothing but triple A. " I was on a roll .
I never saw the next line coming .
" Mr. Vollmer , " she said , leaning forward with a wicked eyebrow raised to the sky , " when you are standing on your receiving dock and you see an inferior shipment of blueberries arrive , what do you do ? "
In the silence of that room , I could hear the trap snap … .
I was dead meat , but I was n't going to lie .
" I send them back . "
" That 's right ! " she barked , " and we can never send back our blueberries .
We take them big , small , rich , poor , gifted , exceptional , abused , frightened , confident , homeless , rude , and brilliant .
We take them with ADHD , junior rheumatoid arthritis , and English as their second language .
We take them all !
Every one !
And that , Mr. Vollmer , is why it 's not a business .
It 's school ! "
In an explosion , all 290 teachers , principals , bus drivers , aides , custodians and secretaries jumped to their feet and yelled , " Yeah !
Blueberries !
Blueberries ! "
And so began my long transformation .
Since then , I have visited hundreds of schools .
I have learned that a school is not a business .
Schools are unable to control the quality of their raw material , they are dependent upon the vagaries of politics for a reliable revenue stream , and they are constantly mauled by a howling horde of disparate , competing customer groups that would send the best CEO screaming into the night .
None of this negates the need for change .
We must change what , when , and how we teach to give all children maximum opportunity to thrive in a post - industrial society .
But educators cannot do this alone ; these changes can occur only with the understanding , trust , permission and active support of the surrounding community .
For the most important thing I have learned is that schools reflect the attitudes , beliefs and health of the communities they serve , and therefore , to improve public education means more than changing our schools , it means changing America .

WASHINGTON — President Obama on Friday angrily assailed the finger - pointing among the three companies involved in the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico as a “ ridiculous spectacle , ” even as his own administration came under criticism for failing to do enough to prevent an environmental calamity .
In remarks during an appearance in the Rose Garden , Mr. Obama also criticized what he called the “ cozy relationship ” between the government and the oil industry that has existed for decades , even into his own administration .
He acknowledged that federal agencies had failed to ensure that safety and environmental standards were being met and announced a thorough review of the oversight process .
“ I will not tolerate any more finger - pointing or irresponsibility , ” he said .
“ This is a responsibility that all of us share . ”
The president ’s comments reflected impatience by the White House over BP ’s failure to stop the leaking of oil into the gulf , and alarm that growing public ire could soon overwhelm the administration .
White House officials have been meeting daily about how to respond to the spill , but amid reports that the administration may have been hasty in issuing drilling permits to BP and other oil companies , Mr. Obama summoned top cabinet officials to the Oval Office on Friday to discuss how to increase the government ’s response .
If you are accused of committing a criminal offense , it is critical that you hire an experienced criminal defense attorney to protect your rights , and represent you at all stages of the court process .
If you have an injury case , you need a trial - ready lawyer who can look out for you at every point in a personal injury or Social Security disability claim .
Many felony and misdemeanor charges are not only punishable with jail time and other serious penalties , but can also carry a negative social stigma that can have a devastating impact on your ability to advance through life .
Likewise , the result of your injury claim is likely to have a profound impact on your future .
The stakes are high , so do n’t settle for anything less than the tough , effective and experienced representation that The Law Offices of Steven R. Roach can provide .
Skill And Experience To Protect Your Rights
Attorney Steven R. Roach has more than 15 years of experience handling criminal law and injury cases .

SCP-084
Item # : SCP -084
Object Class : Euclid
Special Containment Procedures : SCP -084 is currently under a full non-interaction order until the full extent of the emission waves has been evaluated ( for detailed documentation on general FNI orders , see Document XRG - 1182 ; for detailed documentation on FNI orders in relation to SCP - 084 , see Document XRG - 1208A ) .
A continuous surveillance watch is to be maintained around the active area of SCP - 084 , with the primary objective of civilian misdirection and external surveillance .
With no major roads , trails , or other travel routes nearby , any civilians encountered approaching SCP - 084 are to be deemed suspect and detained for evaluation .
Under no circumstances are any Foundation or civilian personnel allowed in to the active area of SCP - 084 , except with express vocal and written permission of no fewer than two ( 2 ) members of O5 Command .
Sentries are to maintain their posted position with line - of - sight contact checks on fellow sentries , in conjunction with compass and landmark checking .
All reference points should be well outside the active area of SCP - 084 .
Should any sentry fail to report in via vocal roll - call , full recall orders will be issued to all sentries , and containment will be re-evaluated by Special Response teams .
In the event of active area fluctuation , full recall orders are to be assumed by all active sentries , followed by appropriate action .
No form of radio , GPS , television , cell phone , video camera , still - picture camera , or any other recording or electronic media devices are permitted within one hundred ( 100 ) meters of the active area around SCP - 084 .
Civilians found with such devices within this area are to have said devices confiscated and destroyed immediately .
Any recordings collected [ DATA EXPUNGED ] .
Description : SCP -084 appears to be a large radio tower positioned in the center of a large , open field with two small outbuildings .
Direct observation and sample collection from SCP - 084 is impossible , due to the effect that is emitted around / from SCP - 084 .
SCP -084 appears to emit a form of wave or radiation that has a detrimental effect on local space - time / reality .
The most pronounced aspect of this is the alteration of local space within the active area of SCP - 084 .
Externally , the active area forms a rough “ dome ” shape of two hundred ( 200 ) meters in diameter .
SCP -084 appears inside this area at random points , appearing to “ jump ” at random times , sometimes even appearing in multiple locations at once inside the active area .
Internally , the space appears to be unlimited , with SCP - 084 at the “ center ” .
SCP -084 is impossible to reach due to the “ emitted effect ” .
Attempts to approach SCP - 084 within the active area have returned the observation that SCP - 084 retains its relative position on the horizon , even after three months and twelve days of dedicated , direct travel both by vehicle and on foot .
Termination tests have proved impossible , as no means of destruction are capable of physically reaching SCP - 084 , even when entered from outside the active area .
Local space will also distort periodically .
This will cause relative distances to randomly extend or contract in a “ flicker ” , causing buildings or objects to suddenly “ jump ” thousands of meters away , or “ rush up ” to other points , sometimes even causing “ overlaps ” .
These “ overlaps ” have a markedly detrimental effect on living tissue .
The town of ██████████ █████ is assumed to have been situated in or around the original manifestation of the active area .
This town is no longer observable from outside the active area , appearing only once inside the active area .
██████████ █████ has maintained the same population ( 343 humans ) for the duration of its encapsulation .
Births appear to be impossible , along with normal aging patterns .
Suicide and / or homicide appear to be circumvented by the area of effect , with dead subjects “ flickering ” and appearing alive and unharmed several seconds after death .
There are also reports of events “ rewinding ” , causing things like mortal wounds to visibly “ freeze ” and close .
Subjects appear to exhibit many events of inconsistent space - time , as do most structures ( for detailed observations , see Log 084 - A4 ) .
Electronic devices and recording equipment do not function correctly in or around the active area .
Subjects report “ bizarre ” or “ unsettling ” transmissions from video and audio recording and playback devices .
This acts to totally isolate ██████████ █████ from the outside world , precluding any need for Foundation - enacted containment .
It also appears impossible to leave the active area after a random period of time .
One subject from ██████████ █████ , found on the grass plane ( see Log 084 - A4 ) , reported he had been traveling for six years .
He was found approximately four hundred meters from ██████████ █████ city limits .

A federal jury in Knoxville today has convicted David Kernell , 22 , of two charges in connection with the 2008 episode where he accessed the personal Yahoo e-mail account of Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and then initiated a worldwide rummaging of its contents .
Kernell was found guilty of computer fraud - a misdemeanor subject to a prison term of up to one year -- and obstruction of justice , which carries a maximum 20 - year sentence .
He was found not guilty of wire fraud and the jury deadlocked on a fourth charge of identity theft , according to a report by WBIR.com .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
A sentencing date will not be set until prosecutors decide whether they will retry kernel on the deadlocked charge , according to this report .
The trial started April 20 and jurors had begun their deliberations on Tuesday .
Earlier today it had been reported that the jury had reached unanimous decisions on three of the four counts lodged against Kernell , but remained deadlocked on the fourth , which accused him of having committed identity theft .
Before the trial started , a judge had rejected a pre-trial motion from the defense contending that Palin 's e-mail address and password could not constitute her " identity " for purposes of identity theft , because anyone could register any name they want online .
Whether that issue had anything to do with the delay in reaching a verdict was not clear .
However , there was indication that some jurors were frustrated with how a few of their colleagues were conducting their deliberations , with a note from the panel reading : " Some of us feel not all jurors are following jury instructions . "
The case has drawn international attention because its cast of characters include not only mega-celebrity Palin , but Kernell 's father , Michael Kernell , a longtime Tennessee state legislator , as well as the notorious Internet message board 4 chan and controversial whistleblower Web site Wikileaks , both of which were involved in disseminating the e-mail and pictures from Palin 's account .
The media has been in full feeding - frenzy mode for two weeks .
( Update : Palin compares her victimization in this case to Watergate , writing on Facebook : " Violating the law , or simply invading someone 's privacy for political gain , has long been repugnant to Americans ' sense of fair play .
As Watergate taught us , we rightfully reject illegally breaking into candidates ' private communications for political intrigue in an attempt to derail an election . " ...
Uh , right , Watergate and some college kid distributing Palin family pictures ; same thing . )

Such social messiness has been known to occur in functioning democracies , even cinematic ones , although less often on celebrity - strewn movie sets under the direction of a dictatorial director .
" It would be good ... if ( Obama ) could be dictator for a few years because he could do a lot of good things quickly , " Allen is quoted as saying .

It started innocently enough :
A tea party organizer angry over Rep. Tom Perriello ’s ( D - Va. ) vote in favor of health care reform published what he thought was the freshman member ’s home address on a blog , in case any readers “ want to drop by ” and provide a “ personal touch ” to their views .
Unfortunately , mistakes were made :
Rather than giving out Perriello ’s address however , the tea party activist instead mistakenly printed the home address of the congressman ’s brother .
Perriello ’s brother and wife have four children under the age of eight .
The perpetrator is unconvinced by , well , facts :
In an interview with POLITICO , Troxel admitted to writing the post and said that he has no intention of removing the address from the blog .
Troxel found the address through a directory website and said he would only replace what he currently has on the blog with an address provided by Perriello ’s office .
“ If they would like to provide me with the address of Tom , then I ’d be more than happy to take it down , ” he said .
“ I have no reason to believe it ’s not his house . ”

Eamonn McCann looks at the latest revelations about the role of Pope Benedict in the covering up the sexual and physical abuse of children within the Catholic Church .
RECENTLY , THE Associated Press news agency published a number of documents dealing with the efforts of a California bishop to persuade Cardinal Ratzinger , as he was then , to allow the laicization of a priest who had been convicted of abusing children .
The cardinal would n't hear tell of it .
The Kiesle case did not involve a bishop hushing up child abuse allegations and failing to alert the civil authorities .
Far from it .
Oakland bishop Dr. John Cummins appears to have behaved with propriety , only to be thwarted by the man who was to become Pope .
Father Steven Kiesle had been convicted and given three years probation in 1978 for tying up and molesting two boys in a church rectory in San Francisco .
In 1981 , his probation completed , Kiesle asked the diocese to allow him to leave the priesthood .
Dr. Cummins wrote to Cardinal Ratzinger , then about to take over as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , seeking permission to take Kiesle at his word .
Ratzinger appears to have ignored the letter .
Over the next two years , the Oakland diocese wrote to Ratzinger on at least three occasions , asking what progress had been made .
No information was forthcoming apart from a letter from a Vatican official suggesting that the Kiesle file may be lost .
Pope Benedict XVI ( David Bohrer )
Dr. Cummins wrote again to Cardinal Ratzinger : " It is my conviction that there would be no scandal if this petition were granted and that , given the nature of the case , there might be a greater scandal to the community if Father Kiesle were allowed to return to the active ministry . "
Ratzinger did n't reply .
It was not until 1985 - - four years after the bishop first requested to sanction the priest 's removal -- that he finally wrote back .
The case was of " grave significance " , he conceded , but " it is necessary for this congregation to submit incidents of this sort to very careful consideration , which necessitates a longer period of time . "
Attention had to be paid to the " good of the universal Church . "
The bishop should be mindful of " the detriment that granting the dispensation can provoke within the community of Christ 's faithful . "
In the meantime , Kiesle should be given " as much paternal care as possible . "
KIESLE WAS finally unfrocked in 1987 .
In 2002 , he was arrested and charged with 13 counts of child abuse dating back to his time as a priest .
In 2004 , he was sentenced to six years in prison for sexually abusing a young girl .
An attorney who interviewed him in prison told the New York Daily News : " He admitted molesting many children , bragged that he was the Pied Piper and said he had tried to molest every child who sat in his lap . "
In 2001 , Cardinal Ratzinger issued an updated version of the 1962 Vatican document Crimen Sollicitationis ( " The Crime of Solicitation " ) , laying down that allegations of clerical sex offenses should be kept confidential and forwarded to his office in Rome .
As the National Catholic Reporter in the U.S. suggested , " As a result , [ Ratzinger ] acquired a familiarity with the contours of the problem that virtually no other figure in the Catholic Church can claim . "
However , when Cardinal Ratzinger was asked at a conference in Spain in November 2002 to respond to the spate of sex abuse allegations in the U.S. , he commented : " The constant presence of these news items does not correspond to the objectivity of the information ... therefore , one comes to the conclusion that it is intentional , manipulated ; that there is a desire to discredit the Church . "
In the Irish Republic three years later , retired Supreme Court judge Frank Murphy published a 271 - page report detailing more than 100 allegations of child sex abuse against 26 priests over a period of 40 years in the diocese of Ferns .
The following year , after a meeting with new Ferns bishop Denis Brennan , Benedict expressed his " personal anguish and horror " at the revelations .
He made no reference to Judge Murphy 's finding that in betraying the victims and protecting the abusers , the diocese had been doing no more than following instructions from Rome .
Last month , in a pastoral letter reflecting on the report from Judge Yvonne Murphy on clerical abuse and cover-up in the Dublin archdiocese , Benedict professed himself " deeply disturbed by the information which has come to light . "
The Irish bishops had made " grave errors of judgment ... and failures of leadership occurred . "
There was no mention of the possibility that the bishops might have been following Benedict 's own wishes .
As new allegations continue to emerge , it becomes clear that the pattern of evasion , obstruction and cover - up reflects the instructions of the Vatican , and specifically of the Pope .
The case against Benedict for collusion in child sex - abuse is much stronger than the case against a number of Irish bishops who have been forced to resign .
First published in the Belfast Telegraph .
The Irish Minister for Communications , Energy and Natural Resources Eamon Ryan yesterday announced that the country has achieved its 2010 target of generating 15 % electricity from renewable sources .
“ The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland report shows that last year Ireland generated 14.5 % of its electricity from renewable sources .
Our target for 2010 was 15 % , which EirGrid tell me has already been reached , ” he said .
The report also indicates that Ireland is on course to meet its 2020 target of generating 40 % of its electricity from renewable sources .
Ryan says Ireland is already harnessing the region ’s wind and solar resources , and is now actively exploring marine energy .
“ [ This ] report proves that we are on the right track securing the future of Ireland ’s energy supplies and positioning Ireland as a world leader in green , home - grown energy , ” he commented .
The Government says it remains committed to its renewable energy agenda , he says , and will hope to surpass its 2020 target .

It ’s been a wild couple of weeks — increasing unemployment , Greek debt crisis , yet another ridiculous bailout , pressure on Goldman Sachs , accusations of commodities manipulation by JP Morgan Chase , and new freakish levels of market volatility that might be signaling the next phase of market collapse .
The many day - to - day issues can leave us dazed and confused , so most people ignore them .
Huge mistake .
They are all related to the most powerful force on earth that controls our lives because it is the very foundation of our society — usury .
We are ruled not by governments anymore but by financial powers that use interest - bearing debt to exert control over governments , corporations , and people .
Almost all other political issues with which we concern ourselves are secondary symptoms of or purposeful distractions from this larger narrative that is never reported by the Wall - Street - funded media .
Sadly the church has remained silent as well .
Explaining the details can be extremely complicated , but the basic core to understand is that the US government issues no money .
Instead all money comes from private banking institutions with interest attached .
At times in the past the US government issued real money for people to use — US notes and coins .
But today all money comes from the Federal Reserve ’s private banking system by putting the US government , i.e. 308,000,000 Americans , in debt .
If the US government were not in debt to the banking system , the American people would have no money .
More technically , the Fed and its Wall Street cartel banks like JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs make billions by doing nothing but controlling our money .
They have the monopoly license to create the core money in our system from holding US Treasury bonds on their balance sheets .
These bonds represent the debt of the United States .
Thanks to interest , the bonds pull a large portion of our wages to the banks .
The primary purpose of the IRS is to take your wages to pay the interest back to the banks .
In effect , Wall Street owns a good bit of your labor .
And the more bonds they hold , i.e. the more debt the population is in , the more money they make thanks to the interest flows and the profits from gambling on your debt .
The system is very much one of “ us vs. them . ”
Such is the nature of monopoly power and usury .
Economics and Morality
Controlling others and living off their backs by forcing them to borrow with interest in order to have any money is called usury ( this does not include standard , self - liquidating bank loans to businesses to fund production ) .
It is a system that ensures everything we do , whether in the public or private sector , feeds Wall Street and the controllers above it .
It creates a two - tiered societal pyramid of money pushers on top vs. money users on bottom .
The power differential is huge .
Everyone is hostage .
In doing something as simple as buying food to survive , we contribute to usury because we only have usury - based money , not real money .
Like the slaves who built the Egyptian pyramids , today we are stuck building an invisible pyramid of monetary power .
In such a system there is never enough money to pay back all the interest to the money pushers .
The only solution is for the money users — government , corporations , individuals — to borrow more .
This is the reason our debt continues skyrocketing to increasingly insane levels .
It is n’t about politics , but the fundamental exponential math underlying the system — the users must borrow more and more to pay back interest and keep the system afloat .
Such math is guaranteed to fail .
Iceland and Greece have reached the point of failure .
The rest of the Europe and the US will experience failure as well .
Then we will see money and assets vacuumed up the pyramid by the money pushers — the banking establishment that owns the collateral and can take your property .
The exponential math not only creates exponential debt growth , but also exponentially increasing :
Scale – government and businesses keep getting bigger ; we get smaller and local communities lose their meaning
Velocity – the hamster wheel keeps spinning faster ; human life suffers
Consumption – we buy more and more things that break more quickly
Production – we make more and more things that break more quickly
Inflation – the dollar buys less and less ; we ca n’t seem to make progress
None of these things have to happen in an economic system .
They only happen in ours because of debt - based money , usury , that greatly benefits the top of the pyramid while everyone else suffers to a certain degree depending on their level in the pyramid .
So this system is guaranteed to fail due to not only the impossible math , but also the fundamental immorality .
Taken together those five issues paint a horrible picture .
Republicans blame Democrats and vice - versa .
Nope .
It ’s all a very simple result of a system based on usury , which used to be considered profoundly immoral .
It was a fundamental violation of every major religion .
It still is for Islam , but Christianity succumbed long ago .
They thought a free market economic system would be beneficial , but got snookered into thinking that usury had to be part of that system .
On the contrary , monolithic usury kills the free market .
Our monetary system is a top - down controlling machine , not a free market .
It is run not by government , but by the most powerful financial interests in the world .
Some people feel in their guts that someone must be stealing from them because they just ca n’t get ahead no matter how hard they work .
Well that ’s because it ’s true — someone is legally stealing from them .
The simple math of usury pulls money from people on the bottom of the pyramid who create real value toward those at the top who create no value .
MBAs and others serving the system must reckon with this truth rather than remaining blind .
Farmers understand it well , having lost their property over the years to the bankers .
Families feel it in the fact that it ’s difficult to get enough money to feed the kids compared to 50 years ago when one parent could work a standard week and feed a family of five .
Everyone in the system will feel it once the debt system collapses as it is doing in Greece .
Living off the backs of others was called feudalism 300 years ago .
It was slavery 100 years ago .
Today it ’s called the “ free market ” thanks to the propaganda and fraud of neoclassical economics .
It completely ignores the truth of our monetary system , the math behind it , and the eventual collapse that will result from it .
Greece is giving us a glimpse , but it is only a mild pre-game warmup compared to what ’s coming .
The world will rue the day it was ever seduced into accepting usury and the illusion of prosperity driven by nothing but debt .
The Irrelevant Church
On this issue of monolithic usury , the issue from which many of our other problems spawn , the church seems to have no voice .
Recently , an older church leader told me , “ Keep it up , this needs to be addressed , but you have more guts than me , I do n’t want to be killed . ”
Sobering comment , to be sure , but in the shadow of Gandhi , Dietrich Bonhoeffer , Oscar Romero , and Martin Luther King , is the church now impotent ?
Are its leaders now too afraid to speak truth to power , to stand against darkness ?
Or is the problem that the church is , like most of us , fooled by the myth that we live in a free market so we do n’t realize we are immersed in an immoral system of controlling usury ?
Lower class Greek citizens are now learning the painful truth about the mythical free market .
A few of them have died as the police brutally repress them to enforce the usury system for the rich bankers like Goldman Sachs .
Where is the voice of Bishop Romero ?
“ I order you , stop the repression ! ” Iceland learned the lesson a few months ago .
Several other populations have learned the lesson in the past as the controlling debt peddlers punished , conquered , and restructured their countries ( Indonesia , Malaysia , Thailand , India , Argentina , Chile , Mexico , England , etc. ) .
The same lesson is coming to the rest of Europe and the United States .
But again , the church seems to be oblivious .
It failed to heed Martin Luther King ’s warning , “ One of the great liabilities of history is that all too many people fail to remain awake … today our very survival depends on our ability to stay awake . ”
The church has fallen asleep .
The Dialectic of Left vs. Right
A possible reason is that the church has been co-opted by the manipulative left vs. right civil war created by the corporate media .
In fact , Protestant denominations have split into conservative vs. liberal camps so they war against each other — Wall Street is brilliant at divide and conquer .
Some sermons in conservative denominations sound like speeches from conservative politicians .
Liberal Christian magazines sometimes seem to be just liberal political magazines with an added dash of Jesus .
Postmodernism should inform us that the left vs. right narrative is contrived to keep people from noticing the real power structure behind Wall Street that controls our lives .
As long as the church submits to the false framework , church leaders will be “ safe . ”
But that means they will also be irrelevant because they are not speaking to the primary narrative in our world that has always caused problems and is getting ready to unleash far more pain and poverty in the near future — the issue of monolithic usury and debt servitude .
By not speaking against usury , the church has become a pawn of it .
So the church has largely been conquered by the same concocted civil war that has divided society .
Dollar Tyranny
Another reason the church may be silent is the simple fact that it depends on money just like everything else does .
Since all money in our system comes from usury , it is difficult to even notice it .
And what authority would the church have to speak against it since it is itself complicit in it ?
Anybody or any organization that uses a Federal Reserve Note or a credit / debit card , which everyone must do , is unknowingly participating in usury because , again , all of that money comes from the bonds held by Wall Street .
But knowingly or not , how could the church or any organization speak against the very thing that fuels its own existence ?
The church ’s tax - exempt status may be another reason for the silence .
Tax exemption is one of the powerful ways the financial empire system influences and controls other entities .
If the wrong person says the wrong thing , the IRS has the ability to suddenly remove the exemption , which doubles the cost of running that organization .
The church never should have submitted to such tyranny over what may or may not be said .
Comfort of the Middle Class Bubble
Finally , it seems the comfort provided by the monetary system for the great mass in the middle , which is a key part of the church , keeps us from wanting to really think about it .
The illusion of peace and prosperity that has lasted for so long has been nice .
Some of us even thought we had that comfort because we were better people , so God blessed us .
Reckoning with the truth will be painful for those who believe this .
The fact is that our perceived comfort today is a result of the darkness of usury .
The middle can only exist because there is a bottom that keeps our system afloat .
They are the only reason the middle class exists .
Moreover , the comfort is currently an illusion because most in the middle class do n’t realize how indebted they are .
Total unfunded liabilities currently hidden on the government ’s financials put each American in an extra $ 300,000 + in debt that they currently are n’t aware of .
That debt comes from the fact that , again , our money comes from usury .
Since the bubble was built on usury , its very existence is immoral , and everyone who participates in it becomes infected .
It is also flimsy because usury means the bubble is sustained by debt .
Many are already aware of the hollowness of the bubble since it has destroyed the fabric of our communities and a sense of deeper meaning in life .
But others are able to ignore that and focus on the material comfort .
What will happen to them once the material comfort itself crashes ?
It will soon .
Some market forecasters predict the final collapse of our debt system will be worse than the Great Depression .
The math is clear — it will be worse .
Just like Greece , we will then see Wall Street paying the government to crackdown on the people , cancel social programs , and take their assets from them to hand them over to the upper class behind the banks .
That is the end result of usury — using debt to control others and take their assets so they have no equity .
At that point it will be too late for the church to save the lower and middle classes from violent repression and the upper class from their narcissistic detachment from the horror .
“ Silence is Betrayal ”
So is there a wing of the church that has not yet sold its soul ?
Is there a remaining Christian voice against usury , or are Muslims the only people in the world who stand against it ?
The church must wake up to the truth of our system and become relevant again .
This is the civil rights issue of the 21st century , only this time it is not black vs. white but a few money pushers vs. the great mass of users .
The power of the bond market is getting ready to wreak havoc .
We ’re all in it together this time .
As Martin Luther King said , “ There comes a time when silence is betrayal … .
That time has come for us today . ”
Will the real church please speak up ?

Facebook is to revise its privacy settings within weeks to make it simpler for people to keep their information private , according to Mark Zuckerberg , its founder and chief executive of the giant social network .
Acknowledging a growing level of irritation among the site 's 450 m users , Zuckerberg said : " Simply put , many of you thought our controls [ for determining who could see information about you ] were too complex .
Our intention was to give you lots of granular controls ; but that may not have been what many of you wanted .
We just missed the mark . "
But Zuckerberg insisted that concerns that Facebook is selling personal data to advertisers were misplaced .
" We do not give advertisers access to your personal information , " he said .
" We do not and never will sell any of your information to anyone . "
Writing in the Washington Post , the 26 - year - old insisted that Facebook will " keep listening " to users ' concerns .
However , he stopped short of offering users the choice of opting in to having all their information spread throughout the social network and the internet – which may mean that the new settings will not satisfy users after all .
Facebook makes money principally by selling advertising space on users ' pages ; the adverts can be tailored to the interests or experiences of the users without the advertiser knowing who it is being sent to .
Thus someone who says their favourite band is U2 might see adverts for a new album or concert tour by the band , though the advertiser will not have known precisely who was targeted .
A rising number of people have expressed dissatisfaction with the social network 's ever - changing privacy policy , which has grown in complexity since the site began in 2004 – and has also seen the default settings for sharing information go from " friends only " to " the entire internet " for almost everything that people put on it .
The ease with which people can find out anything about people who are unaware of the settings has been demonstrated by a site which uses Facebook 's new connectivity to its underlying database , launched on 21 April .
Youropenbook , which has the tagline " Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life .
Whether you want to or not " , says that it wants Facebook to restore the privacy of information " so that this website and others like it no longer work " .
The site 's creators say there are two fundamental problems with Facebook now : " First , they do not do a good job of indicating how public each piece of information you share on the site will be .
Second , they change the rules far too often .
If you understood Facebook 's privacy settings two years ago ( or even six months ago ) , that information would be worse than useless with today 's bewildering settings . "
Others think it is time to give up Facebook : one group has come up with a " Quit Facebook Day " idea , urging people to delete their accounts on 31 May .
Zuckerberg insists in the Washington Post article that Facebook will always be a free service – which suggests that it will have to continue to rely on selling advertising space targeted at users ' interests and activities .
That , in turn , means that at least some of the user information must be shared with advertisers , even in anonymised form .
And that , in turn , must mean a limit on some of the limits that users can put on sharing their data .
He does not retreat in the article from his frequently - expressed view that sharing information is beneficial .
" Six years ago , we built Facebook around a few simple ideas , " he writes .
" People want to share and stay connected with their friends and the people around them .
If we give people control over what they share , they will want to share more .
If people share more , the world will become more open and connected .
And a world that 's more open and connected is a better world .
These are still our core principles today . "
No date has been put on the release of the new privacy settings .

Mary Tattersall was 88 years old when she first took up golf A 90 - year - old woman from West Yorkshire has amazed her fellow golfers by hitting a hole in one .
Mary Tattersall made the 181yd ( 165 m ) shot on the second hole at Shay Grange Golf Centre in Heaton near Bradford .
The pensioner , who has only been playing golf for two years , said she felt amazed and stunned to have achieved the feat .
She was given a special trophy by the club to mark her success on the par three hole .
' Amazing woman ' " I was going around with friends and on the second tee off was amazed to find that I could n't find my ball and it was in the hole , " Ms Tattersall said .
" I was quite amazed really , and stunned , and so were my fellow golfers at the same moment . "
Mary made the hole - in - one shot on a three par hole Ms Tattersall was 88 when she took up golf to get some exercise and make new friends .
Jordan Gibson , owner of Shay Grange , said she was a natural at the sport .
He said : " It 's very rare to get a hole in one .
Mary is a real natural with excellent hand and eye co-ordination .
She loves golf and plays in all weathers .
" She is an amazing woman , when you see her getting in and out of her car I always feel I should go and help her , but she just jumps out , swings her clubs on her back and she 's away . "
Ms Tattersall said : " I 'm not a competitive person , I only come up to the Shay because it 's a very good exercise , better than going to the gym . "

Nearly one in three Americans failed to return their census questionnaires by Friday ’s official deadline , the Census Bureau said .
More forms were expected to be received over the weekend .
Census workers will not begin going door to door until May 1 to count people who did not return their questionnaires by mail .
As of early Friday , the mail participation rate was 68 percent .
The mail participation rate , which the bureau is using this year for the first time , is the percentage of forms mailed back by households that received them .
Unlike the mail response rate , which the census used in earlier counts , it excludes forms returned by the postal service as undeliverable , often because a house or apartment was vacant .
The mail response rate was 67 percent in 2000 .
If the undeliverable forms had been excluded then , the mail participation rate would have been 72 percent .
The states of New York and New Jersey think that they can convince the National Football League to schedule a Super Bowl for January in an open - air stadium in the north :
There could be the commissionerâ€™s party at the American Museum of Natural History and another party with a view of the Statue of Liberty from Liberty State Park .
Maybe a breakfast at Tiffany & Company for team owners and their families .
Perhaps even a Super Bowl float in the Macyâ€™s Thanksgiving Day Parade .
The bid to host the 2014 Super Bowl at New Meadowlands Stadium , portions of which were obtained by The New York Times in advance of its Wednesday unveiling , dresses the Super Bowl in a giant â€ œI Love New Yorkâ€ T - shirt , spinning even the prospect of bad weather as a chance to go â€œold schoolâ€ and embrace a link to some of the N.F.L.â€™s storied cold - weather games .
Yet for all the spectacular possibilities proposed , the mundane realities of dealing with winter are likely to dominate the conversation about the bid .
The plan includes elaborate contingencies for Super Bowl week , everything from providing hand warmers to fans at the game to having hundreds of people standing by with shovels to dig out the stadium .
No wonder the proposal calls other public spectacles that have played out in the area , like papal Masses , â€œpracticeâ€ for the Super Bowl .
â€œThe focus was on those things that only this community and this stadium can provide , â€ said one bid official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans were not final .
It would certainly be a change for the NFL ’s marquee event .
The Super Bowl has never been played outdoors in the north , and the coldest recorded game time temperature in Super Bowl history was 39 degrees during Super Bowl VI in New Orleans .
New York ’s weather in January could be much colder , and snow , ice , sleet , or rain are not at all out of the possibility .
But , the bidding committee is trying to turn the possibility of bad weather into a positive :
â€ œPlaying the game in a cold weather outdoor setting will add yet another element of intrigue , â€ it reads .
â€
œThe game will take on the â€˜old schoolâ€™ feel of the great outdoor contests of the past , yet it will be played in one of the leagueâ€™s most technologically advanced stadiums .â€ 
The committee is prepared for the worst , though .
The teams , which will practice at the Giantsâ€™ and the Jetsâ€™ new facilities in New Jersey , which both have indoor fields , will stay at hotels within a few miles of the sites .
The bid is built on having up to 800 people with shovels ready to clear the stadium , although more could be added if needed .
Part of the bid calls for covering some of the openings in the stadium to cut down on the wind and for using heaters to warm the concourses .
There will be seat and hand warmers .
And perhaps fire pits in the parking lots before the game .
â€ œWeâ€™re really trying to embrace the weather and make it more of a communal experience , â€ the bid official said
That does sound a bit like putting lipstick on a pig , but there ’s no doubt that a Super Bowl held in something other than a climate - controlled or climate - perfect environment would add a new element to the game , quite literally .
Will the NFL owners be willing to take the risk ?
I think they should .

In time for tax day , Citizen for Tax Justice releases a new fact sheet [ pdf ] on your federal tax bill for 2009 .
It 's good news , for 98 % of working families .
According to a recent CBS News / New York Times poll , the vast majority of Americans do not perceive that they have received a tax cut from President Obama .
Asked if the President “ has already raised taxes this past year , ” 53 percent of those polled said that the President has “ kept taxes the same , ” and 24 percent think that the President has “ raised taxes . ”
A mere 12 percent believe that the President has cut their taxes .
This is an astonishing level of misunderstanding .
The truth is that the major tax cuts enacted in the 2009 economic stimulus bill actually reduced federal income taxes for tax year 2009 for 98 percent of all working families and individuals .
These tax cuts saved working families and individuals an average of $ 1,158 on the tax returns they will file by April 15 .
( The median tax cut was approximately $ 600 . ) [ emphasis in original ]
An astonishing level of people believe any lie the Republican party tells them .
A sizable chunk of them probably still believe that Saddam Hussein was responsible for the 9/11 attacks .
Turning around the " tax and spend " stereotype for Democrats is going to take a long time to dislodge .
Even more important to dislodge will be the persistent idea that taxes somehow are n't critical to the functioning of government , of society .
At any rate , if you 've been procrastinating on completing that return , get to it .
You might very well have a better outcome than you 've been expecting .

The investigative organization WikiLeaks on Monday released military video of what it describes as three incidents of an " indiscriminate slaying " by U.S. forces near Baghdad on July 12 , 2007 .
WikiLeaks says the encounters killed as many as 25 civilians , including two Reuters journalists .
The U.S. military said in a statement at the time that a total of 11 people died in the strikes conducted by U.S. and Iraqi forces , including two Reuters employees .
The video , obtained by WikiLeaks , is shot from two Apache helicopters on patrol in Iraq .
The choppers were responding to reports of AK - 47 gunfire in the suburb of New Baghdad when military personnel on board spotted a group of nine to 12 persons , including what turned out to be the two Reuters photographers , walking through a courtyard .
A military official confirmed the authenticity of the footage to Fox News .
The military contends that the U.S. followed the appropriate " Rules of Engagement " for these episodes .
In fact at the time , the Pentagon says U.S. troops were hit by rocket - propelled grenades ( RPG's ) and small arms fire while caught in a clash with Shia insurgents .
" There is no question that coalition forces were clearly engaged in combat operations against a hostile force , " said multinational forces spokesman Lt. Col.
Scott Bleichwehl in July , 2007 .
The video shows military personnel aboard the Apaches indicating they spot the suspects toting several AK - 47s and several RPG's .
But WikiLeaks contends that the Reuters photographers were only carrying cameras , which the military mistook for weapons .
The helicopters circled multiple times before opening fire .
" Keep shooting ! , " yells a U.S. soldier recorded in the chopper radio traffic .
" Oh yeah , look at those dead bastards , " responds another .
" Nice ! " adds a third .
The two Reuters employees who died were 22 - year - old photographer Namir Noor - Eldeen and his 40 - year - old assistant Saeed Chmagh .
The identities of the other casualties are unknown .
Once the smoke clears from the U.S. attack , one of the Reuters employees appears to be wounded and is crawling away from the scene .
" All you gotta do is pick up a weapon , " says a voice aboard one of the Apaches .
In the second incident , a van arrives and begins to pick up the bodies .
U.S. forces fire again .
WikiLeaks believes four people were killed in this attack .
Later , American ground troops pull into the courtyard in an armored Humvee and appear to drive over one of the casualties .
" I think they just drove over a body , " says one of the voices aboard the Apaches .
" Really ? " asks a colleague
" Yeah , " answers the first voice with a chuckle .
A bit later , the same helicopters spot several individuals entering a nearby building .
U.S. troops receive permission to strike again , this time with Hellfire missiles .
" Bastards ! " shouts a voice from the helicopter .
" Look at that bitch go ! " chimes in another voice .
" Nice missile , " compliments a third voice .
Julian Assange of WikiLeaks released the video at the National Press Club in Washington .
He described the U.S. troops as callous and the shootings as " another day at the office . "
" The behavior of the pilots is like they 're playing a video game , " said Assange .
" It 's like they want to get high - scores in that computer game . "
The military would n't publicly confirm the video's authenticity but said it " presumably " was associated with an incident investigated in 2007 .
" We are aware that several media outlets are airing footage depicting gunfire from a U.S. helicopter , " the military said in a written statement .
" At this time , we are working to verify the source of the video , its veracity , and when or where it was recorded . "
Reuters attempted to obtain the 38 - minute video without success through the Freedom of Information Act .
Assange would not say specifically about how WikiLeaks obtained the video .
" It was being conveyed by people in the U.S. military , " he said , adding that some " people in the military do n't like what 's going on . "
Asked to comment on the video , a senior military official at the Department of Defense told Fox News on the condition of anonymity that " an investigation of the incidents confirmed our belief that these attacks were justified . "
" The individuals who were killed , apart from the Reuters journalists , were involved in hostile activity , " this official said .
The official also said all the material seen on this video has been addressed publicly by the Department of Defense .
" With regard to the death of the journalists and the apparent misidentification -- all of this has been acknowledged in the past , " the official said .
The " Rules of Engagement " have not been changed following the incident .
How to make Chinese people stop scamming ?
Let me introduce you the ULTIMATE revenge guide :
Free Tibet
A short justification first .
Since the very beginning of the game we are being annoyed by the Chinese spammers , whispering us and offering gold for sale .
I understand that such a person makes money and living this way .
It annoys me though , that their main source of gold is scamming .
I would not try to bother sellers if they were not selling gold they scammed ( mine , maybe yours ? ) .
In real the seller and the scammer are the same person ( or group of them ) .
Thus they shall be punished .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background info
The Chinese government likes to censor some information .
In China there are some issues that are a taboo .
People do n't talk about them and want to stay as far away from people who discuss those subjects .
Why is that ?
Well , a person caught or suspected of talking about the forbidden may , be accused of spreading revolutionary ideas and therefore expect :
- at least an investigation ,
- often a jail sentence ,
- rarely a capital punishment .
And this is what we have to exploit .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the HOT topics in China ?
This is just a basic short list :
-
Human rights
-
Tiananmen Square protests of 1989
-
Invasion of Tibet
------------------------------------------------------------------------
So what we do ?
In - game :
Whenever you are whispered by a 1 lvl character just spam him with revolutionary slogans
- Free Tibet !
- Tiananmen Square massacre !
- etc .
like :- Free Tibet !- Tiananmen Square massacre !- etc. ( I actually got the idea when I saw this on wowbash.org )
Email :
Often if you try to sell an account a few of Chinese scammers will message you .
Just send them email containing info about the taboo topics .
Remember to include a lot of forbidden keywords !
Phishing websites :
Like in game , instead of username and password , just input some revolutionary slogans !
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anything else ?
Yes !
Popularize the idea .
Mention it to your guildies , tell it in your pug raids , make people aware of the Free Tibet action .
It will take just 20 seconds and you can have some real revenge on those scammers !

BOZEMAN , Mont. —
Walking across the campus of Montana State University here , David Sands , a plant pathologist , says the blanket of snow draped over the mountains around town contains a surprise .
The cause of most of it , he said , is a living organism , a bacterium , called pseudomonas syringae .
In the last few years , Dr. Sands and other researchers have accumulated evidence that the well - known group of bacteria , long known to live on agricultural crops , are far more widespread and may be part of a little - studied weather ecosystem .
The principle is well accepted , but how widespread the phenomenon is remains a matter of debate .
The accepted precipitation model is that soot , dust and other inert things form the nuclei for raindrops and snowflakes .
Scientists have found these bacteria in abundance on the leaves of a wide range of wild and domestic plants , including trees and grasses , everywhere they have looked , including Montana , Morocco , France , the Yukon and in the long buried ice of Antarctica .
The bacteria have been found in clouds and in streams and irrigation ditches .
In one study of several mountaintops here , 70 percent of the snow crystals examined had formed around a bacterial nucleus .
Some of the bacteria promote freezing as a means of attacking plants .
They make proteins that will trigger freezing at higher temperatures than usual and the resulting water ice damages the plant , giving the bacteria access to the nutrients they need .

I 've recently started a contract at work for Professor Donald Sadoway 's lab at MIT working on liquid metal batteries .
I can't describe the details of the project I 'm working on , but the research going on in the lab is quite interesting .
The idea is to solve the problem of energy storage that accompanies all of our promising renewable energy solutions , like wind and solar .
When the wind stops blowing or a cloud obscures the sun , the electrical grid still needs to supply energy to the world .
If you only have a small amount of renewable power attached to your grid , you can just ignore the problem , but around 20 % penetration , you get into trouble .
Our best solution right now is either firing up natural gas turbines to cover the peak loads or pumping water up a hill when we have extra capacity so it can run down through a generator when we need it back .
What we really need are massive , cheap , efficient batteries .
The idea in the Sadoway lab is to make something like an aluminum refinery , but instead of just sinking huge amounts of electricity to extract aluminum , you set up a reversible reaction so you could get the electricity back later .
Go take a look at this awesome , enormous picture of one of these furnaces in an aluminum refinery so you know what I 'm talking about .
Look at the size of the guy in the picture , and then look at how many furnace chambers there are in the row .
That 's an industrial scale operation .
To make aluminum , you dig bauxite out of the ground and use heat and sodium hydroxide to extract the part that 's aluminum .
What you get out , unfortunately , is oxidized aluminum , known as alumina .
This is because aluminum , in its elemental form , reacts with oxygen , and when it sits in the earth for eternity , there 's plenty of air seeping around , so all of the aluminum bonds with oxygen .
Fortunately , we have electrochemistry on our side .
The large smelting furnaces in the picture you looked at a moment ago are long steel troughs that are lined with carbon and filled with aluminum oxide .
These form the two electrodes in a chemical reaction .
When electricity is run through the carbon into the aluminum oxide , the oxygen releases from the aluminum and bonds to the carbon , creating carbon dioxide , which is then vented to the atmosphere to help keep the planet warm .
During the reaction , the aluminum oxide in the center heats up and liquefies , while the outer crust remains solid , sort of like the liquid - filled gum of the 70's , Chewels .
( You may also recall Freshen - up , " the gum that goes squirt . " )
To turn this process into a battery , we need an electrode that does n't turn into a gas , and we'd like both electrodes to be cheap and lightweight , relative to the amount of energy they can store .
Sadoway 's lab started with one magnesium electrode and one antimony electrode , with a salt electrolyte in between .
( They have since moved on to better combinations that I 'm not at liberty to describe . )
If you heat the core of the battery up to 700 C , everything becomes liquid , and the resistance drops substantially .
Most remarkably , the three materials separate by density — electrode , electrolyte , electrode — all in a stack .
What 's so great about a liquid metal battery ?
They have several advantages , notably extremely low internal resistance and huge current capability .
Aluminum refineries run at currents above 100,000 amps .
For comparison , most household circuitbreakers blow at 15 amps .
The low resistance of liquid metals means that the battery is likely to charge and discharge very efficiently .
At first , the fact that the battery needs to run at high temperature seems like a major disadvantage — if you have to dump a lot of energy into heating , that makes the battery less efficient .
This is true , but what 's not obvious is what happens to a furnace 's thermal behavior as it grows in size .
In general , hot objects cool off in proportion to their surface area , which grows proportional to the square of the size of an object , roughly speaking .
The capacity of a battery , however , grows with its volume , which is proportional to the cube of its size .
This means that as the battery becomes huge , the amount of heat loss per unit of capacity decreases , i.e. the volume overwhelms the surface area .
It 's this same property that allowed icehouses in pre-industrial times to store ice well into the summer .
There 's some hope that at the right scale , with the right insulation , the small inefficiency in charging and discharging the battery will suffice to keep the core in the molten state .
So that 's what I 'm working on recently .
( I 'm still working on a Linux board on the side , but it 's kind of on the back burner for the next month or so . )

At least four people have been killed in clashes between police and protesters in Kyrgyzstan 's capital , Bishkek , witnesses and medics say .
There are reports that police fired live rounds at the demonstrators after failing to disperse them with tear gas and stun grenades .
Protesters in several parts of the country are calling for the president to resign over rising fuel prices .
Russia and the US , which have military bases in Kyrgyzstan , appealed for calm .
The clashes in Bishkek come a day after thousands of people stormed government offices in the north - western town of Talas .
Government offices in another town , Naryn , have also been seized by opposition supporters .
President Kurmanbek Bakiyev has declared a state of emergency and imposed customs in Bishkek , Talas and Naryn .
Leaders arrested Witnesses said at least four bodies were on the ground in the square outside the president 's office and a medical official told Reuters news agency that several people had been killed and dozens injured , mostly from firearms .
AT THE SCENE Rayhan Demytrie , BBC News , Bishkek
We 've been to the square where the demonstrations were taking place - the situation is very chaotic .
There are thousands of people there , mainly young men , and lots of them have arrived from different parts of Kyrgyzstan .
They are very angry and it was very noisy , the police were firing stun grenades and also live rounds .
We saw people who had been shot - one man walked past me , he had been shot in the hand .
We seemed to be the only camera there - and the protesters wanted us to see the people who had been killed .
We saw at least one dead man .
All this has angered the protesters even further - they say they wo n't go anywhere and were shouting " the president must go " .
The protesters in Bishkek appeared to be leaderless , says the BBC's Rayhan Demytrie in the capital , after a number of opposition heads were arrested overnight .
Earlier , police had used tear gas and stun grenades to break up crowds outside an opposition headquarters but the protesters overcame the police and marched to the presidential offices in the city centre .
Police cars have been overturned and set alight and officers attacked by the crowd , some of whom are reported to be armed .
The unrest began on Tuesday in Talas , where protesters briefly took the local governor hostage while another group surrounded the local police headquarters .
Angry crowds attacked special forces police with rocks and petrol bombs .
They reportedly set fire to portraits of President Bakiyev .
Prime Minister Daniyar Usenov said at least 85 people were injured in the unrest - most of the injured were reported to be police officers .
Protests spread on Wednesday to Bishkek and Naryn .
Thousands of people occupied a government building in Naryn and have installed what they are calling a " people 's governor " .
The protests have been touched off by rising fuel prices , but the opposition has also accused President Bakiyev of economic mismanagement and failing to tackle corruption .
KYRGYZSTAN FACTS
One of the poorest of the former Soviet states Hosts both US and Russian military air bases Population mostly Kyrgyz but 15 % are Uzbek and a significant number of Russians live in the north and around the capital Kurmanbek Bakiyev has been president since the Tulip Revolution of 2005 , which overthrew the government of Askar Akayev Mr Bakiyev vowed to restore stability but has been accused of failing to tackle corruption Opponents also complain he has installed relatives in key government posts Domestic media have come under increasing pressure from the government in recent months
The most popular opposition leader , Almazbek Atambayev , and several other politicians have been arrested and journalists attacked , adding to the tensions in the country , says our correspondent .
In a statement , the US embassy in Bishkek said it would call on " all parties to show respect for the rule of law and call on both the demonstrators and the government to engage in talks to resolve differences in a peaceful , orderly and legal manner " .
The US base in Manas , near Bishkek , is a key resupply hub for the operations in Afghanistan .
Russia 's Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin has urged the authorities not to use force against demonstrators , the Interfax news agency reported .

PRESIDENT KURMANBEK BAKIYEV
Came to power after " Tulip Revolution " street protests in 2005
His party won every parliamentary seat in 2007 polls - which observers said did not meet international standards
Won re-election again in 2009 - but EU observers again said poll was flawed Opposition accuses him of a media crackdown , nepotism and corruption
Profile : Kurmanbek Bakiyev
There has also been rising discontent with the role of President Bakiyev 's son who was recently appointed as the head of an important government agency .
Five years ago , mass protests in Kyrgyzstan brought Mr Bakiyev to power .
He promised to fight corruption and promote democracy , but his critics say the country has become increasingly authoritarian under his rule , our correspondent says .
Last week UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon visited Bishkek and called on the government to do more to protect human rights .
On Tuesday , the UN said Mr Ban was " concerned " at events in Talas and urged all parties to show restraint .

A new version of the Bluetooth wireless technology could expand what can be done by watches , toys , home sensors , medical monitors and other devices that typically have been limited in their functions because they do n't get their batteries changed or charged very often .
Imagine your wristwatch now telling you who 's calling on your phone and showing your text messages .
The industry group behind the Bluetooth standard planned to announce Tuesday that chips for the new , low - energy version of Bluetooth will be ready in a few months , and will probably show up in consumer products by the holidays .
" It 's going to enable an entirely new market for Bluetooth and allow it to be used in a category of products that Bluetooth just could n't be used in before , " said Michael Foley , executive director of the Bluetooth Special Interest Group .
He said he believes health and fitness products like pedometers and glucose monitors could be a big new market for Bluetooth .
Some of them have their own , proprietary wireless technologies , but the standardization brought by Bluetooth could make them cheaper and allow them to connect to many more devices .
Bluetooth - equipped watches hit the market about five years ago .
They were heavy and required charging every few weeks .
They vibrated to alert the wearer to calls on his cell phone ( if it was within range ) and showed the number of the caller .
The low - energy version of Bluetooth should enable these watches to be no bigger than regular watches and last more than a year on battery power , Foley said .
However , for a cell phone to connect to the watch , the cell phone needs to have a Bluetooth chip that 's compatible with the new low - energy version .
Phones with existing Bluetooth chips wo n't be able to connect .
The low - energy version has been delayed by a few years .
Nokia Corp. started developing it in 2001 under the name " Wibree . "
In 2007 , Nokia donated the technology to the Bluetooth group to promote wide adoption .
Foley said then that that group would combine it with the Bluetooth standard in 2008 .
But then the group got preoccupied with another addition to Bluetooth , one that would allow it to transfer large files at Wi -Fi speeds .

Some people think that what unites the Tea Party Patriots is simple racism .
I doubt that .
But the Tea Party movement is not the solution to what ails America .
It is an illustration of what ails America .
Not because it is right - wing or because it is sometimes susceptible to crazed conspiracy theories , and not because of racism , but because of the movement ’s self - indulgent premise that none of our challenges and difficulties are our own fault .
“ Personal responsibility ” has been a great conservative theme in recent decades , in response to the growth of the welfare state .
It is a common theme among TPPs — even in response to health - care reform , as if losing your job and then getting cancer is something you should n’t have allowed to happen to yourself .
But these days , conservatives far outdo liberals in excusing citizens from personal responsibility .
To the TPPs , all of our problems are the fault of the government , and the government is a great “ other , ” a hideous monster over which we have no control .
It spends our money and runs up vast deficits for mysterious reasons all its own .
At bottom , this is a suspicion not of government but of democracy .
After all , who elected this monster ?
This kind of talk is doubly self - indulgent .
First , it ’s just not true .
Second , it ’s obviously untrue .
The government ’s main function these days is writing checks to old people .
These checks allow people to retire and pursue avocations such as going to Tea Party rallies .
This basic fact about the government is no great secret .
In fact , it ’s a huge cliché , robably available more than once in an average day ’s newspaper .
But the Tea Party Patriots feel free to ignore it and continue serving up rhetoric about “ the audaciousness and arrogance of our government , ” and calling for the elimination of the Federal Reserve Board or drastic restraints on the power of the Internal Revenue Service .
“ I like what they ’re saying .
It ’s common sense , ” a random man - in - the - crowd told a Los Angeles Times reporter at a big Tea Party rally .
Then he added , “ They ’ve got to focus on issues like keeping jobs here and lowering the cost of prescription drugs . ”
These , of course , are projects that can be conducted only by Big Government .
If the Tea Party Patriots ever developed a coherent platform or agenda , they would lose half their supporters .
Principled libertarianism is an interesting and even tempting idea .
If we wanted to , we could radically reduce the scope of government — defend the country , give poor people enough money to live decently , and leave it at that .
But this is n’t the TPP vision .
The TPP vision is that you can keep your Medicare benefits and balance the budget by ending congressional earmarks , and perhaps the National Endowment for the Arts .
What is most irksome about the Tea Party Patriots is their expropriation of the word patriot , with the implication that if you disagree with them , you ’re not a patriot , or at least you ’re less patriotic than they are .
Without getting all ask - notty about it , I think a movement labeling itself patriotic should have some obligation to demonstrate patriotism in a way other than demanding a tax cut .
In their rhetoric , the Tea Party Patriots do not sound as if they love their country very much : they have nothing but gripes .
Yes , of course , these are gripes against the government , not against the country itself .
But that distinction becomes hard to maintain when you have nothing good to say about the government and nothing but whines to offer the country .
[ The following documents dealing with capitalism 's climate crisis were presented at the 16th World Congress of the Fourth International , held in Belgium in February 2010 . ]
* * *
By Daniel Tanuro
February 2010 --
Three billion human beings lack the essentials of life .
The satisfaction of their needs requires increased production of material goods .
Therefore increased consumption of energy .
Today , 80 per cent of this energy is of fossil origin , and consequently a source of greenhouse gases which are unbalancing the climatic system .
However , we can no longer permit ourselves to unbalance the climate .
We are probably no longer very far from a “ tipping point ” beyond which phenomena which are uncontrollable and irreversible on a human timescale are likely to be set in motion , which could lead to a situation that humanity has never experienced and which the planet has not experienced for 65 million years : a world without ice .
A world in which the sea level would rise by approximately 80 metres compared to its level today .
The total disappearance of ice is certainly not for tomorrow : the process could take up to a thousand years .
But it could be set in motion in 20 , 30 or 40 years and involve a rise in the sea level of several metres before the end of the century .
To prevent this happening , it is necessary to radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions , therefore to completely do without fossil fuels within two or three generations .
Do without coal , oil , natural gas ?
It is possible : the technical potential of renewable energies is sufficient to take over .
But in practice , in the very short period of time we dispose of , the energy transition is possible only if it goes hand in hand with an important reduction in energy consumption .
A reduction so great that it cannot be only attained by an increase in energy efficiency : a reduction of material production and of transport of goods is necessary .
This is enough to understand and to make people understand that humanity is facing a gigantic challenge .
A challenge of a completely new nature , which will dominate the 21st century .
A challenge which contributes to determining the conditions of intervention of revolutionary Marxists and of the workers ’ movement in general .
Capitalism cannot rise to this double challenge .
Neither on the social level , nor on the environmental level .
More exactly : it cannot rise to it in a way that is acceptable for humanity ( I will come back later on this ) .
The reason for this incapacity is the same on the two levels : the purpose of capitalism is not the production of use values for the satisfaction of finite human needs , but the potentially infinite production of value by many and competing capitals , organised around rival states .
Capitalism without growth ?
A capitalism without growth is a contradiction in terms .
The relative dematerialisation of production is certainly a reality , but it is more than compensated for by the increase in the mass of goods produced .
This accumulation dynamic constitutes the fundamental reason for which “ green capitalism ” is an illusion , in the same way as is “ social capitalism ” .
There are green capitals , without any doubt , there are even more and more , and they generate considerable surplus value .
But they do not replace dirty capitals : they are added to them , and the latter , because they dominate , determine the rhythms , the technological choices and the modalities of introduction of the former .
The recent past does not leave any doubt on this subject .
Look at Barack Obama : at the time of the presidential campaign , he promised to make the polluters pay , in order to massively support green energies ( US $ 150 billion in 10 years ) and to help the most underprivileged layers in society to handle the increase in the price of energy .
This policy was supposed to create 5 million jobs .
But along came the subprime crisis and of all these intentions , there remains nothing .
In the USA as in the EU , the polluters will receive rights to pollute for nothing , sell them at a profit and pass on the price to the consumers .
Capitalist climate policy reinforces the capitalists who are destroying the climate .
Thus we can see in action the power of the fossil energy lobbies and the sectors which are linked to them , such as cars , shipbuilding , aeronautics , petrochemicals and others .
This confirms the Marxist analysis according to which monopolies have the power to slow down the equalisation of rates of profit .
In the case of fossil fuels , this power is all the stronger in that it is anchored in the ownership of deposits , mines etc , therefore in ground rent .
The result is laid out before our eyes : in all countries , climate plans do not represent even half of what would be necessary in terms of reduction of greenhouse gases emissions .
Moreover , these plans are deepening social inequality and are accompanied by a headlong flight into dangerous technologies : nuclear energy , the massive production of biofuels , and the capture and geological sequestration of CO2 ( supposed to make coal “ clean ” ) .
Copenhagen
It is within this general framework that we have to look at the farce of Copenhagen : the ultra- mediatised conference supposed to lead to a new constraining and ambitious international treaty to take over from the Kyoto Protocol ended in a rout : without targets in hard figures , without deadlines , without even a reference year from which to measure reductions in emissions .
Moreover , Copenhagen could well mark a turn towards a policy even more dangerous than that of the Kyoto Protocol .
By the agreement they concluded , in fact , the 25 big polluting countries were largely freed from the scientific pressure of the IPCC and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities .
It was a horse - traders ’ agreement between imperialism and the new rising capitalist powers , who shared out the atmosphere on the backs of the peoples , the workers and the poor of the entire world .
It is very much to be feared that the Cancun Conference in December 2011 will confirm this turn .
In that case , on the basis of current national climate plans , we can project a rise in the average surface temperature between 3.2 °C and 4.9 °C in 2100 ( compared to the eighteenth century ) .
We should be wary of falling into a catastrophism with eschatological undertones .
Some apocalyptic discourses , indeed , only invoke urgency in order to argue for sacrifices and to conjure away the responsibility of capitalism .
But there is no doubt that a rise in temperature of 4 °C would lead to real social and ecological catastrophes .
It is a question here of taking the exact measure of the threat .
It is not the future of the planet which is at stake , nor life on Earth , nor even the survival of humankind .
Apart from an asteroid dropping on us , a large - scale nuclear accident is probably the only thing that can threaten the survival of our species .
Climate change , in any case , does not threaten it .
But it threatens to seriously worsen the conditions of existence of the 3 billion men and women who already lack the essentials of life .
And it threatens the physical survival of a few hundred millions of them , those who are the least responsible for global warming .
Mike Davis , in Late Victorian Holocausts , described in detail the horrible famines which caused tens of millions of victims at the end of the 19th century .
These famines were the combined result of an exceptional sequence of El Nino and of the formation of the world market in agricultural produce .
It is the repetition of such tragedies that we must expect .
With the difference that this time the drama will be due entirely to the thirst for profit of big capital , in particular of the monopolistic sectors based on fossil fuels .
This enables us to define precisely the reasons for the inability of capitalism to meet the challenge .
“ There is no situation without a way out for capitalism ” , said Lenin .
Indeed .
But this time the way out is likely to be particularly barbarous .
The ecological crisis and the social crisis are one and the same
It is obvious that the ecological crisis and the social crisis are one and the same crisis : the crisis of the capitalist system .
The expression “ ecological crisis ” is misleading : it is not nature which is in crisis , but the relationship between society and nature .
It is not the climate which is in crisis , and its disturbance is not due to “ human activity ” in general : it is due to a certain type of this activity , historically determined , based on fossil fuels .
The ecological crisis , in other words , is nothing but a manifestation of the deep systemic crisis of capitalism .
It is absolutely obvious that satisfying the right to development and to social needs in general at the same time as carrying out the gigantic reductions in emissions which are necessary in the coming 40 years is possible only if you adopt a radical anti-capitalist perspective .
Esther Vivas ( see below ) will come back to our political tasks in the second part of this report .
I will confine myself here to listing the principal measures which are necessary : to remove useless or harmful production ; to plan the transition towards another energy system ; to establish renewable sources and to develop energy efficiency , independently of the costs ( according to thermodynamic rationality , not profit ) ; to transfer , massively and free of charge , clean technologies to the peoples of the global South , via the public sectors of the countries concerned ; to set up a world fund for adaptation to the effects of global warming in poor countries ; to support peasant agriculture against agribusiness ; to relocate a substantial part of production , in particular agricultural production ; to redistribute wealth by making inroads into the revenues of capital ; to radically reduce working time and work rhythms , without loss of wages , with hiring of extra workers ; to expropriate the credit and energy sectors … .
People say : “ It is easier said than done . ”
No doubt , but the first thing to do … is to say it .
And that is what we must do initially , as an international : say it .
That will not isolate us , on the contrary .
The fight against climate change gives really considerable credibility to the anti-capitalist alternative .
The very scale of the problem , its global character , its urgency , the monstrous injustice of the foreseeable consequences : all that makes it possible to introduce directly and in very simple terms the need for a radical rupture with the generalised production of commodities .
Considering the enormity of what is at stake , it is much more than a policy option that is posed : it is a choice of civilisation .
Through the climatic danger , capitalism makes it possible for us to rehabilitate communism for what it really is : a project of civilisation worthy of the name .
The project of a human community self - managing common natural resources in a rational and careful way , in order to allow everyone to live well .
Faced with vaguely anti-liberal projects , the fight against climate change reinforces our choice of a clearly anti-capitalist line , as it does our refusal of any participation in governments which manage capitalism .
Role of working class
Strategically , the fight for the climate is not distinguished for us from the general struggle of the exploited and oppressed .
It can only be carried out effectively by them : the working class , young people , women , the poor , small farmers , Indigenous people .
The working class has to play an important role there , because only it can provide the foundations of another mode of production in which it will decide what is produced , how , why , for whom and in what quantity .
At the same time , it is an understatement to say that the environmental question in general , and the fight for the climate in particular , is difficult to introduce into the workers ’ movement .
This difficulty results from the situation of the workers as the most exploited class , divorced from its means of production , divorced in particular from nature as a means of production , and which sees these means of production appropriated by capital confronting it as hostile forces .
The conclusion which results from this is that the possibility of integrating ecology into the class struggle depends on the class struggle itself .
The more the workers are beaten , atomised , demoralised , the more they will see the defence of the climate as a threat , and the more the capitalist class will be able to really use the protection of the climate as a pretext to attack them even more .
In such a context , ecological consciousness can progress only in the alienated form of an inner conflict between the consumer convinced of the necessity to behave in a sober and responsible fashion and the producer preoccupied by the loss of his employment .
On the other hand , the more the workers are successful in their struggles , the more they will gain confidence in their own strength , the more they will be able to deal with the ecological question by bringing to it collectively , as producers and as consumers of their own production , the anti-capitalist solutions that are essential .
A better relationship of forces between in favour of the exploited and oppressed is the necessary prerequisite for an anti-capitalist solution to the climatic crisis , in other words of any acceptable solution .
But this prerequisite is by no means sufficient , and does not allow us to put off until later the fight for the environment .
Indeed , in addition to its urgency , the ecological question has a certain number of specific characteristics such that the formation of an anti-capitalist class consciousness comes up against even greater obstacles here than in other fields .
Three conclusions flow from this :
First , the importance of building a political instrument , an anti-capitalist political party capable of presenting analyses of the double crisis , social and ecological .
Seldom has the need for a revolutionary party and a revolutionary international , acting as a collective intellectual , been so obvious ;
Second , the importance of a program of demands making it possible to link concretely the social and ecological dimensions of the capitalist crisis .
The key point here is that the climatic crisis , by giving a new topicality to the idea of a completely different kind of society , rehabilitates at the same time the concept of the transitional programme , capable of establishing a bridge between the current situation and this global alternative ;
Third , the importance of social dialectics to help the working - class vanguard to play its role .
It is no accident that peasants , Indigenous peoples and youth are on the front lines in the social mobilisation for the climate .
Young people are fighting for their future , against a monstrous society in which those in authority know what is happening , but let it happen .
As for the peasants and Indigenous peoples , unlike the workers , they are not divorced from their means of production , in particular the land .
Faced with a capitalist system which has condemned them to death , they have understood that the fight for the climate is part and parcel of their overall struggle and confers upon it a formidable additional dimension of legitimacy .
“ The peasants can cool down the planet that agribusiness is heating up ” , said an official statement of Via Campesina a little before Copenhagen .
The workers can also cool down the planet .
By producing for needs , not for profit , by radically reducing working time , etc .
The convergence of the social movements can help them to become aware of the enormous force that they represent .
There lies in particular the importance of the Cochabamba conference convened by Evo Morales .
The Fourth International will call itself ecosocialist
By adopting this Draft Resolution , the Fourth International will call itself ecosocialist .
Some people refuse this label , saying : “ What use is it , socialism is enough . ”
Among the adversaries of ecosocialism , there are those for whom nothing has changed , who refuse that the pure schema of the October Revolution should be polluted by the ecological question .
They are not , as far as I know , present in our ranks .
Moreover , there are comrades who , while accepting the radical innovation of the combined social and ecological crisis , regard ecosocialism as an unnecessary concession to political ecology .
That is not what it is about .
We can discuss at length whether or not there was such a thing as an ecology of Marx .
Personally , I believe Marx was much more of an ecologist than we have said he was .
But that is not what is really important .
What is really important is that all the Marxist currents missed the ecological question , that some of them continue to miss it and that all of them still have difficulty in responding to it in a convincing way .
Calling ourselves ecosocialists is first of all a way of saying “ we have understood ” or , at the very least , “ we know that we must understand something which we did not understand ” .
It is a new label on the bottle , a little bit like the new shirt that Lenin said had to be put on .
A new label can be useful .
But ecosocialism is much more than a label .
Though the concept is still work in progress , we can indicate a series of points on which it is substantially different from socialism as generations of militants conceived of it , and as our own current conceived of it .
The starting point is that to stabilise the climate implies a different energy system .
Not only other technologies to produce electrical power , heat or movement , but also a different kind of agriculture , a different rationality and a different organisation of space .
The building of this new system will inevitably be a long - term task , requiring the destruction of the capitalist productive apparatus .
The taking of political power is only the starting point of this upheaval .
The new energy system that must be built implies necessarily the decentralisation of the production of electric power – which is in particular a prerequisite for the rational use of heat – and the relocation of a part of its production .
Decentralisation and relocation are perfectly compatible with the project of world socialism , and essential to its democratic self - management .
However , it cannot really be disputed that these two concerns do not emerge spontaneously from our programmatic tradition , which rather puts the accent on world planning of production and exchanges .
Another new set of problems relates to the importance of living labour .
Our program allocates a major role to the need to invest living labour in services such as personal care , teaching , health , etc .
So these problems are not foreign to us .
But , for all the other sectors , we rely on the idea that machines and robots will make it possible to free , to the maximum degree , producers from the burden of physical work .
This idea must be called into question , because taking care of the ecosystems requires an intelligence and a sensitivity which can be only be brought by human labour .
This is particularly obvious in the case of agriculture : in order to “ cool the Earth ” , as Via Campesina says , it is necessary to replace agribusiness by peasant or co-operative organic agriculture .
That inevitably implies greater investment in human labour ( which means neither the return to primitive agriculture nor the end of progress , but another form of progress ) .
Last , the very conception of nature needs to be re-examined .
In the context of the capitalist ecological crisis Marxism can really no longer be satisfied with looking at nature solely from the point of view of production , i.e. as a stock of resources , a platform for work and a dumping ground for waste .
We must also learn how to look at nature from the point of view of nature itself , from the point of view of large - scale exchanges of matter and of the operating conditions of the ecosystems , which in the final instance determine the living conditions of humanity .
There are invaluable indications on this subject in Marx , we have to take hold of them and develop them .
On all these points , the resolution only opens up a process of ongoing theoretical work to which the International will have to come back .
But it is important as of now to send out a signal , to show we are moving .
In Copenhagen , in December , a breach opened .
For the first time , a mass mobilisation on global environmental issues took on the character of a social struggle against the system in place : “ Change the system , not the climate ” , “ Planet not profit ” .
This internationalist movement will develop .
It offers us considerable potentialities .
An anti-capitalist tendency did not wait for us to develop .
We must reinforce it .

Anti-capitalism and climate justice
By Esther Vivas
Today , climate change is an undeniable reality .
The political , social and media impact of the Copenhagen Summit in December 2009 was a good proof of this .
A summit that showed the inability of the capitalist system to give a credible response to a crisis that it has itself created .
Green capitalism offers a series of technological solutions ( nuclear power , capture of carbon from the atmosphere to be stored , biofuels and so on ) that will have a major social and environmental impact .
These are false solutions to climate change that try to hide the structural causes that have led us to the current crisis situation and raise the contradiction between the short term calculations of capital and the long rhythms of ecological equilibrium .
In this context , a movement able to challenge the dominant discourse of green capitalism , recognising the impact and the responsibility of the current model of capitalist production , distribution and consumption and linking the global climate threat with everyday social problems is urgent .
Copenhagen saw the increased expression of the movement for climate justice , precisely to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the mobilisations against the World Trade Organization in Seattle .
A protest which , under the slogan “ Change the system , not the climate ” expresses this diffuse relationship between climate and social justice , between social crisis and ecological crisis .
But the success of the protests in Copenhagen contrasts with the weakness of demonstrations around the world , with some exceptions such as London .
The current crisis raises the urgent need to change the world from below and do so from an anti-capitalist and radical ecosocialist perspective .
Anti-capitalism and climate justice are two struggles which must be closely linked .
Any prospect of rupture with the current economic model that does not take account of the centrality of the ecological crisis is doomed to failure and any environmental perspective without an anti-capitalist orientation of a break with the current system will deal with the surface of the problem and end up being an instrument at the service of green marketing policies .
Slowing down climate change involves modifying the current model of production , distribution and consumption .
A superficial and cosmetic retouching is of no point .
Solutions to the ecological crisis mean taking up the foundations of the current capitalist system .
If we want climate change we need to change the system .
Hence , the need for a true eco-socialist perspective , or eco-communist perspective as Daniel Bensaïd said in one of his last articles .
Also , we must combat the thesis of green neo-Malthusianism blaming the countries of the global South for their high rates of population growth and seeking to control the bodies of women , undermining our right to decide on our bodies .
To fight against climate change means to fight poverty : the greater social inequality , the more climate vulnerability .
It is necessary to convert productive sectors with a serious social and environmental impact ( military , cars , extractive industries and so on ) , creating employment in ecologically just and social sectors such as organic farming , public services ( health , education , transport ) , among others .
Putting an end to climate change means asserting the right of peoples to food sovereignty .
The current agro-industrial model ( delocalised , intensive , mileage intensive , oil - dependent ) is one of the maximum greenhouse gas generators .
An ecological , local peasant agriculture with short marketing circuits allow , as La Via Campesina say , the cooling of the planet .
It should also incorporate the demands of native peoples , control of their lands and natural goods and their worldview and respect for the “ pachamama ” , “ mother earth ” , and defence of the “ good life ” .
Enhancing these contributions posing a new type of relationship between humanity and nature is key to addressing climate change and the commodification of life and the planet .
From a North - South perspective , climate justice involves unconditional cancellation of the debt of the countries of the South , an illegal and illegitimate debt and demanding recognition of a social , historical and ecological debt from North to South , the result of centuries of pillaging and exploitation .
In cases of disaster , it is necessary to promote mechanisms of “ popular relief ” .
We have seen as climate change increases the vulnerability of the popular sectors , especially in the countries of the South .
The earthquakes in Haiti and in Chile are two of the most recent cases .
These threats necessitate networks of international solidarity of rank and file social movements allowing a channelling of immediate and effective aid to local populations .
The initiative cannot be in the hands of an international “ humanitarianism ” empty of political content .
The fight against climate change is a fight against the current model of industrial production delocalised , " just in time " , massive , dependent on fossil resources and so on .
Union bureaucracies tail and legitimise policies of “ green capitalism ” with the farce of “ green technology ” to create employment and generate increased prosperity .
It is necessary to remove this myth .
The trade union left must call into question the current model of growth without limits by another “ development ” model in accordance with the finite resources of the planet .
Climate change and environmental demands must be a central axis of combative trade unionism .
Trade unionists cannot see ecologists as enemies and vice versa .
All suffer the consequences of climate change and we need to act collectively .
It is wrong to think that we can combat climate change only by individual attitudes changing , and when more when half of the world ’s population lives in conditions of “ chronic underconsumption ” , and is also wrong to think that we can combat climate change only with scientific and technological responses .
Structural changes are necessary to the models of production of goods , energy and so on .
In this respect , local - based initiatives pose practical alternatives to the dominant model of consumption , production , energy ... they have a demonstrative character and raise awareness which is fundamental as a basis .
By its nature , talk of how to confront climate change implies discussing strategy , self - organisation , planning and the tasks that lie ahead for those of us who consider ourselves anti-capitalists .

Capitalist climate change and our tasks
1 . The climate change that is underway is not the product of human activity in general but of the productivist paradigm developed by capitalism and imitated by other systems that claim to be alternatives to the former .
Faced with the danger of a social and ecological catastrophe which is without precedent and is irreversible on a human timescale , the system , incapable of calling into question its fundamental logic of accumulation , is engaged in a dangerous technological forward flight from which there is no way out .
The climate change that is underway is not the product of human activity in general but is mainly due to the fact that the capitalist system , guided by considerations of short - term profit and superprofit , has based and continues to base its development not only on the exploitation of labour power but also on the plundering of natural resources , in particular finite and non-renewable reserves of cheap fossil fuels .
i . In the last decades of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century , coherent proposals for alternative energy systems based on the utilisation of solar energy were swept aside by the laws of capitalist profitability or torpedoed under the pressure of the coal companies .
ii .
After 1945 , in order to perpetuate their superprofits , the oil monopolies and the sectors dependent on oil suppressed many technical alternatives and imposed means of transport , consumption and town and country planning dictated only by the desire to sell an ever - increasing quantity of goods , in particular cars and other mass - produced individual consumer goods .
iii .
In the course of the last 40 years , in spite of an accumulation of increasingly convincing evidence , scientists ’ warnings were ignored by bourgeois governments and the media .
On the contrary , they backed up the disinformation campaigns of capitalist lobbies , while at the same time , neoliberal globalisation of production and exchanges was leading to explosive growth of greenhouse gas emissions .
iv. Today , at the beginning of the 21st century , the causes of global warming are perfectly documented , the danger is known and recognised by the governments , the technical solutions exist and the gravity of the situation increases with each new report by the experts .
Without a voluntarist policy , the experts project that the average rise in temperature could exceed 6 °C between now and 2100 , in relation to the 18th century .
However , for a +3.25 °C rise , ( compared to the pre-industrial period ) , located approximately in the mid range of IPCC projection , costal floods , according to some estimations , would cause between 100 and 150 million victims by 2050 , famines up to 600 million and malaria 300 million , while water shortages could affect up to 3.5 billion more people .
But capitalism continues in spite of everything to use mainly fossil fuels , including non conventional sources ( heavy oils , bituminous sands and shale ) as well as the enormous low - price coal reserves .
Since the logic of accumulation constitutes its foundation , the system has launched into productivist gambles which imply dangerous technologies : development of nuclear power , genetic engineering aimed at increasing the harmful production of biofuels , “ clean coal ” with capture and storage of gigatons of CO2 in deep geological layers .
For capital , renewable energy sources are just one new field for the accumulation of value , which explains why their implementation can take particularly destructive forms and comes as a complement to being supplied by fossil fuels , not as a replacement for them .
The only limit to capital is capital itself ( Marx ) .
The insane race of this system which accumulates wealth and overconsumption at one pole , poverty and scarcity at the other , threatens to precipitate a human and ecological catastrophe that is irreversible on a historical timescale , with irrevocable damage inflicted on ecosystems , in particular on biodiversity .
Whereas the threshold of danger , considerably lower than +2 °C compared to the preindustrial era , has already been crossed in many regions ( island states , Andean countries , Arctic regions , semi-arid zones … ) the plans that have been adopted or are being discussed at the level of the imperialist powers announce a warming between +3.2 °C and +4.9 °C , corresponding to a rise of the sea level of between 60 cm and 2.9 metres at equilibrium ( without counting the dislocation of the icecaps ) .
Not only will the Millennium Development Objectives , which are insufficient , not be reached , but in addition hundreds of millions of human beings are exposed to serious degradation of their living conditions .
For the poorest among them , their very existence is threatened , due in particular to the risks of coastal flooding , tension over fresh water resources and the expected fall in agricultural productivity in tropical regions .
2 . It would be an illusion to believe that climate stabilisation will occur spontaneously due to the depletion of fossil resources .
These are amply sufficient to provoke a climate tipping point
The stabilisation of the climate at the least dangerous level possible requires a drastic reduction in the consumption of energy and therefore of material production .
At the same time , energy and other resources are necessary to ensure the right to development of the three billion men and women who live in conditions that are unworthy of their humanity and who are the first victims of global warming .
The capitalist system is incapable of taking up these two challenges separately .
To take them up simultaneously amounts for it to squaring the circle .
Radical anti-capitalist measures are indispensable in order to implement , independently of the costs , a world plan of transition towards an economical and efficient energy system , based exclusively on renewable sources , capable of satisfying the fundamental needs of humanity .
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the stabilisation of the climate at the least dangerous level possible requires world emissions of greenhouse gases to peak before 2015 and decrease by 50 to 85 per cent between now and 2050 , compared to 2000 .
In name of the precaution principle , it is essential to adopt as a minimum the most drastic of these objectives .
Indeed , climatic models do not incorporate , or do so very imperfectly , the phenomena known as “ non-linear ” , in particular the dislocation of the Greenland and Antarctic icecaps and the release of methane from permanently frozen ground ( permafrost ) .
However , these phenomena , already perceptible , are likely to very strongly accelerate climate change and to considerably increase its negative effects in coming decades .
To these physical constraints must be added other constraints , of a social , political and technical nature :
i . In order to take into account the differentiated historical responsibilities of imperialist countries and other countries , the IPCC estimates that the first must reduce their emissions by between 25 and 40 per cent between now and 2020 and by between 80 and 95 per cent between now and 2050 , compared to 1990 , while the output curve of the second must drop by from 15 to 30 per cent compared to existing projections , in all regions in 2050 and in the majority of regions ( except Africa ) from 2020 .
Here too , the most drastic objectives must be adopted as a minimum , for the reasons indicated above .
ii .
Considering their decisive responsibility for global warming , the share of these objectives which concerns the developed nations must be realised by them using domestic measures , i.e. by reductions of their own emissions .
These reductions can be replaced neither by purchases of rights to pollute coming from supposedly “ clean ” investments in the developing countries or those in transition , nor by the planting of trees -- which does not offer a structural solution , nor by the protection of existing land and forests – the safeguarding of land and forests , necessary in itself , must not allow the polluters to continue to pollute .
These so - called compensation measures and the emission rights market foreseen under the Kyoto Protocol have proven perfectly ineffective in environmental terms , even to achieve the utterly insufficient objective of these agreements ( a 5.2 % reduction in emissions over the 2008 - 2012 period ) .
iii .
In the name of climate justice and in atonement for their ecological debt , imperialist countries must transfer to the countries dominated by imperialism the knowledge and the technologies that will enable them to develop while respecting the physical constraints of climate stabilisation .
They must also finance measures of adaptation to that part of climate change that is inevitable , of which the poor populations of poor countries , mainly women , are the main victims .
iv .
From the technical point of view , renewable sources make it amply possible to face up to the future needs of humanity .
However , because of the need to change the energy system , the success of the transition over the next 40 years is conditional on an important reduction in the consumption of energy ( 50 per cent and more in the developed countries ) .
This implies in its turn a significant reduction of material production , so that the key question is the following : it is necessary to produce less overall , while answering the legitimate demands of three billion human beings for whom many fundamental needs remain unsatisfied .
It is a total illusion to believe that this range of conditions could be respected by allotting to carbon a price which takes into account the cost of the damage from climate change .
Value is a purely quantitative indicator expressing the quantity of abstract human labour put into motion at a given moment by the development of capital : it is by definition incapable of taking account of natural wealth , of taking account of the needs of future generations , of making the difference between useful or useless concrete labour from the human point of view and of taking into consideration the many parameters , both quantitative and qualitative , of climate stabilisation .
This inability is already expressed in practice in the fact that the capitalist monopolies are exerting all their weight , successfully , to prevent the bill for global warming from being laid at their door , so that in the final analysis they determine the rhythms and the forms of the policies pursued , according to their own interests .
On the social level , finally , the imposition of a world price for carbon would make the workers and the poor pay the bill for global warming , thus aggravating inequalities , between the global North and the global South but also within the societies of the North and the South .
Capital is unable to resolve the key question because it is structurally incapable of reducing overall material production while producing more for non-solvent needs .
To combine the legitimate right to human development and the planned , democratic and rational implementation of a world programme of transition towards an economical and efficient energy system , based exclusively on renewable sources , independently of the cost , is only possible by resorting to radical anti-capitalist measures .
These measures include in particular the expropriation of the credit and energy sectors ; a massive reduction of working time ( towards a half - day of work ) with reduction of work rhythms , without loss of wages and with hiring of extra workers ; significant taxing of capitalist profits ; the greatest extent possible of re-localisation of production , in particular agricultural production , via support for peasant agriculture ; public initiatives in the field of housing and transport , essential in order to change modes of consumption ; the constitution of a world fund for adaptation , financed from the profits of the monopolies ; public refinancing of research , an end to its subordination to industry and the free transfer of clean technologies towards the countries of the South ; as well as mechanisms of democratic participation and control by the populations and by local government bodies , at all these different levels .
3 . The poisoned heritage of two hundred years of capitalist development based on fossil fuels , climate change concentrates the crisis of civilisation due to the fact that the potential of this system for social and ecological destruction now outweighs its ability to identify human needs and respond to them .
The combination of the economic , climate and food crises in the framework of the capitalist law of population carries within it the threat of a major human catastrophe , and even of a descent into barbarism .
The poisoned heritage of two hundred years of capitalist development , climate change constitutes the clearest demonstration of the global crisis of a system whose potential for social and ecological destruction now outweighs its ability to identify human needs and respond to them .
The growth of the productive forces has become the growth of destructive forces , not only because more and more socially and ecologically destructive technologies have been deployed , but also , overall , because capitalist logic , by ruining the climate , is leading humanity towards a whole range of acute difficulties .
The capitalist mode of production implies a specific law of population , expressing the permanent need for an “ industrial reserve army ” .
In the framework of this law and in the context of the historical exhaustion of late capitalism , the combination of the economic , climate and food crises carries within it the profound threat of a wave of “ creative destruction ” ( Schumpeter ) of unprecedented scope , implying not only the massive elimination of material productive forces and irreplaceable natural wealth , but also a major risk of physical destruction for hundreds of millions of human beings .
This infernal logic is already at work in the convergence between the fractions of big capital invested in agribusiness , energy , cars and petrochemicals which , by rushing to get their hands on land and on the industrial exploitation of the biomass as an energy resource , are accelerating the ruin of small farmers and the rural exodus , threatening indigenous communities and dramatically increasing the number of sub-proletarians who are victims of chronic famine .
For lack of a global alternative , the internal dynamics of the system will push ever more strongly down the slippery slope of a global crisis which could be on a level of brutality and barbarism without any historical precedent .
4. Climate change underlines the urgency of both a world socialist alternative and a radical break of the socialist project from productivism .
The saturation of the carbon cycle and the exhaustion of non-renewable resources in fact mean that , unlike in the past , the emancipation of the workers is no longer conceivable without simultaneously taking into account the principal natural constraints .
Opposition to capitalist growth , in itself , constitutes neither a project of society nor a strategy for broad social mobilisation in favour of another society .
The reduction in material production and consumption is immediately necessary for the stabilisation of the climate because capitalism has led humanity too far into a dead end .
But that does not in any way prejudge the future possibilities of development , once the climate system has been stabilised , on the one hand , and on the other hand it constitutes only one quantitative criterion of the necessary transition towards an economy without fossil carbon .
If we do not want to be led towards antisocial or even reactionary conclusions , this quantitative criterion must be combined with qualitative criteria : in particular , redistribution of wealth , reduction of working time without loss of wages , development of the public sector .
If these criteria are satisfied , and on condition that it targets useless or harmful productions , the reduction in material production will actually be synonymous with an increase in the wellbeing , the wealth and the quality of life of the vast majority of humanity , through investments in social sectors , a different kind of town and country planning , free access to vital services and the re-conquest of the free time necessary for self - activity , self - organisation and democratic self - management on all levels .
The capitalist system is inseparable from the growth of material production and consumption , but this constitutes an effect , not a cause .
It is the production of value , as an abstract form of exchange values , which leads to the permanent tendency to unlimited accumulation of wealth at one pole , and causes at the same time the accumulation of poverty and destitution at the other .
A climate policy which did not take into account this double reality would be doomed to failure .
The crucial point and the lever of the anti-capitalist alternative thus remain basically those which the socialist project has defined : the mobilisation of the exploited and oppressed against a system based on the race for profit , private ownership of the means of production , the production of commodities , competition and the wages system .
But this crucial point and this lever are no longer enough to define the alternative .
The saturation of the carbon cycle constitutes actually the most obvious and most global demonstration of the fact that , unlike in the past , the emancipation of the workers is no longer conceivable without taking into account the principal natural constraints : the limits of the stocks of non-renewable resources on a historical scale , the speed of replenishment of renewable resources , the laws of conversion of energy , the conditions of the functioning of ecosystems and biological cycles and their rhythms .
It is not enough to affirm that socialism must take ecological questions on board .
The real challenge consists rather of creating the conditions so that the socialist project is compatible with the global ecology of the terrestrial super - ecosystem .
Development cannot only be conceived of with the aim of satisfying real democratically determined human needs , but also according to its sustainability by the environment , and by furthermore accepting that the complexity , the unknown factors and the evolutionary character of the biosphere confer on this undertaking a degree of irreducible uncertainty .
The concept of “ human control over nature ” must be abandoned .
The only really possible socialism from now on is one that satisfies real human needs ( disentangled from commercial alienation ) , democratically determined by the interested parties themselves , simultaneously taking care to carefully question ourselves as to the environmental impact of these needs and the way in which they are satisfied .
To think in terms of the interpenetration of the social and the ecological implies first of all to go beyond the partitioned , utilitarian and linear vision of nature as the physical platform from which humanity operates , as the store from which it draws the resources that are necessary for the production of its social existence and as the dumping ground where it deposits the waste matter of this activity .
In reality , nature is simultaneously the platform , the store , the dumping ground and the whole range of living processes which , thanks to the external supply of solar energy , make matter circulate between these poles , while constantly reorganising it .
Waste and the way of disposing of it must therefore be compatible , both in quality and in quality , with the capacities and the rhythms of recycling by the ecosystems , in order not to ruin the proper functioning of the biosphere .
However , this proper functioning depends on the number and the diversity of the biological operators , as well as on the quality and complexity of the multiple chains of relations which link them , the balance of flows determining in the final analysis the supplying of humanity with resources .
To think in terms of the interpenetration of the social and the ecological implies secondly to learn the lessons from the reality that a mode of production is not defined only by its relations of production and property but also by its technological structures , which are modelled by its energy choices .
Climate change shows this clearly : the energy sources used by a mode of production and the methods employed to convert energy in order to satisfy human needs ( for food , heat , and light ) are not socially neutral but have a marked class character .
The capitalist energy system is centralised , anarchic , wasteful , inefficient , dead - labour intensive , based on non-renewable sources and characterised by a tendency towards overproduction of commodities .
The socialist transformation of society requires its progressive destruction and its replacement by a decentralised system , planned , economical , and efficient , living - labour intensive , based exclusively on renewable sources and directed towards the production of durable practical values , which can be recycled and reused .
This transformation does not only concern the “ production ” of energy in a narrow sense but the entire industrial apparatus , agriculture , transport , leisure and town and country planning .
The energy / climate challenge forces us to conceive of the socialist revolution not only as the destruction of the power of the bourgeois state , the creation of a proletarian state which starts to wither away as soon as it is established and progressive phasing - in of self - management by the masses , but also as the beginning of a process of destruction of the old capitalist productive apparatus and its replacement by an alternative apparatus , utilising different energy sources , different technologies and different structures in the service of democratically decided objectives .
This extremely profound historical upheaval can start in one country or in a group of countries , but it can only take on its full character and be completed after the victory of the socialist revolution on a world scale , once the abolition of the principal inequalities of development have made it possible to satisfy the basic right of each human being to an existence worthy of the name .
It postulates in fact the preliminary realisation of energy autonomy , in particular the food autonomy of different countries .
Far from being synonymous with the end of human development , it implies an important progress of science and technique as well as of the social power to democratically apply them , with the active participation of everyone , within the framework of a culture of “ prudently taking care ” of the biosphere , for which the contribution of indigenous communities will be invaluable .
Revolutionary Marxism considers that , once fundamental human needs have been satisfied , the qualitative development of humanity will become more important than the quantitative development .
This conception is coherent with that of Marx , for whom real wealth lies in free time , social relations and the comprehension of the world .
The perspective of a communism using exclusively renewable energy sources , mainly solar , is situated in the continuity of this non- productivist thought , deepening it and drawing new conclusions in terms of demands , tasks and programme .
This deepening justifies the use of the new concept of ecosocialism .
Representing the concentrated expression of the common fight against the exploitation of human labour and the destruction of natural resources by capitalism , ecosocialism does not proceed from an idealistic and chimerical vision of the “ harmony ” that is to be established between humanity and nature , but from the materialist necessity of managing the exchanges of matter between society and the environment , while controlling consciously , collectively and democratically the tension between human needs and the proper functioning of the ecosystems .
5 . Our tasks
5.1 . Prepare the activists of the social movements so that they can aid the development of the consciousness of the masses and contribute to building a mass mobilisation on climate .
The fight for the climate requires in priority the construction of relationships of social forces .
Faced with the urgency of the question and with the criminal policies of capitalist governments , we work in all countries for the building of a powerful unitary mass movement , coordinated on a world scale .
This movement must be conceived of as a grid of social resistances existing on different terrains , with convergent coordinated actions and periodic pluralist demonstrations , on a common minimal platform .
Its goal must be to force governments to aim for at least the most radical reductions in emissions put forward by the IPCC , respecting the principle of “ common but differentiated responsibilities ” and of social and democratic rights as well as the right of everyone to a human existence worthy of the name .
Mass mobilisation in defence of the climate is a difficult task , due in particular to the double de-phasing , spatial and temporal , between the phenomenon and its effects .
A broad campaign of information on global warming and its impacts is necessary .
It must be aimed in particular at the activist nuclei of the various social movements and the political formations of the left , because these nuclei play a decisive role in establishing the concrete link between the global climate threat and particular social problems , and in deducing from that strategies that make it possible to combine social struggles and the fight for the environment .
5.2 . Build a left current which links the fight for the climate to social justice .
The change that is necessary cannot be obtained without the mobilisation and the active participation of the exploited and oppressed who make up the vast majority of the population .
Capitalist climate policy makes this participation impossible because it is unacceptable on the social level .
This policy in fact implies the reinforcement of imperialist domination and of capitalist competition and violence ; therefore of exploitation , oppression , social inequality , competition between workers , violation of rights and private appropriation of resources .
In particular , this policy does not provide any answer to the major challenge represented by the jobs , the wages and the social gains of the millions of workers employed in the sectors that emit large quantities of greenhouse gases .
So it can only encounter legitimate social resistance .
The big environmental NGOs try to radicalise the climatic objectives of governments while refusing to see that this radicalisation involves at the same time the accentuation of antisocial attacks .
This is a dead end .
We defend the need for a combined fight for the climate and for social justice .
Within the broad movement , we work for the constitution of a left pole which links these two dimensions and which argues consistently against proposals based on market instruments , accumulation , neo - colonial domination and technological forward flight .
This pole will seek to bring together elements of the trade - union , ecologist , global justice , feminist and third - worldist lefts , the “ decreasing ” left , the organisations of the radical left , critical scientists , etc .
5.3 . Conduct the ideological fight against green neo-Malthusianism , in defence of the poor and of women ’s rights .
By its nature as a global problem and by the extent of the catastrophes which it is likely to cause , global warming favours the development of a whole series of ideological currents which , under cover of radical ecology , try to rehabilitate the theses of Malthus by packaging them in an apocalyptic discourse with strong religious accents .
These currents find an echo at the highest level in certain sections of the ruling classes , where the disappearance of a few hundred million human beings is easier to imagine than the disappearance of capitalism .
Because of this , they represent a potentially serious threat to the poor , particularly to women .
The fight against these currents represents an important task , which our organisations must assume , as such and in liaison with the women ’s movement .
The population level is obviously one parameter of the evolution of the climate , but we have to categorically combat the false idea that population growth is a cause of climate change .
The demographic transition is largely underway in the developing countries , and is progressing more quickly than had been envisaged .
It is desirable that it continues , but that will be a result of social progress , the development of social security systems , the information that women dispose of and their right to control their own fertility ( including the right to abortion in correct conditions ) .
This is obviously a long - term policy .
Short of resorting to barbaric methods , no policy of population control makes it possible to respond to climatic urgency .
5.4 . Introduce the question of the climate into the platforms and the struggles of the social movements .
In the perspective of a broad mobilisation rooted in existing struggles , we act so that the defence of the climate becomes a major concern of the social movements and that it finds a concrete expression in their platforms of demands , on all terrains .
For example :
- the fight for peace : the production and the use of arms constitute an unacceptable folly in relation to climate change … which is itself a possible cause of additional conflicts ; - the fight against poverty , for the right to development and social protection : the ability to adapt to climate change is directly proportional to the level of resources and development .
Social inequality increases vulnerability and handicaps energy change ; - the fight of women : adaptation to climate change reinforces the importance and the urgency of the specific demands of women for equal rights , for society to take responsibility for the care and protection of children , against the double working day , for the right to abortion and contraception ; - the fight for employment : to radically reduce the consumption of energy , to reorganise the territory and the cities , to take care of biodiversity , to develop public transport and to substitute renewable sources for fossil fuels offers a gigantic reserve of quality employment ; - the fight for access to land , water and natural resources and for an organic peasant agriculture : rural communities which practice a labour - intensive organic agriculture know how to increase the organic matter content of land of and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture ; - the fight against globalisation and the liberalisation of agricultural markets : a cause of the ruin of rural populations , famine , rural exodus and / or the plundering of ecosystems , the liberalisation of these markets is also a major source of emissions , direct ( transport of products for export ) and indirect ; - the fight for the right of asylum : faced with the increase in the number of environmental , and in particular climatic , refugees , freedom of circulation is essential and constitutes the only response worthy of humanity ; - the fight of Indigenous communities for their rights : by their knowledge and their mode of exploitation of ecosystems , in particular forests , these communities are the most capable of preserving and developing carbon sinks ; - the fight against the flexibility and the precarisation of work , against the lengthening of working time : work schedules that are cut and made flexible and capitalist campaigns in favour of the increased mobility of the labour force workers to use cars .
“ Just in time ” production is a major source of emissions of greenhouse gases in the transport sector .
The reduction of working time is a necessary condition for the development on a mass scale of alternative patterns of consumption and leisure ; - the fight against privatisations , for a public sector of quality in the fields of transport , energy and water .
Only a free public transport sector of quality can reconcile the right of everyone to mobility and the reduction of emissions .
The liberalisation of electrical production complicates the introduction into the network of intermittent renewable sources .
Only a public enterprise not working for profit can take up the challenge that consists of suppressing within two or three decades the totality of emissions in the housing sector .
5.5 . Outline the perspective of a global anticapitalist plan for social and ecological reconversion .
In this framework put forth demands concretely linking the struggle for the climate and the struggle for meeting social needs , in particularly the right to work .
The leaderships of the big international trade - union confederations accompany capitalist climatic policies in exchange for the possibility of them negotiating certain of their modalities .
This orientation is concretised in the proposal of a “ Green Deal ” based on the illusion that green technologies will make it possible to absorb unemployment and give the impulse to a new long wave of prosperity and capitalist expansion .
The trade - union bureaucracies accept the requirements of productivism and capitalist profitability as well as the instruments of the dominant climate policy : government aid to “ green ” companies , “ ecological taxation ” , Clean Development Mechanism , the market in emission rights , even support for nuclear energy and biofuels .
This policy is likely to make the trade union movement co-responsible for catastrophes .
It sows division among workers on an international level , and between sectors within the different countries .
To take up the challenge the trade union left must get away from a cramped vision centred on the redistribution of wealth , in order to contest the very conception of wealth and the way in which wealth is produced i.e. the very foundations of the mode of production .
To the bureaucratic trade union leaderships ’ policies we oppose the prospect of a global anti-capitalist plan for social and ecological reconstruction .
This plan includes the defence and strengthening of the public sector ( in particular the transport and energy sectors ) , the right to work , social and income protection as fundamental rights , collective reconversion under workers ’ control of workers in useless of harmful production , a radical cut in working time with no loss of wages with a slowing of production rhythms and compensatory hiring , the creation of green jobs in public firms and free basic services .
Based on this framework we will intervene in struggles , notably around industrial restructuring in ecologically non-sustainable sectors ( such as the car industry ) to propose concrete solutions to the infernal choice between continuing production and destroying jobs .
We demand that governments create ecologically useful public jobs in sectors such as insulation of dwellings ; public transport and the development of renewable energy sources independently of their costs .
5.6 .
The massive transfer of clean technologies towards the countries dominated by imperialism and the financing of adaptation to the effects of climate change in these countries require a sharing of assets and knowledge on a world scale , therefore substantial taxation of capitalist profits .
The rescue of the climate requires a sharing of assets and knowledge on a world scale .
It must thus be related to :
- the cancellation of the debt of the third world and restitution to the people of the assets that the dictators of countries of the South have placed in Western banks ; - lifting of bank secrecy , suppression of tax havens , taxing of inheritances , a tax on speculative movements , etc ; - a substantial increase in the budgets of the imperialist countries that are allocated to government aid to development ; - the creation , in addition to this aid , of a single world fund for the adaptation of the developing countries to the inevitable effects of climate change and for the transfer of clean technologies towards the public sector of these countries , without financial conditions ; - the resources for this fund should come from taxing the profits and the excessive superprofits of the economic sectors most responsible for climate change ( in particular the oil sector , coal , cars and electrical production ) ; - suppression of the system of patents in health and in technologies that make it possible to produce essential consumer goods and services ( transport , light industry , water and energy , communications ) so that all the populations of the planet can have access to basic goods ; - a system of financial compensation for the countries of the South which give up exploiting their fossil fuel resources .
5.7
The emissions of the countries dominated by imperialism will not be able to diminish by at least 30 per cent compared to projections unless the capitalist model of development is called into question .
The contribution of the countries dominated by imperialism to the stabilisation of the climate at the least dangerous level possible can only be achieved by an endogenous development , responding to the needs of the great mass of the population , therefore linked to land reform in favour of peasant agriculture and to a reorientation of production towards the domestic market .
To reconcile the right to human development with the stabilisation of the climate thus requires taking measures against the local ruling classes , who use the right to development as a pretext to try and refuse any obstacle to the burning of fossil fuels , who plunder natural resources , appropriate the forests for themselves , act as intermediaries for the sale of carbon credits , produce biofuels and export agricultural food products or industrial products at low prices for the markets of the developed countries .
To prevent them being used to fuel this socially and ecologically harmful model , the funds and the technological means that are placed at the disposal of the countries of the South must be placed under the democratic control of the populations and their social movements .
5.8 Indigenous peoples by the defence of their way of life and their type of relationship with the environment , play a leading role in the struggle for forest protection , thus of the climate and the environment in general .
The peoples of Latin America , in particular , have a conception of linked to their ancestral civilisation that is the polar opposite of the one promoted by bourgeois ideology .
They do not see themselves as owners of their land ; rather , they see themselves as belonging to the land – and this idea summarises the central thrust of their philosophy , which is inspired by respect for the Earth .
This is why they call their territory Mother Earth , or Pacha Mama .
They nurture , maintain and cultivate another , community and solidarity - based , model of life , one which is deeply connected to nature .
As such , the socio-political organisation of aboriginal peoples on their territory does not limit itself to the borders imposed on them by the imperialists .
The threats to their way of life , social structures , natural resources and peoples – as a result of the countless invasions of their territories – are an attack on their inalienable rights ; and this prompts them to organise themselves and to resist the predations of multinationals carried out within the framework of the free trade agreements or the Initiative for the Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America .
We must support their demands and oppose any occupation of their territories by extractive industries , and any building of hydroelectric stations , railways , roads and dams without the previous consent of these peoples .
As the environmental question is clearly taking on a strategic role and place in the anticapitalist struggle , building an alliance between workers in countryside and towns and aboriginal peoples is one of the greatest challenges of our epoch .
What is at stake in these struggles is also the preservation of the last tropical forests which play a major role in the climate system .
5.9 Oppose technological forward flight and incorporate all the great ecological challenges into a really sustainable perspective of development .
The history of capitalism is littered with environmental crises that were “ solved ” without a global ecological vision , by the implementation of partial technological answers subordinated to the demands of profitability , whose harmful environmental effects appeared later .
To solve the climate / energy crisis while following this same method of the sorcerer ’s apprentice is likely to have even more dangerous consequences , in particular in three fields : the increased recourse to nuclear power and genetically modified organisms and the geological storage of CO2 in the framework of a new wave of exploitation of coal .
To oppose these capitalist responses is one of the most important tasks .
They should be denounced as symbols of the madness of unbridled capitalist growth , as the absurd attempt of the system to jump over its own head in order to maintain in spite of everything the accumulation that generates profit .
In a more general way , the climatic challenge brings together all the environmental questions .
The response must thus integrate all the great ecological challenges , in particular : ( i ) the defence of the tropical forest , respecting the rights of the indigenous communities which live off its resources ( carbon sinks ) ; ( ii ) the defence of biodiversity ; ( iii ) rational and public management of water resources ; ( iv ) the fight against the poisoning of the biosphere by the several hundred thousand molecules resulting from petrochemicals , which do not exist in nature and thus in some cases cannot be broken up by its reducing agents ; ( v ) the elimination of the gases that destroy stratospheric ozone and their replacement by compounds which do not have other dangerous ecological impacts ; ( vi ) the fight against atmospheric pollution and its consequences for human health ( asthma , cardiovascular diseases , ) and for the ecosystems ( acidification , tropospheric ozone ) .
5.10 Denounce the gulf between the capitalist plans and the diagnosis of the situation by scientists .
Establish links with critical scientists .
Pose the questions of intellectual property rights and the social role of research .
The claim by governments which are trying to make us believe that their capitalist and liberal climate policies are founded on “ science ” must be fought vigorously .
To do this , we must denounce the gulf that separates the objectives of governments from the conclusions that the precaution principle makes it necessary to draw from the reports of the IPCC .
This denunciation implies assimilating the essence of the scientific expertise while criticising the dominant ideological and social presuppositions which are conveyed by a large majority of the experts .
The left must establish relations with scientists , invite them to communicate their expertise to the social movements , challenge them on their general political positions , on the basis of their own scientific expertise , push them to speak out on the contradiction between the global rational solutions which the fight against global warming requires , on the one hand , and on the other hand the extreme compartmentalisation of science in the service of partial capitalist rationality .
Considering the place occupied by scientific expertise in the development of policies , it is of considerable importance to establish relations between the social movements and critical and humanistic researchers .
Within this framework , we develop a more general point of view on the role of science and research in the fight for the stabilisation of the climate in a framework of social justice .
We do not refuse technological solutions , nor the concepts of development and progress .
We argue on the contrary for scientific research and technique to be freed from the influence of capital so that their potential can be placed massively and quickly at the service of progress in energy efficiency , rational management of resources and the sustainable development of renewable energy sources .
We demand massive public refinancing of research , an end to the contracts which tie universities to industry and to finance capital , the democratic definition of research priorities in the context of the transition , in a framework of social justice , towards a society without fossil fuels .
5.11 Fight against the attempts to make individuals feel guilty , but assert the need for energy sobriety as far as socially possible .
The discourses of governments aimed at making people feel guilty , which place responsibility for global warming on the behaviour of individuals , seek to conjure away social inequality , to hide the responsibility of capitalism , seek to divert attention from the profound structural changes that are necessary and pave the way for unjust measures such as the “ carbon tax ” .
It is an illusion to believe that the climate could be saved by a movement of “ cultural contagion ” against overconsumption , whereas more than half of humanity lives in a situation of chronic underconsumption .
But it is also an illusion to gamble on hypothetical revolutionary scientific breakthroughs in order not to put in question individual overconsumption and practices which result from it .
Instead of counterposing actions in the sphere of consumption to structural changes in the sphere of production , the first must be conceived of as a means of making people aware of the need for the second .
Alternative social practices , democratic campaigns and mobilisations , even those which only involve a minority , which contest productivism and consumerism , can also play a positive role in the formation of the collective consciousness that structural changes are necessary , in the sphere of production , and that these changes will be accompanied by a higher quality of life .
5.12 Develop a practice of popular aid in the event of a catastrophe .
Climate change considerably increases the risks of catastrophes , affecting more particularly the workers and the poor , in particular in the developing countries .
In the face of this threat , we must prepare to intervene with the social movements on two different terrains : the terrain of demands , consisting of placing states and governments before their responsibilities ; and the terrain of direct , popular and interdependent aid , taken in charge by the local populations and their organisations with the assistance of networks of activists on a world level .
The experience gained in natural disasters shows in fact that these popular aid initiatives are faster , more directly directed towards the poor and their real needs and are less expensive .
Moreover , they favour the development of a different kind of social relations and of contestation of the established order .
Make the Cochabamba gathering a new stage in the fight for an anticapitalist response to climate change
By the 16th World Congress of the Fourth International
- Denounces the caricature of an agreement that 25 major polluting countries reached on the sidelines of the Copenhagen climate summit ; the agreement sets aside the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities .
They seek to impose this agreement on the peoples of the world ; it is tailor made for the interests of big capital and capitalist appropriation of resources .
It represents a grave threat for the workers of the world , for the poor , for peasants , women and Indigenous peoples , as well as for ecosystems ; - Celebrates the initiative taken by Bolivia 's President Evo Morales to hold a Peoples ’ Summit on Climate and the Rights of Mother Earth in order to make the voices of Indigenous peoples heard ; and to develop a common response to the imperialist policy of dividing up the world and the atmosphere between the big powers .
We call on all political and social forces in struggle against exploitation and oppression to support the Cochabamba gathering and participate as far as possible ; - Salutes those communities who defend the ecosystems they developed and struggle for their rights , way of life and methods of collective appropriation that respect the environment .
In so doing , they have become a driving force in the climate movement and oppose the capitalist logic of neoliberal commodification of resources .
They are a source of inspiration for the creation of a new relationship between society and nature ; - Calls on revolutionary Marxists to ensure that the Cochabamba gathering paves the way for a broadening and deepening of the international mobilisation of social movements -– above and beyond specific cultural references -— for an anti-neoliberal and anti-capitalist response to climate change .

I 've been noticing many different copies of my Windows liveusb - creator popping up on various sketchy - looking download sites .
The majority of these copies contain a variant of the Vundo Trojan .
" Vundo , or the Vundo Trojan ( also known as Virtumonde or Virtumondo and sometimes referred to as MS Juan ) is a Trojan horse that is known to cause popups and advertising for rogue antispyware programs , and sporadically other misbehavior including performance degradation and denial of service with some websites including Google and Facebook . "
So , if you downloaded a copy of the Windows liveusb - creator from anywhere other than https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator -- you could be infected .
Apparently the latest variation of this trojan is undetectable by most antivirus ( although , clamav was able to recognize the one that I found ) , so you may need to look around for some of the common symptoms .
There is apparently a tool that will remove this trojan which can be found here , however I have not tested it and cannot vouch for its validity .
If anyone was actually hit by this , I 'd be interested to hear about it .
Also , to state the blatantly obvious : only download the liveusb - creator from the homepage !

At some point over the last couple of days , Microsoft made a small yet significant adjustment to how you buy Microsoft points online .
Notice the difference ?
Advertisement
That 's right , now Microsoft points are sold in North America in increments of 400 , to better match the normal pricing of Xbox Live Arcade titles and downloadable content .
Previously , for an 800 point title , we'd have to purchase 1000 Microsoft points , as the batches were sold in increments of 500 .
Either that , or pick up a point card , which would mean leaving the couch , which I 'm pretty sure is illegal .
Hopefully this means less leftover points in our Xbox Live accounts , and less OCD - fueled purchases of unnecessary themes and avatar clothing .

Thanks to bowen13 for pointing out the change !
A living lung donation generally requires two donors , according to the United Network for Organ Sharing , the nonprofit agency that administers the organ transplant waitlist for the government .
One donor gives a lobe from the right lung , the other a lobe from the left .
The donors need to match the recipient in blood type and lung size and volume .
The donors have to be physically and mentally healthy .
Cohen could only find one person who met these criteria — her brother , Howard Meyerson .
Desperate to find the second donor , she sent out an e-mail to everyone she knew .
By 2000 , she was on the waiting list for a transplant .
By 2003 , she decided she had to stop waiting and look for herself .
“ I could n’t do anything a woman my age could do , ’’ Cohen said .
“ It was like house arrest . ’’
Cohen was diagnosed in 1994 with a progressive lung disease that is as lethal as it is hard to pronounce : lymphangioleiomyomatosis .
She could not climb the stairs .
Sometimes , she could not breathe .
She suffered collapsed lungs all the time .
“ When you ’re talking living lung donation it is usually someone the donor knows really well , ’’ Fitzpatrick said .
“ Somebody ’s alive now because of what Hilary Greene did .
What she did was exceptional . ’’
As uncommon as living lung donors are , it is even less common for the organ to come from a stranger .
And the way Greene found out about Cohen ’s plight — from a mass e-mail forwarded by a friend — makes the story all the more incredible , said Sean Fitzpatrick , spokesman for the New England Organ Bank , the federally designated nonprofit organization that identifies deceased donors and recovers organs and tissues for transplants in the region .
It was an unusual act of kindness .
Last year , out of 1,661 lung transplants in the United States , only one came from a living donor .
In 2008 , the number of living lung donors was zero , according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network , the government agency that coordinates national waitlists for organ transplants .
And in 2004 , the year Greene made her donation , she was one of just 28 living lung donors out of 1,172 transplants .
That year , 492 people died while waiting for a lung .
And when Greene , who turned 50 last week , hits the pavement in her first Boston Marathon Monday , you will not be able to tell that she is running without one of the lobes of her left lung .
She is doing it as a birthday present to herself ; Cohen , 48 , now celebrates that birthday as though it were her own .
You would never know that they share something else .
Six years ago , Cohen was dying of a rare lung disease .
Greene donated part of one of her lungs to save Cohen ’s life .
At the time , the two were total strangers .
PLYMOUTH —
When Ellyn Cohen and Hilary Greene rushed to greet and hug each other at the fire pit outside the Blue Eyed Crab Grill and Raw Bar , they looked like who they are today : two lively , middle - aged women , close friends who share the gift of gab and an agile wit .
Greene , who lives in Centerville , received the e-mail in October 2003 from an old high school friend , with the subject line “ Hopefully somebody in Massachusetts can help . ’’
To her own surprise , Greene decided to consider the request .
“ I ’d always wanted to donate an organ , ’’ she recalled .
She had thought it would be a kidney — living donations of that organ are relatively common .
“ When I found out someone needed a lung or she could die , I was like , ‘ looks interesting , I ’ll look into it . ’ ’’
Greene , who has worked in radio and run websites , is curious by nature and likes to try new things .
She had never had surgery .
She decided to try it out .
Her mother suggested she reconsider .
“ ‘ Oh , Hil , ca n’t you wait till I ’m dead to do this ? , ’ ’’ Greene recalled her saying .
Cohen , her husband , Lee , and their son , Marshall , dining with Greene in Plymouth this week , laughed at the memory .
When Cohen learned that she had found a donor who was not only willing but medically able to supply the second lobe , she was flabbergasted .
Two weeks later , she picked up the phone to thank her benefactor .
“ I could n’t believe someone would undergo a complete surgery for a total stranger , ’’ Cohen recalled .
“ How do you call somebody and say , ‘ Thank you for offering your lung to me ? ’ ’’
Greene remembers the conversation well .
“ She told me , ‘ I ’m sorry I did n’t call earlier , I had two collapsed lungs , ’ ’’ Greene said .
“ I ca n’t imagine not being able to breathe . ’’
Before a transplant , a living donor is constantly reminded that it is OK to back out .
Greene put aside her fears , and instead focused on her fascination with all the medical science .
Now they can laugh about the nervous moments before surgery .
“ I was worried because I am Christian and she ’s Jewish , ’’ Greene joked .
“ I ’m gay and she is straight . ’’
“ Any lung in a storm , ’’ Cohen retorted .
“ Since I got the lung , nobody has converted either way . ’’
They have become close .
It started in the waiting room .
Cohen ’s and Greene ’s loved ones mingled , commiserated , and started to get along .
Now the two families get together frequently .
Cohen ’s recovery took six months .
Now she volunteers at her synagogue .
She works at a women ’s jewelry and gift boutique .
She can breathe .
“ Once you can breathe you kind of do n’t have to think about it any more , ’’ she said .
“ I feel great .
I feel normal . ’’
A few weeks after the surgery , Greene was playing tennis .
The four lobes that remain in her two lungs are one less than a normal healthy person has .
But her doctors have told her that her lungs work better than those of many healthy people .
Two years ago , Greene started running .
She decided to do the marathon to mark her half - century milestone .
She got a charity number from her spouse , Angela Cenzalli , who works for the Special Olympics .
But she will wear the shirt of the New England Organ Bank , to draw attention to the plight of the more than 1,800 people in the country awaiting lung transplants .
“ If more people registered as donors we would n’t have to take parts out of living bodies , ’’ Greene said .
“ I ’m not asking people to donate their organs when they are alive . ’’
She is not expecting to finish the race in less than five hours .
“ I like to think that I ’ll be fairly high up among the four - lobe people , ’’ she smiled .
So look for Hilary Greene at the back of the pack .
She will be the one missing a lobe .
Though to look at her , you would never know .

UPDATE : Hilary Greene finished the Boston Marathon in 5 hours and 26 minutes .
" I was hoping to be closer to 5 hours or maybe 5:15 .
Ah well , " she said .
" My lungs were fine , my quads are what did me in ! "
She is back to playing some golf and tennis and running 15 to 20 miles a week .
" Overall it really was a great experience , just like the surgery -- something very special that I am very lucky to have been a part of ! "
Ellyn Cohen had her six - year checkup in May , and reports that her breathing function is stable and her doctors were pleased with her test results .
She spends a lot of time volunteering at her synagogue and in May became second vice president of the board of directors .
" Every day is a gift ! , " she wrote in an email .
" I 'm thrilled to wake up , shower without effort , get dressed and do a day 's worth of activities -- something I could n't do 6 years ago ! " - July 15 , 2010

Absolute subservient adherence -- that 's a pretty apt way to sum up the Republican Party 's tactics during the past .... I do n't know how long .
Year ?
Year - and - a - half ?
Three years after the beginning of campaign season ?
Nine - plus years post - 9/11 ?
I suspect the groupthink mindset of " absolute subservient adherence " is a behavioral characteristic that has evolved among the GOP for even longer than that , though it has manifested itself in increasingly ugly ways in recent memory -- like whenever Republicans accused liberals of being unpatriotic and un-American whenever they criticized the Bush Administration 's foreign policy .
Bartlett 's words are also a pretty refreshing bit of criticism considering it came from one the GOP 's own .
Think for a second about John McCain ever since he ran for President back in 2000 .
Yes , he was always fairly conservative , but in the past decade , he 's lurched further and further to the right on nearly every issue .
Back in 1999 , McCain said that he would n't support repealing Roe v.
Wade in either the short - term or the long - term ; during the 2008 campaign , he called Roe v.
Wade a " flawed decision " that should be overturned .
On torture , McCain himself pushed for a ban on cruel and degrading treatment of prisoners back in 2005 ; then in 2008 , he voted against a bill that curtailed the CIA 's ability to enforce " enhanced interrogation techniques . "
In fact , Think Progress documented a big list of McCain 's other policy flip - flops during the past several years -- and nearly all of them have been adopted as the mainstream position of the Republican Right .
Even now , McCain is being challenged in his home state in the GOP primary by J.D. Hayworth , an even more conservative Tea Party Republican , and McCain has since tilted ever more rightward in his positions .
I have long maintained that it is far better for a political party -- and far healthier for society as a whole -- that elected officials and their constituents have rational disagreement , and that political parties foster an environment that allows for legitimate criticism , even of their own .
Bartlett has reaffirmed what many of us on the progressive blogosphere have been saying for a while :
That the GOP no longer accepts any criticism .
Basically , agree with everything the party leaders say , or you 're an apostate who must be dismissed .
While the Republican Party 's " no - at - all - cost " strategy might pay political dividends for the Democrats , it 's still bad for the country , as Paul Krugman noted last April .
Would that others in the GOP could at least show the same level of frank insight that both Bartlett and Frum have recently .
( h/t to Think Progress for the original news item )
Update : The Huffington Post adds more from Bartlett about how the GOP demands lockstep subservience :
[ T ]he conservative movement has a tendency to excommunicate anyone who breaks ranks , says Bruce Bartlett , who was fired by the National Center for Policy Analysis , another right - wing think tank , for writing a book critical of Bush policies .
" In the years since , I have lost a great many friends and been shunned by conservative society in Washington , D.C , " Bartlett wrote in the wake of Frum 's resignation .
tristero over at Hullabaloo responds to that particular item , and makes an important point about the difference between liberals and conservatives with respect to ideological " purity " :

INTRODUCTION
You are about to read a rare true story about a young boy who received a kind of help from his mother that some children need , but almost none receive .
Danial should have been born a girl .
In these pages , you will meet Daniel 's father who believes that sexual reassignment is against God .
You 'll follow the fencing matches with bureaucrats , and the contest of wills with councilors whose skills are so often limited to dream - obstruction and fee collection .
Most importantly , you 'll read how Daniel 's courageous and superbly understanding mother helped Daniel to become the charming , irrepressible Danielle , despite a globe full of minor tyrants , tunnel vision functionaries , buffoons , finanancial opportunists , and misguided do - gooders trying to prevent it .
I have finally met Danielle now 19 , after having heard and been entertained by her exploits every week for months during my electrolysis sessions with her mother .
I am deeply impressed .
Danielle 's fitness for life as a teenage girl and success at it , as well as her happiness and maturity bring glad , wistful tears to my much older eyes - - wistful , because I , too , am a transsexual .
I lived through Danielle 's childhood experiences of having the wrong body , but because I grew up in teh 50's and 60's , and because of the less communicative , sexually repressed atmosphere of my family , I had to go through full male puberty , attend male gym classes , deal with bullies , and miss out on many years of shopping and dating .
I hit every stump , bramble bush and pothole that waits for us folk who hack our way along the wrong road of life .
But it 's 1998 now , and things are changing .
Danielle 's experience is one of the first in what promises to be a new and better era for people like her and like me .

PART I PART II PART III PART IV PART V Rear Cover About the book , Phyllis Randolph Frye says , " I remember when Just Evelyn contacted me in 1994 or so for legal help for her teenage transsexual child , and I could give her none , other than strategies and role models , to encourage her to push the system to work for her daughter .
And push she did .
Just Evelyn's book about her new daughter Danielle , will join my personal list of four other books - boiled down after 23 years of out activism - that I will recommend to folks like her to read .
Actually , this is a must read for ALL parents of ANY transgendered child of ANY age .
It is heartwarming with touches of humor , insight , guidance and things to avoid .
It is chatty and very readable .
I laughed as Danielle exceeded the expectations of her own very outgoing mother .
I felt justified as I read of many of Danielle 's learning problems being reduced or going away as she no longer carried the extra heavy burden within of hiding her true self .
I cried several times as I read it because I felt Evelyn's love for her new daughter juxtaposed over my own parents and siblings 23 years of rejection and ostracism of me .
I clapped as I read Just Evelyn scold the many in the helping professions who are often educated BY us , yet they charge a high fee or have a financial conflict of interest in their treatment regimes , and give us little or no meaningful help at all .
The excesses of the gatekeepers are exposed with details , and at the end is a listing of how - to 's and what - to avoid 's - thank you , Just Evelyn . " " ... mom , I need to be a girl " is , in my honest opinion , essential reading for any parent whose child is transsexual .
The book is a testament to unconditional love for one 's child .
Rare would be the transperson who does n't get a bit wistful and misty - eyed reading Evelyn 's account of her child 's trials and tribulations and her own unfailing support of her child .

Apparently , the Poles love bacon as much as Southerners & Cajuns , as the shelves of The Polish Market in suburban Detroit ( 48902 Hayes Rd , Macomb , MI 48044-1953,586-532-9077 ) overflowed with bacon , bacon - flavored , and bacon - inspired products .
I really wanted to try the spiced bacon roll ( pressed bacon layered with sweet & hot paprika ) or one of their EIGHT varieties of headcheese , but those items were n’t road - trip friendly , so I settled for Crik Crok crunchy bacon snacks .
Imagine a salty snack food wafer impersonating bacon : decorated with stylish , streak - o - lean stripes , with a lingering smoky , greasy aftertaste .
Besides a thirty - foot - long deli counter brimming with sausages , The Polish Market offers a nice array of central European pastries , as well as an astonishing array of salted & smoked fishes .
Fancy some pickled herring ?
Feel free to fish around in the cauldron to select the choicest morsel , located right next to a vat of pickles .
Stay tuned for more from Summer in the Heartland … .
If you ’ve begun to use CSS3 experimental features in your sites lately such as box - shadow , border - radius or text - shadow , you know how much pain it can take away from the design process .
Unfortunately , lots of people are still using Internet Explorer and ca n’t see all these pretty additions you ’ve added .
I thought it would be useful to have a simple way to run a sanity check on my design to make sure it was n’t going to look awful or unreadable once all of the CSS3 goodies were taken away .
With that in mind , I created a bookmarklet that will toggle the display of all of that modern goodness .
Just drag this link : Toggle CSS3 into your bookmark toolbar .
Then , by clicking it , you can turn off ( and back on ) the most common CSS3 improvements .
Once installed , if you visit a page such as CSS3 .info and click the bookmarklet , you should see the CSS3 effects toggle off .
Note that this is a simple , none - too - bright bookmarklet and only removes the obvious traces of CSS3 .
It does n’t inspect your CSS for non-supported color values ( like RGBA ) or deal with many of the more advanced features of CSS3 .
In fact , all it does is eradicate these styles :
border - radius
box - shadow
text - shadow
border - image
background - origin
background -clip
However , it ’s still a useful tool if you ’re designing for the future with an eye for the past .
Enjoy !

“ The Living Wake ” is a dark comedy set in a timeless storybook universe .
Self — proclaimed artist and genius , K. Roth Binew ( Mike O'Connell , " What 's It Gonna Be " ) , has one day to live .
He has enlisted his best and only friend , Mills Joquin ( Jesse Eisenberg , " Zombieland " , " Adventureland " ) , to take him around on a bicycle powered rickshaw .
In a final attempt to probe life 's deepest mysteries , Binew endures one ridiculous trial after the next .
He concludes his day with a final performance , his living wake .
On a makeshift stage in an open field , Binew 's friends and enemies gather to witness his madness one final time .
For the first time , a major Hollywood film will hit the $ 20 threshold at the box office , as movie - theater owners test the public 's ability to absorb ever higher ticket prices .
Several theaters will charge $ 20 per adult ticket to IMAX showings of the animated 3 - D family film " Shrek Forever After , " the fourth " Shrek " installment from DreamWorks Animation .
The theaters include the AMC theater in Manhattan 's Kips Bay neighborhood , AMC Loews 34 , AMC Loews Lincoln Square and AMC Empire 42nd Street .
The increases were n't officially announced , but were reflected in prices posted Wednesday on movie - ticketing Web sites such as Fandango.com and tracked by BTIG LLC media analyst Richard Greenfield .
" With the state of the economy remaining questionable , we worry pricing is simply moving up too quickly , " cautioned Mr. Greenfield in a research blog post , adding that he was especially concerned about how quickly children 's ticket prices are increasing .
" The danger is scaring consumers away from the movie theaters . "
This weekend 's price increase come less than eight weeks after theater operators instituted some of the steepest hikes in a decade .
Those increases in late March — in some cases of as much as 26 % — varied theater to theater and focused on 3 - D and IMAX showings of another DreamWorks Animation title , " How to Train Your Dragon . "
The same AMC theater in Manhattan charged $ 19.50 for an IMAX showing of " Dragon . "

I 've always just adored Lewis Black !!!!
He 's just an absolute card !!!
But I wonder if Beck even hears the clear - cut irony that Black is presenting to him ?
Beck went so far as to insult the victims of the Holocaust by trying to reconfigure everything Obama does into a ( poorly developed ) parallel with the Third Reich .
I mean , that 's not just irresponsible , it 's insulting .
it 's like falsely accusing someone of a serious crime like rape ... it trivializes the pain of the real victims or that brutality ... just as Beck does night after night with regards to the blood - curdling atrocities of the Nazis .
But after painting Health Care reform , ACORN , the Peace Corps etc ... as evidence of a nazi presence , Beck totally dismisses any parralel from the Third Reich with the bill in Arizona .
And that bill EXACTLY MIRRORS THE INSTITUTIONALIZED TARGETING OF MINORITIES , FOREIGNERS / IMMIGRANTS AND THE POOR WHICH BECAME THE HALLMARK OF NAZI DOMESTIC POLICY !
I mean , does Beck even see that ?
Does anyone in his audience ?
Do they really think that " health - Care " was the definitive mark of the Third Reich ?
DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CLUE ?
How does
Fox expalin all this ?
How would Beck ?
In any case , it 's proof positive that , even in the era of the internet and the world - wide - web , we still have people like Beck trying to lock us in a mind - numbing , un - thinking Mini - True style dark age .
All - Nighters is an exploration of insomnia , sleep and the nocturnal life .
As a photographer , I work the night shift — when daylight gives way to moonlight , neon , and street light .
In cities , especially New York , the darkness awakens me in a way the light of day never can .
Gradually , my insomniac wanderings have taken me to the more ambiguous , transitional zones of the city .
And I am seeing these not in black and white , as I used to , but in color — as if the visual noise of daytime were transforming itself into haunting nocturnal tonalities .
High Line
The workday crowds have ebbed ; houses , streets , bridges and parks resemble a giant set , a theatrical approximation of a town or city .
Perhaps one or two ambiguous figures remain , apparently as lost as I am .
It is in such moments that I can begin to populate these spaces with my own thoughts and fantasies .
Kentile with Fence
I ’m a roamer of limbo regions , one of our last frontiers — places that seem unloved and overlooked , cracks in the urban facade .
The long exposures — sometimes for up to a minute — required by the low light are my way of giving such places attention and respect .
Number 39
While I wait for the light and shapes to register on my film , a passerby might accidentally walk into the picture .
At one time , interlopers annoyed me .
Recently , however , I have begun to appreciate such visits , welcoming these fellow night - wanderers into my photographs .
Are they surrogates for me , actors hurrying across a set , or lost friends and relatives coming to people my nocturnal cityscapes ?
Whoever they are , these figures add to the feeling that something has just happened , that something is about to happen .
Bethesda Fountain
When I discover a site that attracts me , I return to it night after night .
The first few times , the atmospheric conditions or the artificial lighting may not be quite right .
But on a subsequent visit , I may find that a light has gone out , creating the odd shadow that makes the space more angular .
I ’m delighted by such discrepancies , which are nearly invisible during the daytime : the unexpected and asymmetric , the quietly out of kilter .
Pepsi
Exploring the border between Brooklyn and Queens one night , I discovered a strange transitional zone behind the large neon Pepsi Cola sign on the East River .
For years , I had seen that sign from the Manhattan side as a kind of commercial icon .
Now , I was suddenly on a construction site , with bulldozers and backhoes parked for the night .
The earth was beautifully plowed , dark brown and scored with tracks , as if on a farm .
I was startled into a vision of the city ’s rural past , ensconced and hidden behind the great red sign .
Fulton Landing Warehouse
Walking past a deserted roofless warehouse in Brooklyn ’s Dumbo neighborhood , I saw motion - sensitive security lights projecting slanting blocks of green and yellow light onto the vacant ground enclosed by the structure .
This warehouse and the distant glowing Manhattan Bridge are part of today ’s New York , but they are also a link to the vanished 19th - century commercial city .
Even so , such a place is not merely about the contrast between past and present .
The city has a way of devouring its past and creating not memorials to a specific time so much as monuments to erasure itself , signs of pure absence and vacancy .

The lengths to which the anti-gay forces will go are really stunning sometimes .
In Florida , a tax credit for the entertainment industry will be forbidden if the movie or t.v. show has gay characters :
Florida lawmakers are considering a “ family friendly ” bill that would deny tax credits to films and television shows with gay characters in favour of those promoting traditional values .
The proposal , which has fuelled a heated controversy for its discriminatory nature , would increase current tax credits from two to five percent of productions costs for shows considered “ family friendly . ”
Those productions are defined as films or TV shows with a “ cross- generational appeal ” that includes a “ responsible resolution of issues . ”
Smoking , profanity , nudity and sex are also out , along with what the state ’s sex crime laws define as “ obscene . ”
The little - known provision was slipped into a 75 - million - dollar incentive package that Republican leaders who hold the majority in the state House of Representatives hope will bring more entertainment industry jobs to Florida .
That ’s how Florida intends to bring more jobs ?
With anti-gay legislation ?
Um , do any of the anti-gay leaders in the Florida legislature know anyone in the entertainment industry ?
Maybe Anita Bryant should head the Florida entertainment commission .
It ’s feeling like the 70s again .
And , one does wonder what the recently married ( to a woman ) Governor of Florida , Charlie Crist , thinks about this legislation .
Here ’s the original report from the Palm Beach Post :
Cengiz Yar Jr , an American in Bangkok : " Two red shirts setting one of the many blazes on the Rama IV road on Saturday . "
Thai authorities have set an ultimatum to protesters camped in Bangkok , calling on women and the elderly to leave their camp by Monday afternoon .
One protest leader said Thailand was close to " civil war " after clashes with soldiers killed at least 25 people .
People in the area have been sharing their stories with the BBC .

It 's amazing how quickly a relatively affluent street can deteriorate .
Both ends of Lang Suan where I live are controlled by Red Shirt barricades .
A one way street that was once very busy now sees only occasional motor cycle taxis and has become two way .
Rubbish is piling up and the smell is overpowering the scent of exotic flowers .
Ants are beginning to appear in large numbers in areas which are normally packed with street food vendors and people .
Last night a 7/11 shop about 50 metres from my residence was broken into , presumably for the food .
An explosion marked an attempt to blow into an ATM machine next to the 7/11 .
The sound of romantic , mournful music from the Red Shirt encampment last night was interrupted by intermittent gunfire and explosions and a part of the sky was black with smoke from burning tyres .
This morning I walked along our street and down some side streets to a part of the main Red Shirt camp in front of the Four Seasons Hotel .
The mood has very much changed from just a few days ago .
Mostly men remain and there is a deflated mood in the camp .
They now relieve themselves on the side of the street where once there were porta - toilets .
The laughing women waving their rattling plastic feet - the ultimate insult in Thailand - seem to have disappeared and now there is desperate danger in the air from men who know they are losing the battle .
Washing is hanging everywhere to dry and food is not so plentiful .
This is a country I have lived in for six years and I have come to love .
I am surprised by how moved I am by what is happening .
Today Accor , the management company of my executive residence and who have done a great job here under extraordinarily difficult circumstances , are moving the few remaining guests to a hotel outside of the danger zone and I think it will be some time before I can move back .
GARY BURROWS , FROM ST HELENS Monday , 1600 local time ( 1000BST )
A bullet was fired at Gary Burrows 's apartment , shattering the glass .
Last night a bullet came through the window of my 29th floor apartment .
I live about 100 metres from the protest site and the electricity went down in my block .
I 'd heard reports of snipers in the area , so I wanted to close the curtains to make sure no - one would see the emergency lighting in the corridors .
Before I managed that , someone shot at me .
A bullet came through the window shattering through the glass and going into the wall .
I 'm sure it was fired by a sniper because it was too close to me to be a random shot .
Empty streets and a tyre barricade - the view from Gary Burrow 's block .
I 've now checked into a hotel outside the red zone , initially for four days .
Like most people , I 'm hoping that this will blow over and calm down so that the government can step in and sort things out .
I 've been in Thailand for six years and this is the worst I 've seen things .
KARN G BULSUK , FROM THE USA Monday 00:30 local time , Sunday 1830 BST
Are we scared ?
Yes .
Never have we seen such chaos and unrest in what is known as the Land of Smiles .
The protest is spreading into previously unaffected areas .
I live in Klong Toey , some way from the protesters .
When we heard that the army was starting to blockade a main junction nearby we decided to call it quits .
We heard that there had been clashes between the army and red shirts just 15 minutes after we had left
We quickly packed our bags and evacuated the house , heading at first to my grandmother 's place .
We were also afraid that the authorities would cut off water and electricity , like in they did in the Bonkai area .
Later , we learned that the protestors have set up a make shift stage just a five - minute walk from our house .
We also heard that there had been clashes between the army and red shirts just 15 minutes after we had left .
The red shirts are being increasingly violent and desperate in their actions .
We were forced to move yet again - when we learned that the red shirts were stealing cars at the Bonkai area to drive into the army - to our condo four kilometres out .
I think there will be more bloodshed and even if the army end this Thailand will be changed and groups will assume violence is the answer to their problems .
JOHN TAYLOR , FROM LONDON , UK Sunday , 2015 local time ( 1415 BST ) John Taylor lives in an apartment close to where the protesters are .
I am really scared now .
I feel even more like a prisoner .
Somehow the red - shirt protesters have got past the security forces and have surrounded our building .
My fear is that they are going to set [ the tyres ] alight and try to choke us
Within the last two hours they have dumped loads of soil and put stacks of tyres around the block .
My fear is that they are going to set them alight and try to choke us .
This is disgusting - there are lots of women and children in this block .
I have no idea why the protesters would try to do this .
Maybe they are trying to make a statement of rich versus poor .
I tried to leave in the last hour - and - a - half but a protester put a grenade in my face and said : " You leave , you die . "
HELMUT HEILIGENMANN , FROM LOS ANGELES , USA Sunday , 1930 local time ( 1330 BST ) I was in the Soi Nam Duplee and Rama IV districts earlier , where constant fighting has been going on for days now .
There were previously crowds on the streets watching the protests .
Now there are only a few who still dare to go outside .
The locals filled me in on the positions of the snipers and I saw the bullet holes in the buildings , mostly coming from Rama IV towards the protestors .
It will just become more chaotic , more widespread and more like a civil war
I am surprised that there is quite a bit of talk about red- shirt " terrorists " using guns .
I have n't really seen any .
Most of the protesters are young guys building barricades from tyres and throwing firecrackers , while the military shoots live rounds back at them .
When I was out there earlier , there were large explosions and gunfire .
Everybody ran and some locals pulled me into their homes to escape the gunfire .
We then heard that someone who had walked past us just five minutes earlier , was shot .
The military appear to be shooting at will , not out of self defence .
If the numbers of demonstrators truly are increasing , then the military have to stop their actions .
Even if they take control over the main camp , it will not mean an end to the fighting .
It will just become more chaotic , more widespread and more like a civil war .
CHRIS BIERMANN , FROM GERMANY Sunday , 1630 local time ( 1030 BST )
It is quite obvious that this stand - off will last much longer than expected by all .
Judging by the smoke clouds at the Rama IV area south of our apartment and the ongoing explosions and rifle shots , the army does n't seem to have made any progress over the past three days .
The heavier fighting seems to have shifted to the north to the Makkasan area , which can not be seen from here .
It has been decided to extend the school holidays for at least another week , which seems to be a sign that the battle might last that long .
Our main concern at present is the supply situation , as all the shops are supposed to close , although some are ignoring this government order and are opening up for a few hours in the morning .
I took my wife and baby out of our home this morning
More serious though is the threat of a withdrawal of Red Shirts to the inner barricades as this would bring the fighting to our doorsteps .
Strangely enough , there is still a small opening in the outer barricades at one part of the protest camp - allowing pedestrians and motorbike taxis to pass through .
I took my wife and baby out of our home this morning and am just back to get some more stuff from our apartment .
There are just five other tenants left in our 35 - storey building and some of the adjacent buildings are completely abandoned by now which certainly does n't contribute to feeling any safer here .
TONY PREHN , FROM SYDNEY , AUSTRALIA Saturday , 2230 local time ( 1630 BST )
Our apartment is between two of the protest fronts and there was a constant peppering of rifle shots and explosions throughout the afternoon .
The streets are very quiet but there is a heavy military presence - and we are not in the most volatile area
There is a sense of uneasy calm now .
But there is the anticipation that the government forces will move against the protesters tonight .
We left the apartment briefly this afternoon .
The streets are very quiet but there is a heavy military presence - and we are not in the most volatile area .
There are armed soldiers on every corner with M16 rifles and walkie - talkies .
There are few foreigners or locals around .
The hotels have signs advising tourists not to leave the buildings tonight .
The protesters seem to have broken into two faction - moderates who are happy to sit and wait , and a more aggressive bunch .
We are not really sure that the government has the resolve to end this stand - off .
JOHN TAYLOR , FROM LONDON , UK Saturday , 1900 local time ( 1300BST )
I 'm imprisoned in my apartment very close to where the protests are happening .
There is just one apartment building between me and the confrontation .
Close to my home I was blown off my feet by what must have been a huge petrol bomb
I have no intention of leaving the building in the near future .
I looked in my fridge just now , and for the first time in my life I 'm thinking about rationing my food .
On my way home on Friday , at around 1600 , I was abandoned by my taxi driver .
He saw roadblocks ahead and realised we were close to the clashes .
He left me in the car and ran off .
I walked out amid a hail of gunfire .
It took a couple of minutes for me to realise what was going on .
Eventually I found someone on a motorbike to give me a lift close to my home in the central Sathorn District .
But close to my home I was blown off my feet by what must have been a huge petrol bomb .
The shooting and bombings were non -stop for about an hour with rifle fire hitting an office building next to me .
I can also see the burning tyres .
It 's now getting dark and it feels like the calm before the storm .
TORI ANDERSON , FROM PERTH , AUSTRALIA Saturday , 1300 local time ( 0900BST )
The atmosphere is really tense because there is such a build - up of soldiers and weapons
It was a sleepless night last night in Bangkok .
All night I heard gunfire and bombs exploding .
I live five minutes from the Red Zone and it was a scary night to be in this city .
Gunfire and explosions continued throughout the night and into the morning .
There are periodic blasts now .
On Friday , I went down to see what was happening and was caught in the crossfire - a truly frightening experience .
There are soldiers everywhere and I assumed with the huge army presence I may be safe .
But the protesters began throwing things at the army and they started shooting back .
I had to run down the side of a building to gain cover .
I waited for the firing to stop then I ran back home and have n't left since .
I'm a development worker and have lived in Pakistan and Afghanistan but I feel more worried right now .
The atmosphere is really tense because there is such a build - up of soldiers and weapons .
Many roads are blocked off and taxi drivers have stopped taking people in this area .
There is barbed wire everywhere .
It 's going to get messy for sure tonight .
Many people I know here are thinking of leaving Bangkok .
Everything is building up to a big confrontation tonight .
Let 's hope that this will be over soon and this peaceful city can continue to thrive .

Frank Buckles , 109 years old , at the WWI monument for D.C. residents .
[ Photo by David DeJonge ]
In 1917 , Frank Buckles , 16 , fudged his age , enlisted in the U.S. Army , and got himself sent to France so he could be a part of the biggest news story of his young life — the Great War .
Now , at 109 , having enjoyed the life of a gentleman farmer in West Virginia for more than half a century , he finds himself famous as America ’s last living World War I veteran .
And he ’s recently become an activist .
Buckles ’ cause is the creation of a National World War I Memorial on the Mall in Washington , D.C.
As the last living American veteran of that war , he says , “ I know that I am a representative of all those who have gone before me .
Those veterans , especially those who made the supreme sacrifice , should be remembered . ”
Actually , there is already a relatively small monument in the nation ’s capital , recognizing the 500 or so District of Columbia residents who died in World War I .
It was dedicated in 1931 , when Americans typically honored their war dead locally , town by town .
That changed in 1982 when the National Vietnam Veterans Memorial was unveiled on the Mall , followed by national memorials to veterans of World War II and the Korean War .
Historically , every war commemorated on the Mall can trace its roots back to World War I. More Americans died in that war than in Korea and Vietnam combined .
The U.S. played a significant role in winning the war for the Allies and , in the process , was transformed into a world power .
So why no national memorial ?
One obstacle has been the territorial feud between those who want to enhance the existing D.C. monument and those who have insisted that the recently restored Liberty Memorial in Kansas City , Mo. , the site of the National WWI Museum , already is the national memorial .
Both sides have had strong supporters in Congress .
The District ’s monument has deteriorated badly over the decades — so badly that in 2006 the D.C. Preservation League put it on its Most Endangered Places list .
This led Edwin L. Fountain , then the League ’s president , to establish the World War I Memorial Foundation along with David DeJonge , a photographer .
Its objective : to restore , expand , and re-dedicate the existing monument as a “ National and District of Columbia World War I Memorial . ”
Frank Buckles joined that effort , too .
“ When I saw the sad state of repair that the D.C. memorial was in , I felt that something should be done about it , ” Buckles said after DeJonge took him to see it in 2008 .
But for two years nothing could proceed because the two groups could not reach an accord .
Earlier this month , however , the foundation and the museum tentatively agreed on a compromise bill whereby both sites would be designated national World War I memorials .
Now the final battle remains — to push that bill through Congress .
Advocates hope a memorial will reverse our national tendency to overlook the 4.7 million Americans who served in the First World War .
In 2003 , when I set out to find a few living U.S. veterans of that war , no one , from the Department of Veterans Affairs on down , seemed to have any idea how many might be left , much less where they were .
I eventually found more than 30 .
They included men like Laurence Moffitt , a corporal in the 26th Division who spent his 21st birthday hunkering down in a rotten trench ; Bill Lake , a machine gunner whose good friend was killed by a German sniper as they were chatting ; Anthony Pierro , an Italian immigrant who survived three fierce battles ; and George Briant , a Cajun artilleryman who saw many of the men in his battery killed on the very last night of the war .
The American Battle Monuments Commission , established by Congress in 1923 and led by John J. Pershing , former commander of the American Expeditionary Force in France , built many beautiful monuments to World War I — but they ’re all in Europe .
The commission ’s charge was to create these monuments — and national cemeteries — at sites of American heroism so they might not be forgotten .
But few Americans visit those sites anymore .
Few even know they ’re there .
The veterans I interviewed had one thing in common :
No matter what they thought about their war or war in general or Army life , they were proud of their service to their country .
And Frank Buckles is proud to stand up for them now .
“ Veterans of all the wars deserve their honor , ” he says .
Richard Rubin is writing a book about the last American veterans of World War I .

The number of homeowners who defaulted on their mortgages even after securing cheaper terms through the government ’s modification program nearly doubled in March , continuing a trend that could undermine the entire program .
Data released Wednesday by the Treasury Department and the Housing and Urban Development Department showed that 2,879 modified loans had been ended since the program ’s inception in the fall , up from 1,499 in February and 1,005 in January .
The Treasury Department said it could not explain the growing number of what it called cancellations , almost all of which were apparently prompted by the borrower ’s being unable to make the new payment .
A scant number — 37 — were because the loan had been paid off , presumably because the borrower sold the house .
About seven million households are behind on their mortgage payments .
The Obama administration ’s modification program has been widely criticized for doing little to help them .
The program received another bad review on Wednesday with the release of a report from the Congressional Oversight Panel .

By
May 3 , 2010 --
The bailout of the debt - ridden Greek government seems finally to be complete .
The European Union ( EU ) – most centrally the French and German treasuries – along with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) will provide € 110 billion ( $ 150 billion ) in emergency loans .
The price for these loans will be high .
Along with steep tax increases and cuts in spending , the loans are conditional on a public sector wage freeze being extended through to 2014 .
[1 ]
This is in reality a wage cut , as there will be drastic changes to the so - called “ bonuses ” – holiday pay that has become an essential part of the income package of low - paid public sector workers .
The anger at these cuts is everywhere in Greek society .
Giorgos Papadapoulos is a 28 - year - old policeman who normally confronts demonstrators .
But in March he put aside his riot shield and joined the mass protests which have become a regular part of life in Greece .
“ It ’s a different feeling for me ” , he told journalists while he was on the demonstration .
“ But this is important .
It hurts me and my family . ” [ 2 ]
However , the crisis in Greece has revealed not just a shift to the left in Europe .
It has also brought to the surface a seamy reactionary underside to politics in the EU portion of the Eurasian landmass .
The April 29 , 2010 , front page of the mass circulation German daily Bild screamed out : “ The Greeks want even more billions from us ! ” [ 3 ]
The echoes of a half - forgotten German nationalism gave shivers to those with an historic memory .
One who has such a memory – Greece ’s deputy prime minister Theodoros Pangalos – reminded Greek voters of the horrors of World War II .
“ They [ the Germans ] took away the gold that was in the Bank of Greece ” , he said .
“ They took away Greek money , and they never gave it back . ” [ 4 ]
It was a thinly disguised attempt to divert attention from a crisis over which his party ( the Panhellenic Socialist Movement or PASOK ) has helped create .
These kinds of reactionary nationalisms were supposed to have been superseded by the progressive cosmopolitanism of the EU .
` Nicer ' capitalism ?
That many have clung to a hope that the EU contains within it the seeds of a progressive capitalism is not in itself news .
Antonio Negri , co-author of Empire , supported a call for a “ yes ” vote on the European constitution in 2004 - 2005 .
His rationale was explained very well by Salvatore Cannavò , then deputy editor of Liberazione , the daily paper of Italy ’s Rifondazionie Comunista .
Empire , for Negri , is the new globalized , capitalistic society .
He thinks of Europe as being a “ brake on the ideology of economic unilateralism which is capitalist , conservative and reactionary .
So Europe can become a counterweight against US unilateralism . ” [ 5 ]
Another with faith in the EU was Christopher Hitchens , who describes himself as “ one of the few on the Left to advocate enlargement of the European Union and to identify it with the progressive element in politics ” .
[ 6 ]
But really , Hitchens need n’t describe himself as being so alone .
In their hope that the EU represents a “ nicer ” capitalism than that in the United States , the very radical Negri and the ex-left gadfly Hitchens are actually trailing behind the very mainstream “ social liberal ” politics of very traditional European social democratic parties , still by far the principal force in the workers ’ movement and the left in Europe .
Hitchens ’ and Negri ’s pro-EU stances place them within the hegemonic project of European capitalism , mediated – as is so often the case – by European social democracy .
This hope for a progressive EU has been sorely tested by the most recent slump in the capitalist economy – the so - called “ Great Recession ” of 2008 - 09 – the trigger for the debt problems in Greece and elsewhere .
November 2009 , 57 per cent of the 53 per cent who participated in a referendum in Switzerland voted to ban the building of mosque minarets in that country .
This reactionary trend is not restricted to Switzerland .
In April we learned that the home affairs committee of the federal parliament in Belgium voted unanimously to ban Muslim women from veiling their faces in public .
“ Support for the ban ... transcended party lines , ranging from the Greens to the far right . ”
Similar restrictions are being contemplated elsewhere in Europe , including in France and the Netherlands .
That this reflected a rise in Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism is revealed by the fact that “ only four modest sized or small minarets exist in Switzerland ” , [ 7 ] and that in Belgium “ very few women wear the full veil , and there has been little public debate about the need to ban it ” . [ 8 ]
Scapegoats
It needs little analysis to see what is at work here .
The deep crisis of 2008 and 2009 triggered huge government - spending programs across the continent .
That spending worked to stem the crisis , but left governments saddled with unsustainable debts .
Every government is now preparing to address this debt crisis by slashing government spending .
The anti-Arab racism is a deeply reactionary , very old - fashioned and very predictable way for ruling elites to try and “ change the channel ” and make working people and the poor look at scapegoats , rather than at the deep attacks on social services and public sector workers that are around the corner throughout the continent .
The anti-Greek nationalism in Germany – which threatens to derail a bailout sorely needed by German as well as Greek capital – reflects this politics of scapegoating getting out of the hands of German capital , and opening the door to populist far - right forces , an increasingly sombre menace on the fringes of the European political landscape .
This shift right is not a big step for politics in the EU .
The EU could present itself as a force for progress , given the barbaric history of European civilisation .
A collection of nations – whose continent had , in a century and a half , witnessed the bloodiest wars ever seen in human history – had found a way to unite and partially reduce their divisions .
Holders of an EU passport could travel easily from one country to the next – and more importantly work in any country of the EU .
The emergence of a common currency for some of the EU states seemed to indicate an even greater reduction in tensions in a continent comprised of historic rivals .
But this progressive surface appearance masked another aspect of the barbarism that has been European civilisation .
Its roots are not just in the 150 years of intra-European rivalry which resulted in the Napoleonic Wars , World Wars I and II .
Those roots are even more in the 500 years of colonial conquest of the global South , which resulted in the depopulation of whole sections of Latin America and the Caribbean , the horrors of the Atlantic Slave Trade , and the long humiliation and plunder of three of the four most populated regions in the world – China , the Indian sub - continent and the Indonesian archipelago .
If the creation of the EU muted intra-European rivalries , it did not lessen European pressure on the global South .
If anything , it led to an intensification of European imperialism abroad .
European imperialism
European corporations , from Latin America to Africa to Asia , have been as much a part of the story of imperialism in the late 20th and early 21st century as has been the much more recognisable hand of the United States .
In fact , an argument could be made that the very reluctant decision to embark on the process of European integration was spurred not so much by a desire to create a progressive Europe , but rather by the recognition that another round of wars between the European states would make all of Europe incapable of participating with the United States in the ongoing plunder of the great riches in the global South .
It was either all in or not at all – and the EU was the result .
In other words , there has always been a reactionary side to the EU project .
Internal migration for holders of EU passports was wonderful for the workers of Europe .
But for those outside the EU , what it meant was “ Fortress Europe ” – a wall of anti-immigrant rules and regulations from Italy to Spain to Germany .
And while it was one thing to push forward with a unity project so long as each country in the project was in its majority white and Christian – when the project faced up to its next task , expanding to include the largely Islamic country of Turkey – a sudden reluctance showed its hand , a reluctance which could only with difficulty conceal its xenophobia and racism .
There is another aspect to the imperialist roots of the project of European Union – the unequal relations between states inside the EU .
Doug Saunders , writing in the Globe and Mail , is going too far when he calls Greece , Portugal and Spain “ economic colonies ” of Germany .
But he is highlighting something important about the unequal structure which is the EU .
There is an inner core of dominant countries – on the continent , Germany and France in particular – and an outer layer of countries which has a very unequal relationship with that core .
Germany is the world ’s second - largest exporter , ahead of the United States and exceeded only by China , and its largest markets are its European neighbours .
These countries are net importers ...
These importing countries have more money flowing out of their borders than they have coming in – for Greece , an amount equivalent to a tenth of the entire economy – and Germany has a surplus , with piles of it stacking up .
Money cannot sit still , and nature abhors a vacuum , so German banks disposed of those heaps of surplus export - payment cash by lending it to companies , especially property developers , in those same countries at low interest rates .
And they lent it to their governments , too , to fill their need for missing cash , which would in turn be spent on more German goods and services . [ 9 ]
This is the toxic brew which is now bubbling over as the EU finalises details on its bailout of the debt in Greece .
The fact , outlined by Saunders above , that much of this debt is held by German banks , means that there is every reason for German capitalism to support such a bailout – but the terms that are being demanded are very severe , and it is Greek workers who are being asked to pay the price .
These conditions also run counter to the lessons learned so painfully in 2007 and 2008 .
The biggest lesson of the Great Recession was that it is neoliberal folly to cut government spending when economies are shrinking .
Such cuts make economic decline even worse .
In fact what is needed is an increase in government spending , so that government demand can compensate for declining private sector demand .
Greek crisis
But if Germany has returned to economic growth and can now contemplate cuts to government spending , Greece has not .
It is estimated that the Greek economy – after contracting through all of 2009 – will shrink by a further 4 % in 2010 and another 2 % in 2011 . [ 10 ]
The cuts being demanded by the EU and the IMF will make a bad situation worse in the coming weeks and months .
There is hope in the situation – the evolving resistance emerging in Greece .
One poll indicated that “ more than half of Greeks say they will take to the streets if the government agrees to new austerity measures ” .
[ 11 ]
The growing mass movement and opening to the left underway in Greece is extremely encouraging .
It is with that movement that hopes ultimately lie for the emergence of a really progressive Europe .
But we should temper these hopes with a sober assessment of the reality of the situation .
Social democracy – and the union bureaucracies on which it stands – is deeply implicated in the construction of the structures which are today being used to orchestrate an attack , across the continent , on social services and the working class .
Social democracy remains the leading force in the workers ’ movement , and we can have no illusions in its capacity to lead a serious fightback .
In Greece the movement has necessarily broken in part with PASOK , as it is a PASOK - led government which is implementing the attacks .
But in Greece , as throughout Europe , social democracy is only a reflection of the problem .
The material foundation of social democracy is comprised of the union bureaucracies entrenched in the workers ’ movements in Europe and throughout the global North .
Ultimately the task facing the workers ’ movement and the left is not just a political break from social democracy , but organisational independence from these union bureaucracies .
Winning that independence will be bound up with creating a counter - hegemonic project whose horizons are not just the internal politics of Europe , but the fact of Europe ’s implication in the imperialism which oppresses the majority of the world ’s population .
Our counter - hegemonic project , in other words , cannot simply focus on economic issues .
A counter - hegemonic project in Europe – as in North America – has to simultaneously involve a break from chauvinism and racism .
Such a recognition has practical implications .
Greece ’s small role in Europe ’s noxious imperialism has been a series of chauvinistic rows over Macedonia and Cyprus , and its irresponsible and long - running feud with neighbouring Turkey .
This has translated into an inflated military budget , keeping “ Greek military spending well above that of other EU members , reaching € 14 - billion , or 6 percent of GDP , in 2007 and 2009 ” . [ 12 ]
In other words , fully half of the deficit problem – which stands at between 13 and 14 per cent of GDP – is caused by inflated spending on war preparation .
Breaking from chauvinism and militarism opens the door to a simple demand which can be a modest , but necessary part of the counter - hegemonic project – cut spending on war , not spending on welfare .

Rob Kothe , SailWorld.com editor , told Australia 's Nine News that " questions had been asked what record she was going for , " saying that sailing experts had long known that the route in question would not qualify as a full circumnavigation .
Some go a step further , claiming that Watson has not sailed far enough to meet the criteria required for an around - the - world voyage .
The World Speed Sailing Racing Council , the international sailing body that monitors around - the - world - sailing record attempts , no longer assesses claims for the youngest sailor to circumnavigate the globe .
Australian teenager Jessica Watson is less than two weeks from completing her quest to solo - circumnavigate the globe .
When the 16 - year - old arrives at Sydney Harbor on the recently announced date of May 15 and disembarks Ella 's Pink Lady at the Sydney Opera House , she will become the youngest person to have sailed around the world , alone and unassisted , without stopping .
An article on the website states that Watson will fall about 2,000 nautical miles short of her goal , because she did not sail far enough north of the equator .
The racing council world - record course rules for offshore yachts of any size state that the shortest orthodromic track of the vessel must be at least 21,600 nautical miles .
According to Sail World , when Watson finishes , she likely will have traveled a course of around 23,000 nautical miles , according to her log .
But as happens in every sailing passage , Jessica has not sailed a straight line , instead zigging and zagging her way across the oceans , adding mileage that should n't be included ( nautical mileage is published according to the straight - line distances and does not include the tacks or gybes that a vessel might make ) .
Corresponding to the great - circle calculations carried out by one of Australian leading offshore navigators , and cross-checked by a number of others , Watson has traveled 18,265 nautical miles orthodromic distance ( or 19,631 rhumb line distance ) , which adds up to 2,335 nautical miles less than the official circumnavigation distance .
Word of this has , of course , reached Watson 's team .
Spokesman Andrew Fraser has posted a formal response to the claims on Watson 's website , excerpted here :
The facts are as follows .
Jessica has sailed a southern hemisphere solo circumnavigation .
There are some basic key requirements that she must adhere to .
' To sail around the world , a vessel must start from and return to the same point , must cross all meridians of longitude and must cross the Equator ' .
Jessica has ticked all of these boxes .
Jessica has sailed the most challenging and treacherous oceans of the world , passing the four capes ( Cape Horn , Cape Agulhas , Cape Leeuwin and the Cape of SE Tasmania ) and crossed the Equator twice .
She has sailed around the world , non-stop , solo , unassisted and when she completes the voyage , she will be the youngest to have done that , sailing almost 23,000 nautical miles in the process .
We have official TracPlus data to confirm Jessica ’s exact distance upon her return , which currently sits at 22,336 nautical miles .
Watson and her team have long known that there is no longer a record -- the racing council stopped recognizing claims for the youngest in any area of sailing , so the record will forever belong to fellow Australian Jesse Martin , who in 1999 became the youngest to sail solo around the world unassisted .
Both Jesse Martin and Britain's Mike Perham , currently the youngest to sail around the world solo , assisted , will be at the finish line in Sydney to congratulate Watson when she arrives after almost seven months at sea ( Watson left Sydney , Australia , on Oct. 18 , 2009 ) .
Watson will achieve her goal of sailing around the world nonstop , solo and unassisted before her 17th birthday , and that can never be taken away from her .
There likely are n't many who achieve their dreams , especially not at 16 .
-- Kelly Burgess

Falsifiability and Objective Reality
Social Scientist have contended for much of the last century that we cannot approach the study of human behavior with the same tools that we would use to study the natural world .
This is hogwash .
And I think Karl Popper , the great 20th century philosopher , would agree with me .
Humans are animals , they are made up of chemicals and cells , their behavior is determined by a complex interaction of chemical processes and their lives are a network of cause and effect relations with other animals ( some of which we ’d call human ) .
If we are ever going to get a solid grasp on our own behavior , we ’ll need to use the items from the large and well developed toolbox of natural science .
Karl Popper believed that a theory is scientific if and only if it is falsifiable .
Most scientists would agree with this statement , and in fact would be shocked by anyone who did n’t .
( This may be why natural scientists and social scientists do n’t tend to hang out together ! )
But , falsifiability presupposes a belief in an Enlightenment - style “ objective ” reality beyond that of our own minds .
In much of social science , especially in sociology and psychology , there is a powerful belief in a post - modern relativism that rejects an objective reality .
That is to say , they do n’t believe that there is a truth that is inherent to the objects of study themselves .
Without a belief in an objective truth outside the mind of the observer , it is impossible to even discuss what it would mean to falsify a statement .
Therefore , you cannot use Poppers falsifiability axiom as a demarcation line for what is and is n’t science .
And now we allow in all sorts of unfalsifiable statements and theories simply because who is to say what is and is not objectively true ?
This is not good science .
But , it defines much of what passes for science in the world of social inquiry .
Now , it must be said , that the truth is likely somewhere in the middle .
But , most relativists are basing their relativism on what I ’d consider a false understanding of some basic ideas .
Among the more common things I hear when encountering someone who is a hardcore relativist , who wants to impress me ( knowing that I ’m a mathematician ) is with the idea of quantum physics .
It usually goes something like this , “ hey , man , you know that every time we observe a particle we
change it ’s state .
So , everything is relative .
Our presence changes what we observe .
There is a reflexivity between us and the object .
There is no way to know what ’s what if every time observe something that something changes .
Reality can be and is manipulated . ”
OK , true .
But , it ’s missing the point .
When we say we change a particles state , we are n’t saying the particle did n’t have a state to begin with .
It was simply a state we ca n’t directly observe .
That is n’t relativism in the strictest sense .
Sure if I observe it and you observe it , we ’ll see different things , but that does n’t mean the particle did n’t have an objective state before we each changed it .
True relativism would be that the particle has no state until someone
observes it .
But , that is n’t quite how it works .
Think of a particle as a coin .
Suppose I spin that coin on a table .
While it is spinning is it heads or tails ?
You might say neither , or more accurately , you could say both .
It ’s 50 % heads and 50 % tails .
That ’s its " objective " state .
We 'd think of it as a probability of heads vs tails , but that is in fact the definition of quantum state .
In mathy terms , we 'd call it a convex linear combination of basis states .
So if we wrote Heads as H and Tails as T , and picked the number " p " to be a number between 0 and 1 , we could write the state of the coin as pH + ( 1 - p ) T.
It 's a probability .
But , it 's still a state defined by the equation above .
This can get worse : what if we lived in a world where we were n't able to see a coin while it was spinning .
What if we could only see coins when they are heads or tails with 100 % probability – that is , when they are flat on the table .
Then if I wanted to observe the coin , I 'd have to slam my hand down on top of it to stop it from spinning ( assuming I knew where to slam my hand down ! ) .
And what if , for example , that it landed heads up .
Now suppose it always pops back up and begins spinning again after a minute .
Then you come by and slam your hand down on it .
If you caused it to land on tails , then we ’d each have seen the same coin in different states .
I 'd claim the coin is heads , you 'd claim the coin is tails , but neither of us would realize that it was a combination of both before we slammed our hands down on it .
Many things in the natural world are of this form ( or we 're forced to deal with them in a form like this ) .
That does n’t mean we ca n’t study them objectively , and infer what we can , correct for our own “ observation ” errors , etc .
Physics is going along just fine with far crazier objects than humans could ever hope to be .
There is no reason we have to pretend that studying human behavior is somehow so much harder than studying particle physics .
Popper ’s 3 Worlds
One More Time
There is no doubt that the reality outside our minds is not always in line with the perceived reality we hold within our minds .
Many natural scientists , in light of this , are Cartesian dualists without even knowing it .
That is , they accept that there are two worlds : the world of material things that we study ; and the world of the human mind .
They accept that these do n’t always jive , and that each one has an influence on the other .
But , keeping them separate , at least heuristically , is seen as useful .
In social science there is a stronger emphasis on the effects culture on the mind .
And this is seen as a feedback loop from the mind to itself .
Karl Popper goes one step further with his heuristic and suggests that the universe is really made up of three worlds .
The objective world of objects .
The world of the Mind .
And the world of human - created ideas as manifested in books , paintings , blogs , etc .
The third world includes culture and so brings it out of the second world , thus striping it of some of its recursive properties .
What I like about the idea of the third world is that it allows for this world to undergo it ’s own evolution ( the way the other two obviously do ) .
And because of this we can study it ( largely ) independently using the tools of evolutionary research such as game theory .
I contend that Social Science is a proper subset of Natural Science and is in fact a subset of Biology , most specifically Human Biology .
To say that we cannot study Social Science with the same tools we use in Natural Science because we are ourselves of the type we are studying is an act in strange logic .
If we follow the strange logic further , then we should n’t study any animals like we study the natural world , because we are animals .
We should n’t study chemistry as we study the natural world because we are made up of molecules .
And we should n’t study physics the way we study the natural world because we are nothing more than a collection of atoms .
There is always some sense of recursion in any attempt we make to study the natural world .
Our brain is made up of cells which use electricity to fire information back and forth .
Whenever we are trying to understand electricity , we are using electricity to understand it !
Popper dealt with this problem in what I consider a most reasonable way , the Popeye way : Science is what it is , and that ’s all that it is .
Scientific statements can only be falsified , not verified .
And the world ( including the world of human interaction ) has an objective component
that must be sought after as truth in its own right .
It is n’t perfect , but it gets the job done .
The only way we ’ll ever make headway into the realm of human behavior is if we are comfortable approaching the human animal the way we approach the study of all animals – with science .
The highly successful symposium – Peace in our time – held in London recently promises a new direction in the debate this nation must have about the place of drugs in our society , and of the laws controlling their manufacture , distribution and use .
For the past 90 years this debate has been dominated by the professional purveyors of moral panic in our society – a toxic combination of politicians , pressmen , prelates and policemen , aided and abetted by ill - informed parents , who have sought to pre-empt any serious discussion of " psychoactive " substances .
The tone for this debate was set in 1920 - 21 , when parliament was first persuaded to legislate against the production and possession of certain narcotic substances – cocaine , morphine , opium and diamorphine .
At that time the British public was being fed lurid stories of " the yellow peril " – the dangers allegedly posed to British values by mysterious men from the East peddling " dope " and enslaving helpless maidens .
These stories had been given spurious credence by the frankly racist pulp fiction of the novelist Arthur Ward ( AKA Sax Rohmer ) , whose master criminal Dr Fu Manchu mesmerised the reading public .
In 1920 , the Lloyd George coalition government decided to exploit this hysteria ( heightened by the death of a minor actress known to be a dope addict ) by passing the Dangerous Drugs Act – the first general statutory restriction on the possession and use of psychoactive substances in this country .
The debate then was more or less monopolised by the purveyors of moral panic .
They have more or less monopolised the debate ever since – most recently in the totally manufactured hysteria over mephedrone , banned in the dying days of the Labour government on the so - called advice of an Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) that we know permitted itself to be bullied into conveying a rushed and ill - informed decision to a home secretary determined to ban mephedrone irrespective of the facts .
Indeed , well before the ACMD had even begun to consider the matter , police officers were stopping and even arresting citizens for possession of mephedrone and were thus meddling in matters that were then of no legitimate police concern .
This complete negation of evidence - based policy making ( for instance , no death has been attributed to mephedrone ) must never be allowed to happen again .
But my overriding concern is with the dangers to our civil liberties posed by the armoury of anti-drugs laws and regulations now at the disposal of the authorities , and with further restrictions threatened / promised by the moral panickers .
Every day of the week citizens are being criminalised because they imbibe , inject , inhale or ingest substances that they believe give them pleasure , or help cope with difficult times .
Granted , these people may need help .
But what is the point of criminalising their behaviour ?
It is now being seriously suggested that students – and their teachers – should be compelled to give urine or blood samples to detect the presence of cognition - enhancing drugs .
Am I to be required to penalise a student whose academic performance might have been enhanced through the use of modafinil ?
What about the student user of another stimulant , caffeine ?
As participants in the symposium were told , the " war on drugs " has been lost .
The decades - old policy of stamping out the supply and use of banned substances is palpably bankrupt .
More than that , it has cost and is costing billions of pounds ( to say nothing of countless lives ) to prolong a conflict that society was never , ever capable of winning .
The alternative is obvious : decriminalise , regulate and tax .
At the symposium , the thinktank Transform presented its " blueprint for regulation " .
In the " new politics " that we are promised , this blueprint must be taken seriously .
Seagate 's new GoFlex — the next evolution of the company 's FreeAgent external hard drives — introduces a new level of flexibility for external hard drive storage .
Seagate today introduced the next evolution of the company 's FreeAgent external hard drives — its new GoFlex storage solutions .
This new family of external drives and accessories introduces a new level of flexibility to traditional USB 2.0 storage .
The FreeAgent GoFlex storage family includes easy , plug - and - play portable and desktop drives , with an array of interchangeable cables and desktop adapters that allow each drive to adapt to the interface or device being used .
GoFlex hard disk drives are also specially designed to provide interoperability between operating systems in order to work with both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X computers .
“ GoFlex interface cables are about providing the speed , performance and connectivity people need to support their interaction with their digital content .
The explosive growth of video capture and multimedia collecting is expanding personal digital libraries to terabytes worth of content within the home , ” said Dave Mosley , executive vice president , Sales , Marketing and Product Line Management at Seagate .
“ These trends are driving demand for high - capacity , high - performance storage .
The GoFlex family of storage products meets this need by delivering simple , USB 2.0 storage and backup devices , with the flexibility to adapt as interface technology advances by using the various GoFlex cables and accessories to access content stored on the same drive . ”
Recent survey results by the Yankee Group indicate that more than half of people planning to purchase a new hard drive consider the interface connection an important factor in their selection .
GoFlex drives address this concern by providing a flexible , plug - and - play way to adapt to the most popular available interfaces or devices .
The seamless GoFlex cable system enables the GoFlex and GoFlex Pro ultra-portable USB 2.0 drives to be upgraded to USB 3.0 , eSATA or FireWire 800 connections simply by switching out the cable adapter .
Additionally , specially - designed GoFlex upgrade cables provide even more applications of how each drive can be used .
For example , the GoFlex Upgrade cable - Auto Backup transforms the drive into acontinuous full - system backup , giving consumers the peace of mind that their files and system settings are backed up , while leaving the remaining capacity for basic drag - and - drop file transfer .
Within the GoFlex family , Seagate has created a special ecosystem wherein people experience easy backup and enhanced protection of all their data — the same way they would expect a traditional hard drive to perform — only now their interaction with that content is not wholly dependent on the drive .
In addition to several cable options , people can pair a GoFlex or GoFlex Pro ultra-portable drive with a GoFlex TV HD media player or the GoFlex Net media sharing device to enhance their experience of the drive ’s content .
Using the GoFlex TV HD media player consumers can easily enjoy their personal digital media library on their television screen by inserting a GoFlex ultra-portable drive or GoFlex Pro ultra- portable drive directly into the media dock , or connecting another storage device , digital or Flip camera to the two additional USB ports on the back of the device .
Using the intuitive remote , owners of GoFlex TV HD media players can view movies , photos , and music from the comfort of their couch in 1080 p high - definition and surround sound .
Connect your GoFlex TV HD media player to the internet using the Ethernet or optional Wi-Fi adapter and stream digital content from a home network or popular online service providers such as Netflix , YouTube , MediaFly , Picasa and more .
The GoFlex Net media sharing device transforms a GoFlex ultra-portable drive , GoFlex Pro ultra- portable drive , or any USB mass storage , into a media sharing device , allowing consumers to enjoy their digital content outside their home using a PC , iPad , iPod Touch , Android , iPhone , BlackBerry or any other internet - connected computer .
The GoFlex Net media sharing device also integrates with social media websites , such as Facebook and Twitter , and publishes RSS feeds allowing people to keep friends and family updated GoFlex media sharing device owners can also stream content to other devices on a home network , including the GoFlex TV HD media player , to enjoy movies , photos and music on their TV .
For the first time , Seagate will include an NTFS driver for Mac OS X on all GoFlex portable and desktop offerings , enabling storage and access of files from both Windows and Mac computers .
The NTFS driver is simply installed once on your Mac computer , and allows access and storage of files on a Windows - formatted drive .
With capacities ranging from 320 GB to 2TB , FreeAgent GoFlex ultra-portable and desktop drives group high - capacity , adaptability and ease - of - use with all the backup and protection people have come to expect from Seagate .

A CERTAIN United States soft drink giant may disagree , but Bolivia has come up with a fizzy beverage it says is the real thing .
The drink , Coca Colla , made from the coca leaf and named after the indigenous Colla people from Bolivia 's highlands , went on sale this week across the country .
Coca Colla ... made from coca leaf .
It is black , sweet and comes in a bottle with a red label - but similarities to Coca - Cola end there .
One is a symbol of US - led globalisation and corporate might ; the other could be considered a socialist - tinged affront to Western imperialism .
The first batch of 12,000 bottles , priced at $ US1.50 ( $ 1.60 ) for half a litre , were distributed in the capital , La Paz , as well as Santa Cruz and Cochabamba .
A Staten Island middle school teacher who was removed from the classroom after allowing her eighth graders to use vulgar terms during a lesson on H.I.V. won her first battle against the city in federal court on Thursday , when a judge overruled a city effort to dismiss her case .
On Feb. 6 , 2008 , the teacher , Faith Kramer , a health and physical education teacher at Intermediate School 72 on Staten Island , taught a state - mandated lesson on the various behaviors that can transmit H.I.V./ AIDS .
According to legal documents filed with the case , she wrote down the polite words for sexual organs , sexual acts and bodily fluids on the board — and then asked her students to list any other terms they might know for those things .
In doing so , the judge ruled , she appeared to be following the spirit of a state syllabus that directed that students be encouraged to use sexual terms that they understood , so that they could relate those words to the more formal terminology .
“ If students use different terms , ” the syllabus says , “ make sure they understand the relationship between both sets of terms . ”
Ms. Kramer argued that she did not ask students to write the resulting slang words , euphemisms and vulgarities in their notebooks , but some did .
As a result , some of Ms. Kramer ’s 30 students went home with neatly transcribed lists of off - color words for sexual acts and body parts , including two Yiddishisms for the male sexual organ .
At least one parent called the school to complain , court documents state .
A vast area of earthquake - hit Chile , including the capital city of Santiago , has been plunged into darkness by a massive blackout , the National Emergency Office said .
Officials say the area without power covered a 2,000 - kilometre stretch affecting about 80 per cent of Chile 's population of 17 million people .
Power went out in the capital just before 9:00 pm ( local time ) on Sunday , and there were also reported problems with phone services .
It is not known if the blackout is related to the massive 8.8 - magnitude quake that rocked central Chile on February 27 , or to the numerous aftershocks that have shaken the country since .
Officials says a power grid failure triggered a loss of electrical service from Atacama in the desert north , to the temperate central region where Santiago sits , to the much cooler south all the way to Chiloe island .

This study tested conventional wisdom about how insurgencies end against the evidence from 89 insurgencies .
It compares a quantitative and qualitative analysis of 89 insurgency case studies with lessons from insurgency and counterinsurgency ( COIN ) literature .
While no two insurgencies are the same , the authors find that modern insurgencies last about ten years and that a government 's chances of winning may increase slightly over time .
Insurgencies are suited to hierarchical organization and rural terrain , and sanctuary is vital to insurgents .
Insurgent use of terrorism often backfires , and withdrawal of state sponsorship can cripple an insurgency , typically leading to its defeat .
Inconsistent support to either side generally presages defeat for that side , although weak insurgencies can still win .
Anocracies ( pseudodemocracies ) rarely succeed against insurgencies .
Historically derived force ratios are neither accurate nor predictive , and civil defense forces are very useful for both sides .
Key indicators of possible trends and tipping points in an insurgency include changes in desertions , defections , and the flow of information to the COIN effort .
The more parties in an insurgency , the more likely it is to have a complex and protracted ending .
There are no COIN shortcuts .

There is a general air of scepticism prevailing that Sarah Palin wo n't bother running for the Republican nomination in 2012 because , how could she be any more awesome than she is now ?
As things stand she gets the bendy straws and Lear Jets , the fancy hotels , the big speaking fees , book and TV deals , all without the messy business of running for anything .
After all , she stepped down halfway through her term as governor of Alaska to spend more time collecting free bendy straws .
Personally , I 'm not convinced .
For one thing her value is partly predicated on her being a contender in 2012 .
For another thing , why the hell not ?
Have you seen the rest of the Republican field ?
Mitt Romney ?
Mike Huckabee ?
Or what about someone no - one has heard of , like whatshisname from that place ?
The fact that Newt Gingrich is a semi-plausible figure in the race tells you everything you need to know .
Sarah Palin would be nuts not to run .
She said as much to Fox News back in February .
There are flaws in the " Palin is most definitely running in 2012 " scenario , such as the fact that even quite a few Republicans do n't like her , according to polls .
But they do n't much like anyone else , either .
In any case , the ones that do like Palin adore her and will turn out in Iowa and New Hampshire in January in six - foot - deep snow drifts to caucus and vote , and that 's what counts .
She is far and away the Republican party 's biggest star .
And she'd have the Tea Party smoke monster behind her .
Palin herself seems to be getting ready for God to tell her to run , according to this recent outing :
Palin said she and her family have had an " exciting and full ride " since the 2008 presidential campaign ended .
Her travels around the country over the last year and a half , she explained , have given her a glimpse of some of the struggles that regular Americans face every day .
" If I can help provide some encouragement , some inspiration , some hope for them to get through their battles and make good decisions and get through a challenge , because that 's what we 've been able to do , then I am going to stay focused on that , " she said in the interview , set to air next week .
" Whether that 's on a local level in my own little town of Wasilla , or in the Oval Office , if it 's right , then we will pursue that . "
Palin said her next move depends , in part , on what God has in store for her .
" I do believe that it is a wise thing for us to put our lives in our Creator 's hands , " she said .
" I put my life into God 's hands and say , I 'm going to do the best that I can every day to bring positive change to people that perhaps need some help .
Need opportunity , too . "
So what would stop Sarah Palin running for , and winning , the presidential nomination ?
Two things .
One is the possibility that a coalition of heavyweight Republicans inside the party – Karl Rove , Haley Barbour , etc – coalesce behind a " stop Palin " candidate , which might be Romney but could equally be a Mitch Daniels or Tim Pawlenty type , and throw all their resources behind him .
They'd then have to shove all the other semi-plausible vote - splitting candidates ( such as Romney ) out of the race .
( The likes of Huckabee could stay in the race to slice off some of Palin 's religio - right support . )
Could that happen ?
The more plausible a threat Palin is , the more likely this is .
But the current state of the Republican party does n't lend much credence to that idea .
No , the most likely thing to stop Sarah Palin in 2012 is ... Sarah Palin .
The question is , can she muster the self - discipline to manage a nationwide presidential campaign ?
Does she have access to the talent that would enable her to gather a good campaigning team around her ?
Can she select and retain senior staff and advisors ?
Because if she can do most of those things , she will probably be the 2012 Republican nominee – and there 's not much the rest of the party can do to stop her .
There 's a lot of hard work that goes into rounding up caucus - goers in Iowa , and it remains to be seen if Palin has the personal capacity to run such an organisation .
So far , though , she 's handled her life as permanent candidate in waiting well enough .
So maybe she has got what it takes , even if her history suggests otherwise .
Speculating about presidential candidates 20 months before any real votes are cast is a dangerous business .
At this point in 2006 it seemed the choice in 2008 would be between President Clinton or President Giuliani , and look how that turned out .
But unless an alternative emerges , it 's Palin 's to win or to lose .
{ April 6 , 2010} progress !
huzzah ! :)
it ’s been an extra-long weekend for me – no school friday or monday , and I do n’t have any tuesday classes . :) so I ’ve been hacking and doing homework and studying like mad .
there ’s still a lot of school crap to do , but I ’ve also found time for KDE , yay ! :)
and now , I * finally * have something I can take a screenshot of .
yes , it ’s not much … but it ’s mine . :) it ’s the very very beginning of an activity manager .
it does n’t actualy have any * activities * as such , but the day is n’t over yet . ;)
back to hacking now .
Governor Mark Sanford of South Carolina went to Florida last weekend to rekindle things with his Argentine lover .
It worked !
He 's hiking the Appalachian trail once more , we presume .
But it cost $ 1,200 in security for his romantic trip .
The Associated Press , those scamps , filed a public records request and found out that Sanford 's attempt to slip back into his hiking boots with Maria Belen Chapur cost the state $ 1,200 for 34 hours of protection .
Florida wo n't be reimbursed since the two states have a " reciprocal agreement . "
Presumably that means when a Florida politician runs off to South Carolina with his mistress for the weekend and receives police protection , the score will eventually be evened .
An Italian minister has stirred up controversy by not only criticizing the efforts of the French to disconnect file - sharers from the Internet , but by also admitting he 's a pirate himself .
Interior Minister Roberto Maroni , a musician in a band , believes the solution to online file - sharing lies in a compromise , where music is paid for by advertisers and sponsors
“ Introducing heavy penalties such as those in France to disconnect people from the Internet is wrong and does not work , ” Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said recently as he openly criticized the French 3 - strikes ‘ solution ’ to illicit file - sharing .
He says the answer lies with a more creative approach .
“ A proposal I have made for some time without being heard is the creation of a great national site where people can legally download music for free , ” says Maroni .
He believes the cost of such a service could be met by advertisers and sponsors .
A keen musician himself with his band 51 District , Maroni says that he listens to music on his iPod wherever he goes .
“ I do not spend a day without music , ” he noted .
But where Maroni gets his music from has been raising a few eyebrows .
Speaking with Italian media , the Minister admitted that he ’s a pirate himself , as he downloads illicit music from the Internet .
Although there are probably many , many more “ in the closet ” , to our knowledge , this is the first ‘ pirate ’ confession by a European minister .
Maroni , who already admitted to illicit file - sharing back in 2006 , is unrepentant and says he sees his actions as a provocation .
He ’s making a stand because he believes that people should be able to download for free , a method of obtaining music he insists is not a crime .
The Minister said that acquiring music in this way is not the same as stealing from a supermarket , noting that all people are doing is taking a copy from someone else over a network .
“ It is as if the owner of this computer where I ’m going to take the music from did a copy of a CD he bought and gave it to me , something that normally happens when we buy a CD and make copies for our friends , ” he added .
FIMI , the Italian branch of the IFPI , were cleared disappointed by Maroni ’s comments .
“ A few million music tracks legally downloaded for free , over a billion click - free videos on Youtube by officers of Italian artists , more than 90 % of individual files sold at less than one euro from dozens of platforms .
The Minister should consider the risk to jobs and loss of revenues to the state because of digital piracy , ” the music group said in a statement .
Maroni ’s comments follow in the wake of a recent Communications Regulatory Authority report which concluded that not only does piracy fail to create the economic damages claimed by the entertainment industries , but repressive policies and monitoring are unconstitutional , unnecessary and harmful .

Gov. Dave Heineman of Nebraska signed a law on Tuesday banning most abortions 20 weeks after conception or later on the theory that a fetus , by that stage in pregnancy , has the capacity to feel pain .
The law , which appears nearly certain to set off legal and scientific debates , is the first in the nation to restrict abortions on the basis of fetal pain .
Abortion opponents praised the law and said it was justified by medical evidence gained since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 .
Abortion rights advocates said that the measure was unconstitutional , and that the motive behind it was to set off a challenge to legalized abortion before the United States Supreme Court .
The Nebraska law grew out of a battle over abortion waged in a far different forum .
After an abortion opponent killed Dr. George R. Tiller , a leading late - term abortion provider in Wichita , Kan. , last year , Dr. LeRoy H. Carhart , who sometimes worked with Dr. Tiller , said he would carry on his legacy by performing some later - term abortions in his clinic in Bellevue , Neb .
Lawmakers in Nebraska were outraged at the prospect of becoming , in the words of one of the state ’s leading anti-abortion groups , the next “ late - term abortion capital of the Midwest . ”
Early Tuesday , the state ’s nonpartisan unicameral legislature passed the new measure overwhelmingly , 44 to 5 .

The Defense Department just released its king - sized , $ 708 billion budget for the next fiscal year .
Much of the proposed spending is fairly detailed – noting exactly how many helicopters the Pentagon plans to buy and how many troops it plans on playing .
But about $ 56 billion goes simply to " classified programs , " or to projects known only by their code names , like " Chalk Eagle " and " Link Plumeria . "
That 's the Pentagon 's black budget .
Cobbling together this round figure for the military 's hush - hush projects is easier than it seems .
The Pentagon 's separate ledgers for operations , research and procurement all contain line items for " classified programs . "
Add those to the nonsensically - named programs , and you 've got yourself an estimate for the Pentagon 's secretive efforts .
Last year , that budget grew to more than $ 50 billion – " the largest - ever sum , " according to Aviation Week 's Bill Sweetman , a longtime black - budget seer .
A few more billion were added for wartime operations , for a total of $ 54 billion .
This year ' total would be $ 2 billion higher , a 3.7 percent increase .
Not all of the Pentagon 's secret projects got a budget boost , however .
Funds for the Cobra Judy missile - watching radar system were cut nearly in half , from $ 61 million to $ 36.5 million .
Similar , money for the Navy 's Link Evergreen project was cut to $ 41 million , from $ 123 million .

In addition to being a human tragedy , it is also a political catastrophe for Israel .
It has provided its critics around the world with fresh ammunition .
The Elemental Workshop below Seers ' Village holds many secrets , long forgotten by the world above .
Even as you read this , adventurers are scouring the world of RuneScape to find the means to pass through the body door , eager as they are to unlock more of this ancient forge ’s mysteries .
Your efforts in the previous Elemental Workshop quest quite literally required a piece of your mind , but you ’ll need it in a more typical , puzzle - solving capacity to get the contraption hidden behind the body door working again .
Grasp the inner workings of this contraption , another of Vitruvius ’s ingenious machines , and you will be able to show off your mental prowess with equipment made from the new body bar , and the ability to create body armour with elemental metals .

The impacts of drought depend on time - scale .
On short time - scales , drought means dry soil .
On long time - scales , it means dry rivers and empty reservoirs .
A region may simultaneously experience dry conditions on one time - scale and wet conditions on another e.g. wet soil but low streamflow or visa versa .
Standardized Precipitation Index ( SPI ) is a widely used measure of drought which can be defined for any time - scale of interest .
For any location , SPI is normally distributed with zero mean and unit standard deviation .
Index values > 2 indicate exceptionally wet conditions for that location , values < - 2 indicate exceptionally dry conditions for that location , etc .
Historical precipitation is the only input needed to compute SPI .
Australia experienced drought between 2002 and 2007 .
The image below shows SPI computed for a location in the drought - prone Murray - Darling basin of New South Wales .
The time - series run from Jan 1948 to Jan 2010 and the index was calculated for time - scales from 1 to 12 months .
Precipitation data is from NCEP Reanalysis [ 1 ] in a 1.875° × 1.875° grid cell centred at 30 °S 145°E .
The drought of 2002 to 2007 shows up very clearly .
It was preceeded by a wet period between 2005 and 2001 .
While 2009 showed an episode of severe drought at short time - scales , SPI at was normal / wet at longer time - scales during 2009 .
Agricultural yields recovered .
Calculating SPI-M
Empirical rainfall probability distributions are far from normal ( gaussian ) and often approximate a shifted gamma distribution .
The empirical cumulative probability distributions are used to transform the rainfall time - series into time - series of percentile probabilities .
A normally distributed precipitation index is found by pretending that these percentile probabilities derive from a standard cumulative normal distribution and inverting to find the index values .
This is simple in R .
If the vector data contains rainfall infall data , then :
fit.cdf <- ecdf( data )
cdfs <- sapply ( data , fit.cdf )
SPI <- qnorm( cdfs )
Tha rainfall data are M- month moving averages ( current and previous months ) .
A separate index is calculated for each calendar month to remove seasonality .
The R code used to compute SPI values ( based in NCEP Reanalysis or other data sets such as GCPC ) is here .

Noted Added 11 October 2011 : I have uploaded a slightly improved SPI R script here .
The function getPrecOnTimescale ( precipitation , k ) takes a vector of monthly precipitation values and returns a k - month average ( i.e current month and prior k - 1 months ) .
getSPIfromPrec( precip.k ) takes k- month precipitation values and returns the corresponding vector of SPI values .
A Sydney man is battling a rare form of meningitis after reportedly eating a slug as a dare .
Health authorities today warned of the dangers of eating the creatures after the man contracted rat lungworm disease , the ABC reports .
The disease is caused by a parasitic worm carried by slugs and snails .
The man is reportedly in a critical condition in hospital .
Dr Jeremy McAnulty from New South Wales Health told the ABC that cases of rat lungworm disease were rare and most people could recover .
" It goes away by itself because the body 's immune system will eventually get rid of it , " he said .
On 27 May the Danish Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision which obliges internet service providers ( ISPs ) to block access to websites that may contain – or link to other sites which contain – material which infringes copyrights ( the Pirate Bay in this instance ) .
The decision has rightly been criticized as a setback for internet freedom in Denmark .
The decision attaches undue weight to the interests of copyright holders while ignoring obvious dangers of abuse , restrictions on internet freedom and access to information and the lack of any due process .
The decision may lead to the blocking of websites that mainly includes content that does not infringe copyright and thus restrict the free flow of information .
Moreover , by forcing ISP ’s to police the Internet without due process the decision marks a dangerous precedent that is likely to include other “ illegal ” or “ offensive ” material in the future .
The Supreme Court ’s decision is only the latest instance of a wider trend towards internet regulation in Denmark ( ranked as the country with the freest press in the world by Reporters Without Borders ) .
In 2005 The Danish police set up the so - called Child Pornography Filter in co-operation with the Danish NGO Red Barnet ( Save the Child ) .
When Red Barnet and the Police identify web - sites that contain child pornography the police informs ISPs and request them to block access to these sites with no prior warning or hearing .
The sites blocked by the filter are kept confidential by the police .
In 2008 Wikileaks leaked all the sites blocked by the filter which seemed to show that several sites were either inactive or contained material that had nothing to do with child pornography .
Earlier in 2010 the Danish parliament ( Folketinget ) passed a law , which will allow the tax authorities to notify ISPs of web sites operated by “ unauthorized ” providers of online - gambling .
ISPs will then be requested to block access to such sites .
Should the relevant ISPs refuse or fail to do so they will be subject to criminal liability .
No courts or tribunals will review the decisions of the tax - authorities nor will the owners of the relevant websites be heard prior to a decision .
It is an open question whether this law violates the Danish constitution ’s prohibition against censorship and / or the European Convention on Human Rights ’ protection of freedom of expression and access to information .
Several Danish lawmakers have proposed wide ranging restrictions on Internet access .
Earlier in 2010 the Socialist Peoples ’
Part proposed criminalizing surfing on “ terror related web sites ” and the Danish Peoples ’
Party has twice proposed banning www.psychedlica.dk a website dedicated to sharing information about drugs .
According to media reports the Danish governments has also been very active in keeping the ongoing Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) negotiations confidential .
According to leaks from the ACTS negotiations the current ACTA draft envisages intrusive measures likely to threaten internet freedom and the right to privacy .

Thursday , the FBI conducted raids of homes and offices .
Today , the Toms River Board of Education has decided to not fire Michael Ritacco as superintendant :
That was the informal decision made by the nine - member Board of Education after a closed - door meeting Saturday that lasted nearly four hours and 30 minutes … .
The special meeting , which started at 1:45 p.m. and took place at Toms River Intermediate School North on Intermediate North Way , was held to discuss subpoenas issued for personnel and records of school district employees following a federal raid two days ago .
Interesting that it is an “ informal ” decision .
One resident expressed surprise that he was not at least suspended , but you have to realize “ zero tolerance ” policies so associated with schools today only apply to those without power .
This seems like it may be very big .
NJ.com has posted a very interesting video where another resident says there are lots of rumors that Ritacco is a shady guy ( video )
“ many , many ( what we consider ) shady deals …
Camp Albocondo , our Bubble , the Ritacco Center …
We ’ve heard a lot of talk about things that are n’t quite on the up and up . “
She also says he is “ a nice man , ” “ a wonderful businessman , ” and reminds us to remember he is innocent until proven guilty .

As prophesied , I bought an iPad .
My intent was and is to use it as a home information and entertainment device rather than a serious work machine , but nonetheless I 'm writing this column on my new tech toy .
In part this is because I 'm hoping this will be the first professional column written and – God help me – illustrated on the iPad .
Also , the on - screen keyboard is actually a good size for thumb - typing with my monstrously huge hands .
As it turns out , this week a reader also sent me a working Virtual Boy .
This is an intriguing and somewhat troubling coincidence , as some skeptics , Apple - haters and blog - wags have compared Steve Jobs ' latest sensuously curved computing device to Nintendo 's greatest failure since the ill - considered crossover game Contra Kong .
As one of the few people to own both devices , I have to ask :
What if the naysayers are right ?
Should the fence - sitters who are still considering the iPad get a Virtual Boy instead ?
Would they be happier as early adopters or really , really extremely late adopters ?
In the interest of uncovering truth and filling column inches , let 's compare them side by side .

Will Howard Kurtz ask Chris Wallace why FOX News decided to make Newt Gingrich 's new book their number one segment of the day ?
Then they followed it up by interviewing Laura Bush and proceeded into their wingnut panel discussion .
Not one opposing view to Newt 's movement conservative high jinks .
And about Gingrich 's book : Newt 's proclamation that President Obama is running a Nazi - style political machine that is as dangerous as Stalin and Hitler should be enough to drum him right out of his elitist DC Beltway bubble .
Wallace seemed upset that Gingrich went all wingnutty on President Obama :
Wallace :
You also write this on the screen : " The secular socialist machine represents as great a threat to America as Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union once did . "
Mr. Speaker , respectfully , is n't that wildly over the top ?
Gingrich : No , not if by America you mean .... Just listen to President Obama 's language .
He gets to decide who earns how much .
He gets to decide when it 's too much .
Wallace :
We 're not talking about any company .
We 're talking about companies that the government has put billions of dollars in ...
Gingrich : No , no .. he has said publicly and generically .
Some Americans earn too much .
So now he 's going to decide that ?
Wallace : No , he 's not .
He has said that some Americans earn too much .
What Gingrich is doing is slyly trying to defend the CEO fat cats and his chummy Wall Street elites who screwed up the economy and their companies while they raked in millions of dollars , but he does n't come right out and say it .
Movement conservatives like Newt are very adept at talking around their far - out beliefs in a way that almost makes them seem reasonable .
They know how to manage the language and play it like an instrument .
His tone is muted , never going off pitch and always in control .
That 's their edge .
Karl Rove does it as well .
Gingrich , who has changed his religion almost as much as his wives then uses
God to justify his odious assertions about the President and what he calls his " secular - socialist machine . "
Gingrich was a bit surprised , methinks , that Wallace called him out on his " wildly over the top " attacks on Obama and I think it 's because Newt is parroting the exact same beliefs as Glenn Beck , Sarah Palin and the Teas Partiers which have caused quite a bit of unrest for the GOP elders .
And yet , Gingrich is one of the elders --- never forget that .
Gingrich is a talented manipulator of the American people and he's the one that suffers no pain when the economy crashes and burns under conservative rule .
It 's the average working class Americans that feel the hurt .
Newt 's argument frames the usual fear - mongering , boogie man beliefs that have been passed on for generations through the Republican Party .
The " Commie threat " has been used for decades and was made popular by Joe McCarthy until he was ousted as a nut .
But the College Republicans of the 80s - - people like Jack Abramoff , Grover Norquist and Ralph Reed - - took the Soviet Union " spies have infiltrated our government " paranoia to the kind of heights that can only be described as downright delusional , coupled with a Robert Ludlum - hero worship syndrome .
These guys read Russian spy novels and dressed up in army fatigues , flying around the world trying to embed themselves into the action , fighting against communism while supporting the South American Apartheid regime .
And it's this mindset untethered by facts that Gingrich philosophizes on .
Gingrich : Democrats Want to Impose ' Secular - Socialist Machine '
Gingrich said that he stands by his argument that the " secular - socialist machine " represents as great a threat to America as Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union , not in the sense of the immorality of those deadly regimes , but as a " threat to our way of life . "
" The degree to which the secular - socialist left represents a fundamental replacement of America , a very different world view , a very different outcome , I think is a very serious threat to our way of life .
I have a lot of problems with the way the President has handled certain issues , as we 've documented on the pages of C&L , but to say he 's a threat to our way of life is cowardly and immoral and should exclude Gingrich from our political landscape .
Of course , in the Village , conservatives can say anything without consequences .
Opposition parties spoke in support of NDP MP Bill Siksay ’s trans rights bill during a Commons debate on Monday , but two Conservative MPs raised concerns .
Siksay ’s C-389 would add gender identity and gender expression as prohibited grounds of discrimination to the Canadian Human Rights Act .
The private member ’s bill would also amend the hate crime and sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code to protect trans people .
“ I ’m really happy that there ’s clear support on the opposition benches , ” says Siksay .
“ Even the government ’s response raised important questions that need to be answered as part of this debate , and I think can be answered , and answered successfully .
I ’m still hopeful that we may convince them that this is an important route to take . ”
The Conservative government ’s prime concerns , raised in debate by both the parliamentary secretary for status of women , Sylvie Boucher , and MP Lois Brown , were that the terms “ gender identity ” and “ gender expression ” were n’t spelled out in the bill .
They said that vagueness could have unintended legal consequences .
Both raised the point that gender expression is n’t found in similar laws in other jurisdictions , and both brought up their government ’s tough - on - crime policies to demonstrate their commitment to protecting Canadians .
Neither Boucher nor Brown responded to Xtra ’s requests for an interview .
So would Siksay support an amendment to the bill that would spell out those terms ?
“ I do n’t think any of the grounds are defined in the Act now , so I would be really hesitant to add definition for gender identity and expression in the Act , ” Siksay says .
“ That ’s just not how the Act has functioned in the past .
I think once there are hearings on it , it will become clear that there is an understanding of what gender identity means , and that will answer questions that the government has on that . ”
Liberal MP Rob Oliphant says the Conservative objections amount to “ splitting hairs . ”
“ The reality is , gender identity is very well known , ” says Oliphant .
“ GID [ Gender Identity Disorder ] is part of the medical terminology — people understand it .
“ They ’re using weasel words to try to get out of supporting this bill because their political base wo n’t like it .
I think the Conservatives understand what [ gender expression ] means , and they ’re simply raising issues to make it more palatable — they do n’t want to support this bill obviously , and they ’re trying to find a way out , and it ’s not going to work . ”
Oliphant , a former United Church minister , shared stories about trans people he has known in his personal and pastoral life .
On a professional level , Oliphant once chaired the Yukon Human Rights Commission and understands the need for clarity in legislation .
“ We ca n’t assume that people with gender identity issues are going to be included in other terms , whether gender or sexual orientation , because the issues are not sexual orientation or broadly based gender .
It ’s very specifically people who have gender transition issues . ”
NDP MP Olivia
Chow related some of her experiences about having a trans woman , Susan Gapka , in her office as a city councillor .
Chow says city councillors and staff hassled Gapka about using the women ’s washroom .
“ It showed the kind of discrimination , day - to - day harassment , ” Chow says .
“ Because her identity is changing , it ’s hard enough to be subjected to that kind of constant bombardment and being afraid of being outed , and it ’s really difficult .
I learned a great deal .
Susan ’s amazing . ”
Oliphant says that the Liberals have discussed the bill in caucus , and he perceives there to be broad support .
Yukon Liberal MP Larry Bagnell signed on as a seconder of Siksay ’s bill .
“ I think it ’s a basic human right in Canada , that everyone should be treated equally , ” Bagnell says .
“ Everyone should have the ability not to be discriminated against , not have hate crimes against [ them ] .
I think Canada can be a lead in this just like when we approved same - sex marriages . ”
“ It ’s really a no - brainer for me — it ’s something that should have been done long ago , and I ’m happy to support the bill . ”
Monday was the first hour of debate during Second Reading of C -389 .
A second , final hour of debate may occur before the summer break , with a vote to follow .
If it passes , the bill would proceed to a Commons committee for further review .

Android 's app trajectory is insane : December saw 4,000 new apps .
Last month saw 8,000 .
This month ?
On track for more .
In a year , the App Market will approach infinity , and our universe will collapse into a sizeless point .

For reference , it 's Apple 's App Store is on a similar tear , adding nearly 85,000 apps to its ranks since the beginning of the year , when it had just passed 100k .
But at this scale , comparing raw numbers does n't tell us much — the fact here is that Android and iPhone OS are the only two OSes with the meteoric growth in app development commensurate with the widespread demand and appreciation for smartphone apps .
In other words , they 're the only platforms that get it , for now .
From Bloomberg : More Than a Million in U.S. May Lose Jobless Benefits ( ht Chris )
[ Lawmakers ] are quietly drawing the line at 99 weeks of aid , a mark that hundreds of thousands of Americans have already reached .
In coming months , the number of those who will receive their final government check is projected to top 1 million .
...
Interviews with state officials found that in New York , 57,000 people have received their last check .
In Florida , 130,000 are no longer eligible as are about 30,000 Ohioans .
According to the BLS , a record 6.5 million workers have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more .
The article notes a study by the Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative that shows 3.4 million workers have been unemployed for more than a year .
Not all states have 99 weeks of benefits , but some workers are starting to exhaust all of their benefits .
The job market better pickup soon ...
Welcome to BBC UX&D .
We do the layer between people and technology .
Every day , we focus on the stuff that makes things special , as well as the stuff that makes things happen .
A little more than a month after the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , President Obama 's trillion - dollar overhaul of the nation 's health care system , the administration has already begun to tout its successes .
On his weekly radio address , the president argued that it was already providing Americans with " real benefits , " while Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius released a four - page memo laying out the " significant progress " she claims her department has already made in implementing the law .
" Over the coming weeks , our team across government will continue to work diligently to produce the regulations and guidance necessary to implement this landmark new law , " she concludes .
The prospect of adding new regulations to the books may be what passes for excitement in Washington these days , but it 's hardly a ringing endorsement .
So while ObamaCare might qualify as victory for Washington 's army of bureaucrats and rulemakers , for the rest of us , there is n't much to cheer .
Since the law 's passage , the news about it has been been unrelentingly bad .
With each passing it day , it looks more likely that costs will go up , businesses will face new bureaucratic burdens , and many individuals will lose their current health care plans — just as the law 's critics predicted before its passage .
Already , businesses small and large are warning of the ill effects of the law 's changes to the tax code .
In order to generate the nearly $ 1 trillion necessary to pay for the law , its authors scoured the tax code looking to squeeze out more money whereever possible .
And sure enough , within a few days of its passage , a handful of big companies took tax write downs in response to changes in the tax treatment of an existing drug subsidy .
An estimate by Credit Suisse puts the total damage across the economy at around $ 4.5 billion — with $ 1 billion coming from AT&T alone .
The change involved the tax treatment of a subsidy that never should have existed , but it suggests the extent to which America 's health care system is already reliant on government meddling , and how costly expanding the government 's role in the system can be .
And , perhaps more importantly , a planned investigation into the write - downs revealed that many big corporations are considering dropping their health care coverage and dumping employees onto the public dole .
When Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) heard about the write - downs , he called a hearing with AT&T and other companies claiming big hits .
But soon after the subpoenaed corporate documents were turned in , the hearing was canceled .
Why ?
Likely because , as Fortune magazine reported , the documents showed that the companies were considering dropping coverage for many employees — directly contradicting one of the president 's key promises , that , under ObamaCare , " if you like your health care plan , you can keep your health care plan . "
Even with penalties in place for employers who decline to provide health insurance , documents showed that Caterpillar could reduce its health care costs by as much as 70 percent and AT&T could save as much as $ 1.8 billion by shifting their employees into public programs .
Small businesses , meanwhile , have discovered that their tax preparation costs just went way up .
The PPACA will require small business owners and the self - employed to fill out 1099s for every company they do more than $ 600 worth of business with .
That means any freelancer who buys a mid-range laptop from Best Buy will technically be required to fill out a 1099 , no matter if the retailer is an indifferent chain giant .
As with the drug subsidy modification , the idea is to beef up compliance and raise additional revenue — about $ 17 billion worth .
Yet if it works , it will drive up compliance costs — how many home - based freelancers are likely to generate a docket of 1099s , complete with tax identification numbers , for big corporate suppliers all by themselves ?
And if , as seems likely , the requirement is widely ignored , it will have the exact opposite of its intended effect , pushing more and more taxable transactions into illegal , unrecorded territory .
At the same time , cost projections continue to spiral upwards .
The Congressional Budget Office now reports that the law will require an additional $ 115 billion in previously unreported ( and yet unpaid - for ) discretionary spending .
Medicare 's actuary has reported that total medical spending in the U.S. will actually go up and that crucial cuts to Medicare — cuts being used to pay for the law 's new entitlement spending — are n't likely to happen , but that Medicare benefits are likely to be reduced .
And in Massachusetts , the state whose 2006 health care overhaul served as the model for ObamaCare , insurers have gone to war with the governor , and the state treasurer is warning that the program could drive the state into bankruptcy .
Thanks to the pace of modern medical progress , it 's no longer true that , as Jean Baptiste Moliere quipped in 1673 , " nearly all men die of their medicines , not their diseases . "
But when it comes to health care , it may be that governments die of their reforms .

Definitionswirrwarr und der Verzicht auf externes Fachwissen Twister ( Bettina Winsemann )
Der neue Vorstoß der EU , Netzsperren gegen Kinderpornographie zu erlauben , wartet mit den üblichen Definitionsproblemen auf .
Auch ein typisches Strohmannargument findet sich im Entwurf der EU - Richtlinie wieder .
Die Debatte , die sich derzeit an dem Entwurf der EU - Richtlinie zur Bekämpfung des sexuellen Missbrauchs und der sexuellen Ausbeutung von Kindern sowie der Kinderpornografie entzündet , konzentriert sich größtenteils darauf , dass hier erneut die bereits auf nationaler Ebene in Deutschland kritisch diskutierten Netzsperren als Mittel zum Zweck angesehen werden .
Doch interessant sind bei dem Entwurf insbesondere die Definitionen , die gewählt wurden .
Die Jugendlichen
Bereits zu Anfang wird mitgeteilt , dass die Ziele der Regelung mit denen der neuen EU - Strategie für die Jugend im Einklang stehen .
Diese Strategie bezieht sich auf Kinder und junge Menschen , wobei hier die Altersstufe 13 - 20 Jahre festgelegt wurde .
Hier wird bereits die Definition des Jugendlichen ( in Deutschland die Altersstufe 14 - 18 ) mit der Definition des jungen Menschen , die die Jugendlichen sowie die Heranwachsenden ( 18 - 21 ) und jungen Volljährigen ( 18 - 27 ) umfasst , vermengt .
Weshalb bei der Kinderdefinition die Altersstufe bis 13 Jahre herausgefallen ist , lässt sich nicht wirklich nachvollziehen , da insbesondere ja Kinder durch die Richtlinie geschützt werden sollen .
Dokumentation des sexuellen Missbrauchs
Auch beim Begriff der Kinderpornographie wird vieles vermengt .
So wird anfangs erläutert , inwiefern die einzelnen Straftaten zu bewerten sind .
Im allgemeinen sind Handlungen mit sexuellen Kontakten schwerwiegender als Handlungen ohne sexuelle Kontakte ; das Vorliegen des Tatbestands der Ausbeutung erhöht die Schwere der Straftat ; die Anwendung von Nötigung , Gewalt oder Drohungen wiegt schwerer als die Ausnutzung einer Machtposition durch den Straftäter oder einer Schwächeposition des Opfers , was wiederum schwerer wiegt als eine Straftat , die mit dem Einverständnis des Opfers begangen wird .
Prostitution , zu der sexuelle Handlungen und Geld gehören , wiegt schwerer als pornografische Darbietungen , die auch ohne sexuelle Handlungen ablaufen können .
Kinder zum Zwecke der Prostitution anzuwerben wiegt schwerer als Kinder zur Mitwirkung zu veranlassen , da das Anwerben die aktive Suche nach der Ware " Kind " impliziert .
Die Herstellung von Kinderpornografie impliziert in der Regel das Anwerben und sexuelle Kontakte mit dem Kind und wiegt daher schwerer als die Verbreitung oder der Vertrieb von Kinderpornografie , was wiederum schwerer wiegt als der Besitz oder der Zugang zu Kinderpornografie .
Hier wird eindeutig von Kinderpornographie gesprochen , die lebende Kinder miteinbezieht .
Dies ist zur weiteren Beurteilung der Richtlinie von Wichtigkeit , insbesondere da im weiteren Verlauf von " sexuellem Missbrauch und sexueller Ausbeutung " geschrieben wird , die " Kinderpornographie miteinbeziehen " .
Der Eindruck entsteht , dass es sich hier um reale Opfer und Täter handelt .
Dies wird noch einmal unterstrichen , wenn es heißt :
Kinderpornographie ist die bildliche Darstellung von sexuellem Missbrauch von Kindern und als solche eine bestimmte Art von Inhalt , der nicht als freie Meinungsäußerung gelten kann .
Die freie Meinungsäußerung dient hier als beliebtes Strohmannargument .
Sie lenkt von der Problematik ab und suggeriert , dass Kritiker des Entwurfes die Dokumentation des sexuellen Missbrauches als freie Meinungsäußerung ansehen .
Die Diskussion wird somit von den technischen und den die Rezipientenfreiheit betreffenden Problematiken auf die Grenzen der freien Meinungsäußerung gesteuert .
Eine Taktik , die bereits vor etlichen Jahren bei den Netzsperren in Nordrhein - Westfalen angewandt wurde und sich seitdem immer in den Kommentaren der Netzsperrbefürwortern wiederfindet .
Erst in den Begriffsdefinitionen , die der Entwurf liefert , wird von der Dokumentation des sexuellen Missbrauchs abgewichen , hier heißt es :
Artikel 2 : Begriffsbestimmungen : ( b ) Kinderpornografie "
( i ) jegliches Material mit Darstellungen eines Kindes , das an realen oder simulierten eindeutig sexuellen Handlungen beteiligt ist , oder
( ii ) jegliche Darstellung der Geschlechtsorgane eines Kindes für primär sexuelle Zwecke ; oder ( iii ) jegliches Material mit Darstellungen einer Person mit kindlichem Erscheinungsbild , die an realen oder simulierten eindeutig sexuellen Handlungen beteiligt ist oder jegliche Darstellung der Geschlechtsorgane einer Person mit kindlichem Erscheinungsbild für primär sexuelle Zwecke ; oder
( iv ) realistische Darstellung eines Kindes , das an eindeutig sexuellen Handlungen beteiligt ist oder realistische Darstellung der Geschlechtsorgane eines Kindes , unabhängig von der tatsächlichen Anwesenheit des Kindes , für primär sexuelle Zwecke
Bereits die " Darstellung der Geschlechtsorgane eines Kinder für primär sexuelle Zwecke " dürfte sich als problematisch in Bezug auf die Bewertung erweisen .
Ähnlich wie bei der Diskussion um das Zeigen einer Vulva bei Wikipedia kann die Intention des Zeigens eines kindlichen Geschlechtsorganes von Aufklärung über Hilfesuche bis zur sexuellen Stimation vielerlei sein .
So werden bzw .
wurden des öfteren auf Seiten , in denen sich Eltern austauschen , auch Bilder der Geschlechtsorgane des Kindes gezeigt , so sich Eltern nicht sicher waren , ob es sich z.B. um " Abnormalien " handelt .
Hier ist fraglich , wie eine Intention , sofern sie nicht plakativ mit den Worten " hier was zum Aufgeilen " oder ähnlichem betitelt wird , sich nachweisen lassen soll .
In Artikel 2 ( iii ) und ( iv ) wird endgültig vom Schutz tatsächlicher Opfer abgewichen und der Entwurf auf die virtuelle Kinderpornographie sowie die Anscheinskinderpornographie ausgeweitet .
Wie bereits des öfteren erläutert wäre dies ein Bildveröffentlichungsverbot ( sowie das Verbot von Besitz , Konsum und , so wie es der Entwurf will , des Ansehens ) in Bezug auf Bilder von Erwachsenen bei realen oder simulierten sexuellen Handlungen , sofern sie ein kindliches Erscheinungsbild vorweisen .
Warum sollen sich Erwachsene an kindlich erscheinenden Leuten aufgeilen dürfen ?
Eine beliebte Frage , die den Kritikern dieser Regelungen gestellt wird , lautet : Warum sollen sich Erwachsene an kindlich erscheinenden Leuten aufgeilen dürfen ?
Die Auseinandersetzung mit dem Problem der sexuellen Selbstbestimmung wird hier auf die Metaebene verlagert , indem es als anrüchig dargestellt wird , jugendlich oder kindlich aussehende " Pornotussen zu verteidigen " .
Eine solche Argumentation wird auch gerne als " schädlich für die Sache " angesehen , was impliziert , dass es bei der " Sache " nur politisch korrekte Argumente geben darf .
Dabei ist die Frage , inwiefern auf Grund der Annahme , dass solche " Kinderpornographie " , die keinerlei Kinder und Jugendliche involviert , in irgendeiner Form schädlich oder anrüchig ist , die Selbstbestimmung eines Erwachsenen stark eingeschränkt werden darf und sollte .
Da der Begriff " kindliches Erscheinungsbild " nicht explizit erläutert ist , stellt dies eine nicht unerhebliche Grauzone dar , die letztendlich eine Vielzahl von ( nicht nur ) Pornodarstellern sowie sexuell zeigefreudigen Menschen mit dem Gesetz in Konflikt bringen könnte .
Die Frage ist letztendlich : warum nicht ?
Da bei dieser Form der Pornographie Erwachsene sich anderen Erwachsenen gegenüber zeigefreudig geben , ist in keiner Weise ein Opfer involviert , so man nicht davon ausgeht , dass Pornographie stets Opfer mit sich bringt .
Dies würde aber die Diskussion von der Kinderpornographie zur Pornographie im allgemeinen lenken und somit denen dienen , die Pornographie in Gänze ablehnen .
Realistisch aussehend ?
Selbst wenn man Pornographie als stets mit Opfern behaftet ansieht , wird mit Artikel 2 ( b ) ( iv ) endgültig klar , dass in keiner Weise Menschen in Bezug auf Kinderpornographie geschützt werden sollen .
Hier wird die " realistische Darstellung " unter Strafe gestellt , was bedeutet , dass eine Dokumentation eines tatsächlich stattgefundenen sexuellen Missbrauchs mit einem Comic gleichgesetzt wird , was für die Opfer stattgefundener sexueller Gewalt zynisch aussehen dürfte .
Die Richtlinie zielt hier offensichtlich auf Mangas und Hentai ab .
Für Comicladenbetreiber bedeutet dies somit , dass sie sich des Vertriebs von Kinderpornographie strafbar machen würden , so sie entsprechende Comics im Repertoire haben - die Reputation dürfte darunter nicht unerheblich leiden .
Netzsperren
Artikel 21 regelt dann letztendlich die vieldiskutierten Netzsperren .
Artikel 21
Sperrung des Zugangs zu Webseiten , die Kinderpornografie enthalten
1.Jeder Mitgliedstaat trifft die erforderlichen Maßnahmen , damit der Zugang von Internet - Nutzern zu Webseiten , die Kinderpornografie enthalten oder verbreiten , gesperrt wird .
Die Zugangssperrung erfolgt vorbehaltlich angemessener Schutzvorschriften ; insbesondere soll sichergestellt werden , dass die Sperrung auf das Nötige beschränkt wird , dass die Nutzer über die Gründe für die Sperrung informiert werden und dass Inhalteanbieter im Rahmen des Möglichen darüber unterrichtet werden , dass sie die Entscheidung anfechten können
Doch unabhängig hiervon will die Richtlinie auch Reisen regeln , die der Ermöglichung des sexuellen Missbrauchs dienen .
Explizit wird ergänzt , dass nicht nur die klassischen Sextourismusreisen gemeint sind - eine Erläuterung , was dann gemeint ist , fehlt bedauerlicherweise .
Schwere Formen des sexuellen Missbrauchs und der sexuellen Ausbeutung von Kindern , die derzeit nicht von den EU - Rechtsvorschriften erfasst sind , würden unter Strafe gestellt .
Dazu gehört beispielsweise die Organisation von Reisen , die mit dem Ziel der Begehung sexuellen Missbrauchs durchgeführt werden - ein insbesondere , aber nicht ausschließlich , im Sextourismus mit Kindesmissbrauch anzutreffendes Phänomen .
Die Richtlinie soll ferner dafür sorgen , dass auch das " bewusste Anschauen " von " Kinderpornographie " unter Strafe gestellt wird , selbst wenn die Bilder weder gespeichert noch heruntergeladen werden .
Inwiefern hier das bewusste und das nicht bewusste Anschauen getrennt behandelt werden können , bleibt offen .
Der Entwurf vermengt insofern in bekannter Weise die Definition und lässt die Unterschiede zwischen den einzelnen Formen der Pornographie weiter verwischen .
Hier würde die Konsultation und Miteinbeziehung von diversen Kritikern und Rechtsgelehrten weiterhelfen können , jedoch wird bereits am Anfang festgestellt , wie der Entwurf zustandekam :
Es fanden drei Treffen zu den Themen " Sexueller Missbrauch und sexuelle Ausbeutung von Kindern " und " Menschenhandel " statt , an denen Sachverständige unterschiedlicher Provenienz teilnahmen wie Regierungsvertreter der Mitgliedstaaten , Mitglieder der Sachverständigengruppe der Europäischen Kommission für Menschenhandel , Mitglieder von internationalen Organisationen , insbesondere Europarat und UNICEF , NRO , Vertreter von Hochschulen , Forschungszentren und anderen öffentlichen Einrichtungen .
Eine Reihe von Sachverständigen und Organisationen haben im Anschluss an die Treffen Beiträge und einschlägige Informationen übermittelt .
Externes Expertenwissen , so findet es sich im Entwurf wieder , war nicht notwendig .
( Twister ( Bettina Winsemann ) )
We have n’t got a lot to be thankful for these days in Pakistan .
But at least we are not Dubai .
Fed up with loadshedding , bombs , and TV cynicism pervading Pakistan , I recently escaped to Dubai for a holiday .
Big mistake .
Huge .
Ten days later I returned , gasping for Karachi ’s polluted , but far sweeter , air .
Dubai may have the world ’s tallest building and the world ’s largest shopping mall , but it also has the world ’s tiniest soul .
It ’s a plastic city built in steel and glass .
It has imported all the worst aspects of western culture ( excessive consumption , environmental defilement ) without importing any of its benefits ( democracy , art ) .
This is a city designed for instant gratification a hedonistic paradise for gluttons to indulge in fast food , fast living and fast women .
It ’s Las Vegas in a dish dash .
You want to eat a gold leaf date ?
Munch away .
You want to drink a Dhs 3,000 bottle of champagne ?
Bottoms up .
You want a UN selection of hookers at your fingertips ?
Tres bien .
Let ’s start with the malls .
These cathedrals of capitalism , these mosques of materialism are mausoleums of the living dead .
Slack jawed zombies roam around consuming food , clothes and electronics in a desperate attempt to fill the emptiness of their existence .
Whilst at the Mall of the Emirates the azan goes off .
Nobody appears to move to the prayer room ; everyone ’s too busy performing sajda before Stella McCartney , genuflecting before Gucci , and prostrating themselves at Prada .
With Dubai , one recalls F Scott Fitzgerald ’s The Great Gatsby .
The people are modern day Gatsbys , buying shirts that they will never wear and books they will never read .
Like Fitzgerald ’s roaring 20s America , Dubai is a moral failure a society obsessed with wealth and status .
Everyone is trying to keep up with the Jones ’ or the Javaids .
You see the goras with their perma-tans , streaked highlights and their flabby cleavages .
The upwardly mobile South Asian man prances around wearing a silly shirt with a large picture of a polo player on a horse , whilst their women wear oversized sunglasses and carry oversized handbags .
And the Arabs walk about with enough gold bling to blind you at ten paces .
But not everything that glitters is gold .
And Dubai is not only morally bankrupt it is also financially bankrupt .
Lately , Dubai , and its ruler , Sheikh Mohammed Al - Maktoum have been compared to another piece of literature — Percy Shelley ’s famous poem Ozymandias , which illustrates the inevitable decline of all leaders and the empires they build .
Shelley finishes it thus :
Look on my works , ye mighty , and despair !
Nothing beside remains .
Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck , boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away With $ 80 b of debt and a stock and property market that has tanked , the comparisons with Ozymandias are apt .
Abu Dhabi may have bailed them out but can Dubai survive as a regional hub in the long - term ?
Or will this city of hubris built on sand and folly sink back into the dunes a desert mirage that evaporates once the public relations people , the speculators and the tourists disappear ?
So for all you naysayers that bemoan Pakistan and its numerous problems please temper your pessimism .
Take time to celebrate our cultural , religious , linguistic plurality and richness .
Stop the cynicism coursing through your corroded veins .
For all its inadequacies , at least we have a democracy .
For all its irresponsibility , at least we have a robust media .
For all the police corruption , at least we are not a police state .
For all our littering , at least we have paper wallahs .
Remind yourself that at least we have a heart .
At least we have a soul .
At least we are not Dubai .
That was one provocative expansion of Obama - as - Rorschach test I had n’t encountered before , and I guess anything is possible , particularly when it involves race in America .
But what is unquestionably true is my friend ’s underlying premise  that the Obama we see now is generally consistent with the one he presented in the 2008 campaign .
Many , if not all , of the positions that have angered liberals since he entered the White House line up with his positions then , including his stubborn and futile faith in the prospect of bipartisanship in Washington .

Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
When the 2008 Obama called Afghanistan an essential war and vowed to take out terrorist havens in Pakistan , he was n’t just posturing to prove he was as hawkish as Hillary Clinton  which is what some chose to hear .
Though he nominally supported a public option as a plank of health care reform , it was not a high priority and he rarely mentioned it , according to a review of his campaign speeches , interviews and debates by Sam Stein of The Huffington Post .
Obama never said anything to suggest that he was interested in economic interventionism as bold as , say , the potential nationalization of failing banks .
He was unambiguous in his professed opposition to same - sex marriage and largely silent on gun control .
And as Jake Tapper of ABC
News chronicled last week , Obama had even opened the door to offshore oil drilling in the weeks before Election Day .
It ’s not just the Tea Party right or some on the liberal left who see only the Obama they want to see .
This phenomenon extends to moderate Republicans who refuse to believe that Obama agrees with them even when he does .
Susan Collins , the senator from Maine , reacted to the news of the Christmas Day bomber with an over - the - top outburst accusing Obama of being soft on terrorism .
Though Obama ’s education reforms have increased Pell grants and nettled one liberal constituency , teachers ’ unions , Lamar Alexander , the supposedly temperate senator from Tennessee , has characterized the president as pushing “ a Soviet - style , European , and even Asian higher - education model where the government manages everything . ”
Mitt Romney has now started a full - tilt campaign to angrily challenge the indisputable reality that “ Obamacare ” resembles his own health care reform package in Massachusetts .
What ’s clear is that Obama largely remains a fixed point even while the rest of us keep wildly revising our judgments , whether looking at him through the prism of partisan politics , race , media melodrama or any other we choose .
It ’s our recession - tossed country , not his presidency , that is rocked by violent mood swings .
That does n’t mean his presidency will be successful .
Being consistent is not the same as being a forceful leader .
If there ’s been an overarching , nonideological failing so far in Obama , it ’s been his execution of the levers of power .
Whether in articulating his health care bottom line , or closing Guantánamo Bay , or moving forward on repealing “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell , ” he has often seemed tardy or unfocused , at times missing deadlines he has set himself .
The narrative that might link his presidential policies into a clear , mobilizing vision for the country remains murky , which in turn facilitates the caricature of his views from all sides .
But in the immediate aftermath of his health care victory , at least , there does seem to be real , not imagined , change in Obama ’s management modus operandi .
Whether challenging Karzai and Bibi , or pushing through 15 recess appointments , or taunting those who would repeal the health care law to “ go for it , ” this is a far more energized executive than the sometimes tentative technocrat we ’ve often seen thus far .
The pace has picked up  if not to faster - than - a - speeding - bullet Superman velocity , then at least as much as the inherent sclerosis of Washington will allow .
And not a moment too soon .
The speed with which Obama navigates out of the recession , as measured by new jobs and serious financial reform , remains by far the most determinative factor in how he , his party and , most of all , the country will fare in the fractious year of 2010 .
If he succeeds in that all - important challenge  or , for that matter , if he fails  the enigmatic , Rorschach - test phase of Obama ’s still young relationship to the American people may rapidly draw to a close .
It will be the moment of clarity that allows us to at last judge him , as we should all presidents , on what he ’s actually done rather than on who we imagine he is .

Calvin and Hobbes Dear Editor : I will be stopping Calvin and Hobbes at the end of the year .
This was not a recent or an easy decision , and I leave with some sadness .
My interests have shifted however , and I believe I ’ve done what I can do within the constraints of daily deadlines and small panels .
I am eager to work at a more thoughtful pace , with fewer artistic compromises .
I have not yet decided on future projects , but my relationship with Universal Press Syndicate will continue .
That so many newspapers would carry Calvin and Hobbes is an honor I ’ll long be proud of , and I ’ve greatly appreciated your support and indulgence over the last decade .
Drawing this comic strip has been a privilege and a pleasure , and I thank you for giving me the opportunity .
Sincerely , ( Signed ) Bill Watterson
rom cafeterias to cocktail parties to the pages of important magazines and journals , few groups of friends have argued ideas so passionately and so publicly as the writers and critics known as the New York Intellectuals .
Rising from America 's working class they went on to wield great influence in the second half of the twentieth century .
ARGUING THE WORLD is the portrait of four members of this group : Irving Kristol , Irving Howe , Daniel Bell , and Nathan Glazer .
It is the story of a lifelong political argument among brilliant and engaging individuals who came of age as radicals at the City College of New York during the Great Depression and then journeyed across the political spectrum .
racing their rise to prominence as political and cultural critics in post - war America through magazines and journals like Partisan Review and Commentary the film charts their path through the controversies of the Cold War and Joe McCarthy 's reign of terror , their clash with the tidal forces of the New Left on college campuses in the 60s , and the fights which pulled them apart in the midst of the conservative backlash hailed by Ronald Reagan 's presidency in the eighties .
Driven apart by their responses to these historical events , by the nineties the four found themselves at odds with one another .
Irving Kristol became influential in America 's resurgent conservative movement , Nathan Glazer , a forceful critic of liberal social policy , while Daniel Bell fought to defend a besieged liberalism .
Until his death in 1993 , Irving Howe , ever on the political margins , endured as a key voice of the radical Left.
eaving personal reminiscence , location photography , archival footage , images of New York and the voices of friends and critics , ARGUING THE WORLD explores the passions , the issues and the era that shaped these men .
News : Arguing the World , the book , will contain a much - expanded oral history of Irving Howe , Irving Kristol , Nathan Glazer and Daniel Bell and the New York Intellectuals along with an introductory essay on the making of the film .
It will be published in the early summer of 2000 by the Free Press , a division of Simon and Schuster .

We ’ve blogged one or two hidden cameras here on the Ferret , but I think this is the first one built into a sculpture .
This 2.4GHz Wireless Table Sculpture with Hidden Camera wo n’t draw any undue attention , I ’m sure .
It broadcasts 420 lines and audio 100 m to the wireless receiver and the 500 mAh battery built into the statue means there are no silly wires to give it away .
It ’s got to be a bargain at US $ 183.99
This Spy camera kit includes a 2.4 Ghz wireless receiver and a wireless camera which is inside a table sculpture , the camera and transmitter are hard to be found by human eyes .
This covert system can be applied to almost any situation .
This model is battery operated or with power supply .
The camera is very easy to operated and no installation is required .
To operate you just plug and play .

As we all know by now , Wolfram| Alpha is a computational knowledge engine .
That means not only should it be able to do computations on a wide variety of topics , but also that it needs detailed knowledge of the names and salient properties of a wide variety of entities that are commonly encountered in human inquiry and discourse .
This is obvious in the case of classes of objects that fit neatly into curated data collections , such as mathematical surfaces ( e.g. , Möbius strip ) , countries of the world ( e.g. , New Zealand ) , chemicals ( e.g. , caffeine ) , and so forth .
What is perhaps slightly less obvious is just how much knowledge needs to be encoded to have a reasonable “ understanding ” of almost any named result in math and the sciences .
For example , most people ( including non-mathematicians ) have heard of Fermat ’s last theorem and therefore would rightly expect Wolfram| Alpha to be able to say something sensible about it .
And as one of my other hats involves writing the online encyclopedia of math known as MathWorld , which is hosted and sponsored by Wolfram Research , putting this information into Wolfram| Alpha naturally fell to me .
So , for the past several months , I have been attempting to gradually build up Wolfram| Alpha ’s knowledge base on named results in math and physics .
The screenshot below shows what Wolfram| Alpha now returns for Fermat ’s last theorem :
As you can see , Wolfram| Alpha begins by giving you the standard name for the result in question , followed by a clearly worded ( or at least as clearly worded as could be managed in the marginal space available 😉 ) plain English statement of the result .
Next , at least in cases where it is possible to do so , a mathematically precise “ formal statement ” of the result is given .
This is followed by any common alternate names the result might have , a listing of historical information , and finally an enumeration of prizes associated with it ( where relevant ) .
There is also a “ More ” button in the History section ( or “ pod ” as we like to call them ) , which displays much more detailed information , including original literature citations , information about when the result was first proposed and proved , who proposed and proved it , and so forth .
Now , one of the important ideas behind Wolfram| Alpha is that everything should be computable .
And while there ’s surely much more that can ( and will ) be done in this direction , you can already ask questions like “ who proved Fermat ’s last theorem ” , “ who formulated FLT  , “ Fermat ’s last theorem proof year , and “ Fermat ’s last theorem formulation source ” and have them sensibly answered :
As of this writing , Wolfram| Alpha knows 196 named mathematical results , and this number is growing weekly .
Some other ones you might care to try include Bieberbach conjecture , Gödel ’s incompleteness theorem , prime number theorem , and 3SAT .
If you ’re curious about the whole list , trying querying for famous math problems .
Similar results are also available for named results in physics .
For example , you can try things like Kepler ’s first law :
The physics results include associated formulas where relevant , in addition to the other properties , and will someday be more tightly integrated with Wolfram| Alpha ’s formula framework ( see for example , Kepler ’s third law to see both the “ formula ” and “ physics problem ” interpretations of this input — note in particular the “ Assuming ” at the top , which lets you toggle between the two ) .
As of this writing , Wolfram| Alpha knows 45 named physics results , a number that is also growing weekly .
Some other ones you might care to try include the EPR paradox , Schrödinger ’s cat , and the Biot - Savart law .
To see a full list , try famous physics problems .
Wolfram|Alpha ’s collection of named problems also includes interesting or useful class tagging in additional to just entities .
For example , you can ask for things like physical effects , Newton ’s laws , NP problems , prize problems , and so on .
Besides closer integration with the Wolfram|Alpha formula framework mentioned previously , additional enhancements coming soon include entrained birth / death information and time lines for people involved .
Interlinking will eventually also work the other way , with queries for people being able to also mention problems they are associated with — for example , Albert Einstein ‘s association with the photoelectric effect .
There are hundreds if not thousands of additional math and physics results that could be added to Wolfram| Alpha .
So keep coming back often if you ’re interested to see what new things we can tell you about and compute with for you .
Of course , there are thousands if not millions of other interesting results in the sciences that are not fortunate enough to be blessed with a common moniker .
That ’s a more difficult problem .
For now at least , as the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein noted , “ That which we can not name we must pass over in silence . ”
Now that Scott Roeder has been handed a life sentence with parole only possible in 50 years , it ’s time to look at the effect his act of terrorism has had on the anti-choice movement .
You ’d think people who claim to be " pro-life " would be so ashamed of terrorist acts that they ’d do anything to distance themselves from them .
But instead , Roeder ’s murder of Dr. George Tiller , the preeminent late abortion provider in the nation , seems to have emboldened anti-choicers to double down on the harassment of other late abortion providers .
Not only have anti-choice protesters moved on to targeted Dr. Carhart for abuse and threats , but as Lynn Harris noted , legislators in Kansas and Nebraska seem to be emboldened by this act of terrorism to put further restrictions on late abortions .
What ’s interesting is about the anti-choice focus on late abortions is that it really shows how intellectually bankrupt the anti-abortion rights position is .
And not just because anti-choicers get energized by terroristic acts of murder .
It ’s because the focus shows how much anti-choicers really do think they get to have it both ways .
By focusing on late abortion , anti-choicers demonstrate two major contradictions between their stated point of view and their actual point of view .
" Life begins at conception . "
The major anti-abortion rights argument has always been that a fertilized egg has the same moral worth as a 5 - year - old child , and that abortion is therefore murder .
By that measure , an abortion at 8 weeks is the same kind of evil as an abortion at 25 weeks .
So why focus more on the latter ?
Why spend more time trying to restrict the latter , or drawing attention to it ?
Why focus on doctors who provide late abortions , if they are n’t any morally different than those who perform early abortions ?
It ’s almost as if anti-choicers agree with the pro-choice view that there ’s a difference between a fertilized egg , a fetus later in pregnancy ( since most pro-choicers support some restrictions on later abortion ) , and a baby .
Anti-choicers can’t have it both ways .
Either a fertilized egg is a person or it ’s not .
If you think later abortion is worse than early abortion , you admit that you do n’t really think early abortions are the same as infanticide .
" We ’re ‘ pro-life ’ ! "
The official anti-choice argument is that they ’re not against women , they ’re just " for life . "
But if that ’s true , then abortion becomes more understandable if someone ’s life is threatened by the pregnancy , or the fetus has defects incompatible with life .
In other words , if you ’re " pro-life , " late abortions that are all , by law , medically indicated would ostensibly be more defensible than an early abortion done because the woman simply does not want to become a mother .
To be intellectually consistent with both the argument that a fertilized egg is the same as a baby and that this is about life --- and not about controlling and punishing female sexuality --- the anti-choice movement should work to secure the right of women to obtain medically necessary late abortions .
Instead , they work to restrict them even more , and during the recent health care debate , fought hard to make sure women had to pay for abortions out - of - pocket , even those getting abortions that save their lives or to end pregnancies where there ’s no real hope of producing a live baby .
The anti-choice approach on late abortions is consistent with one viewpoint : the misogynist one .
Let ’s assume for a moment that the motivation behind anti-choice activism is not a love of life or a belief that a fertilized egg is the same thing as a baby .
Let ’s assume , for the sake of argument , they ’re motivated by a belief that the main role of women in this world is to be baby machines , and that women should mindlessly reproduce even if it kills them .
Is this viewpoint consistent with the focus on late abortion ?
Absolutely !
If this is how you feel , you ’d be extremely interested in portraying women as callous , stupid , and mercurial , then you ’d be all about portraying late abortion as something that happens because stupid , heartless , fickle women change their minds 6 months into a pregnancy .
You would n’t be interested in the truth about the medical indications that lead to late abortions , because in your mind , if they ca n’t have babies , they should die trying .
You ’d relish the opportunity to use graphic imagery and language to shut down people ’s rational thinking , and get them to react to an " ick factor . "
And you ’d be indifferent to the suffering you caused real women , like Tiffany Campbell , who had to abort much - wanted pregnancies because of fetal abnormalities --- their feelings do n’t matter to you as much as the production model of their uteruses .
It ’s true that some people are against late abortion because they ’re ignorant .
They ’ve bought into anti-choice propaganda that paints women as so stupid and cruel they would wait so long in a pregnancy before aborting .
But once you ’ve been educated to the realities of the medical reasons a woman might need a late abortion ?
I have no sympathy for your position .
At this point , you are choosing the misogynist view of women against the prevailing evidence .
Considering that the most intellectually consistent reason for anti-choice obsession with the relatively rare procedure of late abortion is misogyny , the willingness to draw energy from terrorist actions like Scott Roeder ’s murder of Dr. Tiller makes more sense .
Could it be that fundamentalist Christian terrorists have more in common with fundamentalist Muslim terrorists than we usually like to admit ?
Could both kinds of terrorisms stem from an ideology that glorifies a violent patriarchy and sees female independence as a threat ?
The only major difference I see between the two is that right wing politicians in the U.S. seem eager to give Christian fundamentalist terrorists exactly what they demand .

Five days into hockey 's postseason , what more can we ask from the 2010 Stanley Cup Playoffs ?
Close games ?
We 've had them .
Each of the first eight games in this year 's playoffs was decided by one goal .
The ninth was a one - goal affair until New Jersey scored an empty - netter in the last minute of a game against Philadelphia .
Amazingly , every game but one through Saturday was a one - goal affair ( excluding empty - netters ) .
Sunday brought two more , a couple of doozies .
First , the Flyers beat New Jersey and Martin Brodeur in overtime in Philadelphia on a Dan Carcillo winner .
Then No. 8 Colorado beat the top- seeded Western Conference San Jose Sharks 1 - 0 in overtime in a game that actually ended on Monday on the East Coast .
Want more Close Encounters of the NHL Playoffs Kind ?
There have already been seven OT games in the first five days .
The Sharks and Avs have played two OT games already and avoided overtime in the first game only because Colorado scored with less a minute left in regulation .
Sunday 's OT winner , rapped in less than a minute , was credited to Ryan O'Reilly , who is 19 and this time last year was still waiting to be drafted in the second round of the NHL Entry Draft .
With Colorado's win , the No. 7 and No. 8 seeds in the Stanley Cup Playoffs are 8 - 4 -- and half of those loses came in OT .
This is the first time in the 16 - team playoff format that all eight series have started with each team registering a win by Game 2 of a series .
Chicago assured that record Sunday night with a 2 - 0 win in Game 2 , 48 hours after seventh - seeded Nashville hung a 4 - 1 loss on the Blackhawks at home .
" Paper does n't mean anything .
You have to go out and play the games , " Pittsburgh defenseman Mark Eaton said after the defending Stanley Cup champs lost their 2010 Stanley Cup opener to the lower - seeded Ottawa Senators
While unsung heroes abound ( see Carcillo and O'Reilly scoring in OT on Sunday ) , the game 's biggest stars are not missing the chance to shine on the game 's biggest stage .
This is the Olympics and then some .
A lot some .
Sidney Crosby made what has to be considered the early candidate for play of the playoffs with his assist on the winning goal by Kris Letang in Game 2 against Ottawa .
Crosby danced back and forth behind the net , leaving Jason Spezza flailing in his wake , then was knocked to his knees but still deposited a pass right on Letang 's stick for a one - timer that broke a 1 - 1 tie .
" I was just trying to get some space , " Crosby said to humbly explain away his brilliance .
" ( Spezza ) was on me .
It was hard to get space .
He was tracking me pretty good .
I finally got a step and tried to get to the net but they had a ton guys there and we had some guys there too .
I just tried to make the play to ‘ Tanger . '" Crosby leads the playoffs with four assists and is tied with Washington 's Nicklas Backstrom and Montreal 's Andrei Kostitsyn for the points ' lead .
Backstrom had a hat trick -- finished dramatically in OT -- in the most memorable game so far , an incredible 6 - 5 overtime win by the Caps over Montreal in Game 2 at the Verizon Center .
Backstrom and Alex Ovechkin each had four - point nights in a nationally televised game that saw Washington erase deficits of 2 - 0 , 4 - 1 and 5 - 4 before winning in OT and sending the series to Montreal all even at one win apiece .
Montreal 's Andrei Kostitsyn also had a hat trick in that game .
In fact , there is no shortage of scoring , or comebacks , in these playoffs .
Role players are wreaking their share of havoc .
Consider uber - grinder Carcillo in a supremely noisy Philadelphia overtime win .
Or Buffalo's Craig Rivet , a defenseman who had gone more than 100 regular - season games without a goal , notching the winner in Game 1 against Boston Professional pest Jarkko Ruutu was the difference for Ottawa in Game 1 against the Penguins .
Maybe you would like to talk about Colorado 's Craig Anderson , who got the chance to start this year and has outdueled Evgeni Nabokov so far ?
In 12 of the first 15 playoff games , the winning team trailed at some point during the game before coming back to win .
No longer can teams sit on leads late in the game .
Simply , there are too many high - octane offenses in the League today .
Eight of the 16 playoff teams have already scored at least five goals in a game .
Not surprisingly , fans are packing arenas and viewers are watching in record numbers .
The White - Out crowd that packed Jobing.com Arena in Phoenix on Opening Night -- which was Wednesday ; was that really only five nights ago -- was nothing short of Loud .
Good stories are everywhere .
In Canada and the United States , in the East and out West , Veterans and rookies ; no one is immune , it seems .
Especially the rookies .
Seven first - year players have already scored goals , including three of the game 's youngest defensemen – Ottawa 's Erik Karlsson , Buffalo's Tyler Myers and Washington 's John Carlson Karlsson scored in Ottawa 's Game 1 upset of Pittsburgh , but Carlson had scored an even bigger goal by beating Jaroslav Halak with just 81 seconds left in regulation on Saturday night to force OT .
" There 's just something about ( Carlson ) , " Washington coach Bruce Boudreau said .
" Glory follows him .
" The best part ?
We 're just getting started on the glory part .
[ Click here and here for earlier blog posts about the Gizmodo warrant . ]
Today , San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Clifford Cretan ordered the release of the previously - sealed warrant affidavit that led to the search of Gizmodo editor Jason Chen ’s house .
As expected , the affidavit confirmed that there was no legal basis for the search .
The search warrant affidavit does indeed allege that Jason Chen committed three crimes : receipt of stolen property ( California Penal Code section 496 ( a ) ) , theft ( California Penal Code section 499 c ( b ) ( 3 ) ) , and “ maliciously damaging the property of another ” ( California Penal Code section 594 ( b ) ( 1 ) ) .
Whether Chen will even be charged with such crimes , let alone convicted , remains to be seen .
But as we have repeatedly pointed out , the warranted search and seizure of Chen ’s property was still illegal .
In his recent article titled " iPhone , Gizmodo , and Moral Clarity About Crime , " Rutgers law professor Stuart Green argued that the decision to seek a warrant was justified and that critics who question this decision must be confused , misguided , or " legally mistaken . "
Professor Green flatly misstated the law .
Contrary to his assertion , there is no “ specific exemption ” to what Green refers to as the California reporter ’s shield law “ when the police are looking for evidence that the journalists … themselves committed crimes . ”
Moreover , the shield law itself , which is a testimonial privilege , however , that protects journalists who refuse to testify about sources and unpublished information , is not directly relevant to the Chen raid at all .
Instead , the applicable statute is California Penal Code section 1524 ( g ) , which categorically prohibits the issuance of warrants for “ unpublished information obtained or prepared in gathering , receiving or processing of information for communication to the public . ”
This is a limitation on the warrant process itself and does not affect the potential legal liability of a journalist - suspect .
Contrary to the assertions of Professor Green , George Washington University Law School Professor Jonathan Turley , and others , it contains no exemption , specific or otherwise , that limits its reach .
The California Supreme Court has said that the reporter ’s testimonial privilege might give way in very limited circumstances , such as when another constitutional right ( like a defendant ’s right to a fair trial ) comes into play .
No such right is implicated here .
And in any event , the California Supreme Court has never second - guessed the California legislature ’s judgment in passing the Penal Code section at issue here .
Nor is it likely to , since the protection provided by 1524 ( g ) was specifically enacted to limit the ability of law enforcement to search journalists pursuant to a search warrant , a protection that the U.S. Supreme Court held was not found in the U.S. Constitution .
The protections afforded to Chen by the California Penal Code will likely not affect the potential prosecution of any crime here .
The police already know the identity of the person who purportedly found the phone and passed it on to Gizmodo .
The allegedly stolen phone was returned to Apple before the raid .
Moreover , the police also have Gizmodo ’s detailed video analysis of the iPhone prototype , which would likely come in handy as evidence at any eventual trial .
What the police will lose , if Chen ’s attorneys choose to press the issue , is the information that they illegally seized .
The police could then try to subpoena a small subset of this information from Chen directly .
( Recall that all of Chen 's computers and all of the data on them were seized in the raid ) .
The issuance of a subpoena would would allow Chen and Gizmodo to challenge the validity of the district attorney ’s legal position , a far different posture than the one Chen found himself in after armed police officers bashed in his door .
San Mateo prosecutors are predictably circling the wagons to defend the raid .
The D.A. agreed to halt any search of Chen ’s computers while he evaluates the implication of California legal protections for journalists , conceding that such a post - raid analysis is “ unusual . ”
This concession speaks volumes about how much thought went into this raid before it took place .
It should also give pause to commentators who have ignored the extent of the legal ramifications triggered by the search and instead rushed to the defense of the police , confusing a desire to force the police to comply with the law with an attack on the enforceability of trade secret or copyright law .
Opposition to the police raid of Jason Chen ’s home has nothing to do with misplaced support for a scrappy underdog or an affinity for schoolyard conceptions of right and wrong .
Objections to overreaching police power are rooted in both a dedication to free speech and freedom of the press and in a fealty to the rule of law .
The relevant legal question in the Chen matter is whether the police obtained a warrant for “ unpublished information obtained or prepared in gathering , receiving or processing of information for communication to the public . ”
Obviously , they did .
If critics believe that police should be able to execute warrants to seize unpublished notes and other data held by journalists – and I would urge them to think through the ramifications of such a decision – then the proper course is to lobby the legislature for such a change to the very clear statute that is now in place , not to pretend that the law already supports their position .
The continuing implosion , better known as Rand Paul 's post primary campaign , will be taking a break from self - immolation it appears .
Senate Minority Leaderis telling fellow Kentuckian Paul to shut his pie hole .
" I think he 's said quite enough for the time being in terms of national press coverage , " McConnell told CNN 's John King on Tuesday .
McConnell is said to be one of the people who successfully convinced Paul to abort a scheduled appearance on " Meet the Press " Sunday following a string of interviews that kindly could be called Hindenburg - like .
Scoring a rare political hat trick in just a matter of days , Paul criticized the Civil Rights Act , the Americans with Disabilities Act , and in the height of the gulf oil disaster , even stood up for BP .
What 's next ?
An appearance at a sponsored barbeque ?
His less - than - stellar performance led left - leaning political pundits and comedians to mention him alongside their favorite target .
"
It 's likemade it through medical school , " Bill Maher said of Rand , an opthamologist .
Still despite the herculean miscues , McConnell predicted Rand could win Kentucky 's Senate seat .
" According to the polls that came out after the primary , he has a 25 - point lead going into the general election .
He 's in a very good position to put this Senate race in Kentucky in Republican hands . "
That is , McConnell says , if Paul keeps it local .
" My advice to him would be to speak to the people who are going to be actually voting in this election , " he said .
Well , Paul appears to be doing that .
Wearing doctors ' scrubs , Paul made his first appearance Tuesday since the trifecta at a local Lions Club in Bowling Green .
“ It was the best of it times .
It was the worst of times , " he said of last week 's outing .

I received a question from a reader the other day in regards to whether small business insurance is necessary for a business even if one is protected by limited liability via an LLC or corporation .
Specifically , he wanted to know whether it was worth paying for insurance for a pass through entity like an LLC or S Corp which carries no profits within the business .
Whenever someone asks me this question , I always say yes no matter the nature of the business but it largely depends on your risk tolerance .
Especially if you are running a business in the United States , the chances of getting sued are higher than you think and it really does n’t take much for someone to take you to court .
There ’s also a common misconception when it comes to limited liability with an LLC or corporation that most people may not be aware of .
For one thing , limited liability does n’t apply in the following circumstances .
You have acted in a negligent or irresponsible manner .
You have done something illegal with your business whether you are aware of it or not
You have signed a personal guarantee for a loan
You have mixed your personal expenses with your business expenses .
In other words , you are not treating your business as a separate entity

What Do You Stand To Lose ?
Let ’s say that you do n’t fall into any of the categories above and you run your LLC or corporation by the book .
What do you stand to lose ?
With a pass through entity , you might not think that you have much at stake but think about it this way .
If you lose a lawsuit , your entire business is at risk .
The plaintiff can take away your website , your business and all of your business assets .
Even worse , you will lose a piece of your mental health .
After all , you worked hard to get your business up and running and insurance will help prevent it from being taken away from you .
What Else Is n’t Covered With An LLC Or Corporation ?
The other thing that is often overlooked is the major hassle involved if you do in fact get sued .
If you do n’t have insurance , you have to go through the trouble of responding to the complaint , possibly hiring a lawyer and handling everything yourself .
If you have business insurance however , you just let your insurance company know about the complaint and they will take it from there .
Often times , they have lawyers in house that will respond and handle the paperwork for you similar to how a car insurance policy works .
Having this peace of mind is absolutely worth it .
In general , business liability insurance protects your small business in the event of a lawsuit for personal injury and / or property damages .
It will cover the damages from the lawsuit in addition to any legal costs involved .
What Are The Different Types Of Small Business Insurance ?
Product Liability Insurance :
This is the category that our wedding linens business falls into .
If you sell or manufacture products , product liability insurance will protect you in the event that a customer becomes injured while using your stuff .
For our wedding linens business , you might think that it would be difficult for someone to get injured using our napkins or handkerchiefs .
But for example , someone could sue us if they were n’t happy with the quality of our product which in turn might have ruined their wedding and caused them mental anguish .
It ’s ridiculous I know , but it could happen .
The amount of coverage and the level of risk depends on your business type .
For us , we do n’t have to pay as much for insurance because our business is considered fairly safe .

General Liability Insurance : General liability insurance is the main coverage that protects your business from injury claims , property damage , and advertising claims .
As the name implies , this is an all encompassing policy for your business and might be the only thing you need depending on what your business sells .

Professional Liability Insurance :
If you provide business services of any kind , you should probably get professional liability insurance .
This coverage protects your business against malpractice , errors , negligence and omissions .
Depending on what you do , you might be legally obligated to purchase this insurance .
For example , all doctors are required to carry malpractice insurance .
Do n’t Risk It
There is more at stake than you think when you do n’t purchase insurance .
If anything , you should consider your mental health .
Are you willing to risk losing all the hard work you put into your business ?
Are you willing to deal with all of the hassle involved if you do in fact get sued ?
Think of your LLC or corporation as bankruptcy insurance .
Sure , you ca n’t lose it all but you sure can lose enough for it to be extremely painful .
Check with your local insurance company to see if the costs are worth it .

HANGU , Pakistan ( Reuters ) - Pakistani jets pounded suspected Taliban positions in a one - two punch on Thursday that killed nearly 50 people , most of them militants , in a restive tribal region in the northwest , officials said .
The two attacks targeted a school used by the Taliban as well as a madrasa or Islamic seminary in the Mamuzai area of the Orakzai Agency , an ethnic Pashtun tribal region where many militants fled to escape an army offensive further south .
“ Twenty - five bodies of militants have been recovered from the school , ” Asghar Khan , a government official , told Reuters by telephone from Kalaya , the main town of Orakzai .
He said 13 militants were killed in the madrasa .
However , he said a nearby center of Tablighi Jamaat , a non-violent non-political group involved in Islamic preaching , was also hit in the strike .
“ Ten people were killed in the Tablighi center , ” he added .
There was no independent confirmation .
Khan said the seminary was a major hideout of the militants loyal to Maulvi Toofan , a local commander of Tehrik - e - Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) , the main alliance of Pakistan ’s homegrown militants .
Orakzai is a considered a Taliban stronghold because many members of the Pakistani Taliban fled there after military offensives drove them from South Waziristan late last year .
Orakzai is one of Pakistan ’s seven tribal regions , known as agencies , and is a stronghold of TTP chief Hakimullah Mehsud , who is widely believed to have been killed in a missile strike by a U.S. drone aircraft in South Waziristan in January .
The Pakistani military has stepped up air strikes in Orakzai and the neighboring Kurram region in recent months , targeting militants who have fled military offensive in South Waziristan .
Think we'd all be better off if HTML5 could somehow instantly replace Flash overnight ?
Not necessarily , according to a set of comparisons from Jan Ozer of the Streaming Learning Center website , which found that while HTML5 did come out ahead in many respects , it was n't exactly a clear winner .
The tests were n't completely scientific , but they did find that HTML5 clearly performed better than Flash 10 or 10.1 in Safari on a Mac , although the differences were less clear cut in Google Chrome or Firefox .
On the other hand , Flash more than held its own on Windows , and Flash Player 10.1 was actually 58 % more efficient than HTML5 in Google Chrome on the Windows system tested .
As you may have deduced , one of the big factors accounting for that discrepancy is that Flash is able to take advantage of GPU hardware acceleration in Windows , while Adobe is effectively cut out of the loop on Mac -- something it has complained about quite publicly .
According to Ozer , the differences between HTML5 and Flash playback on a Mac could be virtually eliminated if Flash could make use of GPU acceleration .
Hit up the link below for all the numbers .
Update : Mike Chambers has performed some additional tests that he says shows that " does not perform consistently worse on Mac than on Windows . "
Check out the complete results here .

Eleanor Catton : The Rehearsal
These students do n’t have the conniving urges of a Blair Waldorf ; they gaze at the spectacle , half - wish it was happening to them , and go about their lives …
Eleanor Catton ’s first novel centers on an affair between a 17 - year - old pupil at an all - girls school and her thirty - something male music teacher , but the novel is really about everyone else : the students , parents and teachers who help to turn the albeit taboo relationship into a scandal .
The gossip extends beyond the perimeters of the campus of the school , Abbey Grange ( which the girls call “ Scabby Grange ” or “ Abbey Grunge ” ) , into newspapers , homes , and , as these things tend to go , the school next door : a co-ed acting school for college - age kids , where the students and instructors conspire to perform an end - of - year play based on the scandal ( which , by the way , falls somewhere between a rape and a domestic relationship , depending on whom you ask ) .
The book , which is set in an unidentified town , possibly in Catton ’s home of New Zealand , is fairly clear - cut in its support of the students .
They may be guilty of too much conjecturing about the girl , Victoria , and the teacher , Mr. Saladin , but there is an innocence and powerlessness about them that has something to do with age , but also with their feeling unimportant and lame as Victoria rises to mysterious stardom .
These students do n’t have the conniving urges of a Blair Waldorf ; they gaze at the spectacle , half - wish it was happening to them , and go about their lives , experimenting with their bodies and finding the courage to challenge their domineering elders .
The saxophone teacher at Abbey Grange , who teaches Victoria ’s sister , Isolde , and an unpopular lesbian named Julia , is the most despicable adult in the book , but she has some stiff competition : a stone - coldhearted mother who , when her child dies , contemplates how mediocre she was ; acting instructors whose advice is either trite or shocking ; and a father who communicates with his son almost exclusively through bawdy humor .
To make these characters more hateful , Catton , a master of description at the ripe old age of 25 , gives them unfortunate physical traits : a father points a “ bony white finger ” at his son , Stanley , and is often drunk ( the son can tell because he “ ducked his head slightly every time he blinked ” ) .
The Head of Acting at the drama school , meanwhile , has “ ropy liver - spotted hands ” that Stanley , a student there , imagines “ to be cold and moist and snatching . ”
The problem with these adults , who play supporting roles to the saxophone teacher , is that they do n’t do enough .
( The father ’s behavior provokes Stanley to mimic him in an acting exercise , with inspired results . )
The acting instructors may ask bold and inappropriate things of their students , but it ’s all in the service of art , so they ’re more or less off the hook .
The saxophone teacher ’s problem is that she does too much , accusing parents of being overbearing when she herself is , just in weirder ways .
In the first pages of the book , while explaining that she does n’t allow parents to sit in on their children ’s music lessons , she says , “ these little half - hour slices are my chance to watch , and I do n’t want to share . ”
This foreboding little nugget really only scratches the surface of her role in the book : she ’s a voyeur , living through her students as a means to revisit her own bland , unsatisfied past , but she does more than just watch — she conducts her students ’ lives in a way that is so insensitive and self - serving that it requires a suspension of disbelief on the part of the reader .
Fortunately , her manner of speaking is so arch and ridiculous from the beginning that it helps make her subsequent actions more believable .
When a parent asks her if she remembers all the students she ’s ever taught , she says , “ [ N ] ot one individual student , but the impression left by them all , inverted like a photographic negative and stamped into my memory like an acid hole . ”
Who talks like that ?
But as Zadie Smith pointed out to a skeptic of White Teeth , fiction owes nothing to reality .
The saxophone teacher believes she ’s being empathetic when she ’s being imprudent , and helpful when she ’s being destructive .
She thinks she ’s a therapist to her students , letting them talk on about their particular roles in the scandal and each other ’s lives , but instead of letting it end when each student leaves the practice room , she turns it into one long incestuous saga with no shut doors , no kept secrets .
We are occasionally led to feel bad for the saxophone teacher — she is trying , however immaturely , to work out a personal problem of her own — but not for long : Isolde and Julia eventually throw the game back in her face .
Catton is an excellent writer , but the organization of The Rehearsal leaves something to be desired .
She relies heavily on dialogue to unfold the story , with mixed results , and flits too frequently between perspectives .
The female students are not as flowery in speech as the saxophone teacher , but their words about the scandal — glimpses , speculation , patchy retellings — make the story hard to follow .
It may help reveal their characters , but it does n’t help build momentum .
On top of that , the story is divided into chapters and then subdivided into sections headed either by a day of the week or a month — the day segments cover the girls at Abbey Grange and the month segments cover the kids at the acting school , but this is not immediately clear .
The disjunctured setup is occasionally put on hold to make room for longer passages — intensive acting lessons , a couple in bed , or a standoff in the saxophone practice room — that are true and touching , and well worth the wait .
The scandal does dangle distractingly over everyone , but of course , it ’s what it brings out in these people that Catton really cares about : they ’ve inflated reality into something horrid and deviant just as capably as celebrity tabloids , and they spin it out as long as they can , just like celebrity tabloids .
The story belongs mostly to Isolde , the forgotten younger sister , who is charmingly caught between shy tweendom and flirty adolescence ; Stanley is equally charming as an overly studious actor .
Catton drops one little clever reference that makes the most sense of the relationship between the student and the teacher , but by giving voice only to the people surrounding the couple , she is also making the point that while technically illegal , the relationship is a private matter made public out of the usual reasons : boredom , self - righteousness , paranoia .
Everyone else is struggling to find intimacy themselves — Stanley is literally instructed to have an intimate moment by his teachers , and following his first make - out session he declares proudly , “ That was the most intimate scene of my life ” — while others , like the saxophone teacher , are happy to just imagine intimacy , provided others can give them every last detail of what it ’s like .
For many , putting themselves in the shoes of the maligned couple proves so much easier than feeling anything first - hand .
We need leaders .
The federal government is abdicating its duty on the border .
Arizona politicians are pandering to public fear .
The result is a state law that intimidates Latinos while doing nothing to curb illegal immigration .
This represents years of failure .
Years of politicians taking the easy way and allowing the debate to descend into chaos .
The Arizona Republic has been calling for comprehensive immigration reform continuously since 2002 .
For a brief time , our congressional delegation led the nation on this front .
But no more .
Now , it seems our elected officials prefer to serve political expediency instead .
Those who failed Arizona :
JAN BREWER was looking out for her political future , not Arizona 's best interests , when she signed the anti-immigrant law that ignores Arizona 's Latino heritage and creates a backlash that will hurt the state 's economic development .
The governor 's GOP primary race would have been tougher if she 'd vetoed the bill , so she ducked her responsibility to the people of Arizona .
Now , she gets a bump in the polls , and Arizona gets beat up on the international stage .
JANET NAPOLITANO came down with amnesia after she abandoned her job as governor of Arizona and moved to Washington , D.C. , to be Homeland Security secretary .
Ensconced in a Democratic administration , she forgot all the arguments she once used to demand that the Bush administration address immigration reform and reimburse Arizona for the costs of the broken border .
Put in charge of Obama 's effort to craft immigration reform , she could n't get the thing out of neutral .
JOHN McCAIN , the one - time maverick and former champion of comprehensive immigration reform , also came down with a convenient loss of memory and principle .
Facing a primary race against J.D. Hayworth , whose demagoguery on this issue is practiced and predictable , Sen. McCain became a man afraid of his own record .
He locked himself behind a door marked " Do not disturb until the border is secure . "
Here 's some straight talk the senator should understand :
The border cannot be secured as long as the current irrational border policies remain unchanged .
JON KYL was also brave enough - once upon a time - to work across the aisle for the sake of achieving comprehensive immigration reform .
Now , he has linked arms with McCain in stonewalling .
There may be little political advantage in helping a Democratic president and Congress achieve what Republicans could not , but Sen .
Kyl 's role in GOP Senate leadership should not be more important than fixing what 's broken in his own state .
J.D. HAYWORTH is the mouth that spewed when it comes to illegal immigration .
The former congressman used his seat in the House and his radio show to pound his chest and shout down every attempt to discuss the genuine complexity of this issue .
He has n't changed .
Fear and anger are his sidekicks .
Self - promotion is his noble steed .
His diatribes helped validate a wickedly distorted image of all migrant workers as heinous criminals .
PHIL GORDON lashed out against the law in shrill tones that did not serve his state or city .
The Phoenix mayor made a flamboyant call to challenge the new law in court without first consulting the City Council , then vowed to go around his fellow elected city officials when they disagreed with him .
RUSSELL PEARCE probably has done more than anyone in the state to turn this from a complex public - policy discussion into what seems like law sketched on a cocktail napkin .
This legislation , his brainchild , shows how a narrow focus on persecuting illegal immigrants blinds him to the consequences of what he is doing .
We wonder if state Sen .
Pearce even considered rights of legal residents and Latino citizens .
Or if he cares how his law introduces real fear into real people 's lives .
RA�L GRIJALVA also fails to see beyond a narrow band of self - interest .
As a representative of a heavily Latino district , he faced no political risk in responding to a divisive law with an equally divisive call for a national boycott of Arizona .
Grijalva , a U.S. representative , must know that lost convention business will hurt Arizonans who are struggling to keep their jobs in these tough times .
For a congressman to call for destruction of his own state 's economy is irresponsible and beneath contempt .
JOE ARPAIO and ANDREW THOMAS , a showboat tag team as sheriff and county attorney , were responsible for ratcheting up the heat and dimming any light on this issue .
Arpaio 's immigration sweeps stirred anti-immigrant sentiment and made " driving while Latino " a suspicious activity .
Thomas ' decision to use a law aimed at criminal smugglers to prosecute illegal immigrants was a perversion of that law - enforcement tool .
These politicians - Republicans and Democrats - used this issue to bait voters .
Voters should get wise and demand leadership and solutions .
Despite the turmoil and passion surrounding this issue , there is a broad consensus that immigration is a federal responsibility and it demands federal action .
State laws can not fix it .
There is also agreement that Arizona suffers disproportionately because of federal border policies , as was seen Friday when a Pinal County sheriff 's deputy was ambushed and shot by suspected drug smugglers .
Arizona can no longer afford to tolerate elected officials who show so little interest in solving one of the state 's most pressing issues .
We need leaders who will push to enact comprehensive reform .
We need Arizona leadership - as a delegation all working together - sponsoring and spearheading federal legislation to fix immigration .
Reform must secure the border so that the people entering this country are doing so legally and we know who they are .
It must eliminate the access to jobs that migrants are willing to risk their lives to reach .
It must include an efficient system to verify worker eligibility and tough sanctions for employers who hire the undocumented .
It must provide a path to legalization that has to be earned by the current undocumented population .
If they choose not to earn it , they choose not to be citizens and live in this country .
Reform must create a legal pipeline for future workers that is demand - based and temporary .
With a legal framework in place , there will be no reason to be in this country without permission .
Foreigners who break our laws will be prosecuted , punished and deported .
Comprehensive reform will make the border safer .
When migrant labor is channeled through the legal ports of entry , the Border Patrol can focus on catching drug smugglers and other criminals instead of chasing busboys across the desert .
Real leaders will have the courage to say that .
Real leaders are what we need .
Arizona , our time for excuses is over .

After only two years of development , the Phantom Ray unmanned airborne system ( UAS ) was unveiled at a ceremony in St. Louis on May 10 .
Built by Boeing in St. Louis , the sleek , fighter - sized UAS combines survivability with a powerful arsenal of new capabilities .
“ Phantom Ray offers a host of options for our customers as a test bed for advanced technologies , including intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ; suppression of enemy air defenses ; electronic attack and autonomous aerial refueling - the possibilities are nearly endless , ” said Dennis Muilenburg , president and CEO of Boeing Defense , Space & Security .
With a 50 - foot wingspan and measuring 36 feet long , Phantom Ray was designed and developed by Boeing Phantom Works based on a prototype the company had originally created less than a decade ago for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) / U.S. Air Force / U.S. Navy Joint - Unmanned Combat Air System ( J - UCAS ) program .
Using a rapid - prototyping approach , Phantom Ray evolved into the technology demonstrator unveiled today on the floor of Boeing ’s St. Louis facility .
“ We ’re really excited about this because Phantom Works is back as a rapid prototyping house , operation and organization , ” said Craig Brown , Boeing Phantom Ray program manager .
“ This is the first of what I expect to be many exciting prototypes , and they ’re all with exciting technology . ”
Financed entirely by Boeing , Phantom Ray is a testament to the company and its Phantom Works division ’s commitment to becoming the leader in the global unmanned systems market .
“ Phantom Ray represents a series of significant changes we ’re making within Boeing Defense , Space & Security , ” said Darryl Davis , president of Phantom Works .
“ For the first time in a long time , we are spending our own money on designing , building and flying near - operational prototypes .
We ’re spending that money to leverage the decades of experience we have in unmanned systems that span the gamut from sea to space . ”
This aircraft is on - schedule to take its first taxi tests later this summer and soar through its initial flight profiles as early as December , continuously gaining ground toward becoming an unmanned system that could one day penetrate enemy forces and provide a new specter of security for the warfighter .

ADDICTION has long been considered a man ’s disease .
Men are far more likely to use illicit substances , and partly for that reason , research on addiction for decades included only male users .
Thus , far more is known about drug dependence in men than in women , and treatment programs and centers have been based on the needs of men .
But there are signs that the gender gap is closing , as drug and alcohol use have become more socially acceptable for girls and women .
Indeed , drinking and alcohol dependence have grown increasingly prevalent among women in recent decades , but not among men , reported psychiatrist Richard A. Grucza of Washington University in St. Louis in a 2008 study .
And in a reversal of past trends , teenage girls are now trying marijuana , alcohol and cigarettes at higher rates than boys are , according to recent results from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health .
Meanwhile the survey demonstrated that overall illegal drug use among both girls and women rose from 5.8 to 6.3 percent between 2007 and 2008 as the rate for boys and men dipped from 10.4 to 9.9 percent .
What is more , a growing literature on female addicts shows that they are not much like their male counterparts .
Women may be uniquely vulnerable to substance abuse and its effects , because female sex hormones affect the brain ’s reward circuitry , influencing women ’s response to drugs .
The studies point to new drug treatments for addiction as well as practical tips for women who want to quit using .
The Weaker Sex ?
Although scientists have been studying drug use in women on a small scale since the 1970s , progress was relatively meager before 1994 , when the National Institutes of Health mandated that most clinical research include women and minorities .
As research on gender differences greatly accelerated , investigators uncovered hints that girls and women may be more vulnerable to addiction and substance abuse than men are .
Scientists noticed that women more quickly escalate to heavy drug use and more readily succumb to the accompanying social and physical damage .
Even female rats obsessively self - administer addictive drugs more readily than male rodents do .
Reproductive hormones may underlie this susceptibility .
Removing the ovaries of female rats so that the animals no longer produce estrogen can diminish their tendency to seek out stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine .
In addition , giving estrogen to female rats whose ovaries have been removed can shorten the path to addiction .
In 2004 neuroscientist Jill B. Becker of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and her colleagues reported that it took six days for ovary - free rats to start repeatedly helping themselves to infusions of cocaine — in this setup , by poking their noses into a hole .
In contrast , rats receiving supplemental estrogen succumbed to the same compulsion after just four days .
Researchers believe that estrogen spurs addiction by stimulating the brain ’s reward pathways , enhancing the “ high ” from drugs .
Administering estrogen to rats that have had their ovaries removed boosts levels of dopamine , a neurotransmitter involved in the perception of rewards such as food , sex and drugs .
Hormone High
In female mammals , estrogen does not act alone , however .
Its hormonal partner , progesterone , appears to oppose estrogen ’s ability to promote addictive tendencies .
In 2006 Becker ’s team reported that giving both estrogen and progesterone to female rats lacking ovaries does not accelerate obsessive cocaine use in the rodents , suggesting that progesterone may be an antidote to estrogen ’s pleasure - seeking influence .
And more recent work confirms that women ’s response to drugs varies across the menstrual cycle , as the relative levels of estrogen and progesterone naturally wax and wane .
In a 2007 study clinical neurobiologist Suzette M. Evans of Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute and her colleagues found that stimulants are far more pleasurable to women during the estrogen - dominated follicular phase , which occupies the approximately two weeks from the onset of a woman ’s period until she ovulates , than during the luteal phase after ovulation , when both estrogen and progesterone are high .
A woman ’s perception of other kinds of rewards — such as money , food and sex — may also vary during her menstrual cycle .
In a 2007 study researchers at the NIH scanned women ’s brains using functional MRI as the women played slot - machine games .
They found that women ’s reward circuitry was more active when they won jackpots during the estrogen - governed phase of their cycles than during the progesterone - infused phase that follows .
The ebb and flow of female hormones could thus have broad effects on the perception of pleasures and incentives , influencing women ’s motivation to engage in a wide variety of behaviors .
A Smarter Way to Stop
Artificially boosting progesterone levels in women tempers the “ high ” they get from drugs .
In a 2006 study Evans ’s team gave 11 female cocaine users progesterone when their bodies ’ natural levels of the hormone were low .
The treated women reported feeling a reduced high as compared with the one they got at the same point in their cycles in the absence of additional progesterone .
( In contrast , progesterone did not influence the subjective experience of cocaine smoking in the 10 male addicts they tested , although the researchers are not sure why . )
If progesterone dampens the pleasure of drugs , it might help treat addiction in women — something Evans is currently testing in female cocaine addicts .
Short of a chemical fix , paying attention to the calendar could help women succeed at quitting smoking , drinking or using drugs .
In a study published in 2008 Sharon S. Allen , a family medicine doctor at the University of Minnesota Medical School , and her colleagues asked half of 202 female smokers to try to quit during the second part of their cycles — when progesterone levels are high — and the others to make the attempt earlier in their cycles .
The results were stunning : 34 percent of the women in the first group had not smoked 30 days later as compared with only 14 percent of those who tried to stop smoking when progesterone levels were low .
“ When women are smoking early in their cycle , they ’re getting more of a kick from their nicotine , more pleasure maybe , so it might be harder to quit , ” Allen explains .
In this mix of hormones , brain chemicals and desire — as in many other parts of life — timing may be everything .
A nationwide research is undergoing to determine the possible causes of complications from H1N1 vaccine .
But these claims are being disputed by leading health experts .
The research data has identified symptoms of Guillain - Barre syndrome which can lead to paralysis and death , Bell ’s palsy , which can lead to temporary facial paralysis , and thrombocytopenia , a condition which leads to a low level of platelets in the blood .
Experts have argued that it is still too early to determine if these reports are true and they need a deeper analysis .
An expert committee has already given permission to follow up on the initial reports .
But various experts argue that swine flu still is too big a threat to be ignored at any cost .
They argue that prevention of an outbreak is still an important priority with the government .
Around 400 million people throughout the world have been given this vaccine , which includes around 80 million Americans , to control the outbreak of swine flu .
But health experts confirm that the vaccine is safe and has already been given to millions around the world .
The World Health Organization , based in Geneva and a part of United Nations , has already launched two investigations into reports that it had heightened the amount of risk posed by the swine flu epidemic .

Version 4.5 of the GNU Compiler Collection was released in mid-April with many changes under - the - hood , as well as a few important user - visible features .
GCC 4.5 promises faster programs using the new link - time optimization ( LTO ) option , easier implementation of compiler extensions thanks to the controversial plugin infrastructure , stricter standards - conformance for floating - point computations , and better debugging information when compiling with optimizations .
The GNU Compiler Collection is one of the oldest free software projects still around .
Version 1.0 of GCC was released in 1987 .
More than twenty years later , GCC is still under active development and each new version is adding important features .
Supporting these new features in such an old codebase often requires major rewriting of substantial parts of GCC .
GCC 4.0 was an important milestone in this regard , and GCC internals are still evolving at a rapid pace .
However , these core improvements are sometimes not clearly visible as improvements for users .
This is not the case in GCC 4.5 .
This article describes four new features in GCC 4.5 , and also looks at an internal feature that may radically change how GCC is developed in the future .
Link - Time Optimization
Perhaps the most visible of the new features in GCC 4.5 is the Link - Time Optimization option : - flto .
When source files are compiled and linked using - flto , GCC applies optimizations as if all the source code were in a single file .
This allows GCC to perform more aggressive optimizations across files , such as inlining the body of a function from one file that is called from a different file , and propagating constants across files .
In general , the LTO framework enables all the usual optimizations that work at a higher level than a single function to also work across files that are independently compiled .
The LTO option works almost like any other optimization flag .
First , one needs to use optimization ( using one of the - O { 1,2,3 , s} options ) .
In cases where compilation and linking are done in a single step , adding the option - flto is sufficient
gcc -o myprog - flto - O2 foo.c bar.c
This effectively deprecates the old - combine option , which was too slow in practice and only supported for C .
With independent compilation steps , the option - flto must be specified at all steps of the process :
gcc -c - O2 - flto foo .c gcc -c - O2 - flto bar .c gcc -o myprog - flto - O2 foo . o bar .o
An interesting possibility is to combine the options - flto and - fwhole - program .
The latter assumes that the current compilation unit represents the whole program being compiled .
This means that most functions and variables are optimized more aggressively .
Adding - fwhole - program in the final link step in the example above , makes LTO even more powerful .
When using multiple steps , it is strongly recommended to use exactly the same optimization and machine - dependent options in all commands , because conflicting options during compilation and link - time may lead to strange errors .
In the best case , the options used during compilation will be silently overridden by those used at link - time .
In the worst case , the different options may introduce subtle inconsistencies leading to unpredictable results at runtime .
This , of course , is far from ideal , and , hence , in the next minor release , GCC will identify such conflicting options and provide appropriate diagnostics .
Meanwhile , some extra care should be taken when using LTO .
The current implementation of LTO is only available for ELF targets , and , hence , LTO is not available in Windows or Darwin in GCC 4.5 .
However , the LTO framework is flexible enough to support those targets and , in fact , Dave Korn has recently proposed a patch that adds LTO support for Windows to GCC 4.5.1 and 4.6 , and Steven Bosscher has done the same for Darwin .
Finally , another interesting ongoing project , called whole program optimization [ PDF ] , aims to make LTO much more scalable for very large programs ( on the order of millions of functions ) .
Currently , when compiling and linking with LTO , the final step stores information from all files involved in the compilation in memory .
This approach does not scale well if there are many large files .
In practice , there may be little interaction between some files and the information required could be partitioned and optimized independently , with little performance loss , or at least gracefully degrading the effectiveness of LTO depending on existing resources .
The experimental - fwhopr option is a first step in this direction , but this feature is still under development and even the name of the option is likely to change .
Therefore , GCC 4.6 will probably bring further improvements in this area .
Plugins
Another long - awaited feature is the ability to load user code as plugins that modify the behaviour of GCC .
A substantial amount of controversy surrounded the implementation of plugins .
The possibility of proprietary plugins was probably the main factor stalling the development of this feature .
However , the FSF recently reworked the Runtime Library Exception in order to prevent proprietary plugins .
With the new Runtime Library Exception in place , the development of the plugins framework progressed rapidly .
This , however , did not completely end the controversy surrounding plugins , and while some developers think that plugins are essential for the future of GCC and for attracting new users and contributors , others fear that plugins may divert efforts from improving GCC itself .
The plugin framework of GCC can work in principle on any system that supports dynamic libraries .
In GCC 4.5 , however , plugins are only supported on ELF - based platforms , that is , most Unix - like systems , but not Windows or Darwin .
A plugin is loaded with the new option - fplugin= / path / to/ file.so .
GCC makes available a series of events for which the plugin code can register its own callback functions .
The events already implemented in GCC 4.5 allow plugins to interact with the pass manager to add , reorder and remove optimization passes dynamically , modify the low level representation used by C and C++ front-ends , add new custom attributes and compiler pragmas , and other possibilities described in the internal documentation .
Despite plugins being a new feature in GCC 4.5 , several projects are already making use of the plugins support .
Among these projects is Dehydra , the static analysis tool for C++ developed by Mozilla ; and MELT , a framework for writing optimization passes in a dialect of LISP .
Also , the ICI / MILEPOST research project strongly relies on the new plugins framework in GCC 4.5 .
Variable Tracking at Assignments
The Variable Tracking at Assignments ( VTA ) project aims to improve debug information when optimizations are enabled .
When GCC compiles some code with optimizations enabled , variables are renamed , moved around , or even completely removed .
When debugging such code and trying to inspect the value of some variable , the debugger would often report that the variable has been optimized out .
With VTA enabled , the optimized code is internally annotated in such a way that optimization passes transparently keep track of the value of each variable , even if the variable is moved around or removed .
A small example of the differences between debug information in GCC 4.5 and previous releases is the following program :
typedef struct list { struct list * n ; int v ; } * node ; node find_prev ( node c , node w ) { while ( c ) { node opt = c ; c = c -> n ; if ( c == w ) return opt ; } return NULL ; }
Variable opt is removed when compiling with optimization .
Hence , in previous GCC versions , or when compiling without VTA , one cannot inspect the value of opt even at the highest debugging level .
In GCC 4.5 , however , VTA enables inspection of the value of all variables at all points of the function .
The effect of VTA is even more noticeable for inlined functions .
Before VTA , optimizations would often completely remove some arguments of an inlined function , making it impossible to inspect their values when debugging .
With VTA , these optimizations still take place , however , appropriate debug information is generated for the missing arguments .
Finally , the VTA project has brought another feature , the new - fcompare - debug option , which tests that the code generated by GCC with and without debug information is identical .
This option is mainly used by GCC developers to test the compiler , but it may be useful for users to check that their program is not affected by a bug in GCC , though at a significant cost in compilation time .
Standard conforming excess precision
Perhaps the most reported bug in GCC is bug 323 .
The symptoms appear when different optimization levels produce different results in floating - point computations , and when two ways of performing the same calculation do not produce the same result .
Although this is an inherent limitation of floating - point numbers , users are still surprised that different optimization levels lead to highly different results .
One of the main culprits of the problem is the excess precision arising from the use of the x87 floating - point unit ( FPU ) .
That is , operations performed in the FPU have more precision than double precision numbers stored in memory .
Hence , the final result of a computation may significantly depend on whether intermediate operations are stored in the FPU or in memory .
This leads to some unexpected and counter - intuitive results .
For example , the same piece of code may produce different results using the same compilation flags and the same machine depending on changes of seemingly unrelated code , because the unrelated code forces the compiler to save some intermediate result in memory instead of keeping it in a FPU register .
One workaround to this behavior is the option - ffloat - store , which stores every floating - point variable in memory .
This has , however , a significant cost in computation time .
A more fine - grained workaround is to use the volatile qualifier in variables suffering from this problem .
While this problem will never be solved in computers with inexact representation of floating - point numbers , GCC 4.5 helps improve the situation by adding a new option - fexcess - precision=standard , currently only available for C , that handles floating - point excess precision in a way that conforms to ISO C99 .
This option is also enabled with standards conformance options such as - std=c99 .
However , standards - conforming precision incurs an extra cost in computation time .
Therefore , users more interested in speed may wish to disable this behavior using the option - fexcess - precision=fast .
C++ compatible
GCC 4.5 is the first release of GCC that can be compiled with a C++ compiler .
This may not seem very interesting or useful at the moment ( but take a look at the much improved - Wc++- compat option ) .
However , this is only the first step of an ongoing project to use C++ as the implementation language of GCC .
Except for some front - end bits written in other languages , notably Ada , most of GCC is implemented in C .
The internal structures of GCC are under a continuous improvement and modularization aimed at creating cleaner interfaces , and many GCC developers think that this work would be easier using C++ than C .
However , this proposal is not free of controversy , and it is not clear whether the switch would occur in GCC 4.6 , later , or ever .
Other improvements
The above are only some examples of the many improvements and new features in GCC 4.5 .
A few other features that are worth mentioning :
Conclusion
We are living interesting times on the compiler front , and GCC 4.5 is an indication that we can still expect new developments in the future .
The release of GCC 4.5 brings to its users several important , and somewhat controversial , features .
It also includes the typical long list of small fixes and improvements , where most will be able to find at least one thing to their liking .
GCC 4.5 may well be a transition point , where the foundational work that has been done during the 4.x release series is starting to show up in user - visible features that would have been impossible in the GCC 3.x release series .
It is difficult to say at this moment what GCC 4.6 will bring us in a year from now , as it will depend on what the contributors decide .
Anyone can contribute to the future of GCC .
This is free software after all .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama will seek $ 500 million for security and send up to 1,200 National Guard troops to the U.S. - Mexican border , an administration official said on Tuesday , after demands from both Republicans and Democrats for more federal resources along the frontier .

The announcement comes as the Democratic president seeks Republican support for a sweeping overhaul of U.S. immigration laws , and seeks to rally opposition to a tough new immigration law in Arizona that has caused tension in U.S. relations with Mexico , without seeming soft on illegal border crossings .
The troops will provide intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance support , intelligence analysis , immediate support to counternarcotics enforcement and training capacity until the Customs and Border Patrol agency can recruit and train more border officers and agents , the official said .
The funds will be used to enhance technology at the border and share information and support between law enforcement agencies as they target illegal trafficking in people , drugs , weapons and money .
SPARRING WITH REPUBLICANS
Arizona ’s two U.S. senators , John McCain and Jon Kyl , and Governor Jan Brewer , all Republicans , have asked Obama for more federal support to secure the border .
McCain and Kyl introduced a Senate amendment to force Obama to deploy 6,000 National Guard troops to the border .
The administration rejected the request in a letter to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin .
“ It represents an unwarranted interference with the commander - in - chief ’s responsibilities , ” wrote national security adviser James Jones and counterterrorism chief John Brennan .
Illegal immigration across the border with Mexico has been in intense focus since Arizona last month passed the law to drive 460,000 illegal immigrants out of the desert state , which straddles one of the principal corridors for human and drug smugglers heading up from Mexico .
The law requires state and local police to investigate the immigration status of people they reasonably suspect are in the country illegally .
It was a central issue last week during a state visit to Washington by Mexican President Felipe Calderon , who said the law discriminated against foreign - born workers .
Mexican officials said on Tuesday they respected Obama ’s right to make the decision , but thought Washington should address problems originating on its side of the border .
“ The Mexican government considers that the decision ... should translate into the channeling of additional resources to make efforts more effective to combat the trafficking of illegal arms and cash to Mexico , ” the Mexican foreign ministry said in a statement .
Mexico also urged “ shared responsibility ” on the fight against drug gangs along the border .
There are currently 344 U.S. National Guard troops working along the border .
U.S. officials are also concerned drug - related violence will cross the border from Mexico , where some 23,000 people have been killed since Calderon took office in late 2006 as drug gangs fight turf wars and battle federal agents and troops .
A prominent cattleman , Robert Krentz , was shot dead on his ranch in southeast Arizona in late March .
Police followed tracks from the scene of the shooting to the Mexican border , but made no arrests .
Cochise County sheriff Larry Dever , whose office is investigating Krentz ’s death , said he doubted that many troops would make much difference , given the border ’s nearly 2,000 - mile ( 3200 - km ) length .
“ If you put 1,200 in perspective ... that ’s about one every two miles ... so we ’re woefully short of doing anything significant , unless they are all deployed in a very specific area , ” he told Reuters .
Obama met on Tuesday with Senate Republicans , none of whom has come out in support of his immigration plan .
He pushed them to support an overhaul , which he said he wants passed this year , but did not bring up the National Guard plan .
Kyl said it was not a good idea for Democrats to “ try to hold hostage the security of the border in order to get comprehensive immigration reform passed . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A spine - chilling slide of nearly 1,000 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , its biggest intraday points drop ever , led to heightened calls for a crackdown on computer - driven high - frequency trading .
The slide , which in one 10 - minute stretch knocked the index down nearly 700 points , may have been triggered by a trading error .
Major stock indexes eventually recovered from their 9 percent drops to close down a little more than 3 percent .
But the follow - through selling that pushed stocks of some highly regarded companies into tailspins exacerbated concerns that regulators can quickly lose control of the markets in a world of algorithmic trading .
“ The potential for giant high - speed computers to generate false trades and create market chaos reared its head again today , ” Senator Edward Kaufman said in a statement .
“ The battle of the algorithms -- not understood by nor even remotely transparent to the Securities and Exchange Commission -- simply must be carefully reviewed and placed within a meaningful regulatory framework soon . ”
Kaufman and Senator Mark Warner -- both Democrats -- said Congress needs to investigate the causes of the market plunge , which at its deepest point wiped nearly $ 1 trillion off equity values .
Citigroup Inc C.N said it was investigating a rumor that one of its traders entered the trade , a spokesman for the bank said on Thursday .
Citigroup , the third - largest U.S. bank , currently has no evidence that an erroneous trade has been made , the spokesman said .
‘ SCREWED UP ’
Earlier , sources told Reuters that the plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial average may have been caused by an erroneous trade entered by a person at a big Wall Street bank .
Market sources said the erroneous trade may have involved E - Mini contracts -- stock market index futures contracts that trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ’s Globex trading platform .
The composition of the E - Mini is similar to the stocks in the S&P 500 .
" I can confirm that our markets operated properly and there were no problems , " a CME Group CME.O spokesman said .
Other market sources said the erroneous trading involved the IWD exchange - traded fund or the S&P 500 Mini .
A person close to BlackRock BLK.N , which manages the IWD , said there was no unusual trading in the iShares product .
During the sell - off , Procter & Gamble shares plummeted nearly 37 percent to $ 39.37 at 2:47 p.m. ET ( 1847 GMT ) , prompting the company to investigate whether any erroneous trades had occurred .
The shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange , but the significantly lower share price was recorded on a different electronic trading venue .
“ We do n’t know what caused it , ” said Procter & Gamble spokeswoman Jennifer Chelune .
“ We know that that was an electronic trade ... and we ’re looking into it with Nasdaq and the other major electronic exchanges . ”
A different P&G spokesman had said earlier the company contacted the Securities and Exchange Commission , but Chelune said that he spoke in error .
One NYSE employee leaving the Big Board ’s headquarters in lower Manhattan said the P&G share plunge lay at the center of whatever happened .
“ I ’ll give you a tip , ” the employee said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
“ P& G .
Check out the low sale of the day .
Something screwed up with the system .
It traded down $ 30 at one point . ”
WIDE SWINGS
Nasdaq said it was working with other major markets to review the market activity that occurred between 2:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. , when the market plunge happened .
The exchange later said it was investigating potentially erroneous transactions involving multiple securities executed between 2:40 and 3:00 p.m .
Nasdaq also said participants should review their trading activity for potentially erroneous trades .
NYSE Euronext CEO
Duncan Niederauer seized on the problems in an interview with CNBC to stress that the exchange was a safer place to trade because it deliberately slowed down market making when it realized there was something extraordinary happening .
The exchange has been in a battle over recent years with a series of upstart trading venues , many of which advertise either lower prices or faster transaction speeds .
The market plunge and especially wide swings in some individual stocks reignited some wider criticism of high - frequency trading , a strategy using lightning - fast computer programs to track market trends .
“ We did not know what a stock was worth today , and that is a serious problem , ” said Joe Saluzzi of Themis Trading in New Jersey , a frequent critic of computer - driven high frequency trading .
Investors had already been on edge throughout the trading day after the European Central Bank did not discuss the outright purchase of European sovereign debt as some hoped they would to calm markets .
Inquiring minds are digging deep into a 190 page PDF by the Congressional Oversight Panel regarding Commercial Real Estate Losses and the Risk to Financial Stability .
Executive Summary
Over the next few years , a wave of commercial real estate loan failures could threaten America ’s already - weakened financial system .
The Congressional Oversight Panel is deeply concerned that commercial loan losses could jeopardize the stability of many banks , particularly the nation ’s mid-size and smaller banks , and that as the damage spreads beyond individual banks that it will contribute to prolonged weakness throughout the economy .
Between 2010 and 2014 , about $ 1.4 trillion in commercial real estate loans will reach the end of their terms .
Nearly half are at present “ underwater ” – that is , the borrower owes more than the underlying property is currently worth .
Commercial property values have fallen more than 40 percent since the beginning of 2007 .
Increased vacancy rates , which now range from eight percent for multifamily housing to 18 percent for office buildings , and falling rents , which have declined 40 percent for office space and 33 percent for retail space , have exerted a powerful downward pressure on the value of commercial properties .
The largest commercial real estate loan losses are projected for 2011 and beyond ; losses at banks alone could range as high as $ 200 - $ 300 billion .
The stress tests conducted last year for 19 major financial institutions examined their capital reserves only through the end of 2010 .
Even more significantly , small and mid-sized banks were never subjected to any exercise comparable to the stress tests , despite the fact that small and mid-sized banks are proportionately even more exposed than their larger counterparts to commercial real estate loan losses .
A significant wave of commercial mortgage defaults would trigger economic damage that could touch the lives of nearly every American .
Empty office complexes , hotels , and retail stores could lead directly to lost jobs .
Foreclosures on apartment complexes could push families out of their residences , even if they had never missed a rent payment .
Banks that suffer , or are afraid of suffering , commercial mortgage losses could grow even more reluctant to lend , which could in turn further reduce access to credit for more businesses and families and accelerate a negative economic cycle .
It is difficult to predict either the number of foreclosures to come or who will be most immediately affected .
In the worst case scenario , hundreds more community and mid-sized banks could face insolvency .
Because these banks play a critical role in financing the small businesses that could help the American economy create new jobs , their widespread failure could disrupt local communities , undermine the economic recovery , and extend an already painful recession .
Present Condition of Commercial Real Estate
The commercial real estate market is currently experiencing considerable difficulty for two distinct reasons .
First , the current economic downturn has resulted in a dramatic deterioration of commercial real estate fundamentals .
Increasing vacancy rates and falling rental prices present problems for all commercial real estate loans .
Decreased cash flows will affect the ability of borrowers to make required loan payments .
Falling commercial property values result in higher LTV ratios , making it harder for borrowers to refinance under current terms regardless of the soundness of the original financing , the quality of the property , and whether the loan is performing .
Second , the development of the commercial real estate bubble , as discussed above , resulted in the origination of a significant amount of commercial real estate loans based on dramatically weakened underwriting standards .
These loans were based on overly aggressive rental or cash flow projections ( or projections that were only sustainable under bubble conditions ) , had higher levels of allowable leverage , and were not soundly underwritten .
Loans of this sort ( somewhat analogous to “ Alt - A ” residential loans ) will encounter far greater difficulty as projections fail to materialize on already excessively leveraged commercial properties .
Economic Conditions and Deteriorating Market Fundamentals
The health of the commercial real estate market depends on the health of the overall economy .
Consequently , the market fundamentals will likely stay weak for the foreseeable future .
This means that even soundly financed projects will encounter difficulties .
Those projects that were not soundly underwritten will likely encounter far greater difficulty as aggressive rental growth or cash flow projections fail to materialize , property values drop , and LTV ratios rise on already excessively leveraged properties .
New and partially constructed properties are experiencing the biggest problems with vacancy and cash flow issues ( leading to a higher number of loan defaults and higher loss severity rates than other commercial property loans ) .
For the last several quarters , average vacancy rates have been rising and average rental prices have been falling for all major commercial property types .
Current average vacancy rates and rental prices have been buffered by the long - term leases held by many commercial properties ( e.g. , office and industrial ) .
The combination of negative net absorption rates and additional space that will become available from projects started during the boom years will cause vacancy rates to remain high , and will continue putting downward pressure on rental prices for all major commercial property types .
Taken together , this falling demand and already excessive supply of commercial property will cause many projects to be viable no longer , as properties lose , or are unable to obtain , tenants and as cash flows ( actual or projected ) fall .
In addition to deteriorating market fundamentals , the price of commercial property has plummeted .
As seen in the following chart , commercial property values have fallen over 40 percent since the beginning of 2007 .
For financial institutions , the ultimate impact of the commercial real estate whole loan problem will fall disproportionately on smaller regional and community banks that have higher concentrations of , and exposure to , such loans than larger national or money center banks .
The impact of commercial real estate problems on the various holders of CMBS and other participants in the CMBS markets is more difficult to predict .
The experience of the last two years , however , indicates that both risks can be serious threats to the institutions and borrowers involved .
Although banks with over $ 10 billion in assets hold over half of commercial banks ’ total commercial real estate whole loans , the mid-size and smaller banks face the greatest exposure .
The current distribution of commercial real estate loans may be particularly problematic for the small business community because smaller regional and community banks with substantial commercial real estate exposure account for almost half of small business loans .
For example , smaller banks with the highest exposure – commercial real estate loans in excess of three times
Tier 1 capital – provide around 40 percent of all small business loans .
Foresight Analytics , a California - based firm specializing in real estate market research and analysis , calculates banks ’ exposure to commercial real estate to be even higher than that estimated by the Federal Reserve .
Drawing on bank regulatory filings , including call reports and thrift financial reports , Foresight estimates that the total commercial real estate loan exposure of commercial banks is $ 1.9 trillion compared to the $ 1.5 trillion Federal Reserve estimate .
The 20 largest banks , those with assets greater than $ 100 billion , hold $ 600.5 billion in commercial real estate loans .
Figure 17 : Commercial Real Estate Loans by Type ( Banks and Thrifts as of Q3 2009 )
As seen in the Foresight Analytics data above , the mid-size and smaller institutions have the largest percentage of “ CRE Concentration ” banks compared to total banks within their respective asset class .
This percentage is especially high in banks with $ 1 billion to $ 10 billion in assets .
The table above emphasizes the heightened commercial real estate exposure compared to total capital in banks with $ 100 million to $ 10 billion in assets .
Equally troubling , at least six of the nineteen stress - tested bank - holding companies have whole loan exposures in excess of 100 percent of Tier 1 risk - based capital .
Risks
In the years preceding the current crisis , a series of trends pushed smaller and community banks toward greater concentration of their lending activities in commercial real estate .
Simultaneously , higher quality commercial real estate projects tended to secure their financing in the CMBS market .
As a result , if and when a crisis in commercial real estate develops , smaller and community banks will have greater exposure to lower quality investments , making them uniquely vulnerable .
As loan delinquency rates rise , many commercial real estate loans are expected to default prior to maturity .
For loans that reach maturity , borrowers may face difficulty refinancing either because credit markets are too tight or because the loans do not qualify under new , stricter underwriting standards .
If the borrowers cannot refinance , financial institutions may face the unenviable task of determining how best to recover their investments or minimize their losses : restructuring or extending the term of existing loans or foreclosure or liquidation .
On the other hand , borrowers may decide to walk away from projects or properties if they are unwilling to accept terms that are unfavorable or fear the properties will not generate sufficient cash flows or operating income either to service new debt or to generate a future profit .
Delinquent Loans
Although many analysts and Treasury officials believe that the commercial real estate problem is one that the economy can manage through , and analysts believe that the current condition of commercial real estate , in isolation , does not pose a systemic risk to the banking system , rising delinquency rates foreshadow continuing deterioration in the commercial real estate market .
For the last several quarters , delinquency rates have been rising significantly .
The extent of ultimate commercial real estate losses is yet to be determined ; however , large loan losses and the failure of some small and regional banks appear to some experienced analysts to be inevitable .
New 30 - day delinquency rates across commercial property types continue to rise , suggesting that commercial real estate loan performance will continue to deteriorate .
However , there is some indication that the rate of growth , or pace of deterioration , is slowing .
Unsurprisingly , the increase in delinquency rates has translated into rapidly rising default rates .
The increasing number of delinquent , defaulted , and non-performing commercial real estate loans also reflects increasing levels of loan risks .
Loan risks for borrowers and lenders fall into two categories : credit risk and term risk .
Credit risk can lead to loan defaults prior to maturity ; such defaults generally occur when a loan has negative equity and cash flows from the property are insufficient to service the debt , as measured by the debt service coverage ratio ( DSCR ) .
If the DSCR falls below one , and stays below one for a sufficiently long period of time , the borrower may decide to default rather than continue to invest time , money , or energy in the property .
The borrower will have little incentive to keep a property that is without equity and is not generating enough income to service the debt , especially if he does not expect the cash flow situation to improve because of increasing vacancy rates and falling rental prices .
Broader Social and Economic Consequences
Commercial real estate problems exacerbate rising unemployment rates and declining consumer spending .
Approximately nine million jobs are generated or supported by commercial real estate including jobs in construction , architecture , interior design , engineering , building maintenance and security , landscaping , cleaning services , management , leasing , investment and mortgage lending , and accounting and legal services .
Projects that are being stalled or canceled and properties with vacancy issues are leading to layoffs .
Lower commercial property values and rising defaults are causing erosion in retirement savings , as institutional investors , such as pension plans , suffer further losses .
Decreasing values also reduce the amount of tax revenue and fees to state and local governments , which in turn impacts the amount of funding for public services such as education and law enforcement .
Finally , problems in the commercial real estate market can further reduce confidence in the financial system and the economy as a whole .
To make matters worse , the credit contraction that has resulted from the overexposure of financial institutions to commercial real estate loans , particularly for smaller regional and community banks , will result in a “ negative feedback loop ” that suppresses economic recovery and the return of capital to the commercial real estate market .
The fewer loans that are available for businesses , particularly small businesses , will hamper employment growth , which could contribute to higher vacancy rates and further problems in the commercial real estate market .
Conclusion
There is a commercial real estate crisis on the horizon , and there are no easy solutions to the risks commercial real estate may pose to the financial system and the public .
An extended severe recession and continuing high levels of unemployment can drive up the LTVs , and add to the difficulties of refinancing for even solidly underwritten properties .
But delaying write - downs in advance of a hoped - for recovery in mid- and longer - term property valuations also runs the risk of postponing recognition of the costs that must ultimately be absorbed by the financial system to eliminate the commercial real estate overhang .
Any approach to the problem raises issues previously identified by the Panel : the creation of moral hazard , subsidization of financial institutions , and providing a floor under otherwise seriously undercapitalized institutions .
There appears to be a consensus , strongly supported by current data , that commercial real estate markets will suffer substantial difficulties for a number of years .
Those difficulties can weigh heavily on depository institutions , particularly mid-size and community banks that hold a greater amount of commercial real estate mortgages relative to total size than larger institutions , and have – especially in the case of community banks – far less margin for error .
But some aspects of the structure of the commercial real estate markets , including the heavy reliance on CMBS ( themselves backed in some cases by CDS ) and the fact that at least one of the nation ’s largest financial institutions holds a substantial portfolio of problem loans , mean that the potential for a larger impact is also present .
There is no way to predict with assurance whether an economic recovery of sufficient strength will occur to reduce these risks before the large - scale need for commercial mortgage refinancing that is expected to begin in 2011 - 2013 .
The Panel is concerned that until Treasury and bank supervisors take coordinated action to address forthrightly and transparently the state of the commercial real estate markets – and the potential impact that a breakdown in those markets could have on local communities , small businesses , and individuals – the financial crisis will not end .
Reflections on the Report
Assets at Banks whose ALLL exceeds their Nonperforming Loans
Systemic Risk
in isolation
What about credit card defaults ?
What about another wave down in housing ?
What about the cumulative effect of banks being so undercapitalized they could not lend if they wanted to ?
What if more businesses decide to walk away for properties ?
What happens to mortgage rates and rates for commercial loans when the Fed stops buying mortgage backed securities ?
Those who think the steep yield curve guarantees the economy will soon be humming are in for a rude awakening .
In the aftermath of a deflationary credit bust , credit conditions , debt levels , and attitudes are far more important than a steep yield curve , and those conditions are god awful .
New Facebook " Feature " Exposes Everyones Personal Info Posted by Pile ( 11158 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
This past week , Facebook announced Instant Personalization , whereby select websites would " personalize your experience using your public Facebook information . "

Imagine , if you can , an alternate universe .
Imagine that in this alternate universe , a foreign military power begins flying remote - controlled warplanes over your town , using onboard missiles to kill hundreds of your innocent neighbors .
Now imagine that when you read the newspaper about this ongoing bloodbath , you learn that the foreign nation ’s top general is nonchalantly telling reporters that his troops are also killing “ an amazing number ” of your cultural brethren in an adjacent country .
Imagine further learning that this foreign power is expanding the drone attacks on your community despite the attacks ’ well - known record of killing innocents .
And finally , imagine that when you turn on your television , you see the perpetrator nation ’s tuxedo - clad leader cracking stand - up comedy jokes about drone strikes — jokes that prompt guffaws from an audience of that nation ’s elite .
Ask yourself :
How would you and your fellow citizens respond ?
Would you call homegrown militias mounting a defense “ patriots ” or would you call them “ terrorists ” ?
Would you agree with your leaders when they angrily tell reporters that violent defiance should be expected ?
Fortunately , most Americans do n’t have to worry about these queries in their own lives .
But how we answer them in a hypothetical thought experiment provides us insight into how Pakistanis are likely to be feeling right now .
Why ?
Because thanks to our continued drone assaults on their country , Pakistanis now confront these issues every day .
And if they answer these questions as many of us undoubtedly would in a similar situation — well , that should trouble every American in this age of asymmetrical warfare .
Though we do n’t like to call it mass murder , the U.S. government ’s undeclared drone war in Pakistan is devolving into just that .
As noted by a former counterinsurgency adviser to Gen. David Petraeus and a former Army officer in Afghanistan , the operation has become a haphazard massacre .
“ Press reports suggest that over the last three years drone strikes have killed about 14 terrorist leaders , ” David Kilcullen and Andrew Exum wrote in 2009 .
“ But , according to Pakistani sources , they have also killed some 700 civilians .
This is 50 civilians for every militant killed . ”
Making matters worse , Gen. Stanley McChrystal has , indeed , told journalists that in Afghanistan , U.S. troops have “ shot an amazing number of people ” and “ none has proven to have been a real threat . ”
Meanwhile , President Barack Obama used his internationally televised speech at the White House Correspondents Dinner to jest about drone warfare — and the assembled Washington glitterati did , in fact , reward him with approving laughs .
By eerie coincidence , that latter display of monstrous insouciance occurred on the same night as the failed effort to raze Times Square .
Though America reacted to that despicable terrorism attempt with its routine spasms of cartoonish shock ( why do they hate us ? ! ) , the assailant ’s motive was anything but baffling .
As law enforcement officials soon reported , the accused bomber was probably trained and inspired by Pakistani groups seeking revenge for U.S. drone strikes .
“ This is a blowback , ” said Pakistan ’s foreign minister , Shah Mehmood Qureshi .
“ This is a reaction .
And you could expect that … let ’s not be naive . ”
Obviously , regardless of rationale , a “ reaction ” that involves trying to incinerate civilians in Manhattan is abhorrent and unacceptable .
But so is Obama ’s move to intensify drone assaults that we know are regularly incinerating innocent civilians in Pakistan .
And while Qureshi ’s statement about “ expecting ” blowback seems radical , he ’s merely echoing the CIA ’s reminder that “ possibilities of blowback ” arise when we conduct martial operations abroad .
We might remember that somehow - forgotten warning come the next terrorist assault .
No matter how surprised we may feel after that inevitable ( and inevitably deplorable ) attack , the fact remains that until we halt our own indiscriminately violent actions , we ought to expect equally indiscriminate and equally violent reactions .

Recently , there have been a few high - profile examples of magazines publishing images of “ real ” women : plus - sized models , or celebrities free of makeup and / or Photoshop .
The ensuing publicity can make it feel that we ’ve won body image victories –but let ’s look closer at these images to find out how much we should really be celebrating .
February 2009 : Love Magazine ‘s first magazine cover features a nude Beth Ditto .
April 2009 : French Elle ’s no make - up edition features eight European models without make - up or digital touch ups .
September 2009 : Glamour Magazine features “ the woman on p.194 ” with a belly roll ( and a smile ) .
January 2010 : V Magazine ‘s plus - size model spread , clothed and nude .
February 2010 : Australian Marie Claire puts Miss Universe 2004 , Jennifer Hawkins , on the cover nude and unaltered .
A cover signed by Hawkins was auctioned on eBay , with proceeds donated to Australian eating - disorder support group The Butterfly Foundation .
March 2010 : Tara Lynn graces the cover and the pages of French Elle ’s “ curvy girl ” issue .
April 2010 : French Marie Claire releases a non-airbrushed issue .
Just last week : Britney Spears releases unretouched photos alongside the altered images for her new Candies campaign .
A few days later , Kim Kardashian releases nude photos for the May 2010 issue of Harper ’s Bazaar sans digital alteration ( and felt so empowered that she tweeted about it ) .
I ’ll admit that I ’ve gotten excited about more than a few of these body - image events , and looking at this list it would appear that there ’s some real positive change occurring .
But after news of Kate Hudson ’s alleged breast enhancement made headlines less than 48 hours after Britney Spears released her unretouched photos , I had to ask , Do these efforts matter ?
Can these images combat the images below ?
Yes , unadulterated images matter , but their impact is diluted by the millions of adulterated ones .
As consumers we are exposed [ PDF ] to hundreds of advertisements per day that overwhelmingly feature unnaturally ( or genetically predisposed ) thin women who have been further retouched .
Waists are made smaller , torsos and legs are elongated and thinned , thighs smoothed and armpits all - but - disappeared .
In this context , the occasional plus - size model appears deeply incongruous : a spectacle , not a part of a spectrum .
In the cases of Spears and Kardashian , featuring striking women without airbrushing is n’t exactly revolutionary –and some speculate whether these images are actually all they claim to be .
Kardashian ’s body , at least , comes pre-altered by cellulite removal .
These photographs set a new unattainable standard , this one for “ real ” bodies .
Plus , both Spears and Kardashian have published countless altered photographs of themselves , and Kardashian hawks diet pills as a side job .
Without an authentic and consistent message of beauty empowerment in all its diversity , these attempts feel like gimmicks , or what Samantha Moore of Gender Across Borders calls “ empower - tainment “ :
It ’s going to take more than a celebrity proclamation that my “ unique ” qualities are beautiful , despite what popular media — and the male gaze driving it — say .
Because beauty standards are socially constructed , redefining what “ beauty ” means is a hairy , multifaceted venture that must consider entrenched social forces .
Powerful influences such as patriarchy , historical context , consumerism , and media are embedded in the fabric of almost every society .
While boosting women ’s self - confidence is peachy , it can not be a successful driver of social change .
What we really need to contest is the beauty myth — the illusion that female beauty standards are natural , inevitable , and backed by some concrete “ truth ” about optimum femininity .
Images that fall outside the limiting standard can’t produce change when millions of taken - for - granted images constantly cultivate our expectations and solidify the standard .
Publishing unadulterated images every so often , with great fanfare , does not successfully challenge the normative Eurocentric image of ideal beauty , which includes vast amounts of alteration .
Rather than promoting real change and creating a critical dialogue that explores the creation and maintenance of unrealistic , confining and , often , dangerous images of beauty , the announcement of these unaltered photos can easily become a spectacle designed for publicity and ratings .

Critter Talk : Should Dogs Be Allowed In Restaurants - Whaddya Say ?
OK , so I can guess what you might have to say on this topic .
If you ’re reading this on PetMD , you more than likely hold the POV that a dog should not be denied entrance to a restaurant based on the code of his or her DNA .
After all , pets are people too .
Well , not really — a point which is actually in their favor when it comes to restaurants and their “ health based , ” no dogs allowed restrictions .
After all , dogs are NOT human , which means they ’re less likely to transmit diseases than the sniffling kid that ’s aiming snot - bombs at the waitress , or the gentleman seated at your elbow who insists on sparing his dinner companions his cough … seeing as your shoulder seems so conveniently located .
What would a dog do ?
At worst , he ’d slurp your hand , transmitting little more than some inert spit with a bevy of harmless germs .
No salmonella , no campylobacter , and no ringworm .
Alarmist FDA
Food Codes notwithstanding , it ’s my firm belief that live , non-human animals are disallowed on the basis of American culture rather than any science .
This subject got a lot of attention last week after my weekly USA Today column carried a little rant of mine .
How the French can be so forward - thinking in this regard got me to thinking this problem comes down to our simple cultural differences .
Here ’s an excerpt :
“ Why , then , does America eschew the [ dining with pets ] practice when it comes to our own dogs ?
Except for limited outdoor seating during balmy months , relatively few establishments offer the open access the French do .
Is it that our culture of canine companions is not yet as evolved as France ’s ?
Or perhaps it ’s that our dogs are infinitely less well behaved ( a distinct possibility , I ’ll concede ) .
It seems more likely , however , that our culture of cleanliness is what does us in when it comes to welcoming dog patrons in our nation ’s eateries .
In my estimation , that which keeps our subway air somewhat breathable relative to France ’s BO - infused railways also keeps us free of canine company in restaurants .
Here ’s the rationale : We Americans are super - sensitive in our hygienic ways .
Perhaps it ’s the Puritan influence ( cleanliness is next to godliness ) , but personal health and hygiene products take up eight full aisles in my SuperTarget here ( I checked recently ) . ”
It ’s one theory , anyway .
What ’s yours ?

BRUSSELS — The European Commission president , José Manuel Barroso , on Tuesday accused the German government of lacking leadership during the euro crisis and describing its plans to rewrite the European Union ’s rulebook as “ naïve . ”
In an uncharacteristically blunt intervention , Mr. Barroso took issue with German proposals to change the European Union ’s Lisbon Treaty so that punishments can be increased for countries , like Greece , that break the rules governing euro countries .
He also suggested that the alarm in the markets , which has destabilized the euro , might have been calmed by quicker assurances of German support .
The comments , made in an interview in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , irritated German officials , where some of Mr. Barroso ’s claims were dismissed as “ absurd ” on Tuesday .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Boosted by upbeat investor reaction to its strong earnings report this week , Apple Inc. has become the second - largest company on the S&P 500 Index in terms of market capitalization , surpassing Microsoft Corp , the publisher of the index said Thursday .
According to Standard & Poor 's index services unit , Apple AAPL , +1.50 % reached a market cap of $ 241.5 billion to pass that of Microsoft's MSFT , +1.48 % $ 239.5 billion market capitalization .
Now Apple trails only Exxon Mobil XOM , +0.14 % and its market cap of more than $ 300 billion , S&P said .
The S&P 500 SPX , +0.82 % , like many other Standard & Poor 's indexes , is float - adjusted .
To calculate the index 's components by market capitalization , S&P excludes shares not available to public investors - those closely held by " control groups , " other companies and government agencies .
Some 87.7 % of Microsoft shares are publicly floated , vs. 99.2 % for Apple shares , according to FactSet Research .
Using all shares outstanding , Microsoft 's market capitalization is still larger than Apple 's , S&P acknowledges .
Microsoft took umbrage of its demoted ranking .
The company said that using all 8.764 billion shares outstanding , which it valued at $ 30 a share , would put the company 's market cap $ 262 billion .
" Just because Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer do n't trade their shares does n't mean that the market cap does n't include them , " said Bill Koefoed , general manager for Microsoft investor relations , in emailed comments .
But Standard & Poor 's stuck by its ranking .
" Apple is bigger on a float basis , which is what the index is , " said S&P senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt in an emailed response to MarketWatch .
" I also state that on a full basis , MSFT is still larger , " he said .
Earnings inspiration
By any measure , Apple 's market cap got a lift this week after the company reported a quarterly profit of $ 3.07 billion , or $ 3.33 a share , on revenue of $ 13.5 billion .
The company 's results were helped by sales of 8.75 million iPhones and 2.94 million Macintosh computers during the quarter .
In the two days since Apple 's report , the company 's share have risen 9 % to close Thursday at $ 266.47 .
Microsoft shares are up just 3 cents to $ 31.39 during that time .
After the market closed Thursday , Microsoft reported a fiscal third - quarter profit of $ 4.01 billion , or 45 cents a share , compared with earnings of $ 2.98 billion , or 33 cents a share during the same period a year ago .
Revenue rose 6 % to $ 14.5 billion .

Microsoft shares sank 3 % in after - hours trading following the report .
Doctors Perform C-Section and Find No Baby Doctors slapped for false pregnancy diagnosis in woman with " pseudocyesis . "
April 2 , 2010  --
Two North Carolina doctors have been reprimanded for performing a caesarian on a woman , only to discover she was n't pregnant at all .
The incident -- a rare case of pseudocyesis or a false or hysterical pregnancy -- happened at the Cape Fear Medical Center in Fayetteville , N.C .
The woman reportedly appeared at the hospital with her husband asking for a C - section .
A resident in charge made the pregnancy diagnosis and doctors agreed to surgery after trying to induce labor for two days .
Neither doctor independently confirmed the pregnancy .
In January , after studying the case for more than a year , the North Carolina Medical Board sent " letters of concern , " the lowest level of discipline , to Dr. Gerianne Geszler , who was the on - call physician , and Dr. Dorrette Grant , who performed the caesarian in 2008 .
When they saw an empty uterus , they " closed her back up , " Geszler told ABC News .
Pseudocyesis can " fool people , " said Paul Paulman , assistant dean for clinical skills and quality at the University of Nebraska College of Medicine , " but you open someone 's abdomen , you make darn sure you know what you 're doing , " he said .
" It 's a potentially life - changing event . "
Paulman wrote about a similar 1990 case in the Journal of Family Practice .
The medical board in North Carolina said the resident at Cape Fear Medical Center did not have enough experience to make the pregnancy diagnosis and doctors should have conducted their own exam .
Dena Konkel , assistant director of public affairs for the medical board , said the case was " unique . "
" The board was mostly concerned about the management of patient care , " she said .
" It may have fallen below the standard of care . "
" Some would argue that this is not disciplinary in nature -- it does n't limit their ability to practice medicine , " said Konkel .
But , " it creates a public record , something that can be looked up and read about what happened . "
Neither doctor has been disciplined publicly before .
Both still practice medicine , but with a warning from the board that similar complaints could lead to formal disciplinary proceedings .
Grant did not return calls from ABCNews.com , but the board 's Web site indicates she is still delivering babies at Women 's Health Haven Obstetrics and Gynecology .
" I do not want to criticize anyone else involved with this case , " said Geszler .
" I was covering the residents when the patient arrived , and she reported the case to me .
I did not actually see the patient as this is not necessarily a protocol that the attending examine the patient . "
Pseudocyesis Can Be Deceptive , Say Doctors
She said the ob - gyn resident was a medical doctor and trained in ultrasound .
" Residency and supervision of residents is very complicated , " said Geszler , who is now practicing at Breezewood 's Center for Health and Restoration .
" To let them make appropriate evaluation and decisions , yet without harm to the patient .
Do you second guess everything ?
Do you repeat everything ? "
Other doctors familiar with pseudocyesis , say the disorder can be deceptive .
Although it is a psychiatric condition , women can have all the physiological symptoms of pregnancy -- cessation of menstruation , distended abdomen , swollen breasts , morning sickness and food cravings , and even labor pains .
Pseudocyesis is considered rare , occurring at a rate of 1 to 6 for every 22,000 births .
It often strikes women with a " strong desire " to become pregnant , according to Paulman .
" On face value , it 's bad care and unconscionable , " he said .
" If I am a first - year resident , buried and swamped , working hard and that week I get a high amount of emotion from a family , I can see how the error was made .
But it should n't have happened . "
Pregnancy can be ruled out by an abdominal exam -- " you can feel the unmistakable bony head " -- or the rapid fetal heartbeat [ 120 beats per minute , unlike the mother 's 70 - 80 per minute ] or through a sonogram image , he said .
False pregnancies have been known throughout history , dating back to 300 B.C. when Hippocrates treated 12 women who were convinced they were pregnant .
The English queen " Bloody " Mary Tudor , the oldest daughter of Henry VIII , experienced pseudocyesis , perhaps because of her father 's reputation for beheading childless wives .
Sigmund Freud 's most famous patient , " Anna O , " believed she was pregnant with the child of her former psychiatrist , Josef Breuer , which led the father of modern psychiatry to expound on the theory of " transference " or attachment .
Doctors Can Be Fooled by False Pregnancy
Capable doctors can be fooled .
In the mid-1960s , Dr. John Radebaugh got a call one night to tend to a woman in labor at a clinic for migrant workers in Rochester , N.Y .
The woman , with a " melon - sized stomach , groaning and writhing in pain , " was convincing enough to rush to the hospital .
She even drenched the doctor in clear liquid , leading him to believe she had broken her water .
" From the condition she was in , we thought she was going to deliver right then and there , " he told The New York Times in 2008 .
But the next day , the hospital told him she had been treated for a full bladder and discharged .
In another case reported in the journal Psychosomatics , a woman experienced labor pains and even the final push sensation at the same time her son's girlfriend was giving birth to her grandchild .
Paulman treated a 30 - year - old woman who claimed she was 13.5 weeks pregnant .
Her belly was swollen and she told him she felt fetal movement .
But upon examination , he discovered she had no uterus or cervix because of a previous hysterectomy .
He said false pregnancies are living proof of the mind - body connection when conscious thoughts can cause the brain 's pituitary gland to create the pregnancy hormone , oxytocin .
" It is psychosomatic , but probably not a delusional state or psychotic , " said Paulman .
" But there is probably some neurosis going on , they are living in a dream world . "
Though there are few studies on pseudocyesis , some suggest that elevated estrogen and prolactin levels can cause physical symptoms like abdominal swelling and even milk secretion , as well as the desire to bond with a baby .
Others say pseudocyesis may have cultural origins .
It is more common in Africa where poverty and relational instability exists in communities that " treasure children for economic survival and generational continuity , " according to a 2008 report in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry .
In the North Carolina case , doctors were chastised for taking the false pregnancy one step too far : " Your inappropriate reliance on their diagnosis and the failure to conduct your own examination were contributing factors in the unnecessary attempt at a caesarian delivery , " said the board letter .
Cape Fear Medical Center did not return calls from ABCNews.com , but Geszler said the hospital had instituted new guidelines .
" It will never happen again , " she told the Fayetteville Observer .
The patient at the center of this case had not been identified .
In her defense , Geszler told ABC News the night the patient was admitted , she was on duty , but multiple other doctors were in charge over the course of two days while the patient was being induced .
In 2008 , she gave up obstetrics after 20 years due to " exhaustion and increasing morbidity and patient potential litigation in a country where people are becoming more obese and less healthy . "
She now focuses on preventive and integrative medicine .
" Certainly we are all humans and subject to error but in no way do I take what I do in a casual manner , " said Geszler .
" I have always tried to treat everyone as if they were a member of my family , " she said .
" I believe this has been blown way out of proportion and why it made the front page of our local paper is beyond me .
In my 20 - year career I would like to think I have helped so many more people , but you never seem to hear about the good , only the bad . "
Sanscript is a visual dataflow programming language , available via its native IDE .
It was developed by Northwoods Software as a simple visual scripting language .
Its main purpose is manipulating file system , interacting with other applications and performing Dynamic Data Exchange ( DDE ) functions , so it provides a large set of library functions for these purposes .
Sanscript works only with Windows platform .
Sanscript IDE is divided in three main parts : Overview , Catalog and Canvas .
Overview window ( on the left ) displays the list of folders available in Sanscript .
These folders are grouped into General ( libraries of standard functions ) , Examples and Templates ( groups of ready - to - run sample programs and sample functions provided in the distribution ) and USER ( user - defined programs ) .
Catalog window ( on the bottom ) displays the contents of chosen folder : functions and programs .
Functions can be dragged into Canvas for further usage , and programs can be clicked for editing .
Note that a function can be not only library one but also a user - defined one .
Canvas window ( the main one ) displays the flowgram to be edited .
Elementary program unit in Sanscript is a function — an entity which accepts some input , processes it and turns it into some output .
A function is displayed as a block with an image which denotes its purpose and a name which can ( optionally ) be changed to a more descriptive one .
This block has inlets and outlets — slots which mark input and output data flows of the function and are used to connect the function to other blocks of the flowgram with links .
Some functions have only outlets : these are used to generate input data of the program .
The most popular example of such functions is “ Constant ” ( used to hold some predefined constant ) .
Even “ Prompt ” function , which asks the user to enter some value , has an inlet for setting the text of prompt .
In flowgrams of functions , the inlets of the function are represented with blocks of special types .
Some functions have only inlets : these are used mostly for outputting the results of calculation , like “ Display Message ” .
Most flow control statements in other languages have their function equivalent in Sanscript .
Thus , loops are done with “ Repeat ” function ( break statement is called “ Stop Repeat ” ) ; if - then - else and case statements are replaced with “ Pick One ” .
Sanscript provides simple data types : integer , decimal ( floating - point number ) , text ( equivalent of string data types in other languages ) , boolean and pathname .
Besides , there are two complex data types — List and Record , along with a number of functions to process them .
If the mobile wars of the future are to be fought and won by the developers , it 's looking like a battle between Google and Apple .
A new survey from Appcelerator has found that Android narrowly beat out the iPhone / iPad as the most popular developer platform .
Enterprise Mobile Today reports on the race between Google 's Android and Apple 's iPhone / iPad platforms , and offers color about where Microsoft and BlackBerry fit into the picture .
Interest among mobile application developers in Apple 's iPad , due to ship Saturday , has waned slightly , allowing it and the iPhone to fall behind the Android platform -- but the Apple devices are still well ahead of every other mobile platform by a healthy margin .
In a survey of 1,028 developers , Appcelerator , developer of a platform for rapidly creating native mobile , desktop , and iPad applications using Web technologies , found Android is the most popular platform , with 86 percent of developers surveyed saying they are interested in writing apps for the open source operating system within the next year .
The iPhone / iPad came in second , slipping from 90 percent interest in writing an app for it in the January survey to 80 percent now , hardly a fatal loss .
Appcelerator suggested that the dip in interest came about thanks to Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) finally introducing the device after months of speculation , and developers were disappointed to see a lack of a camera and multitasking .
We pulled three nice charts from Goldman 's Global Economics Weekly .
The theme is emerging markets domestic demand , and while Western world has famously been devouring emerging markets exports for quite some time now , the next few decades will be about emerging markets consuming a rapidly increasing share of the world 's products .
Already , despite all the hype to the contrary this has already been happening , whereby domestic demand growth has been faster in emerging markets than developed markets .
Goldman :
The story of emerging markets ’ ( EM ) imports has significantly changed in the past decade .
Since 2000 , EM imports have grown by 17 % on average , exceeding both world import growth ( 13 % ) and developed markets ’ ( DM ) import growth ( 10 % ) .
In level terms too , EMs are making their mark by increasing their share of total world imports ( currently 45 % , compared to 30 % in the late 1990s ) .
This means that emerging markets ( EM ) are likely to account for a larger portion of global imports than developed markets ( DM ) , by 2020 as shown below .
( The white bars )
Further out , emerging markets will account for a larger and larger share of world import .
By 2050 they could account for over 70 % of world imports .
( The dark blue bars above ) .
It seems like U.S. and European exports are the place to be , the wind will be behind their back for the next forty years .

At any given time , across any of our business groups , there are new ideas being investigated , tested , and incubated .
It 's in Microsoft 's DNA to continually develop and incubate new technologies to foster productivity and creativity .
The " Courier " project is an example of this type of effort and its technologies will be evaluated for use in future Microsoft offerings , but we have no plans to build such a device at this time .
Well this is depressing .
Word has just gone fluttering out of Redmond that work on the Courier project -- a heretofore rumored dual - screen tablet which rightfully set the tech world ablaze -- has been spun down by the company .
Here 's the official line from Frank Shaw , Microsoft 's VP of corporate communications :
All very sad , of course .
So how did we get here ?
And was this thing ever really real to begin with ?
After all , it 's hard to kill something that never lived .
Well here 's the deal , according to a source familiar with the situation : the Courier did indeed start life as a potential new product category for the company , one which was being incubated internally with very real plans for a marketable device .
It seems , however , that things just did n't manage to take shape , and word was handed down very recently that the incubation period had reached its conclusion -- sans product -- and resources would be directed elsewhere .
Now , that does n't mean that we wo n't see some of this technology turn up in other products which Microsoft has in the pipeline ( the company does keep quite a few balls in the air ) , but it does mean that those rendered videos of the Courier in action will remain , unfortunately , renders .
As far as the Engadget team is concerned , there is n't a dry eye in the house right now -- but the Courier will always remain in our hearts as one of the finest unicorns that ever unicorned across our screens .
Just one " pulse " of artificial light at night disrupts circadian cell division , reveals a new study carried out by Dr. Rachel Ben-Shlomo of the University of Haifa - Oranim Department of Environmental and Evolutionary Biology along with Prof. Charalambos P. Kyriacou of the University of Leicester .
" Damage to cell division is characteristic of cancer , and it is therefore important to understand the causes of this damage , " notes Dr. Ben-Shlomo .
The study has been published in the journal Cancer Genetics and Cytogenetics .
The current research was carried out by placing lab mice into an environment where they were exposed to light for 12 hours and dark for 12 hours .
During the dark hours , one group of mice was given artificial light for one hour .
Changes in the expression of genes in the rodents ' brain cells were then examined .
Earlier studies that Dr. Ben-Shlomo carried out found that the cells ' biological clock is affected , and in the present research she revealed that the mode of cell division is also harmed and that the transcription of a large number of genes is affected .
She states that it is important to note that those genes showing changes in their expression included genes that are connected to the formation of cancer as well as genes that assist in the fight against cancer .
" What is certain is that the natural division is affected , " Dr. Ben-Shlomo clarifies .
This research joins earlier studies from the University of Haifa on the effects of exposure to artificial light at night .

‘ Machete ‘ has fallen into controversy , and it ’s still months away from its September release .
20th Century Fox , which won a ‘ bidding war ’ to distribute the film , pulled Rodriguez ’ fiery “ Illegal ” trailer from the web shortly after its special “ Cinco de Mayo ” message created a storm of controversy and fueled attacks , including one from its sister subsidiary Fox News .
Fox News , in turn , pulled the critical article from circulation , entitled “ Violent Movie Declares War on Arizona for Immigration Law . ”
Worst of all , Robert Rodriguez ’ incendiary race film ‘ Machete ‘ was made , in part , with help from tax incentives and location access provided by the Texas Film Commission , a division of Governor Rick Perry ’s Office .
A spokesperson from the organization confirmed that Rodriguez indeed applied for the program and that all of his Troublemaker Studios films have been part of it .
The film , originally based on a largely satirical mock - trailer inserted into Rodriguez & Taratino ’s Grindhouse , has expanded into full production , and developed a message that many have criticized as glorifying a race war .
Among those critics are two anonymous crew members from the production– who happen to be Hispanic– that came forward to warn
Alex confidentially about the upsetting script .
Further , two individuals who were privy to early screenings of ‘ Machete ’ have warned that the film is far more racially inflammatory than either the trailer or leaked script have indicated .
By contrast , films like Waco were denied taxpayer - funded resources for fears that it cast Texas in a bad light .
Attempting to shed the light of truth on one of Texas ’ most infamous and controversial episodes is bad , but stoking the fires of racial conflict somehow does Texas “ good ” ?
Yet , no issue has been made of using Texas Film Commission resources to fund Rodriguez ’ racist treatise .
Why does such a production warrant the support of the people of the State of Texas ?
Will people standby as as tax breaks and other value resources are poured into the creation of divisive , reductive and ultimately offensive portrayal of Mexicans and Americans , white , black , brown or otherwise .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In addition to state funds , Robert Rodriguez has long had use of the state & city funded studios based at the former Austin airport .
His Troublemaker Studios utilizes the Austin Studios facilities , which is managed by the Austin Film Society .
Are racial - revenge fantasies the intended use of such publicly and community supported institutions ?
Let the Texas Film Commission and other related entities know whether or not you support taxpayer funds going towards the production of ‘ Machete ’ and other films like it :

BARCELONA ( Reuters ) - A company behind plans to open the first hotel in space says it is on target to accept its first paying guests in 2012 despite critics questioning the investment and time frame for the multi-billion dollar project .
The Barcelona - based architects of The Galactic Suite Space Resort say it will cost 3 million euro ( $ 4.4 million ) for a three - night stay at the hotel , with this price including an eight - week training course on a tropical island .
During their stay , guests would see the sun rise 15 times a day and travel around the world every 80 minutes .
They would wear velcro suits so they can crawl around their pod rooms by sticking themselves to the walls like Spiderman .
Galactic Suite Ltd's CEO Xavier Claramunt , a former aerospace engineer , said the project will put his company ( www.galacticsuite.com) at the forefront of an infant industry with a huge future ahead of it , and forecast space travel will become common in the future .
“ It ’s very normal to think that your children , possibly within 15 years , could spend a weekend in space , ” he told Reuters Television .
A nascent space tourism industry is beginning to take shape with construction underway in New Mexico of Spaceport America , the world ’s first facility built specifically for space - bound commercial customers and fee- paying passengers .
British tycoon Richard Branson ’s space tours firm , Virgin Galactic , will use the facility to propel tourists into suborbital space at a cost of $ 200,000 a ride .
Galactic Suite Ltd , set up in 2007 , hopes to start its project with a single pod in orbit 450 km ( 280 miles ) above the earth , traveling at 30,000 km per hour , with the capacity to hold four guests and two astronaut - pilots .
It will take a day and a half to reach the pod - which Claramunt compared to a mountain retreat , with no staff to greet the traveler .
“ When the passengers arrive in the rocket , they will join it for 3 days , rocket and capsule .
With this we create in the tourist a confidence that he has n’t been abandoned .
After 3 days the passenger returns to the transport rocket and returns to earth , ” he said .
More than 200 people have expressed an interest in traveling to the space hotel and at least 43 people have already reserved .
The numbers are similar for Virgin Galactic with 300 people already paid or signed up for the trip but unlike Branson , Galactic Suite say they will use Russian rockets to transport their guests into space from a spaceport to be built on an island in the Caribbean .
But critics have questioned the project , saying the time frame is unreasonable and also where the money is coming from to finance the project .
Claramunt said an anonymous billionaire space enthusiast has granted $ 3 billion to finance the project .

A St. Louis - area nonprofit has fired a 37 - year - old office worker – after discovering that in her own time , the woman blogs about her polyamorous escapades .
The blogger – a single mother whose blog is called " The Beautiful Kind " – told St. Louis 's The Riverfront Times she " really was Clark Kent " about keeping her office and her extracurricular life separate ( and the extracurricular life was anonymous ) .
But she made one fatal mistake : Using Twitter .
TBK , as she 's known , refers to what happened to her as a Twitter " glitch . "
But her webmaster clarified to Inc. that her downfall was really " in the failure of how third party search / archiving sites work . "
When TBK created her Twitter profile , she filled out her real name expecting that only her handle would be visible , not her true identity , her webmaster explained .
The moment she saw her name pop up , she immediately removed it and adjusted the name field of her handle accordingly .
But unfortunately , the Twitter search engine Topsy already had cached the details and was displaying her name alongside her handle all this time .
( If you visit a profile on Topsy , there is a sync button on the right and a user has to manually select that in order to update any changed profile information . )
" When a user updates their bio data on Twitter , there is no automated update mechanism to inform third parties such as Topsy , " Topsy spokesman Brian Merritt told Inc.com .
He said the company is " saddened " to hear of TBK 's situation , and plans to add a feature that will allow users to delete individual tweets from Topsy that they do not wish to include in the index .
The service is available already on request , but the company hopes to make it easier for users to do it themselves .
He added : " We 're also working with Twitter to see if we can come up with a scaleable solution for dealing with private - public account status changes , so that we can automatically remove content when accounts go private . "
According to TBK , her boss – at the suggestion of top management – searched the web for information about employees , and discovered the sex blog .
When she arrived at work April 27 , she was fired on the spot .
Per an account TBK posted on another website , Aagablog , her boss was furious .
' I need to let you go , " the woman said , according to TBK .
" Corporate office suggested I Google employees .
I typed in your name and it took me two seconds to find your website .
How COULD you put that stuff out there ?
What were you thinking ?!
I feel like I 'm talking to a 14 year old !
We 're DONE .'
Her boss said the organization could n't be associated with anyone who was posting graphic images or erotica .
" They wanted me to pretend that I never even was there ; they want nothing to do with me , they want to act like it never happened , " TBK said .
( She does n't make any money from her blog , she said .
She used to make about $ 40 per month from having a PayPal button , but says the company suspended her account for having adult content . )
At the time of her firing , she had been working for the nonprofit for a month – and says she made every effort to be a model employees .
" I dressed like a freaking Mormon when I went in , " she wrote .
" I was really overcautious and did an extra - good job .
Because I always thought that if they ever did find out about it , I would have proved myself so much that they would weigh the pros and cons and decide to proceed a certain way that , you know , would n't fire me .
But I was n't there long enough to do that , and I do n't think it would have made a difference anyway , with the way they reacted .
It 's like – I went from good employee to monster . "
After her dismissal a letter from her former boss arrived .
It reportedly read : " We simply cannot risk any possible link between our mission and the sort of photos and material that you openly share with the online public .
While I know you are a good worker and an intelligent person , I hope you try to understand that our employees are held to a different standard .
When it comes to private matters , such as one 's sexual explorations and preferences , our employees must keep their affairs private . "
Tony Rothert , legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Eastern Missouri told The Riverfront Times it 's not an employer 's job to police the sexual lives of its employees – " when an employer discriminates on that basis it is sex discrimination and it's against the law , " he said .
But TBK has n't been specific enough about her circumstances for him to judge whether the employer 's actions are illegal .
He did suggest that if the organization only were concerned about public image the problem could have been solved by TBK 's taking down the blog ( which she has done . )
" The fact that they did n't do that and instead just fired her causes one to believe that it really is the content that they had a problem with , and not really that they were concerned about a connection between her blog and the employer being made in the public , " he said .
( In 2004 , Jessica Cutler – a staff assistant for then - U.S. Senator Michael DeWine who wrote a racy blog called Washingtonienne – was fired after the blog Wonkette revealed her identity .
But Cutler 's technical offense was " unacceptable use of Senate computers , " since she blogged from work .
Cutler , of course , ended up with a book deal . )
Wrote TBK's Webmaster on the question of legal action : " I wo n't go into details on the topic , but research into ' At - will employment ' ... gives an employer the right to terminate for any ( or no ) cause whatsoever ( with a few exceptions ) .
We could talk all day about how this does n't protect an employee 's rights in the wrong situation and how businesses can abuse this , but that 's another topic for another time .
Moral of the story :
Even if you think you 're protecting yourself by deleting questionable tweets or hiding information , it may already be in the hands of a third - party site who is continuing to display it to the world .
Said TBK 's webmaster : " What goes on social media does n't always stay there . "
Image caption Booms are being used against the oil off Louisiana
Oil firm BP may be " pushed out of the way " if it fails to perform in the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster clean - up , a top US official has warned .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the British company had missed " deadline after deadline " in its efforts to seal a blown - out oil well .
But he said BP had agreed to pay clean - up costs beyond the current US $ 75 m ( £ 52 m ) liability limit .
Mr Salazar is due to visit the disaster site on Monday with other officials .
The oil leak began more than a month ago , when a drilling rig operated on behalf of BP exploded , killing 11 people .
Tens of thousands of barrels of oil have spewed into the ocean since then from the well 's ruptured riser pipe , 1,524 m ( 5,000 ft ) beneath the surface
The spill has reached Louisiana and is threatening Florida and Cuba .
Limited options
" If we find they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately , " Mr Salazar told reporters after visiting BP 's US headquarters .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
Ken Salazar is threatening a move that would make a rodeo hero proud : he says his boot is on BP 's neck , but he is ready to push them out of the way Read Mark 's thoughts in full
The BBC's Madeleine Morris in Washington says Mr Salazar 's comment is the strongest language yet used by a US official towards BP .
Although it is within the government 's power to push BP aside , our correspondent says BP is the only organisation with the knowledge to deal with a situation like this at such a depth .
Washington is coming under increasing criticism for its response to the disaster , as well as pressure to assume control from BP .
Most of the information about the extent of the spill as well as measures to plug the leak have come from BP itself , leading to allegations the American government has been too reliant on the company for dealing with the spill , our correspondent adds .
Mr Salazar said the government had sent a team of scientific " all - stars " to BP 's headquarters in Houston .
" They have pushed BP in every way that they can to kill the well and they have pushed BP in every way that they can to stop the pollution , " he said .
" If there is a way to kill this well , they will find it .
If there is a way to stop this pollution from spreading , they will find it . "
He said the best option at the moment was to proceed with a " top kill " which involves injecting heavy drilling fluids into the ruptured pipe .
Mr Salazar added that there was " no question " that BP was doing its utmost to resolve the situation " because this is an existential crisis for one of the world 's largest companies " .
" Do I have confidence that they know exactly what they 're doing ?
No , not completely . "
Short - term options

At least 5,000 barrels of oil have been spewing out daily
Speaking on Saturday , President Barack Obama blamed the spill on " a breakdown of responsibility " at BP .
BP 's efforts suffered a new setback when it reported that its containment method on the ocean floor was capturing much less of the leaking oil than three days ago .
Its managing director , Bob Dudley , said it would press ahead with a series of short - term options while working on a relief well not due to be completed before August .
" We will keep trying , we will not wait until August , " he told CNN .
" There is no certainty at these kinds of depth . "
The chief of the US coast guard , Admiral Thad Allen , acknowledged on Sunday that the government was forced to rely on BP and the private oil sector to try to plug the spill .
" They have the eyes and ears that are down there .
They are necessarily the modality by which this is going to get solved , " he said .

Oil company engineers on Sunday finally succeeded in keeping some of the oil gushing from a blown well out of the Gulf of Mexico , hooking up a mile - long tube to funnel the crude into a tanker ship after more than three weeks of failures .
Millions of gallons of crude are already in the water , however , and researchers said the black ooze may have entered a major current that could carry it through the Florida Keys and around to the East Coast .
BP PLC engineers remotely guiding robot submersibles had worked since Friday to place the tube into a 21 - inch pipe nearly a mile below the sea .
After several setbacks , the contraption was hooked up successfully and funneling oil to a tanker ship .
The oil giant said it will take days to figure out how much oil its contraption is sucking up .
The blown well has been leaking for more than three weeks , threatening sea life , commercial fishing and the coastal tourist industry from Louisiana to Florida .
BP failed in several previous attempts to stop the leak , trying in vain to activate emergency valves and lowering a 100 - ton container that got clogged with icy crystals .
A researcher told The Associated Press on Sunday that computer models show the oil may have already seeped into a powerful water stream known as the loop current , which could propel it into the Atlantic Ocean .
A boat is being sent next week to collect samples and learn more .
William Hogarth , dean of the University of South Florida 's College of Marine Science , said one model shows oil has already entered the current , while a second shows the oil is 3 miles from it -- still dangerously close .
The models are based on weather , ocean current and spill data from the U.S. Navy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , among other sources .
Hogarth said it 's still too early to know what specific amounts of oil will make it to Florida , or what damage it might do to the sensitive Keys or beaches on Florida 's Atlantic coast .
He said claims by BP that the oil would be less damaging to the Keys after traveling over hundreds of miles from the spill site were not mollifying .
" This ca n't be passed off as 'it 's not going to be a problem . ' "
Hogarth said .
" This is a very sensitive area .
We are concerned with what happens in the Florida Keys . "
BP had previously said the tube , if successful , was expected to collect most of the oil gushing from the well .
On Sunday , the company said it was too early to measure how much crude was being collected and acknowledged the tube was no panacea .
" It 's a positive move , but let 's keep in context , " said Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice president for exploration and production .
" We 're about shutting down the flow of oil from this well . "
Crews will slowly ramp up how much oil the tube collects over the next few days .
They need to move slowly because they do n't want too much frigid seawater entering the pipe , which could combine with gases to form the same ice - like crystals that doomed the previous containment effort .
Two setbacks over the weekend illustrate how delicate the effort is .
Early Sunday , hours before a steady connection was made , engineers were able to suck a small amount of oil to the tanker , but the tube was dislodged .
The previous day , equipment used to insert the tube into the gushing pipe at the ocean floor had to be hauled to the surface for readjustment .
The first chance to choke off the flow for good should come in about a week .
Engineers plan to shoot heavy mud into the crippled blowout preventer on top of the well , then permanently entomb the leak in concrete .
If that does n't work , crews also can shoot golf balls and knotted rope into the nooks and crannies of the device to plug it , Wells said .
The final choice to end the leak is a relief well , but it is more than two months from completion .
Top officials in President Barack Obama 's administration cautioned that the tube " is not a solution " to the spill and said they are closely monitoring the situation .
" We will not rest until BP permanently seals the wellhead , the spill is cleaned up , and the communities and natural resources of the Gulf Coast are restored and made whole , " Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said in a joint statement .
Meanwhile , scientists warned of the effects of the oil that has already leaked into the Gulf .
Researchers said miles - long underwater plumes of oil discovered in recent days could poison and suffocate sea life across the food chain , with damage that could endure for a decade or more .
Researchers have found more underwater plumes of oil than they can count from the well , said Samantha Joye , a professor of marine sciences at the University of Georgia .
She said careful measurements taken of one plume showed it stretching for 10 miles , with a 3 - mile width .
The hazardous effects of the plume are twofold .
Joye said the oil itself can prove toxic to fish swimming in the sea , while vast amounts of oxygen are also being sucked from the water by microbes that eat oil .
Dispersants used to fight the oil are also food for the microbes , speeding up the oxygen depletion .
" So , first you have oily water that may be toxic to certain organisms and also the oxygen issue , so there are two problems here , " said Joye , who 's working with the scientists who discovered the plumes in a recent boat expedition .
" This can interrupt the food chain at the lowest level , and will trickle up and certainly impact organisms higher .
Whales , dolphins and tuna all depend on lower depths to survive . "
Conservationists in Florida said oil could wreak havoc in the Keys or the environmentally fragile Everglades .
" Obviously this is a fear that we had about where the oil might go next , " said John Adornato , regional director for the National Parks Conservation Association .
Oil has been spewing since the rig Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20 , killing 11 people and sinking two days later .
The government shortly afterward estimated the spill at 210,000 gallons -- or 5,000 barrels -- a day , a figure that has since been questioned by some scientists who fear it could be far more .
BP executives have stood by the estimate while acknowledging there 's no way to know for sure .
News of the tube 's success was met with tempered enthusiasm by the leader of a coastal parish in Lousiana that includes environmentally sensitive marshes and islands .
" It 's definitely good news , " Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said after a BP vice president called to brief him .
" It will be better news when they get it stopped , " he said , noting the underwater oil plumes .
" We have a large mess out there . " ___ Collins reported from Hammond .

African leaders are pushing for tougher terms on mining concessions after 25 years of structural adjustment – when countries cut red tape and offered generous tax holidays to foreign prospectors .
The new dynamic was on display at a recent mining conference in Senegal .
The chief executive officer of a multinational Africa mining firm was speaking , but Senegal 's president did n't appear to be listening .
Across the hall from President Abdoulaye Wade sat 500 delegates from foreign mining firms .
They had come in March to see which new holes were worth digging in this continent whose riches are in demand from booming economies like China's .
When the CEO 's presentation ended , Mr. Wade treated his visitors to a rhyme : " I never said , enrichissez - vous . " [ Enrich yourselves ] .
" I said enrichissons - nous . "
( Let 's enrich one another . )
A cheer rose up from the African delegates .
" I think we 're at a turning point , " says Bonnie Campbell , political science professor at the University of Quebec in Montreal and author of " Mining in Africa . "
" There 's been a quarter - century where a certain investment - friendly road has been taken .
[ Now ] there is a recognition that there needs to be another focus . "
A cartel modeled after OPEC ?
The capstone of that push , at least for Wade , would be an international alliance of Africa 's mineral - rich nations , modeled after OPEC – a pan-African body that could influence the price of metals like the cobalt in Chinese - made laptop and cellphone batteries , 90 percent of which comes from Africa , according to the business watchdog SwedWatch .
" It 's an ambitious but feasible idea , " says Mazou Yessouph Faudy , geological director for Niger 's Mining Ministry .
" Our economy is falling .
As a producer of uranium , it would be good to involve ourselves in a union of producers that could set the price . "
Already , according to estimates by gold mining company Randgold Resources , the continent produces 30 percent of the minerals required by the US and China .
" [ Africa is ] going to become a very important player in the commodity and minerals market , " says Roger Dixon , chairman for South Africa 's SRK mining consultancy , citing China 's 11.9 percent growth in its gross domestic product , the total of goods and services produced , in the first quarter of 2010 .
" With that kind of demand , I think it 's a great opportunity for Africa to move to the forefront of things . "
Africa should call mining companies ' bluff
The question is how .
For African negotiators , seizing the moment may mean demanding that companies hire more locals , adhere to stricter environmental rules , or build more roads and schools for local communities .
Those are all accommodations that mining companies find reasonable , says Mr. Dixon .
But an OPEC - like cartel ?
That 's " crazy , " says Honorary Prof.
Phillip Crowson at Scotland 's Center for Mineral Law and Policy .
" There were attempts to do this with phosphates , iron ore , bauxite , copper – none of them worked , " he says , because too many nations opted out .
" Mining companies do n't have to invest , and if the terms are n't attractive , they wo n't . "
Professor Campbell thinks African arbitrators should call their bluff .
" The idea that global companies will go elsewhere , we 've always heard that , " she says .
" We have to be careful about this discourse that says if you raise a finger , investment will flee . "
" If it was n't for the smoke of the bacon burning this onto the pan it could have been a very bad situation , perhaps someone 's looking over me .
There are worlds , and there are worlds
-- Cornelius Eady
There 's been a lot of talk over the past few months over the dating prospects for black women .
Besides the occasional dip , I 've tried to stay clear as I think this is the kind of conversation where there 's a lot of condemnation and very little exploration .
One instance of claimed exploration is this study done back in October by the dating site OKCupid in which they mined their data to see how race and gender affected your chances at the site .
There 's a lot of data and conclusions up there , but for our purposes , I want to focus on the conclusions about black women :
Black women write back the most .
Whether it 's due to talkativeness , loneliness , or a sense of plain decency , black women are by far the most likely to respond to a first contact attempt .
In many cases , their response rate is one and a half times the average , and , overall , black women reply about a quarter more often that other women .
Men do n't write black women back .
Or rather , they write them back far less often than they should .
Black women reply the most , yet get by far the fewest replies .
Essentially every race -- including other blacks -- singles them out for the cold shoulder .
Times ' Freakonomics blog ,
At the Freakonomics blog , Ian Ayres looked at the data and offered his observations :
Men ( including African - American men ) write back to African - American women at about a 20 % lower rate .
This result is somewhat reminiscent of the famous resume study done by Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan , which found that employers who place want ads were less likely to respond to resumes from people with African - American sounding names .
But in some ways the OkCupid result is even more depressing than the racial disparities found in employment .
It seems that OkCupid does n't match couples where the match would be inconsistent with an explicit racial preference of a user .
So these racial disparities persist even after excluding users who have stated an explicit racial preference ...
Ayres finds this depressing , and laments that black women have " an uphill battle . "
TIME uses the study , and others of online dating sites , and concludes that black women " will be disproportionately snubbed by men of all races . "
Look , I deeply suspect that , on a national level , there are an unfortunate number of people who think black women are less attractive then women of other races .
The remnants of white supremacy are not just economic , they are cultural .
I also think that 's less true today then it was twenty years ago .
But that said , I think that people passing this data around need to be really careful about using this study to draw inferences about the dating world of black women .
One significant problem is that , as any black person will tell you , when black folks date online they do n't go to OKcupid .
They go to blacksingles .
They go to soulsingles .
Or if they 're truly high post , they go to EliteNoire .
( Dig the sensuous piano riffs and candelabra . )
Black people who are going to a site like OKcupid are generally black people who , with some exceptions , are open to interracial dating .
But the same is n't true of white people on OKcupid .
So the game is rigged -- on OKcupid you have many white men who have no interest in dating black women , but very few black men with no interest in dating white women .
That 's because all the black men who do n't want to date white women are on the African American Dating Network or Blacksinglesconnection .
There simply is no real white corollary .
Stormfront excluded , there are n't many " WhiteSingles " websites or " EliteIvory " dating sites .
There is no Caucasian Dating Network , because the broader world is the Caucasian Dating Network .
OKCupid is the Caucasian Dating Network .
( Note that there is Jdate , though . )
This has other implications for white people .
OKCupid reports a relatively high rate of white people who do n't want to date interracially .
It looks shocking when you compare it to black people on the site .
But it 's also an unfair comparison because , again , most of the black people opposed to interracial dating are n't on OKCupid .
I do n't write this to be dismissive of the struggles black women face on the dating scene , or all women , for that matter .
But these tales of black female woe are becoming grating , not because black women do n't have their share of struggle , but because of the lack of agency runs that through them all , this sense that black women , are there to be acted upon , to wait by the phone .
There 's almost an objectifying quality to the whole discussion .
We 've been here before .
And , evidently , we 've learned nothing .
With all the privacy issues surrounding Facebook , many people are considering quitting the site altogether .
If you 're not ready to take it that far , here 's how to avoid the privacy breaches without completely deleting your account and losing touch with your friends .

Should I Quit Facebook Altogether ?
We 've all had that one friend who deactivated his / her Facebook and was never seen again , because no one could establish contact .
As if the telephone , email , and IM were never invented , many people are at a loss as to how to contact you if your Facebook is n't an easy click away .
Even if the situation is n't quite that dire , Facebook is still how a lot of people keep connected , and severing that connection completely is a big deal .

But now , privacy - minded folks have many legitimate reasons you should quit Facebook ( or reasons you should but can't go through with it ) , the same thing is on everyone 's mind :
Is the grief of quitting worth avoiding future privacy breaches ?

The Less Extreme Alternative
Luckily , there is another , more middle - of - the - road option .
That 's not to say this is n't still extreme — this is n't for the faint of heart .
It is n't a tutorial about how to change your privacy settings .
This is a tutorial on how to create the most minimalist Facebook profile possible , with as little information on yourself as possible , to be used only for communication between you and your friends .
You wo n't be able to do much on the site ; you probably wo n't even visit the site that often .
This is not for people who want to continue using Facebook ; it is for the people who are ready to up and quit tomorrow , but do n't want to miss out on the next party just because they care about their privacy .
So if you 're really ready to give up wall posts , comments , Farmville , and fan pages , here 's how to proceed without falling off the face of the Earth .

Create a Disposable Email Address for Your Account
We 've talked about disposable email addresses before , and most people probably already have one .
( The idea being that if you create a second email address for free and sign up for the sketchy sites with it , you wo n't have to deal with spam in your main account later on . )
With all the bugs and privacy gaffes surrounding Facebook , it has certainly become one of those sites you could call sketchy .
Advertisement
With this email address , you can also set up notifications for messages and event invites and get all that by email ( so you do n't ever have to actually " check " Facebook ) , and even forward it to your main email account .
That way , you wo n't have to check this separate one , but if something ever happens ( like Facebook making your email public for 30 minutes ) , you can delete the disposable address , make a new one , link it with Facebook , and not have to deal with the spam forever .
You can use any service to do this , but I 'd personally just make a new Gmail address separate from my regular Google account , sign into it using Private Browsing mode ( so you do n't sign yourself out of your regular Gmail ) , set up the forwarding filters , and forget it .
( To set up forwarding , just log into your disposable account , click Create Filter , and set the filter to forward any email From : facebook to your real account .
If things get ugly , you can always turn the filter off . )

Create a New Account and Transfer Your Friends
Advertisement
Technically , this part is optional , but I also think it has the biggest impact on how the rest of your experience will pan out .
You could just edit all the information on your current account , but if you make a new one and delete the old one you 'll have a completely clean slate .
You wo n't have any posts lingering around anywhere , no personal information for the taking and no photos tagged of you .
Plus , this is prime time to get rid of all your friends that you do n't need .
Do you really still need to be Facebook friends with that girl you met at that party that time ?
Did n't think so .
This process is actually quite simple , especially because you have a new email address as created in step one .
Log out of Facebook and create a new account using that email address .
Do n't enter any information , and for now , do n't make any new friends except with yourself ( you 'll need to friend your old account for this to work smoothly ) .
Bask in the glory of that clean , privacy - filled profile , and then log back into your old account and accept the friend request to your new one .
Alternatively , open up a second browser and use one for your old account and one for your new account , just for this process — you 'll be switching back and forth a lot .
Advertisement
Conveniently , Facebook will then ask you to suggest friends for your new account ( if not , you can do so by visiting your new account 's profile page from your old account ) .
This is the part of the process in which you 'll transfer over the friends you actually want with one fell swoop — no spending hours searching each and every one of them out .
Go through the entire list of your friends and check off the ones you want to keep .
It wo n't take nearly as long as you think it will , I promise .
Click Send and then move over to your new account .
All those suggestions will be pending friend requests that you can run through quickly and add each as a friend ( again , it looks like a tedious process , but should n't take too long ) and you 'll have all the friends you need .
Advertisement
If you want to hold on to your old account during the transition , that 's fine , but the point of making a new one is to delete all the old stuff , so when you 're ready , go ahead and delete ( not just deactivate ) that old account .
It 'll try to tempt you into staying by showing you pictures of your friends , but you can press continue without guilt knowing you 're still going to ( mostly ) be around .

Turn Off the Wall on Your Profile
There are a few privacy settings we need to tweak on the new account , so hit " Account " in the upper left hand corner of your window and click Privacy Settings .
The first area we 'll venture into is " Personal Information and Posts " to turn off the wall .
This way , you wo n't have your profile covered with the stupid things your friends say ; it 'll just be your very barren news feed .
Advertisement
Everything else here can stay the same ; you do n't need to make anything else private .
You are n't going to be making any posts , you are n't going to be filling out information , and you are n't going to be uploading photos , so no need to cover them up .
Again , keep in mind — this is n't about changing privacy , this is about quitting unnecessary Facebook activity , so it does n't matter what these privacy settings are .
They 're just going to go public again after the next redesign , so why mess with them now ?
Hide Your Email Address
Advertisement
Next , head back to your Privacy settings and go to " Contact Information " .
You could add more info here , like your phone number , if you want your friends to have easy access , but we 've already seen how Facebook can make information public , even unintentionally .
That 's why we created the junk email address back at the beginning of this process .
I 'd just leave it all blank .
Advertisement
Down next to your registered email address is the privacy setting for who can see it .
Click on it and hit customize .
In the dropdown at the top of the popup window , choose " only me " and click save .
Your email address is now hidden from everyone , including your friends .
If you want to make it visible to them , you can — sometimes people get in a bind and may want to contact you via email with something that physically can't be sent via Facebook message — but again , it 's just a junk email address .
You do n't want your friends actually thinking that 's your address , because then you have a lot more work to do if you ever have to trash it and get a new one as mentioned above .
Just keep it a secret .

Hide Media Tagged With Your Name
As of right now , you can only keep tagged photos and videos out of search results and off your profile .
There is currently no way to actually prevent people from tagging photos of you .
With this setting , people wo n't be able to see photos of you from your profile page , but if they get to the picture by other means ( by , say , looking at the actual album or linking to it from the profile of someone else tagged in it ) they will still see your name on the photo .
Yes , it 's a glaring omission from the privacy features in Facebook , but it also does n't matter much .
Unfortunately , the responsibility does and will always have to lie with your friends that are uploading pictures .
Facebook will never be able to stop them from uploading a picture of you , and they 'll never be able to stop that person from tagging that photo with a name , any name ( including yours ) , whether or not it is linked to a profile .
But even if it does , your profile is completely empty .
What 's the difference between it linking to your empty profile and being unclickable text ?
The only fool - proof solution to the photo tagging problem is to kick your friends in the shin if they post embarrassing pictures of you .
Or , you know , get some more mature friends .
Advertisement
To stop tagged photos from showing up on your profile , though , go back to Privacy Settings and hit " Friends , Tags , & Connections " .
Edit the " Photos and Videos of Me " setting just like you did in the last step so only you can see the tags , and save the settings .
This will delete the link to " photos of you " under your profile picture .
Advertisement
Hide Yourself from Facebook and Google Searches
You can tweak this next step to your liking .
You probably do n't want your profile showing up in Google , but if you want people to find you on Facebook you might want to stay in those search results ( since people wo n't be able to find you through activity on your friends ' walls , because there wo n't be any ) .
At the same time , you may wish to have complete control over who you become Facebook friends with , and that 's fine too .
In Privacy Settings , hit up the " Search " section and uncheck Public Search Results .
Set your Facebook Search Results to whatever you want the same way you did for photos .

Lock Down Applications ( Just In Case )
This is the one area where I would just make everything as private as possible .
You never know what those darned applications are going to do , and while you 're not going to be running around Facebook installing anything , you can never be too careful .
I would n't even recommend you stay logged into Facebook while you browse the web , since we 've all seen they 're always watching you .
Under Privacy Settings , head to Applications and Websites and go nuts .
Edit what your friends can share about you and what you can share about your friends down to nothing , and set your activity visible only to you .
Again , keep in mind that even if applications were to share your information — you do n't really have any information to share , so you 're probably safe .
The darned things are just so annoying that I 'd like to lock them down as much as possible .
Advertisement
I 'd also go into notification settings ( under Account > Account Settings > Notifications ) and turn off any notifications having to do with applications .
In fact , while you 're there , you might as well turn everything else off except for messages , event invitations , and ( if you want ) photo tagging , because you wo n't be doing much else on Facebook , so there 's no reason to clutter up your inbox .
Every once in a while , it 's probably a good idea to log in and clear all your unnecessary notifications , but other than that , you should be able to get the few necessary features to notify you via email .
Advertisement
While I 'd like to say you wo n't have to pay attention to Facebook 's privacy gaffes ever again , that just is n't the case .
With each redesign , you 'll want to do a quick scan of either the privacy settings , policy , or just the blogosphere to see what fresh new hell Facebook unleashes , but in general , no matter how much of your information they try to share , there is n't much on this minimal profile that can get out there .
There are a few things Facebook will always have on you , such as your email address and list of friends , so these are the important things to check up on .
But if you do n't have anything else on your profile , it 's hard to see how applications taking information from your profile is going to be a big disadvantage if there is n't anything on it to take .
Advertisement
Your life wo n't be completely free of Facebook drama , but it will be significantly easier since you wo n't have to pour through how - tos ( like this one ) trying to figure out how to get everything set straight again .
It should be a pretty easy process from now on .
And , best of all , your friends can't complain about you being " hard to get a hold of " , and you wo n't miss out on the next gathering just because the invitation went out on Facebook .
To be perfectly clear , though : I 'm not saying this is what everybody should do .
If you 're not violently furious with Facebook ( I 'm personally not ) , let it go .
But , if you are seriously thinking about quitting , I think this is a set - up to consider , if you have n't already .
If you have , be sure to share your tips for a minimalist Facebook in the comments .
Note : I ’ll be on TVO ’s The Agenda with Steve Paikin tonight talking about Government 2.0 .
Why does open data matter ?
Rather than talk in abstract terms , let me share a well documented but little known story about how open data helped expose one of the biggest tax frauds in Canada ’s history .
It begins in early 2007 when a colleague was asked by a client to do an analysis of the charitable sector in Toronto .
Considering it a simply consulting project , my colleague called the Canada Revenue Agency ( CRA ) and asked for all the 2005 T3010s – the Annual Information Returns where charities disclose to the CRA their charitable receipts and other information – in Toronto .
After waiting several weeks and answering a few questions , the CRA passed along the requested information .
After spending time cleaning up the data my colleague eventually had a working excel spreadsheet and began to analyze the charitable sector in the Greater Toronto Area .
One afternnon , on a lark , they decided to organize the charities by size of tax - receipted charitable donations .
At this point it is important to understand something about scale .
The United Way of Greater Toronto is one of the biggest charities in North America , indeed its most recent annual charitable donation drive was the biggest on the continent .
In 2008 – the year of the financial crisis started – the United Way of Greater Toronto raised $ 107.5 million .
So it was with some surprise that after sorting the charities by 2005 donation amounts my colleague discovered that the United Way was not first on the list .
It was n’t even second .
It was third .
This was an enormous surprise .
Somewhere in Toronto , without anyone being aware of it , two charities had raised more money than the United Way ( which in 2005 raised target of $ 96.1 M ) .
The larger one , the International Charity Association Network ( ICAN ) raised $ 248 M in 2005 .
The other , the Choson Kallah Fund of Toronto had receipts of $ 120 M ( up from $ 6 M in 2003 ) .
Indeed , four out the top 15 charities on the list , including Millennium Charitable Foundation , Banyan Tree , were unknown to my colleague , someone who had been active in the Toronto charitable community for over a decade .
All told , my colleague estimated that these illegally operating charities alone sheltered roughly Half a billion dollars in 2005 .
Indeed , newspapers later confirmed that in 2007 , fraudulent donations were closer to a billion dollars a year , with some some 3.2 billion dollars illegally sheltered , a sum that accounts for 12 % of all charitable giving in Canada .
Think about this .
One billion dollars .
A year .
That is almost .6 % of the Federal Government ’s annual budget .
My colleague was eager to make sure that CRA was taking action on these organizations , but it did n’t look that way .
The tax frauds were still identified by CRA as qualified charities and were still soliciting donors with the endorsement of government .
They knew that a call to CRA ’s fraud tip line was unlikely to prompt swift action .
The Toronto Star had been doing its own investigations into other instances of charity fraud and had been frustrated by CRA ’s slow response .
My colleague took a different route .
They gave the information to the leadership of the charitable sector and those organizations as a group took it to the leadership at CRA .
From late 2007 right through 2009 the CRA charities division – now under new leadership – has systematically shut down charity tax shelters and are continuing to do so .
One by one , International Charity Association Network , Banyan Tree Foundation , Choson Kallah Fund , the Millennium Charitable Foundation and others identified by my colleague have lost their charitable status .
A reported $ 3.2 billion in tax receipts claimed by 100,000 Canadian tax filers have so far been disallowed or are being questioned .
A class action suit launched by thousands of donors against the organizers and law firm of Banyan Tree Foundation was recently certified .
It ’s a first .
Perhaps the CRA was already investigating these cases .
It must build its cases carefully as , if they end up in court and fail to successfully present their case , they could help legalize a tax loophole .
It may just have been moving cautiously .
But perhaps it did not know .
This means that , at best , government data – information that should be made more accessible and open in an unfettered and machine readable format – helped reveal one of the largest tax evasion scandals in the country ’s history .
But if the CRA was already investigating , scrutiny of this data by the public served a different purpose – helping to bring these issues out into the open , forcing CRA to take public action ( suspending these organizations ’ right to solicit more donations ) , sooner rather than later .
Essentially from before 2005 - 2007 dozens of charities were operating illegally .
Had the data about their charitable receipts been available for the public ’s routine review , someone in the public might have taken notice and raised a fuss earlier .
Perhaps even a website tracking donations might have been launched .
This would have exposed those charities that had abnormally large donations with few programs to explain then .
Moreover , it might have given some of the 100,000 Canadians now being audited a tool for evaluating the charities they were giving money to .
In the computer world there is something called Linus ’ Law , which states : “ given enough eyeballs , all bugs ( problems ) are shallow . ”
The same could be said about many public policy or corruption issues .
For many data sets , citizens should not have to make a request .
Nor should we have to answer questions about why we want the data .
It should be downloadable in its entirety .
Not trapped behind some unhelpful search engine .
When data is made readily available in machine readable formats , more eyes can look at it .
This means that someone on the ground , in the community ( like , say , Toronto ) who knows the sector , is more likely to spot something a public servant in another city might not see because they do n’t have the right context or bandwidth .
And if that public servant is not allowed to talk about the issue , then they can share this information with their fellow citizens .
This is the power of open data :
The power to find problems in complicated environments , and possibly even to prevent them from emerging .
It 's a courageous , smart and open - eyed essay that Peter Beinart , my old friend and fellow former editor of TNR has written .
It has , to my mind , two central things to tell us .
The first is that the political , moral and cultural shift within Israel is much worse than many seem to acknowledge ; and the second is that the American Jewish Establishment , as Peter calls it , is intent on looking away , and on reiterating exhausted motifs and failing smears to keep reality at bay , as their children drift away from what looks increasingly like an apartheid state in a permanently warring Middle East .
The Dish has tried to convey part of what has culminated over the last couple of years .
But Beinart 's picture of reality is as sobering as any I have yet read , and helps one realize just how alarmingly realist John Mearsheimer 's bleak view is .
The government in Jerusalem is more radical and extreme and illiberal than many want to believe :
Effi Eitam , a charismatic excabinet minister and war hero , has proposed ethnically cleansing Palestinians from the West Bank .
“ We ’ll have to expel the overwhelming majority of West Bank Arabs from here and remove Israeli Arabs from [ the ] political system , ” he declared in 2006 .
In 2008 , Eitam merged his small Ahi Party into Netanyahu ’s Likud .
And for the 20092010 academic year , he is Netanyahu ’s special emissary for overseas “ campus engagement . ”
A minor figure ?
Let 's go further up :
Foreign minister , Avigdor Lieberman ’s position might be called “ pre-expulsion . ”
He wants to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs who wo n’t swear a loyalty oath to the Jewish state .
He tried to prevent two Arab parties that opposed Israel ’s 2008 2009 Gaza war from running candidates for the Knesset .
He said Arab Knesset members who met with representatives of Hamas should be executed .
He wants to jail Arabs who publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day , and he hopes to permanently deny citizenship to Arabs from other countries who marry Arab citizens of Israel .
Then ... drum - roll please ... Netanyahu himself .
This , I 'm ashamed to say , I did n't know :
In his 1993 book , A Place among the Nations , Netanyahu not only rejects the idea of a Palestinian state , he denies that there is such a thing as a Palestinian .
In fact , he repeatedly equates the Palestinian bid for statehood with Nazism .
An Israel that withdraws from the West Bank , he has declared , would be a “ ghetto - state ” with “ Auschwitz borders . ”
And the effort “ to gouge Judea and Samaria [ the West Bank ] out of Israel ” resembles Hitler ’s bid to wrench the German - speaking “ Sudeten district ” from Czechoslovakia in 1938 .
It is unfair , Netanyahu insists , to ask Israel to concede more territory since it has already made vast , gut - wrenching concessions .
What kind of concessions ?
It has abandoned its claim to Jordan , which by rights should be part of the Jewish state .
So while those of us in what Peter calls the " comfortable Zionism " of the older American generation somehow believe that Netanyahu is sincere in wanting out - one day - of the West Bank , you realize that he already believes that in reality , Israel has a legitimate claim to the East Bank as well , and should be congratulated for not invading and occupying that !
How on earth is there ever going to be any kind of settlement on those grounds ?
The politics of Netanyahu 's coalition also means he could never concede anything on the West Bank .
The ultra -orthodox - a very fast - growing group - has shifted to a strong anti-concession position , represented by their party , Shas , which helped humiliate Biden .
The fundamentalist virulence of the settler movement has infiltrated the military ; and much of the next generation is more extreme than the last :
When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year , Lieberman won .
This March , a poll found that 56 percent of Jewish Israeli high school studentsand more than 80 percent of religious Jewish high school studentswould deny Israeli Arabs the right to be elected to the Knesset .
This is the mirror that Obama said he would try to hold up to Israel in order to help it make the right decisions for survival as a Jewish and a Western state .
The American Jewish Establishment ( AJE , a useful new term ) tried to smash that mirror or veil it .
This is not an answer .
It is an integral part of the problem .
On its current trajectory , Israel will become a Jewish authoritarian state , using brute force against a majority of its citizens and inhabitants , because it has no other option .
And its actions , by inflaming Jihadism worldwide , could well come back to hurt not just Israel , but us all .
I read Ze 'ev Sternhell in college , when I studied modern European history .
He remains a brilliant scholar of fascism .
So this winner of the prestigious Israel Prize deserves a listening :
Commenting on Avigdor Lieberman and the leaders of Shas in a recent Op - Ed in Haaretz , [ Sternhell ] wrote , “ The last time politicians holding views similar to theirs were in power in post World War II Western Europe was in Franco ’s Spain . ”
With their blessing , “ a crude and multifaceted campaign is being waged against the foundations of the democratic and liberal order . ”
Sternhell should know .
In September 2008 , he was injured when a settler set off a pipe bomb at his house .
Why is that pipe - bomb any less of a warning than an IED in Iraq ?
And is it really being a friend of Israel to ignore it ?

Mexico 's federal government went ahead over the weekend with a plan to disconnect cellphone lines whose users did not submit their identities to a national registry by midnight Saturday , a move intended to strike a blow to organized crime .
About 69 % of the 83.5 million cellphone lines in Mexico had been registered , La Jornada reported .
But by Sunday , 25.9 million cellphone lines not registered in time were in the process of being cut off .
As with many operations undertaken by the federal bureaucracy in Mexico , organizational disorder increased as the process quickened .
Confusion reigned among many over how to complete the process to register their lines .
The registration system , known as RENAUT , was swamped by last - minute users .
And one provider , Movistar , threatened to ignore the government 's order to disconnect lines , saying telecommunications were a " constitutional right . "
Foreigners living in Mexico , meanwhile , were left to figure out their options on their own by sharing information on online message boards .
" The disconnection of 31 % of cellular telephone lines in the country represents an unprecedented act ... in the history of telecommunications and in commercial contracts between individual parties , " said La Jornada in its Sunday coverage .
Cellphone providers , of course , stood to lose tens of millions of pesos if large numbers of cellphone lines were temporarily disconnected .
But the government did not budge .
Procrastination , the president of the Federal Communications Commission said gravely on Friday , " carries consequences . "
When the deadline finally hit , a stunned disbelief gripped some Mexicans , clutching their hand - held links to the world in homes and businesses over the weekend :
How could my cell number just ... be cut off ?
To register , users had to provide their CURP number , similar in some uses to a Social Security number in the United States .
But many Mexicans said they did not have a CURP or know their number .
On some social - media sites , others admitted to unlawfully using someone else 's CURP -- in some cases , that of a dead person -- to register .
In apparent protest of the registration law , an estimated 12,000 cellphone lines were reportedly submitted to the registry under the name Felipe Calderon , Mexico 's president .
Providers have told their customers their lines , including their calling credit , will not disappear while the RENAUT system has them cut off .

Prime Minister Stephen Harper announces on Friday that Helena Guergis has resigned from cabinet .
( ( Adrian Wyld / Canadian Press ) )
Prime Minister Stephen Harper has asked former cabinet minister Helena Guergis to sit outside the Conservative caucus while the RCMP investigates " serious " allegations over her conduct .
In an email sent Friday before the prime minister held a news conference in Ottawa , Guergis announced she had resigned as minister of state for the status of women , ending her tumultuous tenure in Harper 's cabinet .
Helena Guergis speaks during question period in the House of Commons earlier this month .
( Sean Kilpatrick / Canadian Press )
Harper said he learned of the allegations against Guergis on Thursday night and immediately referred them to the Mounties , as well as the commissioners for ethics and conflict of interest .
In the meantime , he has asked Public Works Minister Rona Ambrose to assume Guergis 's cabinet responsibilities .
" Those allegations had to do with Ms. Guergis 's conduct and do not involve any other minister , member of Parliament , or federal government employee , " Harper told reporters outside the Commons , without providing more details about the allegations .
" Ms. Guergis offered her resignation from the ministry , and I accepted it .
Pending a resolution , she will sit outside of the Conservative party caucus . "
Allegations ' peripheral ' to Jaffer dinner
Speculation over when the unpopular junior minister 's time in cabinet would come to an end escalated mid-week after media reports about the alleged business dealings of Guergis 's husband , former Alberta Tory MP Rahim Jaffer .
A Toronto Star report on Thursday alleged Jaffer boasted to potential clients about his connections inside the Prime Minister 's Office at a liquor - filled dinner meeting in downtown Toronto last September .
Later the same night , while driving home , he was arrested on charges of impaired driving and cocaine possession .
The PMO dismissed Jaffer 's alleged claims of influence as " false " and " absurd . "
It also emerged Thursday that Jaffer was using a parliamentary email account through a wireless device given to him by Guergis .
Sources told CBC
News that the prime minister received the " credible " allegations against Guergis late Thursday night .
The sources said Guergis did not volunteer any information herself , as Harper did n't speak to her until Friday morning .
The sources added the allegations are " peripheral " to Jaffer and not directly linked to the alleged events of the dinner meeting reported in the Star story .
CTV
News reported Friday night that the RCMP is investigating whether Jaffer used his wife 's parliamentary office for private , commercial business and whether Guergis accompanied him to business meetings .
Remains MP for Simcoe - Grey
Guergis has faced repeated calls for her resignation after she apologized for throwing a tantrum in Charlottetown Airport in February , during which she allegedly swore at airport staff and referred to the city as a " hellhole . "
This week , the Liberals asked the federal ethics commissioner to probe the financing of her purchase of an Ottawa home .
Jaffer , who represented the Alberta riding of Edmonton - Strathcona — first as a Reform Party MP and later as a Conservative — pleaded guilty to a charge of careless driving stemming from his Sept. 10 arrest and was ordered to pay a $ 500 fine , but the more serious charges against him were dropped .
In her email announcing her resignation , Guergis said she will remain the MP for the southern Ontario riding of Simcoe - Grey .
She said the past nine months have been a " very difficult time " for her .
She apologized again for her " emotional " behaviour in February and insisted she would never insult Prince Edward Island , her father ’s birthplace .
" I have worked hard for Canadian women , and I am proud of my record of my accomplishments on their behalf , " she added .
PM must ' be straight ' : Ignatieff
Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said the prime minister must restore public confidence in the government and Parliament by coming clean about the whole affair .
" He 's got to come out and level and be clear and be straight and then I think we all want to move on , " Ignatieff told reporters on Friday outside the House .
Ignatieff said it ’s not credible for the government to say MPs had no contact with Jaffer , a former MP , who was using the Conservative logo on his website until Thursday .
" There are a huge number of questions to which Canadians need an answer , and the idea that this is over seems to me mistaken , " he said .
" It ’s continuing because this government cannot level with the Canadian people . "
NDP Leader Jack Layton said Harper should reveal to the public the allegations against Guergis .
" I think he would be obliged .
He said he would run the most transparent and open government that we had seen , " Layton said .
" But let ’s face it , that ’s not happening and Mr. Harper ’s tendency is to be very closed about things .
You get the impression he was dragged kicking and screaming into this one . "
Guergis was first elected to the House of Commons in 2004 .
She served as parliamentary secretary to then trade minister David Emerson after the Conservatives were elected to form a minority government in 2006 .
In 2007 , she was promoted to secretary of state for foreign affairs and international trade , and secretary of state for sport .
She was named minister of state for the status of women following the 2008 federal election , which saw Jaffer defeated in his riding .
The two married the day after the election .

At about 12:10 EDT ( UTC - 4 ) early this morning , a Tripoli - bound Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A330 - 200 went down at its airline 's main hub , Tripoli International Airport ( IATA : TIP ; ICAO : HLLT ) , killing about 100 .
The flight originated in Johannesburg , South Africa .
About 61 Dutch , about 22 Libyans , and lesser numbers of British and South Africans were aboard the plane .
A child between eight and ten years old thrown clear of the explosion and carrying a Dutch passport is thought to be the only survivor of the crash .
No fire resulted .
The A330 - 200 was going to change its flight number and continue on to Gatwick Airport in London ( IATA : LGW ; ICAO : EGKK ) .
The plane reportedly came to rest not far from the end of the runway on which it was expected to land .
On its website , Afriqiyah Airways offered assistance with hotel accommodations and visa approval to relatives of the victims .
This is the most deadly accident in the airline ’s nine - year history .
Libya ’s Transport Minister has said the incident was not terrorism .
Here are some articles about the crash .

OnStar Leverages Google Technology to Connect Customers to the Chevrolet Volt
New features coming for Chevrolet Volt Mobile App
DETROIT , May 18 / PRNewswire / --
OnStar is leveraging the power of Google technology to develop a number of new mobile app features that strengthen Chevrolet 's commitment to providing Volt customers with the most connected vehicle experience possible .
The public will get a peek at what OnStar is working on at the Google I/O conference May 19 - 20 in San Francisco , CA , where OnStar will debut and demonstrate new functionalities they 're developing for the Chevrolet Volt mobile application leveraging the Android™ platform .
" While OnStar will never lose sight of our core focus on safety and security , this relationship is an example of how we 're evolving our leadership position in connected vehicle technology , " said Chris Preuss , OnStar president .
" What we 're talking about today is only the beginning . "
A new " navigation " tab has been added to the home screen of the existing Chevrolet Volt mobile app on the Android smartphone .
When a Volt owner presses this tab , they will be able to see the current location of their Volt pinpointed on Google Maps™ , as well as their location relative to it .
From this map screen , owners can use Google search by voice to vocally search for a destination with their Android handset , and see where that destination is related to the Volt 's current location .
They can then elect to send the destination from their Android phone to their Volt and have OnStar Turn - By - Turn directions to their destination waiting for them when they start the vehicle .
Additionally , the owner will also have the option to get voice - guided directions to their vehicle from their current location , using Google Maps Navigation .
The new functionalities wo n't be available on the Volt mobile app at launch , but are planned for a 2.0 version .
The smartphone mobile application for the Chevrolet Volt made its debut at the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show and is planned to launch in tandem with the Volt this fall .
Launch features include :
* Charge status display – plugged in or not and voltage ( 120V or 240V )
* Flexibility to " Charge Now " or schedule charge timing
* Display percentage of battery charge level , electric and total ranges
* Ability to manually set grid - friendly charge mode for off - peak times when electricity rates are lowest
* Send text or email notifications for charge reminders , interruptions and full charge
* Display miles per gallon , electric only miles , and odometer readings
* Shows miles per gallon , EV miles and miles driven for last trip and lifetime
* Remotely start the vehicle to pre-condition the interior temperature
" These two new features add to the suite of mobile application features for Volt that give Volt owners a personal connection to their car , " said Tony DiSalle , Chevrolet Volt marketing director .
" Connecting customers to their cars is one way we 're using technology to provide value and a real useful benefit to the Volt owner . "
'' If anyone can offer Bronto a new home they should get in touch .
The only problem is that it is a bit too big to post , so they will have to sort out how they get it home themselves . ''
— Carolina Hurricanes majority owner Peter Karmanos has hired Allen & Co. , an investment banking firm , to help sort out options in selling half his interest in the team , a source told 620 The Buzz Monday .
According to Forbes.com , the Canes franchise was valued at $ 177 million heading into the 2009 - 10 season .
Karmanos is not looking to give complete control of the franchise to a co-owner , but he will explore the options of having a 50/50 partner .
The Canes owner will look first for a North Carolina - based investor , then consider investors from outside the Triangle .
Tom Thewes , who was Karmanos ' business partner , passed away in September 2008 .
Since then , the organization has been looking for options to fill his role .
“ The intent is in no way to sell the team , said Hurricanes CEO / Owner / Governor Peter Karmanos .
" We simply hired Allen & Co. to assist us with the process of finding a new minority partner .
“ Given the Hurricanes ’ success as the only major professional team in a rapidly growing market , we feel confident that the results of this process can further strengthen our franchise ’s bright future . ”
As a franchise , the Hurricanes depend on season ticket sales and postseason play in order to make money .
When the team missed the playoffs this year after signing veteran players in the off - season , the idea of taking on a partner to bear the financial burden became a more viable idea for Karmanos .
Carolina also had a payroll that was near the top of the NHL salary cap this past season and has some tough financial decisions coming up with free agents and players on the roster .

Most of us have received a 419 scam in our mailbox at some time or another .
Forming part of what is also known as an advance - fee fraud , these emails typically ask the recipient for their help in transferring a large amount of money from a foreign bank account .
In return for their assistance , the recipient is purportedly allowed to keep a significant cut of the proceeds .
There are often some inventive background stories behind the origin of monies — some may involve a government or bank employee who is aware of a large amount of unclaimed money that they themselves cannot access directly .
Other common ruses are wealthy foreigners dying in a plane crash shortly after depositing lots of money in a bank , or even a dictator who has built up a fortune in stolen assets .
Most of us are wise enough to ignore these emails ; indeed , many are filtered away as spam before they even get a chance to be read .
But what happens when someone falls for this first part of a 419 scam ?
After the victim responds to the fraudster , how does he prove that the money really exists ?
In the case of the fictitious bank employee and his bank 's unclaimed fortune , one obvious ' proof ' is to supply the unwitting victim with the online banking username and password .
The victim can then log in to the online banking site and verify that there is , apparently , a lot of money in the pot .
Of course , the online banking site is entirely fake and does not contain any real money ; nor does it really allow the money to be transfered to other bank accounts .
A closer look at a real scam site
Every now and then , we stumble upon a scam site that reveals more information than the fraudster intended .
Sometimes this is caused by a configuration oversight , but more often than not , this is simply caused by limitations in the free hosting platform or compromised web space selected by the fraudster .
The Asterx Standard Bank is well documented as a 419 scam site .
One of its many instantiations was placed onto a free 50 webs hosting account , but the fraudster forgot to create an index page .
If it was n't already obvious from the poor web design effort , this makes it rather obvious that the site is fake :
Each webpage on this 419 site is a static HTML file , several of which display fake account details .
None of these pages requires authentication , which is clearly something to be suspicious of .
This is the page that the fraudster really wanted you to see , of course :
To add a bit of credibility to the fake login page , it even produces a popup window , warning the victim about identify theft :
After logging in with the top - secret credentials supplied to you by the fraudster ( which are of course unnecessary — any username and password will let you in ) , the account status page shows that the bank account does indeed contain a very healthy balance !
Also note the unauthorised use of the VeriSign logo , in an attempt to add some further credibility to the fraudulent site :
By this stage , the fraudster hopes you 'll be totally convinced that the money is real .
Perhaps convinced enough to transfer the money to your own bank account within 24 hours :
Naturally , transferring such a large amount of money can take a while .
This is an ideal moment to slip in a progress bar :
Even the most gullible victim would probably wait for the money to arrive in their account before forwarding a percentage of it on to the fraudster , so how does the fraudster expect to make money ?
The fake online banking application informs the victim that the account is on " de- active " mode , and a " Presidential Clean Source of Funds Clearance " is required in order to reactivate the account and have full access to transfer funds :
Undoubtedly , the fraudster will be able to offer the necessary funds clearance document — in exchange for an advance fee , of course .
Although this fee may seem very small in comparison to the 8 million dollars at stake , the prospect of getting access to those 8 million dollars could very well blinker a victim into going along with the whole implausible scheme .
This is likely to result in the loss of their advance fee , and perhaps anything else the fraudster can coax out of them .
So far , his efforts to find a new location for the base have not appeased Washington ; it initially demanded that Tokyo adhere to the original 2006 deal but has recently signaled greater flexibility .
The 2006 deal calls for moving the base from its current location , in the center of the city of Ginowan , to Camp Schwab , an existing Marine base in less - populated northern Okinawa .

The perception that Mr. Hatoyama has mishandled the relationship with the United States , Japan ’s longtime protector , has contributed to his falling approval ratings , which have dropped below 30 percent .
Opposition leaders and media commentators have begun calling on him to resign if he fails to find a compromise by the end of May .
While Mr. Hatoyama has remained tight - lipped about what his plan may look like , officials from his government have made repeated visits to Okinawa to sound out local leaders .
Okinawan politicians and the local news media have described the emerging plan as a modified version of the 2006 agreement .
They said the government was considering building a smaller airbase at Camp Schwab than under the 2006 agreement and moving at least part of Futenma ’s functions — most likely some of its training operations , and perhaps some of its helicopters — to Tokunoshima , a smaller island about 120 miles north of Okinawa .
Japanese news media have interpreted this proposal as a token gesture to appease Okinawans by moving at least some of the Marines off the island .
Okinawan leaders and local media reports have also said the government is considering constructing a new air base on an artificial island to be built off the Okinawan city of Uruma .
Japanese media reports have said the island could take decades to build and would serve as a longer - term home for the Marines .

The concept of peak oil , where the inaccessibility of remaining deposits ensures that extraction rates start an irreversible decline , has been the subject of regular debate for decades .
Although that argument still has n't been settled — estimates range from the peak already having passed us to its arrival being 30 years in the future — having a better sense of when we 're likely to hit it could prove invaluable when it comes to planning our energy economy .
The general concept of peaking has also been valuable , as it applies to just about any finite resource .
A new analysis suggests that it may be valuable to consider applying it to a renewable resource as well : the planet 's water supply .
The analysis , performed by staff at the Pacific Institute , recognizes that there are some significant differences between petroleum and water .
For oil , using it involves a chemical transformation that wo n't be reversed except on geological time scales .
Using water often leaves it in its native state , with a cycle that returns it to the environment in a geologic blink of an eye .
Still , the authors make a compelling argument that , not only can there be a peak water , but the US passed this point around 1970 , apparently without anyone noticing .
They make their case based on three ways in which water can run up against limits on its use .
The first is peak renewable water , for sources that rapidly replenish , like river basins or snow melt .
The classic example here is the Colorado River where , for most years since 1960 , essentially no water has reached the ocean .
Although actual water use is governed by a series of interstate and international agreements , these simply serve to allocate every drop of water .
Similar situations are taking place in other river basins , such as the Jordan .
The second is what they term peak nonrenewable water , as exemplified by the use of aquifers that replenish on time scales that make them closer to a finite resource .
( This issue is so well recognized that it has a Wikipedia entry . )
At the moment , the Ogallala and Central Valley Aquifers in the US , along with a number in China and India , are being drained at a rate that far exceeds their recharge .
Ultimately , usage will necessarily peak and start dropping , as it gets harder to get access to the remainder .
Eventually , these water supplies will tail off to something in the neighborhood of their recharge rate .
The final issue the authors consider is peak ecological water .
The gist here is that we 've accepted the elimination of the Colorado near its terminus .
For a wide variety of other water sources — think the Hudson or the Rhine — we'll never tolerate the equivalent .
This is because of the potential economic impact of eliminating the use of the waterway , and because we 're no longer likely to accept wiping out species that rely on the habitats created by the rivers .
Combined , these three peaks set a hard limit on the sustainable water use .
We can exceed them for a while , but we will eventually have to drop down to something near the limit , unless we 're willing to start paying substantially more for our water supply .
There are really two ways to do this .
The first is to simply make more of the water accessible that 's currently off limits .
So , for example , there are a lot of areas where we could change our habits of dumping industrial and municipal waste into the environment , and clean up the existing watershed in order to make that supply available for other uses .
The authors consider this analogous to what economists have termed a " backstop " technology for other finite resources .
For example , renewable energy acts as a backstop for fossil fuels .
Although some forms of renewable energy are currently expensive in comparison with fossil fuels , the latter 's scarcity will ultimately cause its price to rise until some the renewable backstops become competitive ; further scarcity will ultimately bring more backstops into play until use of the nonrenewable resource becomes negligible .
In an analogous manner , cleaning up existing renewable water sources acts as one backstop for the post - peak water scenario .
But , as the authors note , " the ultimate water backstop is still water . "
Long distance transport is still possible , as is large - scale desalinization , which currently is largely confined to island nations and the Mideast .
Is large - scale desalinization inevitable ?
The authors make the case that it 's not , based on the US .
Although they caution that water - use figures , which are notoriously fragmented , are n't entirely reliable , they use them to suggest that US water use roughly paralleled GDP growth for most of the 20th century .
The two separated around 1970 , as water use tailed off , peaking around 1975 .
After a short period of decline , water use has remained stable even as both GDP and population have continued to climb .
This pattern , the authors suggest , is a lot like what they expect peak water to look like .
And , if that really was the peak , the experience of the US might provide valuable lessons for economic planning .

The Diario de Centroamerica newspaper recently featured an article about the growing phenomenon of women forced to arm themselves due to the instability in Guatemala .
Reportedly , some 9,200 guns have been registered to women .
Digecam regulatory agency director Guillermo Mejia said that it is still a relatively uncommon occurence for women to register weapons , it is happening more frequently as women from all walks of life and socioeconomic sectors look to arm themselves for self - protection .
Many of the women who have purchased and registered firearms are small business owners who have found themselves victims of crime in the past .
Mejia says that while some women have taken advantage of professional training with to regards to how to fire their weapons , others have been shown how to use their new weapons by their husbands and sons .
But Rosario Escobedo , an activist with the Sector de Mujeres group , says that the upsurge in women purchasing firearms will do nothing to protect themselves , stressing that it is the duty of police officials and government authorities to ensure the safety of their citizens .
Unfortunately for many women in Guatemala , the protection of police is just not guaranteed .
From 2003 - 2008 the murder rate of women in the country more than doubled and in 2009 , 720 women were murdered .
Just last month , 40 women were victims of fatal violent acts .
Officials blame most of the violence on the increase of gangs and drug trafficking .
And in a country where only four percent of murders are solved , there seems to be good reasoning behind the uptick in the purchase of weapons for self - defense .

One of my favorite films is ‘ The Great Escape ” with its spectacular cast and haunting conclusion .
If you are unfamiliar with the film , it is based upon a true account concerning a POW camp especially built for Allied officers who were “ problematic ” ; that is , always escaping .
The audacity of their escape had wide effects , and is said to have helped with the D - Day landing , considering the escapees tied up a whole lot of soldiers trying to round them up .
Tragically , the majority of the escapees were executed upon capture in retaliation .
A largely unknown story is about to be told .
It is well chronicled in the book “ Colditz ” by Henry Chancellor ( among other books ) .
The town of Colditz is located approximately 150 km southwest of Berlin .
Prisoners , upon arrival , found it confusing .
Disembarking from the train , there was no camp .
They were marched from the station , through the village , up a hill and right into the courtyard of a large , gloomy castle .
They half expected to be executed .
Colditz Castle was built in 1014 and steadily enlarged until about 1694 when it comprised about 700 rooms .
It was used as a hunting lodge at times until 1824 when it was converted to an asylum .
In 1933 , it was converted into a labor camp for Hitler ’s communist enemies .
The structure looked extremely formidable .
It was situated on a rocky outcropping .
The outer courtyard housed the 200 or so Germans it took to maintain the place and the inner courtyard was used by the prisoners .
The outer courtyard had two exits .
One led over the moat into the town , the other into the forest .
The prisoner side was lined with a 100 foot cliff into a river .
Although this seemed terribly impregnable , one German officer mentioned , “ … apart from putting bars on the windows , it had never really been built for he purpose of keeping people in .
A more unsuitable place to hold prisoners will probably never again be chosen . ”
As with similar structures , the place was a labyrinth of tunnels and passageways , perfect for escaping “ bad boys ” .
Still it was n’t all tea and crumpets .
Before the influx of Red Cross packages , they were literally starving .
When the first Allied officers arrived in 1941 , there were over 100 Polish soldiers who were also termed “ bad boys ” .
During the war , the Polish and Russians were treated as subhumans by the Germans .
The Polish because they were conquered and technically had no country under the Nazi rule and the Russians because they never signed the Geneva Convention .
The prisoners were separated into nationalities and housed such .
There were Polish , British , French , Dutch , Indian , and so on .
There were more unsuccessful attempts than successful ones .
It is estimated that there was an escape attempt every 10 days during the four years prisoners were housed there .
The attempts were so many , that the Kommandant began an escape museum to train his men in finding and stopping as many attempts as possible .
The British war department was also helpful in these attempts , smuggling useful escape items into the camp in care packages .
The would hide compasses in walnuts or spools of thread , saws in shoelaces or combs , maps in wax phonographic records or in false walls of food tins .
They had secret codes and maps embedded in silk handkerchiefs that would develop when placed in water boiled with a certain yellow almond .
Blankets washed would reveal patterns for making civilian suits .
The possibilities were endless and it turned into a serious game to hide them from the Germans .
The first successful attempt was made by a Frenchman name Le Ray .
His attempt was fairly simple .
Two or three times a week , the officers were led down a zigzag path to a barb - wired area called the park .
On the way down they passed an unused building that was under construction .
The workers stored their tools in one of the rooms on the first floor .
On one of the walks , Le Ray , who had hidden some civilian clothes under his great coat , ran up the small bank and hid in the house while the zigzag shielded him from the guard following him .
After changing into his civilian clothes , which was dangerous considering you could be taken for a spy and shot , he made his way over 400 miles to the border and into freedom .
One officer , very young looking and small , was sewn into a mattress as it was being removed by some French orderlies .
His costume was that of a Hitler Youth .
He traveled quite far , even getting a ride with some soldiers until hunger drove him to the American consulate in Vienna .
From fear of loss of diplomatic status , he was turned away and betrayed ; directed to a police station .
The attempts became more audacious at time went on .
Another Frenchman Lebrun spent time running in the park to build up his legs .
When the day came , he was in his accustomed running outfit .
Using his friend as a catapult , he ran , stepped into his friend ’s cupped hands and leaped clear over the 10 ft wire .
Dodging bullets , he cleared another 8 ft wall and escaped .
Soon after he stole a bicycle and rode his way to the border .
His disguise , also to hide his awful German accent , was an Italian officer on holiday .
A few miles from the border , he ditched the bike and took the pump with him as a weapon .
Lebrun actually crossed into freedom twice .
Mistakenly , he crossed into Switzerland and then back out into Germany .
Retracing his path , he ran into a German police , who , for some strange reason , did n’t believe his Italian officer story at 6 a.m. in the morning near the Swiss border walking with a bicycle pump .
Lebrun knocked him out with the pump , took his pistol and made across the border again .
Enlisting the help of a passing village girl , he had himself arrested by the Swiss police .
Two weeks later the Kommendant of the camp received a letter requesting his personal effects .
In true British fashion , a theatre with stage was built and various plays were performed .
The soldiers put on full performances , growing out their hair and drawing hose on their legs to play female parts .
They were so convincing that a couple of them received invitations to the French officers ’ quarters for dinner .
In even truer British fashion , the stage and props were built on the promise that the tools would not be stolen or used for escape .
No one broke that promise ; they made their own tools .
Under the stage they cut a hole in the ceiling which opened into a locked room .
Picking the lock , they found that the adjoining hall led out into the German side of the camp near the main gates .
At the end of one play , they dropped down through the hole , picked the lock on the door , exited out into the German side of the castle .
Dressed as German officers , they marched out , even reprimanding a soldier for not returning their salute .
One attempt led 6 officers to make a hole leading from a German officer ’s office to an adjoining storeroom where they left the camp dressed as 2 German officers and 4 Polish workers .
Two successfully made it on that one .
Other attempts were made using disguises matching either German officers or frequent visitors to the camp .
Here is a side - by - side photo of the camp electrician and the POW dressed as him .
One day , while returning from the park to the castle , some British soldiers noticed that a passing lady dropped her watch .
The Brits , being all form and manners , picked up the watch and attempted to return it to the lady .
The German guards only thought it odd when the lady kept walking instead of retrieving her watch .
Upon inspection , it turned out to be a French officer decked out to look like a very respectable woman .
During the numerous attempts to escape , the three or four Appells ( roll calls ) a day could make or break an attempt .
If the Germans did n’t know you were gone , they would not send out the goon squad to find you .
The Dutch utilized the fact that they were just counted to give escapees more time .
One of the prisoners , an artist , sculpted two heads which were then dressed in a hat and long coat .
At roll call , the dummies were brought out and stood at attention with a pair of boots .
It worked fine until one day the dummy was told to dress right , which it did n’t .
The glider built in the attic .
The most outlandish attempt was never put into play as the war ended before it could be utilized .
A British aeronautical engineer designed a plan for a 2 man glider .
The prisoners built it in the attic of the castle chapel .
It was extremely light and was made with materials at hand : bedding , wooden bed slats , floor boards , electrical wiring .
It would be launched off a runway of tables using a bathtub full of concrete to provide the necessary acceleration .
The project was extremely well hidden using false walls , lookouts and an electric alarm system .
