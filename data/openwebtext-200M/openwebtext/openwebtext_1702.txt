Israeli commandos board the Mavi Marmara and are met by angry protesters wielding weapons .

In the blackness before the rising of a burnt - orange moon , all that could be seen of the Israelis around us were pin-points of light , as warships sitting a kilometre or more either side of the flotilla inched in - seemingly to squeeze the Gaza - bound humanitarian convoy .
Then , the tightening noose .
Sneaking up and around every boat , there were bullet - shaped hulks that soon became impossible to hide as the moonlight made fluorescent tubes of their roiling wakes .
First one , then two and maybe four could be seen sneaking in from the rear .
They hunted like hyenas - moving up and ahead on the flanks ; pushing in , then peeling away ; and finally , lagging before lunging .
But as they came alongside the Mavi Marmara , the dozen or so helmeted commandos in each assault craft copped the full force of the ferry 's fire hoses and a shower of whatever its passengers found on deck or could break from the ship 's fittings .
Suddenly , sound bombs and tear - gas were exploding on the main aft - deck , where prayers were held five times a day .
The lifejacketed passengers on the rails at first seemed oblivious as those behind them donned the few gas masks that were on board and others , wearing asbestos gloves , sought to grab the devices and hurl them back at the Israeli commandos - before they exploded .

In failing to get their grappling irons to hold on the rails of the five - deck ferry , the commandos in their assault craft continued to be an irritant , or perhaps a decoy because at this point the Israelis opted for a critical change of plan - if they could not come up from the water , then they would have to drop from the sky .
The death toll stands at nine of the ship 's activists with maybe 30 injured .
There were claims from some on the ship that some of their comrades were missing , unaccounted for since the battle at sea and the chaotic arrest and deportation by Israel of the estimated 700 activists on board the six vessels .
Four of the ships carried 10,000 tonnes of emergency supplies for Gaza , which Israel has kept under blockade since 2006 when Hamas , designated a terrorist organisation by Israel , the US and the European Union , won electoral control of the Palestinian Occupied Territories - and a year later , retained control of Gaza in the face of an Israeli and US - backed bid by forces loyal to Mahmoud Abbas , leader of the secular Fatah movement , to oust the Islamist movement from power in Gaza .
But the flotilla 's international coalition of Palestinian support groups - drawing funds from non-government organisations in Turkey , Malaysia , Ireland , Algeria , Kuwait , Greece and Sweden - is also determined to prove the Israeli blockade of Gaza as a western - backed exercise in collective punishment that will be maintained till Gazans turn on Hamas and not , as Tel Aviv claims , a policy that is vital to Israel 's security .
As distress flares launched from the ship cut through the steel - beam spotlights on Israeli helicopters hovering overhead , the first Israeli commandos who slithered down ropes from the choppers were easy pickings for activists who rushed the upper decks on hearing the machines moving into place .
At this stage , Challenger I 's British skipper , Dennis Healey , opted to gun the ship 's engines , hoping to break away from the Israelis swarming the rest of the flotilla .
The following account of what happened on the decks of the Mavi Marmara is based on interviews with activists while they and the Fairfax news crew , which accompanied the flotilla as non-participating observers , were held in an Israeli prison for more than two days and , on Wednesday , on board one of three aircraft sent to Israel by the Turkish government to ferry all the near - 700 captured activists to a rousing 4 am reception by tens of thousands of cheering Turks at Istanbul 's airport .
On hearing the helicopters , activists on the upper decks rushed to the top level of the ship - grabbing the commandos even before they landed , disarming them ; beating them till , according to some who were present , their leaders demanded that the Israeli 's not be harmed ; but in one case , one of the Israelis was hurled from one deck to the ship to the next .
There were conflicting accounts of the first commando's landing - some activists said he was injured and was being carried inside the ship for treatment by the flotilla doctors .
However , a Serbian cameraman , Srojan Stojiljkovic , said that some of the activists had armed themselves with lengths of chain and metal posts .
'' Some of the people caught the first commando before he touched the deck - a few started to hit him , but a lot of people moved in to shelter him with their bodies , '' the cameraman said .
'' Another soldier with a bleeding nose was brought in … a few people threw punches , but not as many as I would have expected . ''
Matthias Gardel , a leader of the Swedish Palestinian support group , confirmed that the soldiers had been beaten , but insisted that those involved were unarmed and that in keeping with the ship 's non-violent charter , the soldiers ' weapons were thrown overboard .
Soon after the soldiers had been treated , the injured and dead from among the ship 's passengers were brought in .
Mr Stojiljkovic said : '' Some were not badly wounded , but then a guy was brought in with a point - blank shot between his eyes - he was dead and I was told that another person was killed in the same way . ''
The Turkish actor Sinan Albayrak said he had witnessed one of the most senior of the Turkish activists ordering passengers to cease beating two of the Israeli soldiers .
Later , he saw a Turkish photographer who had been shot in the back of the head ; and while he and others had been attempting to assist another injured activist , Israeli troops had opened fire on them .
Mr Gardel said that the bulk of the passengers had remained in the second deck saloons and had not been involved in resisting the Israelis .
'' But a bunch of people tried to protect the bridge , the engine - room and the point from which we streamed the live video , '' he said .
Another activist , a Turk , lifted his shirt to reveal 10 puncture marks in a rough and black - bruised circle , about the circumferences of a tea cup , which he said had been inflicted when he was bitten by an Israeli security dog while assisting the Israelis as a translator .
The dead are believed to include Turkish journalist Chetin Genghis , whose head wounds suggested he had been shot from above - possibly from one of the Israeli helicopters .
Another of the dead was said to be an Indonesian cameraman , Sura Fachrizaz , who was shot in the chest .
Also among the dead was a Malaysian doctor who , activists said , was shot while treating the wounded .
The Mavi Marmara was captured by the Israelis in about one hour and 25 minutes .
As the 100 - plus reporters and other media workers on board followed orders to return to the ship 's press room , after being told by the captain that his vessel was now under Israeli control and that all resistance was to cease , many were crestfallen by a sense that an Israeli blanket of '' white noise ' ' had prevented them from getting the story out .

But then one of their number flicked the switch on a large flat - screen TV on the wall .
It burst into life with a Turkish channel , running the live - feed video that the ship had been transmitting to websites run by the Free Gaza Movement and the flotilla 's other sponsors - it was scenes of the Israeli takeover of the Mavi Marmara .
A resounding cheer went up .
■ McGeough and Geraghty were yesterday deported to Turkey after being detained in Israel for three days .

EA Sports Online scouting reports will let you know your opponents better than they know themselves .
Online scouting reports will let you know your opponents better than they know themselves .
I like to throw the curl route on first down in " Madden . "
Prefer to throw it to the receiver on the right side of the screen .
I have the timing down so perfect in my head that I can usually do it without looking .
Eight yards to open the drive .
As John Madden used to say , " Boom ! "
And it 's funny -- I know my tendencies and a couple of my best friends know what I 've been up to for years , but when I go online and play random people , that curl route is still always open .
But not for long .
With " Madden NFL 11 , " EA Sports is tracking your every play in order to deliver scouting reports to your online opponents .
So now , whether I 'm playing against a " Madden " vet in Sacramento or a newbie in Denver , all they need to do is order up my report and they 'll know my tendencies as well as the people I 've been playing " Madden " against since high school .
" Online scouting tracks all of your play calling and what you like to do in different situations , " producer Donny Moore says .
" We 're tracking every online game that you play : online ranked , unranked and ' Madden Ultimate Team ' head - to - head . "
And according to Moore , there are 10 situations the game is tracking : first down , second down and long , second down and medium , second down and short , third down and long , third down and medium , third down and short , fourth down , goal line , and red zone .
" On defense , the first thing you 're going to unlock is the run / pass percentage of your opponent .
The next thing you 're going to unlock is the field location , " Moore says .
" Where on the field does your opponent target in this given situation .
If it 's a run , it 's broken down into three zones : right , middle and left .
If it 's a pass , it 's broken down into more zones : right , middle and left , and then also short , medium and deep . "
The final thing gamers unlock on defense is the player - specific target :
Who does your opponent like to throw to or hand the ball off to in these certain situations .
" On offense , you 're going to be scouting the percentages on how often your opponent likes to play man or zone versus the blitz in certain situations , " Moore says .
" The other thing you 're able to unlock on offense is to view your own tendencies .
This adds to that chess match where you can see that on third down and short , you actually run the ball 87 percent of the time , and during those runs , I 'm running to the left 68 percent of the time .
So now that I know what I do , I 'm actually going to flip my play and run to the right because my opponent might scout me and know what I 'm doing . "
So now , not only will my opponent know about my curl route on first down , but I 'm reminded of that fact myself , leading me to change my game plan and maybe call a draw or even an out and up to catch my opponent off guard .
Says Moore : " By changing your game plan , it 's actually making you a better player . "
EA Sports
With one message , you know the chess match is on .
With one message , you know the chess match is on .
But how do you unlock these scouting reports ?
" Madden " producer Phil Frazier provides the details : " Scouting is a consumable .
So you earn coins in every online game that you play as long as you do n't quit or disconnect .
You can then spend these coins on scouting reports or other things within the game [ gamers also will be able to use real money to buy coin packs or scouting packs , but the prices are not final ] .
It 's the same economy that drives ' Madden Ultimate Team . '
So you can literally be playing ' Madden Ultimate Team ' online , earn some coins , then turn around and either buy a pack of cards or a scouting pack .
The economy drives a lot more this year than just ' Madden Ultimate Team , ' but we 're not talking dollars per scouting report here .
You 're earning these coins by playing ' Madden ' online , so this is n't a money - grab for us .
This is about building up your online skills .
We 're trying to provide a competitive advantage and we 're presenting it to you in a way that 's authentic to the sport of football . "
And to give gamers a taste of the strategy , everybody who buys the game new will receive 50 free scouting reports with purchase tied to the new EA Sports Online Pass initiative .
" When you total everything up , there are 45 different pieces of scouting report information that you could buy per game , " Moore says .
" Or you can just buy the full game purchase option before the game for just 25 coins so you can just have all the scouting before the game without having to buy every piece of information separately .
It 's a pretty good discount .
Then when you 're in - game , if a scouting report is available to be viewed , you just hit a button to activate . "
Adds Frazier : " What ultimately drove this feature was the hard - core , competitive , head - to - head gamer who wanted the ability , just like NFL coaches , to have a tool to understand what their opponents are doing .
And that 's why we 've focused this feature on online head - to - head and not carried it over to online franchise , which we feel is a more social aspect of gaming . "
As for how the new scouting works with " Madden 's " GameFlow play - calling system ?
Frazier believes the two work hand in hand .
" With GameFlow , you 're giving the A.I. the ability to choose for you , so maybe the statistic of pass versus run is n't as valid as the others , but even when a pass play is called , it 's up to you on how to execute that play , " he says .
" When we call out the primary receiver who is running a streak route , you can choose instead to throw to the receiver on the other side of the field who is running the corner route .
So the information on where the play is run , who is favorite target is , how deep he likes to throw , all of that information is very much relevant even though the play was called by GameFlow .
And since you can also audible out of GameFlow , we 're also tracking those plays that you 're calling .
There 's no way to circumvent the system , as we 're tracking the final result . "
EA Sports Viewing your own tendencies will help make you a better playcaller .
Viewing your own tendencies will help make you a better playcaller .
In addition , Moore sees the advantage coming from how online opponents like to constantly change playbooks .
" The computer does n't change his playbook , but online , gamers are always adapting , " he says .
" And just because you have the information on what your opponent likes to do , that does n't mean he 's going to do it .
It 's just some great , useful information that could help you gain that edge in your game .
And it 's cool , because when someone is scouting you , a pop - up appears on your screen that reads , ' You 've been scouted . '
So you know when somebody is watching you and it gets back into that chess game where he thinks you 're going left , so you throw a deep ball to the right when he 's least expecting it .
But to me , the scouting I find most useful is field location .
This lets you know if a guy likes to throw those screens and drag routes across the middle or if he likes to throw deep more often . "
" I agree , " Frazier adds .
" I was playing a game against [ ' Madden ' producer ]
Ian Cummings the other day , and when I play defense , I like to play safety , and the scouting enables me to cheat a little one way or the other .
But at the same time , Ian was using his own scouting to target places on the field he does n't usually throw to because he knew I was cheating my safety deep .
It really added an extra element to the game play .
" We have high hopes for this feature because of this .
Now if you 're being shut down , it 's not because of your stick skills .
It 's because you 're not calling a good game .
You wo n't be able to get away with calling the same plays over and over anymore .
It 's geared to make the average Joe play a more serious game of football and call the game more like a real coach . "
Looks like my days of first - down curl routes are coming to an end .
Then again , now that you know what 's coming , and you know that I know that you know what 's coming , you never really know what 's coming .
And that 's what playing " Madden " is all about .
Work on a reinforced , “ robust ” booming system for the St. Andrew Pass began yesterday morning after the Bay County Commission unanimously approved the plan at a special meeting Tuesday afternoon .
Crews are began driving the first of 18 42 - inch steel pilings and eight pile dolphins ( each consisting of three pilings attached together with a cap on them ) .
The pilings vary in length depending on the depth of the water , and extend at least 10 feet above the mean high tide level .
The boom is comprised of 30 - inch diameter , two - inch thick high - density polyethylene ( HDPE ) pipe and will have a 48 - inch long HDPE fabric weighted skirt hanging below the pipe .
In the middle of the channel , a 400 - foot hinged boom gate will allow for opening or closing the pass and diverting the oil products to the sides , where skimming vessels will be used on either side of the project to collect oil .
The hinged boom in the center of the pass will allow boat traffic to come and go with the outgoing tide and will be closed to traffic with the incoming tide , if oil is actively being removed from the area .

This a schematic of the plan .

“ One of the major lessons we ’ve learned , ” Bay County Public Works Director Ken Schnell said , “ is that the conventional booming to the west of us has been very difficult to maintain in open channels . ”
Bay County worked with AshBritt , a Florida - based disaster response company , to develop the rigid booming plan for the pass .
Bay County engineers as well as ocean and coastal engineers devised the plan .
The overall cost for the project is $ 2.8 million , with an operational and maintenance cost of $ 8,300 per day , Schnell said .
Assuming cooperative weather , it would take 24 days from tomorrow to complete .
Bay County has worked in concert with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , the U.S. Coast Guard , the Port Authority and other stakeholders to coordinate this plan .
Permit applications were submitted Friday , Schnell said .
“ We still anticipate that with a push from the Coast Guard , we should have a permit today , ” Schnell told the board .
“ We have the equipment in place to start driving pile . ”
The new , rigid booming plan evolved after various booming strategies to the west have not been sufficient , though funding the operation , for now , is coming out of county coffers .
Bay County Emergency Services Chief Mark Bowen said none of the state or federal agencies have given any negative feedback about the plan and he ’s optimistic that the county will be reimbursed .
“ Everything that can be done has been done , ” he said .
“ We may well see approval come well before we finish this project . ”
The Tier 1 , 2 and 3 booming plans will still be exercised , Bowen said , and up to 28 additional skimmers of varying types are available if necessary .
Is Macroeconomics Hard ?
" Math is hard , " said Malibu Barbie , famously -- and a ton of criticism came down on her for the implicit message that her auditors should go off and do other , easier , things instead and leave the math to the trained professionals .
Is macroeconomics hard in this sense ?
I confess that I do not think so .
I think that macro is pretty easy ... [ 1 ]
Let 's go back in time almost two centuries , to the days when -- first after the end of the Napoleonic Wars and then in 1825 - 6-- the nascent intellectual community of economists confronted the question of whether the circular flow of economic activity as mediated by the market system could break down and the economy become afflicted by a " general glut " of commodities .
There was no question that there could be a " glut " of particular commodities .
An example may make this clear :
Suppose -- this is Berkeley , after all -- that households decide that they want to spend less than they have been spending on electricity to power large - screen video and audio entertainment systems and more on yoga lessons to seek inner peace .
The immediate consequence -- within the " market day , " as late - nineteenth century British economist Alfred Marshall would have put it -- of this shift in preferences is excess demand for yoga instructors and excess supply of electric power .
Prices of electricity ( and of large - screen TVs , and of audio systems ) fall as unsold inventories pile up in stores and as generators spin down and stand idle .
Yoga instructors , by contrast , find themselves overscheduled , working ten - hour days , and stressed out -- and find the prices they can charge for their lessons going through the roof .
Workers in electric power distribution and in video and audio production and sales find that they must either accept lower wages or find themselves out on the street without jobs .
Over time the market system provides individuals with changing incentives that resolve the excess - supply excess - demand disequilibrium and restore the economy to equilibrium balance .
Seeing the fortunes to be earned by teaching yoga , more young people learn to properly regulate their svadisthana chakra and teach others to do so .
Seeing unemployment and stagnant wages in electrical engineering , fewer people major in EECS .
The supply of yoga instructors grows .
The supply of electrical engineers shrinks .
Wages of yoga instructors fall back towards normal .
Wages of electrical engineers rise .
And balanced equilibrium is restored .
Thus we understand how there can be a glut of a particular commodity -- in this case , electric power .
And we understand that it is matched by an excess demand for another commodity -- in this case , yoga instructor services to properly align your svadisthana chakra .
But can there be a general glut , a glut of everything ?
Some economists early in the nineteenth century said yes -- and that the economy was experiencing one , and that the fact that such " general gluts " could manifest themselves was a problem with the market system that economists needed to figure out how to solve .
Thomas Robert Malthus was the most prominent of those who protested .
He agreed that the then - fashionable economic theory said that a glut in one market had to be balanced by a surplus of excess demand in another .
But , he said , so much the worse for economic theory :
Malthus on Ricardo : [ A ] ccording to [ Ricardo's ] ... theory of profits ... the master manufacturers would have been in a state of the most extraordinary prosperity , and the rapid accumulation of their capitals would soon have employed all the workmen that could have been found .
But , instead of this , we hear of glutted markets , falling prices , and cotton goods selling at Kamschatka lower than the costs of production .
It may be said , perhaps , that the cotton trade happens to be glutted ; and it is a tenet of the new doctrine on profits and demand , that if one trade be overstocked with capital , it is a certain sign that some other trade is understocked .
But where , I would ask , is there any considerable trade that is confessedly under - stocked , and where high profits have been long pleading in vain for additional capital ?
The [ Napoleonic ] war has now been at an end above four years ; and though the removal of capital generally occasions some partial loss , yet it is seldom long in taking place , if it be tempted to remove by great demand and high profits ; but if it be only discouraged from proceeding in its accustomed course by falling profits , while the profits in all other trades , owing to general low prices , are falling at the same time , though not perhaps precisely in the same degree , it is highly probable that its motions will be slow and hesitating ...
Jean -Baptiste
Say defended the theory .
He wrote to Malthus claiming that theory was sound , and that the idea of a " general glut " was logically inconceivable :
Letters to Mr. Malthus : I shall not attempt , Sir , to add ... in pointing out the just and ingenious observations in your book ; the undertaking would be too laborious .... [ And ]
I should be sorry to annoy either you or the public with dull and unprofitable disputes .
But , I regret to say , that I find in your doctrines some fundamental principles which ... would occasion a retrograde movement in a science of which your extensive information and great talents are so well calculated to assist the progress ....
What is the cause of the general glut of all the markets in the world , to which merchandize is incessantly carried to be sold at a loss ?...
Since the time of Adam Smith , political economists have agreed that we do not in reality buy the objects we consume , with the money or circulating coin which we pay for them .
We must in the first place have bought this money itself by the sale of productions of our own .
To the proprietor of the mines whence this money is obtained , it is a production with which he purchases such commodities as he may have occasion for ....
From these premises I had drawn a conclusion ... “ that if certain goods remain unsold , it is because other goods are not produced ; and that it is production alone which opens markets to produce . ” ... [ W ] henever there is a glut , a superabundance , [ an excess supply ] of several sorts of merchandize , it is because other articles [ in excess demand ] are not produced in sufficient quantities ... if those who produce the latter could provide more ... the former would then find the vent which they required ....
You , on the contrary , assert that there may be a superabundance of goods of all sorts at once ; and you adduce several facts in favour of your opinion .
M. Sismondi had already opposed my doctrine ...
As the young John Stuart Mill put it , the core of the argument of Say , Ricard , and their school was that :
There can never , it is said , be a want of buyers for all commodities ; because whoever offers a commodity for sale , desires to obtain a commodity in exchange for it , and is therefore a buyer by the mere fact of his being a seller .
The sellers and the buyers , for all commodities taken together , must , by the metaphysical necessity of the case , be an exact equipoise to each other ; and if there be more sellers than buyers of one thing , there must be more buyers than sellers for another ...
Thus a general glut was as impossible as a square circle or a solid gas .
Yet Say changed his mind .
By 1829 , in his analysis of the British financial panic and recession of 1825 - 6 , Jean - Baptiste Say was writing that there could indeed be such a thing as a general glut of commodities after all : " every type of merchandise had sunk below its costs of production , a multitude of workers were without work .
Many bankruptcies were declared ... "
The general glut , Say wrote in 1829 , had been triggered by a panicked financial flight to quality which had led the Bank of England to shrink its liabilities :
The Bank [ of England ] , legally obliged to redeem its banknotes in specie ... [ t ] o limit its losses ... forced the return of its banknotes , and ceased to put new notes into circulation .
It was then obliged to cease to discount commercial bills .
Provincial banks were in consequence obliged to follow the same course , and commerce found itself deprived at a stroke of the advances on which it had counted , be it to create new businesses , or to give a lease of life to the old .
As the bills that businessmen had discounted came to maturity , they were obliged to meet them , and finding no more advances from the bankers , each was forced to use up all the resources at his disposal .
They sold goods for half what they had cost .
Business assets could not be sold at any price .
As every type of merchandise had sunk below its costs of production , a multitude of workers were without work .
Many bankruptcies were declared among merchants and among bankers , who having placed more bills in circulation than their personal wealth could cover , could no longer find guarantees to cover their issues beyond the undertakings of individuals , many of whom had themselves become bankrupt ...
What was going on ?
The answer was nailed by John Stuart Mill in that same year .
Mill 's explanation : there was indeed a " general glut " of newly - produced commodities for sale and of workers to hire .
But it was also the case that the excess supply of goods , services , and labor was balanced by an excess demand elsewhere in the economy .
The excess demand was an excess demand not for any newly - produced commodity , but instead an excess demand for financial assets , for " money " :
Although he who sells , really sells only to buy , he needs not buy at the same moment when he sells ... there may be , at some given time , a very general inclination to sell with as little delay as possible , accompanied with an equally general inclination to defer all purchases as long as possible ....
In order to render the argument for the impossibility of an excess of all commodities applicable ... money must itself be considered as a commodity ....
Those who have ... affirmed that there was an excess of all commodities , never pretended that money was one of these commodities ....
What it amounted to was , that persons in general , at that particular time , from a general expectation of being called upon to meet sudden demands , liked better to possess money than any other commodity .
Money , consequently , was in request , and all other commodities were in comparative disrepute ....
The result is , that all commodities fall in price , or become unsaleable .... [ A ] s there may be a temporary excess of any one article considered separately , so may there of commodities generally , not in consequence of over - production , but of a want of commercial confidence ...
How , exactly , should economists characterize the excess demand in financial markets ?
Where was it , exactly ?
That became a subject of running dispute , and the dispute has been running for more than 150 years , with different economists placing the cause of the " general glut " that was excess supply of newly - produced goods and of labor at the door of different parts of the financial system .
The contestants are :
Fisher - Friedman : monetarism : a depression is the result of an excess demand for money -- for those liquid assets generally accepted as means of payment that people hold in their portfolios to grease their market transactions .
You fix a depression by having the central bank boost the money stock .
Eliminating the excess demand for money also brings the goods and labor markets into balance and out of excess supply .
Wicksell - Keynes ( Keynes of the Treatise on Money , that is ) : a depression happens when there is an excess demand for bonds -- for ways of moving purchasing power from the present into the future .
The workings of the banking system lead the market rate of interest to be above the natural rate of interest which balances the supply of funds saved and the demand for funds to finance business investment .
You fix a depression by either reducing the market rate of interest ( via expansionary monetary policy ) or raising the natural rate of interest ( via expansionary fiscal policy ) in order to bring them back into equality .
Then , with no more excess demand for bonds , the goods and labor markets will also be back in balance and out of excess supply .
Bagehot - Minsky - Kindleberger : a depression happens because of a panic and a flight to quality , as everybody tries to sell their risky assets and cuts back on their spending in order to try to shift their portfolio in the direction of safe , high - quality assets -- which , of course , everybody cannot all do at the same time .
The excess demand is an excess demand for high - quality AAA assets in particular , not of money ( although outside money and some inside money are AAA assets ) and not of bonds ( some of which are AAA assets , but not all ) .
You fix a depression by restoring market confidence and so shrinking demand for AAA assets and by increasing the supply of AAA assets .
Eliminating the excess demand for high - quality assets is eliminated will bring the goods and labor markets out of excess supply and back into balance .
From the perspective of this Malthus - Say - Mill framework Keynes 's General Theory is a not entirely consistent mixture of ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) ...
Note that these financial market excess demands can have any of a wide variety of causes : episodes of irrational panic , the restoration of realistic expectations after a period of irrational exuberance , bad news about future profits and technology , bad news about the solvency of government or of private corporations , bad government policy that inappropriately shrinks asset stocks , et cetera .
Nevertheless , in this Malthus - Say - Mill framework it seems as if there is always or almost always something that the government can do to affect asset supplies and demands that promises a welfare improvement over , say , waiting for prolonged nominal deflation to raise the real stock of liquid money , of bonds , or of high - quality AAA assets .
Monetary policy open market operations swap AAA bonds for money .
Quantitative easing that raises expected inflation diminishes demand for money and for AAA assets by taxing them .
Non-standard monetary policy interventions swap risky bonds for AAA bonds or money .
Fiscal policy affects both demand for goods and labor and the supply of AAA assets -- as long as fiscal policy does not crack the status of government debt as AAA and diminish rather than increasing the supply of AAA assets .
Government guarantees transform risky bonds into AAA assets .
Et cetera ...
And then there are , of course , those who never read their John Stuart Mill of 1829 , and who never noticed that Jean - Baptiste Say in 1829 had retracted his 1803 claim that a general glut is impossible .
They continue claim that a depression is not an economic disequilibrium that can be cured by proper government policy at all -- but rather an economic equilibrium that can only be made even less pleasant by government intervention .
Think of Karl Marx , Friedrich Hayek , Ludwig von Mises , Andrew Mellon , Robert Lucas , et cetera .
This fraction maintains that in a depression there is no excess supply of goods and labor in any meaningful sense .
But , instead , they say :
goods and labor markets are in balance -- no government policy to raise employment and production is welfare - increasing -- it is just that technological regress has lowered the productivity of labor , and employment is low because real wages are low and workers would rather be unemployed ; or
goods and labor markets are in balance --- no government policy to raise employment and production is welfare - increasing -- it is just that workers have an increased taste for leisure that has raised their reservation wage , and employment is low because real wages are high and businesses would rather not hire ; or
goods and labor markets are in balance --- no government policy to raise employment and production is welfare - increasing -- it is just that previous overinvestment has given us a capital stock that is too large and misallocated , and employment is low because workers cannot quickly be redeployed into jobs in the consumption goods sector ; or
goods and labor markets are in balance --- no government policy to raise employment and production is welfare - increasing -- it is just that workers have mistaken nominal shocks for real shocks , and think that real wages are lower than they are because they misperceive the price level .
It is pretty clear that they are wrong .
Indeed , John Stuart Mill and Jean- Baptiste Say back in 1829 had pretty clear and convincing arguments that this no-disequilibrium fraction is wrong .
And Mill 's and Say 's arguments have not become less clear and convincing in the past 180 years .
I like this Malthus - Say - Mill framework .
I think that this framework allows me to at least characterize every position on our current macroeconomic dilemmas that I have heard -- like , for example , that the advocates of austerity are convinced that further debt issue by the U.S. government will crack the U.S.
Treasury bond 's status as a safe asset and thus increase , not decrease , the excess demand for AAA assets and increase , not decrease , the excess supply of recently - produced commodities and labor .
And it is not rocket science .
But it is , however , cutting - edge economics -- cutting edge for 1829 , that is .
[ 1 ] People who , along with me , took Olivier Blanchard 's Economics 2410 b course in spring 1983 will note how closely this tracks what Olivier was trying to teach us in the three classes -- the week and a half - - he spent on Lloyd Metzler 's " Wealth , Savings , and the Rate of Interest . "
( The only distinction Metzler is missing that I think is needed is the distinction between safe and risky bonds . )
And , of course , Edmond Malinvaud 's Theory of Unemployment Reconsidered
With the champions two games into their World Cup campaign the story so far reads : two games drawn , two goals conceded from set pieces and two goals scored from set pieces .
Many suggest there is a defensive frailty in this Italian defence , an area which has always been the team 's forte .
However , it is the latter statistic that is more worrying in that the Azzurri have yet to score from open play .
This year , for the first time in more than 20 years , Italy embarked on a World Cup journey without a natural trequartista .
Many argue that the role of the " classic No10 " has disappeared from the modern game but for Italy this position has always been paramount to its success .
In fact , more often than not the Italian national team has been spoilt for choice in this department .
Going as far back as the 1970 World Cup , Ferruccio Valcareggi was forced to use a policy referred to as staffetta , or relay , where he would give Sandro Mazzola and Gianni Rivera one half each .
In the 1990s Gianfranco Zola could not make the first XI as long as Roberto Baggio was fit and more recently Alessandro Del Piero and Francesco Totti were direct rivals for the role of fantasista .
So how does a country that has produced these creative players for so many years find itself in this situation ?
Italian football is clearly in transition at the moment and the development programmes at youth and Under - 21 level have failed to create a young talent in this role .
However , in Antonio Cassano and Totti , Marcello Lippi has opted to omit perhaps Italy 's most naturally talented attacking players still playing at the highest level .
It is well known that Lippi has never been a fan of Cassano but how ironic is it that on a weekend which was perhaps the happiest of Cassano 's life ( he married water polo player Carolina Marcialis ) the Italian national team experienced one of its darkest moments in recent history ?
Totti may have perhaps played himself out of the squad with that outrageous tackle on Mario Balotelli in the dying moments of the Italian Cup final .
Up to that point there was a general feeling that Lippi would call on Totti , one of his heroes of 2006 .
Some people feel that Totti would not have had the physical fitness required to play in a World Cup finals but anyone who watched Roma 's gallant attempt to grasp the title from the hands of Inter would have witnessed the prowess and guile of Er Pupone , the exact qualities that have been lacking in the Azzurri 's performances so far in South Africa .
So where does that leave Lippi for the remainder of the tournament ?
In the various formations that he has experimented with so far he has used Claudio Marchisio and Mauro Camoranesi in the role of trequartista , a position neither player is capable of playing .
The one ace up Lippi 's sleeve may be the return to full fitness of Andrea Pirlo , a player who actually started his career in an advanced midfield position before dropping into a deep - lying role and becoming such a pivotal player for Italy in 2006 .
Pirlo is possibly the only player who can deliver the killer pass that Italy have been lacking and , with Riccardo Montolivo and Daniele De Rossi functioning well in their midfield partnership , Lippi may well be tempted to use Pirlo in the role of trequartista .
If a solution to Italy 's lack of creativity is not found , unfortunately it looks like the fans could be holding up a sign that Roma fans regularly display when Totti is not available be it through injury or suspension : " No Totti , No Party . "
Channel
Ten has threatened to ban MasterChef fans from posting comments on its official program website in the wake of a backlash against unpopular contestant Joanne Zalm .
The Sydney mother - of - two has become the target of an online hate campaign with everything from her cooking skills to her looks and frequent outbursts of on - screen emotion coming in for criticism .
Some media reports claim even physical threats have been made against her on social networking sites including Facebook , where groups such as the " Get rid of Joanne Zalm fanclub " have been formed .
-------------------
MasterChef :
Who 's left ?
-------------------
" I hate her , " posted one of the group 's 1000 - plus members .
" Finally a place with like minded people , who are obvioulsy great judges of character [ can congregate ] ...
I despise her , her voice , the way she looks and especially the way she always passes the buck and refuses to take any blame for things not going right . "
Another wrote : " She bloody cried getting interviewed on 7 pm Project - you 've got 2 be kidding me !!!!! "
The bile has also spread to the show 's official website , from which Channel Ten has been forced to pull down abusive comments from fans .
A Ten spokeswoman said this morning that Zalm was " oblivious " to the outpouring , but was refusing requests for comment or interview on the subject .
In a statement , the network said it was doing as much as it could to limit the campaign .
" In environments where we have control , bad behaviour and toxic commentary , not in keeping with the positive spirit of MasterChef , is not tolerated , " it said .
" Master Chef is a family show and a family website .
We have always removed posts that are abusive and have taken an even harder stance in recent weeks . "
" We still encourage debate .
However all non-constructive personal abuse of contestants , judges and other users are removed and repeat offenders banned . "
Zalm , who is one of eight contestants still in the running , has been accused of unfairly dodging elimination on a number of occasions .
Ten this morning dismissed fan claims that Zalm was being kept on the show only to add to the drama .
" All contestants in the competition are here because of their passion , skill , talent and hard work , and each is deserving of their place , " the spokeswoman said .
Some fans have taken to Facebook to offer support for the maligned contestant , calling the criticism of her hurtful and " pathetic " .
Zalm , who has two daughters aged six and three , said she had considered entering Master Chef series one , but put it off because her children were too young .
" I have a lot of dinner parties but I 'm really harsh on myself , " she has said previously .
" People tell me my food is good , but I am my harshest critic .
I need MasterChef to hone my skills and find out if I really am good . "
Despite being slammed for constantly bursting into tears , she warned before the show began she would " cry a lot " at the thought of being separated from her family .
" When I 'm missing them , I see the eyes of my children in my head and it makes me really emotional , " Zalm , who grew up on a farm , said .
In episodes airing this week , contestants were flown to London to cook with a number of top international chefs including Jamie Oliver and Heston Blumenthal .
Competition favourites Marion and Alvin won last night 's challenge to recreate a signature Blumenthal dish called Sound of the Sea .
As sleeping disorders go , this may not be the worst one .
Sexsomnia patients report having initiated sex while sleeping .
Now scientists have provided a hint at the prevalence of this sleep sex .
Sexsomnia was reported by 7.6 percent of patients at a sleep disorders center , researchers report today .
Starting sex while asleep was more common in men ( 11 percent ) than women ( 4 percent ) .
Previous studies have found that some people — mostly men — occasionally initiate sex with a partner and reach orgasm during sleep .
They usually have no memory of such " sleep sex , " as some researchers call it .
They find out about it only if a partner tells them .
The results of the new survey of 832 people , all of whom had reported to a sleep disorder clinic and so do not represent the general population as a whole , are slated to be presented today at the annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies LLC .
" There have been no previous studies of how frequently sexsomnia occurs , " said co-investigator Sharon A. Chung in the department of psychiatry at the University Health Network in Toronto , Canada .
" While our finding of 8 percent of people reporting sexsomnia seems really a high number , it should be stressed that we only studied patients referred to a sleep clinic .
So , we would expect the numbers to be much lower in the general population . "
Unfortunately , the survey revealed , sexsomnia does not seem to replace other symptoms of poor sleep .
Symptoms of insomnia , fatigue and depressed mood were similar between people reporting sexsomnia and other patients at the sleep disorders center , Chung and her colleagues explained in a statement .
But there was a hint of what might be behind the initiation of intercourse while dozing :
Both groups ( sexsomniacs and other insomniacs ) reported smoking and consuming caffeine at similar rates .
But people who reported sexsomnia were twice as likely as other sleep center patients to admit using illicit drugs ( 15.9 percent vs. 7.7 percent ) .
Patients seem reluctant to talk about their late - night antics .
Patients rarely mentioned sexsomnia to their doctor , the survey showed .
Only four of the 63 sexsomniacs in the study had complained about it during a consultation with a sleep specialist .
" It seems that patients generally do n't discuss this with their doctors , " Chung said .
Sexsomnia appears to occur predominantly during confused states of arousal , experts say , and it may occur during an episode of sleepwalking .
Both disorders that are classified as " parasomnias , " which involve undesirable behaviors that occur while falling asleep , during sleep or while waking up .
At the 2007 Women Deliver conference in London , The Lancet put out a special edition with this message on the cover : “ Since the human race began , women have delivered for society .
It is time now for the world to deliver for women . ”
I envision a world where people , men and women together , will deliver for women , who will climb over the barricades in a nonviolent struggle for enormous change .
We have to make it happen .
We need a peaceful , purposeful , stubborn , and obstinate revolution .
Gender inequality is the greatest moral challenge of our age .
There has been a willful denial of girls ’ and women ’s full humanity by individuals , governments , religions , cultures , and customs .
We have to imagine a world where all people , men and women together , in equal partnership , with no artificial legal , cultural , religious , or economic barriers , work together for the greater good .
We must imagine a world where all people , regardless of their gender , are judged , as Dr. Martin Luther King might have said , only by the content of their character .
Nothing else is working .
To be pessimistic about the future is to be realistic .
With food , water , energy , environmental , climate crises present and looming , we need all human beings to be educated and motivated to demand long - term solutions that wo n’t be sacrificed on the altar of short - term and private gain .
Wow , would n’t that be revolutionary !
Envision a world where all female babies were welcomed as much as their male counterparts .
This would mean an end to sex - selective abortion , female infanticide , and neglect of the girl child .
This cultural shift would have enormous implications for both people and planet .
Envision a world where the education of all their citizens might be the first priority of governments .
Universal education as encompassed by Millennium Development Goals two and three would affect many more girls and women than men and boys .
The whole world is saying that girls ’ education is crucial .
Educated , literate girls value themselves , marry later , marry “ better , ” have fewer children , educate their children , and keep them healthy .
They become educated women who participate in their communities and are empowered to earn both income and respect .
Country - specific budgets must prioritize quality education for girls .
If this is done for girls , boys will benefit , too .
In important ways , education leads to health .
What if every girl and woman on the planet were given access to health ?
For instance , what if every baby were guaranteed to have a birth weight of seven to eight pounds and to be AIDS - free ?
That would give every baby a good start .
Imagine the revolution in health that this guarantee would imply .
It would imply a world commitment to every aspect of reproductive health .
It would imply that early marriage might disappear .
It would mean the end of female genital mutilation .
It would probably mean that every pregnancy was wanted , that prenatal care was universal , that every birth was safe , that obstetric fistula and maternal morbidity and mortality would disappear .
It would mean that family planning would be universally available , as promised in human rights documents — particularly at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo , Egypt , in 1994 .
The health benefits of family planning are so vast as to be almost invisible .
200 million women lack access to family planning .
The underlying cause of this dereliction of duty is gender inequality .
The Cairo Consensus has been more honored in the breach than in the implementation .
Fulfilling the Cairo Consensus to the letter would mean that the huge toll of unsafe abortion ( 70,000 deaths and 5 million injuries , hemorrhages , and infections every year ) would disappear .
The acronym PAC ( post- abortion care ) would disappear .
The fact that abortion remains illegal and that family planning remains controversial , especially in the developing world , results from gender inequality , from women ’s disempowerment politically and culturally , from enormous hypocrisy on the part of power structures , and from , in my view , the pernicious influence of certain religious persuasions .
When the world takes care of women , women take care of the world .
We have to envision a world that takes care of women .
Let ’s be honest — for once !
Africa is on a path toward a humanitarian disaster .
Its population , if present predictions hold true , will nearly double by 2050 , from 1 billion to 2 billion people .
Women do most of the work in Africa , and men make most of the decisions .
Forty percent of Africa ’s children are undernourished .
If maternal mortality is a measure of the African continent ’s well - being , then Africa fails .
If infant and child mortality are measures of health or lack thereof , then Africa fails .
Africa does not take care of its women .
Beyond Africa , the countries of the world that are the most unstable and have the highest misery index , and whose people are the most poverty - stricken , the least educated , and the least healthy , are those where women ’s status is low .
On February 28 , 2010 , on the eve of the two - week session of the 45 - member U.N. Commission on the Status of Women , Thoraya Obaid , executive director of the United Nations Population Fund , said , “ We ca n’t continue to pay lip service to gender equality . …
World leaders should not just say they are committed , but must prove their commitment with tangible allocations of budgets and people … .
When men and women have a respectful relationship in which they recognize each other as equal partners , men will benefit as much as women . ”
That is the whole point .
Gender equality would achieve enormous tangible benefits for people , the planet , and peace .
I do not believe that change will come from the top without pressure from the bottom , from the grassroots , from both women and men .
Media attention to this profound issue is the key to mobilizing world opinion .
Come on , CNN !
Stop twittering and dithering .
Come on , Bono .
Write us a song .
Come on , peoples of the world !
Ponder the prophetic words of Stephen Lewis , the UN special envoy for HIV / AIDS in Africa : “ I challenge you …to enter the fray against gender inequality .
There is no more honorable or productive calling .
There is nothing of greater import in this world .
All roads lead from women to social change . ”
And those of the late Dr. Allan Rosenfield , a world - renowned champion of women : “ It is not enough to know for the sake of knowing .
We have the responsibility to act on what we know .
Acting on knowledge is an imperative .
And that imperative we can truly delight in . ”
At 3:00 a.m. on the morning of July 23 , 2002 , I lay in my bed lamenting how Colin Powell had sold his soul the day before by announcing that the George W. Bush administration was not going to release $ 34 million to the United Nations Population Fund — for what I knew to be totally spurious reasons .
After all , the whole world knows that UNFPA takes care of the world ’s women .
My thought was to ask for one dollar from 34 million Americans .
It was time for me to take a stand .
I envisioned , and still do envision , that 34 million people — not only Americans , but people from around the world who hear about 34 Million Friends — would eagerly comply .
Grassroots at its purest and finest !
The world is out of balance , careening toward an uncontrollable unknown .
Gender equality in education , health , and the opportunity to contribute to family , community , and world is at the very core of any acceptable future .
So I repeat :
We need people , men and women together , who will deliver for women , who will climb over the barricades in a nonviolent struggle for enormous change .
We need a peaceful , purposeful , stubborn , and obstinate revolution .
Envision gender equality .
Make it happen .

The system could close the loophole that redirects web users to fake sites
Moves to make the web 's address system more secure will take a major step forward next month .
In the planning for a decade , the Domain Name System Security Extentions , DNSSEC , will help protect users from cyber attacks such as phishing and spam .
The security layer will be added to the web 's address system in July .
It should close the loophole that allows hackers to intercept DNS data and redirect users to fake websites .
The Domain Name System ( DNS ) was created in 1984 to allow computers to ' read ' net domain names but it had no security features , offering rich possibilities for criminals .
" DNSSEC will improve the security of the web so we can have more confidence in the activities on the network as it increasingly becomes part of our working lives and home lives , " said Leslie Daigle the chief internet technology officer at the Internet Society , which is the home of the standards body that developed DNSSEC .
The new security extension , DNSSEC , basically works by using cryptography and digital signatures to verify each query and ensure that each response that is made has not been compromised or intercepted .
Cyber - criminals are increasingly using false DNS servers to intercept legitimate web addresses and redirect users to fake sites , which steal personal information .
" It acts like tamper - proof packaging to make sure if you type in the website name of your bank that you actually get to the machine that your bank wants you to use and not to a machine that looks like that of your bank but is operated by those who want to take you to a different website to steal your log - in details , " said Ms Daigle .
' Security puzzle '
The reason this move is being seen as a " technological milestone " in shoring up the web is because , although not visible to most users , DNS is an essential part of the way the internet works .
It acts as the net 's address system or phone book by translating website addresses like www.bbc.co.uk into the numerical equivalents preferred by machines .
The DNSSEC protocol is being overseen by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( Icann ) , which is the administrative body behind net addresses .
It is working with domain - name registrars and root nameservers - which are at the heart of translating web addresses into IP addresses - to make sure the process runs smoothly .
However Ms Daigle told the BBC , DNSSEC cannot solve all the evils perpetrated by cyber - criminals and best practices that people have been using should not be abandoned .
" It is a piece of the security puzzle and while it does build better security around everything people are doing on the internet , users should not become lax in how they protect themselves online , " she said .
Revolutionary
One of the greatest critics of the security of the Domain Name System has been Dan Kaminsky , chief scientist at security firm Recursion Ventures .
In 2008 he went public with a flaw that he found in the DNS which meant the internet was at the mercy of phishing gangs who could redirect internet users to fake banks sites to steal their personal information .
This issue became known as the " Kaminsky bug " and is often referred to as cache poisoning .
Mr Kaminsky told the BBC that even though he was initially sceptical of the efficacy of DNSSEC , he has examined the code carefully and has become a recent convert having declared it " awesome " in its ability to provide a " safer and more secure internet " .
" The basic flaw of the internet is one of trust and this will revolutionise the way we use the internet .
" In my mind the biggest benefit we will get concerns one of the biggest embarrassments in the security sector and that is secure email where it will be truly possible to know that when you get an email from your bank , it really is your bank , " said Mr Kaminsky .
The Internet Engineering Task Force 's Ms Daigle agreed and called DNSSEC " an essential building block for building a larger internet future " that will allow us to take on " bigger activities and carry out new applications " .

Thanks to the invention of an animal - loving art student , little Hoppa can easily move around , even without front legs .
Hoppa , a 4 - year - old mixed breed dog , from Tel - Aviv , israel , has received a very special gift , created especially for him .
This adorable pooch was born without his front legs , and even though his owner , Avi Kuzi , showed him all the care and affection , he had trouble moving around .
But most of his problems were solved by a wheeling device custom made for Hoppa , by an art student , who hopes his invention could ease the life of pets born with abnormalities , or with amputated limbs .
This is great , but dogs like Faith – the biped dog do n’t need such contraptions .

It is one of the tools used by governments to filter out unwanted information and to prevent the spread through the World Wide Web .
It is a phenomenon of staggering proportions that affects over 25 % of the global population .
According to the latest data released on OpenNet Initiative and Reporters Without Borders 12 are the countries which have adopted a form of Internet censorship at a pervasive or substantial level .
China , with a population of over 1.3 billion people and 360 million active users of the Internet is by far the nation in which the censors ’ activity affects the highest number of citizens , followed in their list by Iran , Vietnam and Egypt .
It is striking to note that based on these figures , approximately 1.72 billion people are affected by the Internet censorship : a significant information which corresponds to 25.3 % of the planet population estimated to be 6.79 billion people .
Moreover , in many cases , the censorship is not limited to filter the information accessible via the web but it also becomes a tool used by governments to fight their opponents .
As reported byReporters Without Borders China , Vietnam , Iran , Syria , Egypt and Burma ( Myanmar ) are the countries in which censorship is applied as a form of repression .
China leads these sad standings with 72 netizens imprisoned , followed by Vietnam ( 17 ) and Iran ( 13 ) , Syria ( 4 ) Egypt and Burma ( 2 ) .
No data is available for North Korea .

A £ 500,000 public dialogue over GM food could be abandoned after a second member of the steering group overseeing it resigned , the government 's independent food watchdog said today .
The Food Standards Agency , which had been commissioned by the Labour government to gauge the public mood on growing and eating the controversial foods , said that it would ask the coalition government if it should continue with the dialogue .
" There has been a major change in government , " said Nathalie Golden , a spokeswoman for the FSA .
" It will need to be presented to ministers .
It depends on the new government whether it goes ahead . "
Professor Brian
Wynne , the vice - chair of the 11 - person steering group , today became the second member to resign in the past eight days .
Wynne , an academic specialist on public engagement with science , said in a letter to the group that the planned consultation was biased in favour of the technology and was little more than propaganda for the industry .
He accused the FSA of having adopted a " dogmatically entrenched " pro-GM position and said that the dialogue could become a " public mistrust generator " .
He was also heavily critical of FSA chair , ex-Labour minister Lord Rooker , who has described the public 's sceptical position on GM food and crops as " anti-science " .
His resignation follows that of Dr Helen Wallace , director of the thinktank GeneWatch UK who resigned last week in protest at the FSA 's links with the agri-chemical industry which has been lobbying strongly to allow GM foods to be used more widely .
She alleged that some of the contractors being considered to run the project were already working for a major biotechnology company in order to " position the company as a positive force " .
" It has now become clear to me that the process that the FSA has in mind is nothing more than a PR exercise on behalf of the GM industry , " she said .
" In my view , this would be a significant waste of £ 500,000 of taxpayers ' money .
A process that was barely credible has become a farce .
" Taxpayers ' money should not be wasted on a PR exercise for the GM industry . "
Pete Riley , director of GM Freeze , a coalition of environment groups opposed to GM foods , said : " The GM public dialogue is now in chaos .
" The coalition government needs to look very seriously at how the FSA is attempting to use the dialogue process to gather information on what the public thinks about GM so they can the use it to manipulate public opinion in a pro-GM direction .
" This would be a gross misuse of public funds , and ministers need to put a stop to it .
" The FSA is far too close to industry on this issue , which is a deep disappointment for an organisation that was set up as an independent regulator and food safety champion for the public just 10 years ago . "
But Golden said there were are no plans to delay the dialogue because of the resignations .
" The steering group is now in the process of identifying an organisation which might carry out the dialogue , " she said .
" Once the steering group is in a position to suggest a body to do this , it will make a recommendation to the FSA board .
" The board will then ask ministers , before contracts are signed , whether the GM dialogue should proceed .
" The agency is completely independent .
It is not at all a front for industry .
We will all be considering the implications of these resignations . "
Few chefs rave about having bugs in their business .
But Myk Banas , the executive chef and director of food and beverage operations at the Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile , dotes on the hotel ’s rooftop hives of honey bees .
“ Getting honey from your roof is about as localvore as you can get , ” said Banas .
“ Ninety - five percent of what we serve – from curing bacon to pastas – is made here .
It was n’t that much of a stretch to get into making honey . ”
The project started in early 2009 as part of an experiment by Banas and the hotel ’s management to expand on their in - house herb garden .
Their goal : to grow their local food production , have access to fresh honey and , perhaps , boost the population of pollinating bees in the Windy City .
After speaking with city officials , Banas said he learned that Chicago had no specific ordinances that prevented beekeeping projects from being set up .
( Mayor Richard M. Daley , who has been a proponent for “ greening ” Chicago , seems to have a fondness for such projects :
Hives of Italian honeybees have been housed in a corner of City Hall ’s rooftop garden for years . )
So last spring , the hotel brought in a beekeeper and set up two hives on an empty stretch of the ninth floor .
By the time winter arrived , Banas and his staff had 205 pounds of honey to use in pastries , meat glazes and other edible products , including their Rooftop Honey Wheat beer .
Some of the sweet – and pricey – stuff is even bottled and sold :
Two ounces goes for $ 5 a bottle .
This year , Banas said they ’ve doubled the number of hives – and currently have about 100,000 honey bees up and buzzing .
And what about the stinging ouch - factor of dealing with bees ?
Banas said it 's not really a problem .
" Honestly , a far bigger concern is to protect the hives from the cold when winter arrives , " Banas said .

The future looks bleak
Kenya has been losing 100 lions a year for the past seven years , leaving the country with just 2000 of its famous big cats , says the Kenya Wildlife Service ( KWS ) – which concludes the country could have no wild lions at all in 20 years .
Conservationists have blamed habitat destruction , disease and conflict with humans for the population collapse .
But Laurence Frank , a wildlife biologist at cat conservation group Panthera , thinks the KWS estimate is optimistic .
“ Lions are disappearing so fast from Kenya , as well as the rest of Africa , that I think they will disappear [ from Kenya ] in less than 10 years if action is not taken very quickly , ” says Frank , who runs several lion conservation projects in the country .
The IUCN suggests that large lion populations of 50 to 100 prides are necessary to conserve genetic diversity and avoid inbreeding .

Leo horror scope
Frank says that the decline of the big cats is due to the inexorable growth in human population and consequent conflict with people over livestock , rather than disease .
“ Vast areas of Kenyan rangelands that held lions 20 years ago are now devoid of nearly all wildlife , ” Frank says .
“ Predators have been poisoned and speared , herbivores have been snared for meat , and the rangelands themselves have been destroyed by massive overgrazing by domestic stock . ”
According to Nicholas Oguge , who works for environmental charity Earthwatch Institute in northern Kenya , people lace cattle corpses with insecticide in order to poison entire prides .
This ends up killing hyenas and birds of prey too .
“ In Kenya , the biggest threat to lion conservation lies outside protected areas , ” says Oguge .
“ This is because of increasing cases of poisoning by communities due to livestock loss through carnivore depredation .
Typically , the communities use the insecticide Furadan by applying it on livestock carcasses . ”
Bribes and trophies
Those who kill lions illegally are rarely punished , says Frank .
Killing tends to occur far from the influence of authorities and conservationists .
In the rare cases of arrest for lion killing , Frank says that the accused may secure their release by the payment of small bribes .
Even the animal - welfare groups that seek to protect lions from trophy hunters may be unintentionally placing them at risk .
Sport hunting is banned in Kenya , which has allowed lions to fare better there than in most other parts of Africa , but the prohibition could also contribute to their eventual demise .
“ Under current policy , there is no way for rural people to benefit from wildlife , ” says Frank .
“ They get essentially no income from tourism , and the only other potential source of wildlife income – carefully regulated , high - paying trophy hunting – is prevented by the financial influence of American and British animal - rights lobbies . ”
Research by the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago and KWS suggests that on average each lion eats livestock worth around $ 270 a year .
“ On the other hand , given the size of Kenya ’s tourist industry and the central importance of lions to tourist satisfaction , each of Kenya ’s 2000 surviving lions may be worth upwards of $ 17,000 per year in tourist revenues , ” says Bruce Patterson , curator of mammals at the museum .
The fact that Kenya is suffering a devastating drought is n’t helping matters , says Zeke Davidson of the University of Oxford .
“ Kenya is experiencing a very severe drought at the moment and this is driving ever - increasing numbers of pastoralist communities into wildlife areas in search of grazing and water supplies for their herds of livestock , ” he says .
“ Large herds of unattended cattle have been reported forming in northern Kenya , moving toward Ethiopia , ” Davidson adds .
He says they have been abandoned by their owners , who have gone in search of refuge from the drought further south .
Across the continent , the future looks bleak for lions .
“ Only drastic action on many fronts – policy change , effective law enforcement , giving rural people an economic stake in their natural heritage , and a great deal of investment – will prevent the loss of wildlife in Africa , ” concludes Frank .

Hey all , Talton here .
Rob ’s just a hair busy – so you ’re stuck with me !
We just wanted to drop a quick post to let everyone know where we are with the big bad ‘ Phone - A - Day Give Away ’ contest we have going .
So far we have picked winners for days 1 - 6 , and congrats to them !
All they need to do is send a PM to Rob on the forums to get things sorted .
Winners # 7 and # 8 ( for the past couple days ) will be announced tomorrow .
We ’re down to 16 to choose from for # 7 , and have yet to look at # 8 .
As you know Phandroid.com and Androidforums.com have had some greater than minor technical issues today .
We do have a few issues lingering and Rob is workin’ his tail off to get these resolved ASAP .
Partly due to these difficulties – and partly due to our debate on whether or not to put a ….twist .. on the contest ( wink wink ) – the contest is temporarily suspended .
Again , winners # 7 and # 8 will be announced tomorrow – but the contest itself is officially on hold .
Do n’t let that stop ya from making reviews though !
For the sake of anticipation , here are the finalists for # 7 :

Thank you for your patience while we work to restore everything back to order .
We hate this as much as you do , I promise !
Put all the peppers in a large frying pan over a medium heat with a little olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper .
Place a lid on , and cook slowly for 15 minutes until softened .
Do n’t rush this too much , as cooking the peppers slowly like this really helps to bring out the flavour .
Add the onion and cook for a further 20 minutes .
Then add the garlic and parsley stalks and toss around , keeping everything moving in the pan .
Cook for about 3 minutes more .
Have a little taste , and season with a bit more salt and pepper .
Add the vinegar – it will sizzle away , so give everything a good toss .
Then add one handful of the grated Parmesan and the mascarpone or crème fraîche if you are using it and turn the heat down to minimum while you cook the pasta .
Another day , another infomercial playing on men's hair - loss insecurities .
I think it 's time we came out and said : this is an industry for men , by men :
I have known a lot of men who were obsessed with losing their hair .
They monitored hairlines , they studied the manes of maternal ancestors with rapt attention , they applied Rogaine .
And in every single one of these case , their wives or girlfriends did n't care nearly as much .

Yes , biologically , I guess everyone likes lustrous , shining mops .
Certainly we like our POTUS to have a full head , just as they have to be unusually tall .
Says one Dr. William Rassman ,
History has shown that when men got sick ( tuberculosis over the course of human history ) they lost hair and died early , so when selecting a mate , women picked men who had good hair , because in the search for a husband they could not have a man would would die on them ( not good for long term futures and babies ) .
This had a great deal to do with prejudice against balding men .
Men when they are in their 20s do n't yet have enough confidence in their manhood , so losing hair seems to exacerbate the balding problem .

If you believe this theory , thank the those creepy TB tests for female indifference to hairline .
I did a little Internet sleuthing , expecting to turn up all kinds of shallow dames declaring that they would n't date bald men , but even in the wilds of the web , this did n't seem to be the case .
" hair is nice , but when it comes down to it , women respond to personality , " wrote one commenter to a 35 - year - old considering a hair transplant on an answers site .
" bald head , schmald head .
we do n't care , " said another .
" be a nice guy and do n't cheat .
that 's what we like . "
Several mentioned Bruce Willis , Patrick Stewart , and Jason Statham .
And yet , to read the code on men's hair - growth commercials , every man is a Samson whose " confidence , " potency and youthful vigor are directly tied to his locks .
Sure , it 's an industry , and like a lot of industries , it plays on insecurities .
But I think it 's up to us as women to help change this perception and spike the advertisers ' guns a little .
People are going to feel the way they feel , and clearly , for many men , this is a sensitive issue .
But men are the ones obsessed with hair - women's and their own - and much as society might try to project male thinking onto us , we 've frankly got other things to worry about .

Enlarge By David McNew , Getty Images Consumers Union studied non-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans because they cover one in three Americans with private insurance .
Non-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans stockpiled billions of dollars during the past decade , yet continued to hit consumers with double - digit premium increases , Consumers Union found in an analysis of 10 of the plans ' finances .
Insurers must keep surplus money to ensure they can pay policyholders ' medical bills if unexpected market conditions develop .
Yet seven of the plans examined held more than three times the amount regulators consider the minimum needed to do that , according to a report being released today by the non-profit consumer group .
" Consumers are struggling to afford health coverage , " said report author Sondra Roberto .
" Those funds could be used in some cases to mitigate these rate increases . "
The report calls on state insurance regulators to scrutinize surpluses when considering rate increases and set maximum limits for surpluses .
In most states , it said , regulators focus only on ensuring companies have minimum surpluses to be financially sound .
CALIFORNIA : Blue Cross nixes big premium hike , cites bad math HEALTH PLANS : Insurers focus on patient choices Alissa Fox , a senior vice president at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association , said this is a " dangerous " time for regulators to limit health plans ' surpluses because of great uncertainty about how insurance costs will change under the nation 's new health law .
" It 's a safety net , " she said .
Consumers Union studied non-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans because they cover one in three Americans with private insurance .
Examples cited in the report include : • Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona : A $ 717.1 million surplus in 2009 , seven times the regulatory minimum .
The plan raised rates for individual market customers by as much as 18 % in 2009 .
Company spokeswoman Regena Frieden said : " We believe the amount we have in reserves is appropriate . " • Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oregon : A surplus of $ 565.2 million in 2009 , about 3.6 times the regulatory minimum .
The plan raised rates on some individual plans an average of 25.3 % in 2009 and 16 % in 2010 .
Spokeswoman Angela
Hult said the company lost money on its individual policies and that the surplus is " essential to protecting our members from surges in claims costs . "
Regulating surpluses is a difficult balancing act because keeping plans financially sound is critical , regulators said .
Each plan has different surplus risks and needs depending on its members .
Oregon Insurance Division administrator Teresa Miller , whose office considered Regence 's surplus and limited its request for a higher 2010 rate hike , said : " The tough question is how much surplus is too much surplus .
There is no agreement on that . "
The Oregon Legislature last year gave state regulators the explicit authority to consider a company 's surplus when it reviews rates — a tool Miller said her agency had sought since 2007 .
A report on the agency 's website charts how surplus levels have risen since 2001 .
In Michigan , a law caps the surplus of the state 's Blue Cross Blue Shield plan at five times the regulatory minimum .
Insurance Commissioner Ken Ross said the state 's Legislature wanted to give the insurer flexibility but also protect consumers against the possibility the plan could hold too much money in its surplus funds .
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan has rarely neared the limit and usually is about halfway between the minimum and maximum .
" It seems to have worked relatively well , " Ross said .
The company insures more than half of the people in Michigan , Ross said , so it 's critical it have enough capital to remain financially sound .
" Their health in many ways goes to the health of the entire health care system in Michigan , " he said .

A 20 - city protest was staged Wednesday to condemn BP Oil and the growing environmental disaster caused by that massive oil spill .
The so - called " Seize BP National Day of Action " was at the " eco-friendly " BP gas station on Olympic Boulevard .
in West Los Angeles .
The demonstrators are calling on the government to seize BP assets to pay for all the damages and losses caused by the spill .
" We 're calling for a federal government seizure of BP 's assests to pay for all the environmental damge , personal losses and untold consequences of their oil spill , " said Ian Thompson , a spokesman for the group Answer Coaliton .
More than 200,000 gallons of oil a day continues to spew into the Gulf of Mexico .
“ Free Enterprise ” is Not Free Enterprise
According to Allison Linn , a writer for the website of the liberal MSNBC Network , the usual suspects in the corporate economy are engaged in a major rebranding effort ( “ Capitalism ?
Yuck !
But free enterprise ?
Yes ! ” July 21 ) .
It seems they ’ve figured out that Americans , as measured by polls and focus groups , tend to react negatively to the word “ capitalism . ”
“ Free enterprise , ” on the other hand , is right up there with motherhood and apple pie .
So the Texas Board of Education voted to replace textbook references to “ capitalism ” with “ free enterprise . ”
And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has eliminated “ capitalism ” from its propaganda in favor of “ free enterprise . ”
According to James E. MacDougald , of The Free Enterprise Nation , “ There ’s been a demonization of the word ‘ capitalism ’ ….
It ’s been used so often by people … who are anti-corporate or anti-business that they ’ve , I think successfully , created the idea that capitalism and greed are the same thing , where free enterprise is n’t greedy but capitalism is greedy . ”
But the choice of the term “ free enterprise ” is just a transparently lame attempt to polish a … well , you get the idea .
The problem is that these people are still defending the present system of corporate capitalism that made them rich — and it ai n’t free enterprise .
Every single awful thing about the present corporate economy that Americans react to negatively when they hear the word “ capitalism ” is at the heart of how the dirtbags in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , who love to toss around the words “ free enterprise , ” actually make their money .
What the Chamber of Commerce means by “ free enterprise ” is exactly the same thing that people like Naomi Klein and Michael Moore are attacking under the name of “ capitalism . ”
As a result , most people hear the words “ free enterprise ” and “ free markets ” emanating primarly from the same interests that want to protect the system as it is , and that depend most heavily on the suppression of the free market for their livelihood .
No wonder establishment libertarianism has such negative “ pot- smoking Republican ” connotations for so many people .
Believe it or not , though , there are some of us on the free - market left who genuinely believe in free enterprise , and who see truly freed markets as the enemy of corporate capitalism .
Far from seeing the Robber Baron capitalism of the Gilded Age as some laissez - faire utopia , we see it as the beginning of a corporate - state system of power which has lasted for 150 years , upheld by massive collusion between big government and big business .
The primary function of the state during that time has been to subsidize the operating costs of big business and to protect it against competition .
And the interests that talk the most about “ free enterprise , ” generally speaking , are the very ones most tightly hooked into the corporate state .
A genuine free enterprise system , without state - enforced artificial scarcities , artificial property rights or subsidies , would be like dynamite at the foundations of corporate power .
It would be an economy of far more evenly distributed property ownership and decentralized production , looking a lot more like something imagined by Ralph Borsodi than by Alfred Chandler .
So I ’d love to issue a challenge to those “ free enterprise ” hucksters in the Chamber of Commerce :
Let ’s have genuine “ free enterprise , ” and let ’s have it now .
That means repealing the DMCA , WIPO Copyright Treaty , drug patents , and all other “ intellectual property ” law — and telling the RIAA , MPAA and Microsoft where to get off .
It means cutting the automobile - highway complex , the military - industrial complex and agribusiness off from the taxpayer teat .
It means eliminating all regulatory barriers to the competitive issue of low - interest credit through mutual banks , against people ’s own property or their future earning power .
It means ceasing to enforce all absentee titles to vacant and unimproved land .
And it means an end to an American foreign policy whose main goal is to make the entire planet safe for corporate power .
My guess is that this is the kind of free market that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce would get Katherine Harris and James Baker to stage another coup to prevent .

NEW YORK --
The imperfect game stands .
An umpire 's tears and admission he blew a call failed to move baseball commissioner Bud Selig to award Armando Galarraga the perfect game he pitched .
The play and its aftermath quickly became the talk of the sports world and beyond , even to the White House .
Selig said Thursday that Major League Baseball will look at expanded replay and umpiring , but did n't specifically address umpire Jim Joyce 's botched call Wednesday night that cost Galarraga the perfect game -- 27 batters up , 27 batters down .
No hits , no walks , no errors .
A baseball official familiar with the decision confirmed to The Associated Press that the call was not being reversed .
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because that element was not included in Selig 's statement .
Joyce said he erred on what would 've been the final out in Detroit , when he called Cleveland 's Jason Donald safe at first base .
The umpire personally apologized to Galarraga and hugged him after the Tigers ' 3 - 0 win , then took the field at Comerica Park on Thursday in tears .
Tigers manager Jim Leyland picked Galarraga to present Detroit 's lineup at home plate before Thursday 's game to set up the emotional meeting with Joyce .
They shook hands , and the umpire gave the pitcher a pat on the shoulder .
" I did n't want this to be my 15 minutes of fame .
I would have liked my 15 minutes to be a great call in the World Series .
Hopefully , my 15 minutes are over now , " Joyce said .
Bad calls are part of the mix in sports , witness the many mistakes last October in baseball 's postseason .
But something about this one -- the chance to right a wrong , the heartfelt emotions of everyone involved -- reached way past the lines .
" I 've got to say we 'll never see it again in our lifetime , " New York Yankees manager Joe Girardi said .
Galarraga , who was barely known outside Detroit before this week , and Joyce , whose career had flourished in relative obscurity , became hot topics on Twitter .
At least one anti-Joyce Facebook page popped up and firejimjoyce.com was launched .
Wikipedia blocked editing to the umpire 's page .
Joyce , a longtime ump with a solid reputation , declined comment on MLB 's statement after Thursday 's game , saying he had n't read it .
" There 's no doubt he feels bad and terrible , " Galarraga said after Detroit beat Cleveland 12 - 6 on Thursday .
" I have a lot of respect for the man .
It takes a lot to say you 're sorry and to say in interviews he made a mistake . "
" I 'm sad , but I know that I pitched a perfect game .
The first 28 - out perfect game , " he said .
Denied the 21st perfect game in history , the record third this season and the first for a Detroit pitcher , Galarraga still got a prize .
The Tigers and Chevrolet presented him with a new Corvette .
Opinions poured in from all over , on both sides .
" I was thinking if the umpire says he made a mistake on replay , I 'd call it a no-hitter , perfect game .
Just scratch it , " St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said Wednesday night .
" If I was Mr. Selig , in the best interest of the game , the guy got it and I 'd give him his perfect game . "
To others , rewriting sports history would open a Pandora 's Box -- what happens in an instant must live forever .
" It 's in the books and , unfortunately , that 's the way it goes , " fan Jim Qualter said at Fenway Park .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said : " I hope that baseball awards a perfect game to that pitcher . "
Told that MLB was not going to reverse it , he joked , " We 're going to work on an executive order . "
Gibbs praised the way Galarraga and Joyce reacted to a play that will define their careers .
" I think it 's tremendously heartening to see somebody understand that they made a mistake and somebody accept the apology from somebody who made that mistake , " he said .
" I think that 's a good lesson in baseball .
It 's probably a good lesson in Washington . "
Tweeted actress Alyssa Milano : " Personally , I agree with Selig on this one .
Part of the game ( as it is played now ) is human error . "
Selig regularly consults some of baseball 's greatest players , such as Hall of Famers Hank Aaron and Frank Robinson , before making big decisions .
Other senior officials and advisers also have input .
The umpire who made perhaps the most infamous call of all thought Selig got it right .
Don Denkinger 's missed call in Game 6 of the 1985 World Series -- like Wednesday night 's play , it involved a pitcher covering first base -- helped cost the Cardinals a chance to clinch it .
St. Louis later lost to the Kansas City Royals .
" No , you can't change it , " Denkinger told the AP in a telephone interview .
" It was Jim 's call , and it 's got to go down that way . "
" You can't run from it , it 's a part of life , " he said .
In 1991 , a panel headed by then - commissioner Fay Vincent took a look at the record book and decided to throw out 50 no -hitters for various reasons .
None of them , however , involved changing calls made on the field .
The NFL , NBA , NHL and the NCAA all employed some form of replay before baseball started trying it late in the 2008 season , limiting its use to questionable home run calls .
On Wednesday night , hockey twice turned to replay to review possible goals in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals .
" Baseball being traditionalists , I guess they do n't want to go that way , and that 's fine by me .
For us , it works out great , " Chicago Blackhawks center John Madden said .
Added Philadelphia goaltender Michael Leighton : " Obviously , baseball 's wishing they had it and the guy in Detroit wishes they had it . "
Los Angeles Angels manager Mike Scioscia was among those who opposed additional replay in the majors .
" I think there 's too many plays that are close that could possibly be up for review , and I think it would become dysfunctional , " he said .
Soccer remains the biggest sport that wants no part of replay , which could become a focal point when the World Cup starts in South Africa later this month .
Replay is a popular part of Grand Slam tennis , and the man who designed the Hawk - Eye system said it could work in baseball , too .
" All decisions in baseball could be resolved definitively and accurately without causing delay to the game , " Paul Hawkins wrote from Britain in an e-mail to the AP .
" In my view , the main benefit of using technology in sport is that you want the story after the match to be about the contest and the players , not about the officials , " he said .
" If you want to make artificial stories out of ' creating controversy , ' then you do n't have much faith in the sport . "
To Hawkins , there are several challenges to a sport deciding to rely more on electronic -- and not human -- eyes .
" Most governing bodies are made up of former players and do not have anyone with a technical knowledge to have an understanding of what is technically possible , " he said .
A planet about eight times the mass of Jupiter has been confirmed to orbit a Sun - like star that 's some 300 times farther from its own star than Earth is from its sun .
The newly confirmed planet is the least massive planet known to orbit at such a great distance from its host star .
The discovery , first reported in September 2008 , was made using high - resolution adaptive optics technology at the Gemini Observatory .
These latest results , published in the Astrophysical Journal , were led by David Lafrenière of the University of Montreal Department of Physics and a researcher at the Center for Research in Astrophysics of Quebec .
The suspected planetary system required further observations to confirm that the planet and star were indeed moving through space together .
" Back in 2008 what we knew for sure was that there was this young planetary mass next to a young Sun - like star , " says Lafrenière .
The extreme proximity of the two objects strongly suggested that they were associated and not just aligned by chance .
" Our new observations rule out this chance alignment possibility , and thus confirms that the planet and the star are related to each other , " says Lafrenière .
With its initial detection by the team using the Gemini Observatory in April of 2008 this object became the first likely planet known to orbit a sun- like star that was revealed by direct imaging .
At the time of its discovery the team also obtained a spectrum of the planet and was able to determine many of its characteristics , which are confirmed in this new work .
" In retrospect , this makes our initial data the first spectrum of a confirmed exoplanet ever , " says Lafrenière , adding the images show water vapor , carbon monoxide and molecular hydrogen in the planet 's atmosphere .
David Lafrenière , along with René Doyon and Christian Marois , received the 2009 NSERC John C. Polanyi Award for capturing the first - ever image of a planetary system outside of our own solar system .
Greenland is situated in the Atlantic Ocean to the northeast of Canada .
It has stunning fjords on its rocky coast formed by moving glaciers , and a dense icecap up to 2 km thick that covers much of the island -- pressing down the land beneath and lowering its elevation .
Now , scientists at the University of Miami say Greenland 's ice is melting so quickly that the land underneath is rising at an accelerated pace .
According to the study , some coastal areas are going up by nearly one inch per year and if current trends continue , that number could accelerate to as much as two inches per year by 2025 , explains Tim Dixon , professor of geophysics at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science ( RSMAS ) and principal investigator of the study .
" It 's been known for several years that climate change is contributing to the melting of Greenland 's ice sheet , " Dixon says .
" What 's surprising , and a bit worrisome , is that the ice is melting so fast that we can actually see the land uplift in response , " he says .
" Even more surprising , the rise seems to be accelerating , implying that melting is accelerating . "
Dixon and his collaborators share their findings in a new study titled " Accelerating uplift in the North Atlantic region as an indicator of ice loss , " The paper is now available as an advanced online publication , by Nature Geoscience .
The idea behind the study is that if Greenland is losing its ice cover , the resulting loss of weight causes the rocky surface beneath to rise .
The same process is affecting the islands of Iceland and Svalbard , which also have ice caps , explains Shimon Wdowinski , research associate professor in the University of Miami RSMAS , and co-author of the study .
" During ice ages and in times of ice accumulation , the ice suppresses the land , " Wdowinski says .
" When the ice melts , the land rebounds upwards , " he says .
" Our study is consistent with a number of global warming indicators , confirming that ice melt and sea level rise are real and becoming significant . "
Using specialized global positioning system ( GPS ) receivers stationed on the rocky shores of Greenland , the scientists looked at data from 1995 onward .
The raw GPS data were analyzed for high accuracy position information , as well as the vertical velocity and acceleration of each GPS site .
The measurements are restricted to places where rock is exposed , limiting the study to coastal areas .
However , previous data indicate that ice in Greenland 's interior is in approximate balance : yearly losses from ice melting and flowing toward the coast are balanced by new snow accumulation , which gradually turns to ice .
Most ice loss occurs at the warmer coast , by melting and iceberg calving and where the GPS data are most sensitive to changes .
In western Greenland , the uplift seems to have started in the late 1990's .
Melting of Greenland 's ice contributes to global sea level rise .
If the acceleration of uplift and the implied acceleration of melting continue , Greenland could soon become the largest contributor to global sea level rise , explains Yan Jiang , Ph.D. candidate at the University of Miami RSMAS and co-author of the study .
" Greenland 's ice melt is very important because it has a big impact on global sea level rise , " Jiang says .
" We hope that our work reaches the general public and that this information is considered by policy makers . "
This work was supported by the National Science Foundation and NASA .
The team plans to continue its studies , looking at additional GPS stations in sensitive coastal areas , where ice loss is believed to be highest .

MEMORANDUM **
Baiyin Wang ( " Wang " ) , a native and citizen of China , petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals ( " BIA " ) dismissing her appeal from an immigration judge 's ( " IJ " ) decision denying her application for asylum , withholding of removal , and relief under the Convention Against Torture .
We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252 .
Reviewing the IJ's and BIA 's adverse credibility findings for substantial evidence , Soto - Olarte v. Holder , 555 F.3d 1089 , 1091 ( 9th Cir. 2009 ) , we deny in part and dismiss in part Wang 's petition for review .
The adverse credibility findings are supported by substantial evidence .
The IJ concluded that Wang lacked credibility because , inter alia , Wang claimed that she sold her soda factory in China because the police were harassing her for practicing Zhong Gong , while Wang 's sister testified that Wang sold the factory because of her poor health .
Wang was unable satisfactorily to explain this contradiction , asserting simply that her sister was wrong .
The inconsistency goes to the heart of Wang 's claim of past persecution .
The IJ provided a specific , cogent reason for the adverse credibility finding .
See Goel v. Gonzales , 490 F.3d 735 , 737 , 739 ( 9th Cir. 2007 ) ( per curiam ) ( upholding an adverse credibility finding where the petitioner 's testimony concerning the severity of the persecution was contradicted by documentary evidence and the petitioner 's only explanation for the inconsistency was that the documentary evidence " was wrong " ) .
In light of the IJ 's supportable adverse credibility finding , the evidence does not compel us to reach a result contrary to that of the IJ on the issues of asylum and withholding of removal .
Nor does the entire record compel us to order relief under the Convention Against Torture .
See Kamalthas v. INS , 251 F.3d 1279 , 1280 ( 9th Cir. 2001 ) ( holding that defeat of asylum claim on credibility grounds does not necessarily preclude relief under CAT ) .
The petition for review accordingly is denied with regard to these claims .
1 See Don v. Gonzales , 476 F.3d 738 , 741 ( 9th Cir. 2007 ) .
We lack jurisdiction to consider Wang 's claim that she was denied due process in her hearing due to an incompetent translator , because Wang failed to exhaust this contention before the BIA .
See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d ) ( 1 ) ; Huang v. Mukasey , 520 F.3d 1006 , 1008 ( 9th Cir. 2008 ) ( per curiam ) .
Thus , the petition for review is dismissed with regard to this claim .
Today we thank the Southeastern Conference for reminding us it ’s almost college football season , when big - time educational institutions hit the “ hold ” button on their ethical standards and all but light candles daily in hopes that their school does not end up at the top of the N.C.A.A. enforcement police blotter .
This year , many of those hopes have already been extinguished and what was originally called the S.E.C. ’s “ Media Days ” have officially been renamed the “ Blame Everything on Those Dastardly Agents Days . ”
It was a bit priceless  pun intended  that Alabama Coach Nick Saban ( annual salary : $ 4 million ) went on the offensive Wednesday , bemoaning how money is ruining this quaint little sport .
He compared the agents to pimps and said they were victimizing his poor children ( players ) .
Saban was joined in this particular rant by Florida Coach Urban Meyer ( annual salary : $ 4 million ) .
What spawned this frantic finger - pointing , writes Pat Forde of ESPN.com , is a rash of reports that prominent S.E.C. players were entertained by agents at a South Beach soiree .
Georgia , not coincidentally , just received notice from the N.C.A.A. that its enforcers will be stopping by for a not - so - friendly visit .
This , writes Jeff Schultz of the Atlanta Journal Constitution , is causing the coaches to suddenly get religion on the agent issue .
As Gregg Doyel does a very good job of articulating on CBSSports.com , they are worried mostly because the N.C.A.A. showed it is finally ready to deal with the agent issue after years of ignoring it .
The University of Southern California ’s stiff penalties are the N.C.A.A. ’s evidence of that .
So it was a bit disconcerting , writes Dennis Dodd on CBSSports.com , to hear S.E.C. Commissioner Mike Slive sounding Mike Garrett - like when he called for “ education not enforcement ” on the agent issue , that it might be time to talk about allowing players to sign with agents whenever they want .
Everyone , it seems , would like to wash their hands of any responsibility and The Sporting News ’s Dan Levy wrote that some of the blame should fall on those “ kids , ” players who are actually adults and should know better .
A judge in Sydney 's Federal Court ruled that the band must relinquish the royalties , a sum that is expected to total several hundred thousand dollars , although an exact amount has not been specified to Larrikin Music , which owns the rights to Kookaburra .
The figure is not expected to reach into the millions , because , under Australian law , compensation only dates back to 2002 .
In their headlong dash toward a lockout that threatens the 2011 season , NFL owners have made a series of five dramatic moves that erase any doubt about their strategy .
• They attempted to persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to adopt a radical new rule of law that would have eliminated the antitrust leverage the players ' union used to obtain free agency and other important benefits ;
• They agreed to extensions of their television contracts that require the networks to pay the league billions of dollars even if there are no games to broadcast during a work stoppage ;
• They included lockout clauses in coaches ' contracts that will eliminate their salaries during a lockout ;
• They hired attorney Robert Batterman , the New York lawyer who led the NHL owners through a lockout that killed the entire 2004 - 05 hockey season ;
• They persuaded Troy Vincent , a former president of the players ' union , to join the NFL staff in an apparent effort to split the union membership .
The first of these maneuvers -- the case known as American Needle vs. NFL -- ended in a stunning 9 - 0 defeat for the owners as the high court adopted an argument offered by the Obama administration and its then - solicitor general ( and current Supreme Court justice - designate ) Elena Kagan .
The decision preserved the players ' legal option to decertify their union and attack the league in antitrust cases as any lockout begins .
The opinion by retiring Justice John Paul Stevens ended the owners ' effort to eliminate the legal rights that have allowed the players to achieve enormous increases in bonuses , salaries and benefits in antitrust cases filed by Freeman McNeil and Reggie White in the early '90s .
So far , that 's the only setback the owners have experienced .
But now , their second maneuver -- the move involving broadcast deals -- is in similar legal jeopardy as the result of a fiendishly clever attack on the league 's TV contracts led by players ' union chief DeMaurice Smith and the union 's lead attorney , Jeffrey Kessler of the law firm of Dewey & LeBoeuf .
The stakes in this legal proceeding are nearly as high as they were in the American Needle case .
The players ' challenge to the television contracts is a dramatic counterattack to the owners ' lockout plans , and it's the latest chapter in the players ' efforts to preserve and build on the advances they made in the McNeil and White litigation .
The union 's case begins with a pact between the owners and the players known as the " White Stipulation and Settlement Agreement ( SSA ) , " a detailed set of bargains and partnerships that have governed the league during its phenomenal growth over the past 20 years .

The centerpiece of the SSA is a complicated formula that allows the owners and players to share the league 's revenues , designed to allow both sides to thrive as the league grew into what the Sports Business Journal says is " the strongest entertainment programming vehicle in North America . "
The most significant of NFL revenues , of course , is television .
Each of the league 's 32 teams shares equally in TV income , with most of it going each year to player payroll .
Although the players have an obvious interest in the NFL 's television deals , the union is not part of the bargaining process between the league and the networks .
But in a series of SSA provisions that the players insisted be included ( and that now appear to be prescient ) , the players received written promises from the owners that they would " act in good faith and use [ their ] best efforts to maximize total revenues . "
Recognizing that their salaries were coming from television contracts , the players even demanded and obtained the owners ' commitment in the SSA to not engage in any " agreement or other transaction " that would " serve the purpose of defeating or circumventing " the owners ' duty to obtain maximum income to be shared with the players .
In a now critical provision , the players made sure that the owners were obligated to act only in " good faith " and " fair dealing " in anything they did while the agreement is in effect .
These provisions are now the key to the players ' attack on the NFL 's extensions of it broadcast contracts .
In TV deals made while the SSA has been in effect , the players contend , the owners failed to obtain the maximum revenues the agreement requires .
Instead of using remarkable increases in television ratings to extract greater fees from the networks , the players assert , the owners accepted less money in return for payments during a lockout .
In the letter that initiated this legal proceeding last week , Kessler states that the owners , in their efforts to set up a lockout , " knowingly left money on the table during the SSA 's term at the expense of the players . "
In 2007 , Troy Vincent , left , was the president of the NFLPA and a close confidant of Gene Upshaw .
Now Vincent works for management .

With the SSA still in effect ( it expires in March 2011 ) , Kessler says , the league made deals with DirecTV , NBC , CBS and Fox that gave the networks valuable rights to online streaming of games and highlight packages but resulted in no new income to be shared with the players .
The NFL did not negotiate an extension of its contract with ESPN because the eight - year pact will remain in effect through 2013 , according to ESPN executive vice - president John Wildhack .
" Our deal was always for eight years .
The others were for six years .
So there was no need to extend our contract . "
Asked whether the ESPN contract contained a requirement that ESPN pay during a lockout , Wildhack replied , " I have no comment on that . "
Instead of using the new broadcast rights to earn new income , the union says , the owners settled for payments during the potential 2011 lockout season , payments that will not be shared with the players .
In the league 's new TV contracts , the owners " accepted less revenues during the SSA 's term in exchange for a guaranteed revenue stream that the NFL could use for its sole benefit during any lockout in 2011 , " according to the players ' letter demanding action from Stephen Burbank , the " special master " who decides disputes that develop under the SSA .
The owners and the players are meeting and negotiating on other issues -- including the length of the season -- even as they begin this battle over the $ 4 billion in TV contracts .
At this stage of the bargaining , though , those meetings probably amount to little more than going - through - the - motions developments .
With the CBA expiring , both sides must agree to negotiate even if the negotiations are perfunctory .
If one side refuses to meet , the other side can accuse it of bad faith .
The more important factor right now in the future of the league is the players ' attack on the TV contracts , their most serious response yet to the owners ' preparations for a lockout .
That legal maneuver is dramatic evidence that union chief Smith and the players are ready for an epic battle .
If Smith and the players are right about the owners and their lockout - based TV contracts , it may be considered the most egregious violation of player rights since the baseball players ' union caught MLB owners colluding on free agency in the mid-'80s .
One of the owners ' five moves toward a lockout , the U.S. Supreme Court gambit , has ended in defeat .
The television contracts move is now in jeopardy , with a decision expected during the 2010 season .
But the other three maneuvers remain in place .
If there is any doubt anywhere about the gravity of a season - killing lockout possibility , the doubt disappears when you see the players say in their legal documents that the owners are " prepared to lockout the players in 2011 and beyond . "

Risky Bonds business
It appears that federal prosecutors in San Francisco are deciding to accept a 2 - 1 appeals court ruling issued against them last week in their prosecution of perjury charges against Barry Bonds .
Instead of asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to reconsider the decision " en banc " -- which would allow a panel of 11 judges to review the decision made by the first three judges in the appeals court -- the prosecutors will push for a trial , possibly in the fall .
As Solicitor General , Elena Kagan helped convince the Supreme Court to reject the NFL's argument in the American Needle case .

If that 's the prosecutors ' final decision , there is one individual who will not be happy : Judge Carlos Bea , who wrote a powerful , 36 - page dissenting opinion that explains how the prosecutors could succeed in presenting positive drug tests and logs to the jury that decides whether Bonds lied to a grand jury investigating his use of performance - enhancing drugs .
Bea , 76 years old and a star on the Cuban basketball team in the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki , was harsh in his criticism of the ruling that bars the government from using the drug tests and the logs .
His dissent offered a detailed road map around the steadfast refusal of Bonds trainer Greg Anderson to testify on the authenticity of the documents .
The key to Bea 's assertion that the documents are permissible evidence is the fact that Anderson was acting as Bonds ' " agent " when Anderson obtained vials for blood and urine , gave them to Bonds and his physician , and then quickly took the samples to BALCO for testing .
Anderson , Bea notes , was paid for this and other work and was doing all of it with Bonds ' permission , support and authority .
Bea relies on an impressive grasp of the evidence gathered in the BALCO investigation and a masterly synthesis of the law that applies to the situation .
He uses previous cases from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and authoritative material from a definitive statement of American law known as a " restatement . "
Reading Bea 's opinion , there is little doubt that he is laying the foundation for an appeal to a larger group of judges ( the " en banc " appeal ) that , if successful , would give government prosecutors an overpowering array of evidence against Bonds .
What will the prosecutors do ?
If Bea is right in his analysis of the applicable law , then the U.S. Department of Justice may want to use his dissent as the basis for the en banc reconsideration .
If the appeal were successful , it would become a major weapon in other prosecutions in which a witness such as Anderson refuses to cooperate with the authorities .
If they ignore Bea 's invitation to further appeal of the 2 - 1 ruling , they may have some uncomfortable moments in their next court appearance before him .

MORE COMMENTARY »
“ On Melancholy Hill ”
The album I listened to for this review is Plastic Beach by the Gorillaz .
I did not listen to the iTunes Deluxe Edition , because frankly I ’ve been putting off listening to this album for too long , and at 56 minutes I think I have all I need to form some opinions on the album .
As an aside , this is a disturbing trend I see in the digital music age : artists making multiple ( deluxe ) versions of their albums .
If the Gorillaz and Apple wanna make some extra bills selling B - sides , I have no beef with that , but an album should have a set number of tracks .
That ’s what an album is , a number of songs that have been put together in a certain order that makes each song better because of its place within the album .
Inclusion of these songs in a “ deluxe edition ” just cheapens the whole experience .
I think an interesting way to think about Gorillaz is the way in which this project has evolved over the years .
( Speaking of years , this is the third Gorillaz album in nine years , and it ’s been five years since Demon Days … when you could n’t have the radio on more than 10 seconds without hearing “ Feel Good , Inc . ” )
If you can remember back to the first Gorillaz release , you may recall that the group was made up of four fictional characters : 2D , Russell , Murdoc , and Noodle .
On that album there were two real - life contributors credited ( you may remember Del tha Funkee Homosapien for the vocals he provided on “ Clint Eastwood ” ) .
The reason I point this out is that Gorillaz at that point was more alternative , and less hip - hop and electronic .
Plastic Beach , according to Wikipedia ( this is my blog , I ’ll cite Wiki if I want ) has about 30 guests featured on the album .
Some of these are for the orchestral introduction , but the album also includes appearances by Snoop Dogg , Mos Def , and De La Soul .
Gorillaz , on this album , trade memorable vocals and rock hooks for synth bass and … more synth .
Listening to this album , I could n’t help but feel like this sound is tailor - made to be played in clubs .
Doing my listening and writing of music reviews , I ’m laying on the couch , about as far from a club atmosphere as humanly possible ( and I like it that way ) .
Honestly , I ’m just not even sure how to go about critiquing it .
I think I ’ll start by saying the album has very little variation .
The “ meat of the album ” tracks are driven by up - tempo synth bass beats , with some “ rapping ” over it .
Perfect example of why I do n’t care for this album : the first time I started listening to “ Plastic Beach ” I was enticed by the introduction and thought the song had potential .
Then the vocals came in , and I thought maybe I could just ignore them .
Then the vocals were purposely auto - tuned OUT OF TUNE , which I guess is supposed to make it sound more interesting , but part of me thinks the producer is just trying to f*ck with me , perhaps to test what he can get me to pay to listen to .
My opinion of this album would greatly increase if all vocal tracks were just dropped , and I could put the instrumental version on in the background and ignore it .
Whether you disagree with my overall assessment of the album or not , one thing is irrefutable : this album does n’t carry some of the “ single - power ” of its predecessors .
“ Clint Eastwood ” remains my favorite song by the group , and Gorillaz also carried with it “ 19-2000 ” which was good .
I should n’t have to mention how big “ Feel Good , Inc. ” became when Demon Days was released .
I just do n’t see this album as having that kind of song on it .
“ Stylo , ” the first single , made it to # 24 on the U.S. Billboard Alternative list .
By comparison , “ Feel Good , Inc. ” made the top 50 on seven U.S. Billboard lists , all higher than # 24 , including a # 1 on the “ Hot Modern Rock Tracks ” list .
Coincidentally ( or not ) , the few songs I was okay with on the album were either singles , already named as future singles , or potential singles .
“ On Melancholy Hill ” uses the same formula as many of Plastic Beach ’s other tracks , but gets it right .
“ Stylo ” rides a decent beat , and has some good guest vocals from Bobby Womack .
“ Rhinestone Eyes ” has a lot of potential , but again I ’m not able to get around the vocals .
If you ’re uninterested in any of these three songs , I would find it difficult to believe that you ’re really going to enjoy the rest of the album .
Anyway , I have little else to say about the album .
I ’m disappointed in it , as well as with my inability to put my criticisms into words , although this is only my third review .
Because there has been such a holdup on getting this review done , I ’m hoping to put out another in the next couple days , which will likely be the Beach Boys ’ Pet Sounds .

( CNN ) --
Hours after its iPhone 4 went on sale to excited crowds Thursday , Apple found itself responding to complaints that holding the phone by its metal edge causes mobile reception to suffer .
The company 's response , in a nutshell ?
You 're holding it wrong .
" Just avoid holding it in that way , " Apple CEO Steve Jobs wrote in an e-mail that was making the rounds on the Web on Friday morning .
An official statement from Apple expanded in less pointed language than Jobs , who is known to occasionally answer e-mails from customers himself .
" Gripping any mobile phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance , with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas , " Apple said in a written statement .
One of the new phone 's vaunted features is its sleek design -- nearly 25 percent thinner than its most recent predecessor .
That 's achieved , in part , by snaking the antenna through a metal band around the edges of the phone .
The Apple statement , like early user reviews , said that putting a cover on the phone also reduces interference .
" If you ever experience this on your iPhone 4 , avoid gripping it in the lower left corner in a way that covers both sides of the black strip in the metal band , or simply use one of many available cases , " the company says .
The iPhone 4 -- with its dual cameras , high - resolution display and glass - backed design -- has received mostly positive reviews since its release .
But by late Thursday , tech blogs and other websites were filling up with complaints about the reception issue .
On CNN's iReport , several contributors noted the problem .
Keith Taylor of Sarasota , Florida , submitted a video review that initially said gripping the metal band made reception slightly worse than that of the iPhone 3GS .
Hours later , he wrote a follow - up saying that " the reception problem is very real " and that it improved when he bought a protective cover for the phone .
Share your thoughts on the new iPhone 4 with iReport .
The reception issue is chief among complaints that surfaced in the day since the iPhone 4 went on sale in Apple stores and other outlets .
There have been some reports of the phone 's glass casing cracking easily and of its " retina display " screen , billed as one of the sharpest in the industry , scratching even after only a few days of wear and tear .
i Reporters share iPhone mania
Other owners of the new iPhone have reported that the display has an annoying yellow tint , although most have not noticed that .

Today was a mid-year Christmas for most NHL fans .
All 30 NHL teams released their schedules today , giving fans the opportunity to salivate over potential matchups and plan out what night they ’re going to see their team .
The Devils will open their season October 8 at home against the Dallas Stars .
It ’s a bit of an interesting decision , matching a Western Conference opponent against an Eastern Conference opponent .
I ’d much rather see the team open against a division rival , or at least an Eastern Conference opponent .
But those are the breaks .
It ’ll be the first game with John MacLean as the head coach , and Jason Arnott will re-introduce himself to Devils fans .
The Devils opening weekend continues October 9 against Ovie and the Washington Capitals in Washington .
The Devils longest homestand of the season will be four games , beginning on Dec. 23 against the Islanders .
They then play the Maple Leafs ( Dec. 26 ) and the Rangers ( Dec. 29 ) before finishing on New Years Eve against the Thrashers .
The Devils longest road trip is six games , beginning against the Rangers on Oct. 24 .
The team then heads west , facing off against the Sharks ( Oct. 27 ) , Ducks ( Oct. 29 ) , Kings ( Oct. 30 ) and the Canucks ( Nov. 1 ) .
The trip concludes with a trip to face the Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks on Nov. 3 .
The Devils will not play a St. Patrick ’s Day game at home this season .
General manager Lou Lamoriello and principal owner Jeff Vanderbeek wanted to rotate in the infamous Devils ’ retro jerseys , and this past season allowed them to make it holiday - appropriate .
The two want the Devils to go retro once a season , but without a St. Patrick ’s Day game , the team will have to find another game to wear it .
**********
Here are some other schedule highlights :
Monday , October 11 , 2010 – Penguins vs. Devils ( 1 p.m. )
In one of three afternoon games the Devils will play in 2010 – 2011 , they face - off in a Columbus Day matinee against the Pittsburgh Penguins .
The Devils swept the season series against the former champs , helping propel the Devils to yet another Atlantic Division title .
Many of these games were close last season , so I ’d expect much of the same this season as well .
Sunday , October 24 , 2010 – Devils vs. Rangers ( 7 p.m. )
The Devils and Rangers tied their season series , 3 - 3 , and will renew their bad blood on a Sunday night .
It ’s always a fun time when these two get together , and I ’m sure their first meeting of the season will be nothing new .
Expect physical play and a low - scoring game .
Wednesday , November 24 , 2010 – Flames vs. Devils ( 7:30 p.m. )
The Devils welcome back ex-coach Brent Sutter to the Rock in their game Nov. 24 .
Sutter left the Devils after the 2008 - 2009 season , citing his desire to be closer to his family .
Shortly after , he took the open coaching position with the Flames .
On March 6 , Calgary defeated the Devils , 5 - 3 , at the Pengrowth Saddledome in Calgary .
Saturday , November 27 , 2010 – Flyers at Devils ( 1 p.m. )
The Flyers and the Devils face off for the first time on Nov. 27 .
Last year , the Flyers won five of six regular season games against the Devils .
Then the playoffs happened and , well … there ’s no reason to bring up the past .
Hopefully the Devils can beat the Flyers a few more times this season .

So that ’s my take on the Devils 2010 - 2011 schedule .
For a full schedule , click here .
Israel should launch a pre-emptive strike to prevent arch - foe Iran from going nuclear , a former head of Israel ’s Mossad intelligence agency said on Monday .
“ I am of the opinion that , since there is an ongoing war , since the threat is permanent , since the intention of the enemy in this case is to annihilate you , the right doctrine is one of pre-emption and not of retaliation , ” Shabtai Shavit told a conference .
ADVERTISEMENT
Shavit , who served as chief of Israel ’s foreign spy agency from 1989 to 1996 , was speaking at a conference held at the hawkish Bar Ilan University outside Tel Aviv .
“ To use retaliation as the main strategy means to sit idly and wait until the enemy comes to attack you , ” a university statement quoted Shavit as saying .
“ But we are dealing with an enemy that plans all the time and waits for the opportunity to arise in order to attack , so what is the point , even morally , to wait and do something only when we are attacked , ” he said .
Israel , which has the Middle East ’s sole if undeclared nuclear arsenal , regards Iran as its principal threat after repeated predictions by the Islamic republic ’s hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of the Jewish state ’s demise .
Along with the West , it suspects Iran of trying to develop atomic weapons under the guise of its nuclear programme , a claim Tehran denies .
ADVERTISEMENT
Israel has backed US - led efforts to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapons capability through sanctions , but has also refused to rule out military force .
In 1981 Israel bombed an Iraqi nuclear reactor and reportedly also attacked a suspected Syrian nuclear facility in 2007 .
Iran insists that its nuclear programme is aimed solely at power generation and medical research and says that the international community should focus its attention on Israel , which , unlike Iran , is not a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .

On Monday , May 10 , eurozone officials presented a stimulus plan involving $ 1 trillion .
The main reason for the package , as stated by officials , is to prevent European economies from falling into an economic black hole on account of the economic crisis in Greece .
Another factor that prompted the European leaders to come up with the massive stimulus package is the desire to arrest the slide of the euro .
After climbing to $ 1.51 in November 2009 the price of the euro in US dollar terms plunged to around $ 1.26 in early May — a fall of 16 % .
There is a concern that an uncontrolled fall in the euro could accelerate the rate of increase in price inflation .
Note that after falling to − 0.3 % in September last year , the yearly rate of growth of the consumer price index ( CPI ) jumped to 1.5 % in April .
The stated intent of eurozone leaders to defend the euro at any price seems to be contradictory given that the European Central Bank ( ECB ) on May 10 started pumping money into the economy by buying government bonds on the secondary market .
Observe that the growth momentum of the ECB balance sheet has been trending up since January this year .
The yearly rate of growth climbed from − 6.8 % in January to 11.5 % in the first week of May .
Eurozone policy makers were quick to suggest that the ECB monetary pumping via the purchase of government bonds of weak economies such as Greece , Portugal , and Spain is meant to stabilize financial markets .
What they mean by stabilizing the markets is to suppress the widening of the yield spread of the Greek , Spanish , and Portuguese government debt against the German government debt .
For instance , in April the spread on the 10 - year Greek government bond stood at 6.2 % against 3.7 % in January while the Portuguese spread stood at 2.4 % against 1.2 % in January .
Trying to suppress the symptoms without addressing the causes behind the widening in the spread can only make things much worse .
Clearly , investors are now assigning a much greater risk to Greek versus German government bonds given the fact that the Greek economy is in much worse shape .
Eurozone policy makers have also suggested that this pumping is not inflationary because it will be neutralized by an appropriate monetary policy of the ECB — the monetary pumping by the ECB is not going to lift the money - supply rate of growth , it is held .
Irrespective of these statements , what matters is what the ECB balance sheet is doing — as we have seen , it has been on a rising growth path since January this year .
Some other experts are of the view that the role of the central bank is to accommodate the demand for money .
In this sense an increase in the supply of money in response to the increase in the demand for money is not inflationary , so it is held .
Given the widening yield spread , clearly — it is held — we have a strong increase in the demand for money .
Failing to accommodate this demand , it is argued , can seriously damage the monetary system .
Regardless of demand , any monetary pumping sooner or later will lead to an exchange of nothing for something , which will weaken the real - wealth - generation process .
Now , can the $ 1 - trillion package fix the underlying problems of Greece and other eurozone economies ?
I.e. , can it improve the ability of some European governments to service their debt ?
This ability is dependent on the wealth - generating process of the private sector of the economy and not a reshuffling of nominal debt ratios .
The stimulus package , which really amounts to income redistribution , will only weaken further the wealth - generating process .
Another important factor that undermines this process is the reckless monetary policy of the ECB .
What we currently observe in Greece and other European economies is an economic bust brought about by a visible decline in the growth momentum of the money supply .
After rising to 20.8 % in August last year , the yearly rate of growth of Greece 's AMS fell to 0.2 % by April this year .
The yearly rate of growth of the eurozone 's AMS fell from 15.8 % in August last year to 10 % by April .
The sharp fall in the money - supply rate of growth is currently putting pressure on various nonproductive — i.e. , bubble — activities that emerged on the back of the previous strong increase in money - supply rate of growth .
Note that increases in the growth momentum of money out of " thin air " divert real savings to bubble activities .
A fall in the growth momentum weakens the diversion and thus weakens bubble activities .
While a fall in the growth momentum of money is good news for the wealth - generating process , ever - growing government activities have continued to undermine this process .
In 2009 , Greek government outlays rose by 104 % from 1999 .
Also in Spain , government outlays have continued to push ahead , rising by 119 % in 2009 from 1999 , while in Ireland the rate of increase stood at 157 % .
The relentless increases in government outlays implies a persistent diversion of real savings from wealth - generating activities to nonproductive activities , i.e. , consumption of real capital .
Obviously , this undermines the process of real - wealth generation .
So , rather than curtailing government outlays and eliminating various nonproductive activities , the rescue package coupled with a loose ECB is actually going to further reinforce nonproductive activities .
Obviously , this cannot be good news for the eurozone .
Conclusion
On Monday , May 10 , eurozone officials presented a $ 1 - trillion stimulus plan to prevent the eurozone economies falling into an economic black hole .
To reinforce the plan , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) was forced by eurozone officials to step in with monetary pumping to provide a quick fix to financial markets .
Such policies can only make things much worse — it is not possible to create something by printing money and redistributing real wealth .
All that such policies produce is a further economic impoverishment .

Oliver Stone 's documentary South of the Border -- about Venezuela and its President Hugo Chávez - - was trashed in the New York Times in a feature story by correspondent Larry Rohter .
Rohter complained the film was full of mistakes -- but supporters of the film point out that he made far more errors in his brief article .
Here , Gregory Wilpert , co-founder of the Venezuelanalysis.com
Web site , responds to attack on the film and on his particular role in it .
IT IS truly amazing how a long - time Latin America correspondent who accuses Oliver Stone 's recently released documentary South of the Border of " mistakes , misstatements and missing details , " manages to get practically every single statement of his own wrong , misstated or lacking in detail .
This is all the more amazing , considering that the filmmakers and I spoke to Larry Rohter at length last week and provided him with the plenty of information to back up the film 's points , which he chose to ignore .
Not only are there the numerous errors that Oliver Stone , Tariq Ali and Mark Weisbrot point out in their letter to the New York Times ( having to do with presidential candidate Irene Sáez , flying over the Andes to get to La Paz , Venezuela 's oil exports to the United States , etc. ) , but here are a few more problems that their letter did not go into .
First of all , Rohter chastises Stone for not disclosing that I -- who appears for about a minute in the documentary -- am married to Carol Delgado , Venezuela 's consul general to New York , nor my affiliation with the mostly pro-Chávez Web site Venezuelanalysis.com .
While these " affiliations " are correct , I question if they are actually the most relevant disclosures , given the testimony I provide in the film .
Oliver Stone and Hugo Chavez in South of the Border
In the documentary , I make brief comments on only two issues -- on what I witnessed during the April 2002 coup attempt and on what many " analysts " of Venezuela have said about the role of Venezuela 's private mass media , that it openly supports the opposition and subverts the government .
These are both issues I have written about extensively and consistently since April 2002 , about six years before my wife was appointed consul in early 2008 .
My first articles on the coup are available online here and here .
I published my fullest account of the coup in April 2007 here , while my wife was still a mid-level PDVSA employee .
Also , my book Changing Venezuela by Taking Power was published in September 2007 , also before we moved to New York .
So if Stone should have mentioned disclosures in the few seconds that I appear on the screen , then perhaps he should also have mentioned other relevant points .
I can just see it , a full disclosure caption that reads : " Gregory Wilpert , adjunct professor of political science at Brooklyn College , co-founder of the mostly pro-Chávez Venezuelanalysis.com , married to Venezuela 's pro-Chávez Consul General , but witnessed and reported on coup - related events six years before his wife 's appointment and one - and - a - half years before the founding of Venezuelanalysis.com . "
I think such a caption would probably have been long enough to cover my face .
SECOND , ROHTER'S article suggests that Stone should have known that one of the buildings from which demonstrators were shot at during the coup ( known as " La Nacional " ) belonged to the pro-Chávez mayor 's office .
First , while this is true , this building is not even mentioned in the documentary .
Second , if Rohter was really interested in providing more detail , he should also have mentioned that nine opposition - affiliated police officers were sentenced to lengthy prison terms for having participated in the occupation of this building and for having shot at demonstrators or for having given the order to do so ( further discussion of metropolitan police involvement in the coup can be found here and here ) .
According to evidence presented at the officers ' trial , opposition - affiliated police shot at demonstrators from this building .
I provided Rohter with this information and suggested to him to read about it in my articles about the coup .
Rohter also says that Stone should have mentioned the hard - line opposition versions of the coup , as described in the film X - Ray of a Lie and in the Brian Nelson book The Silence and the Scorpion .
In short , Rohter is arguing that Stone should have taken this opposition version of the coup seriously , which claims ( as Nelson and X - Ray of a Lie do ) that the coup was not really a coup , even when it is commonly accepted both in Venezuela and around the world that it was indeed a coup .
Rohter clearly still believes the coup was not a coup also , because he never retracted his April 12 , 2002 , statement in the New York Times , " The armed forces did not actually take power on Thursday .
It was the ousted president 's supporters who appear to have been responsible for deaths that numbered barely 12 , rather than hundreds or thousands , and political rights and guarantees were restored rather than suspended . "
The bottom line is , even though Rohter brings up three arguments to cast doubt on the Stone documentary 's version of the coup ( failure to mention the hard - line opposition account , my potential bias as a witness , and government control over a building from which people were shot ) , he is unable to raise a single point in the Stone documentary 's coup discussion that is misstated or false .
Rohter then goes on to attempt to question several other points made in the film , such as the Kirchners ' role in Argentina 's economic success and the privatization of Bolivia 's water system .
As Stone , Ali and Weisbrot argue , none of these points hold any water , let alone validity .
Perhaps this is to be expected from a journalist who in 2004 wrote an article , with hardly any evidence , alleging that Brazil 's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is an alcoholic .
I guess the one place where one can say that Rohter is correct , where Stone indeed made a " mistake or misstatement , " is on the pronunciation of Chávez 's name .
It is pronounced CHA - vez , not sha-VEZ .
Gringos should really get that right .

Condemn Israel 's attack on the Gaza flotilla
Socialist Alliance statement June 3 , 2010 .
Socialist Alliance condemns the completely unwarranted and murderous attack by Israeli armed forces on the civilian flotilla carrying aid to Gaza .
Not since the French Secret Service blew up the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland Harbour in 1985 has there been such a brazen act of international piracy by a sovereign state .
Governments all around the world have condemned the criminal actions of Somali pirates in international waters off the horn of Africa , and have even sent naval armadas to confront those pirates .
The international community must unreservedly condemn this criminal act of piracy on the high seas .
We demand the Rudd government condemn the killings of unarmed civilians without any equivocation ; break off diplomatic relations with Israel and demand that future aid convoys be allowed to land unimpeded , and the aid delivered to the people of Gaza .
The Rudd government must also demand that the siege of Gaza , imposed in 2007 , be lifted immediately and that Israel recognise the democratically - elected Hamas government of Gaza .
PM Kevin Rudd said he " condemns any use of violence under the sorts of circumstances that we have seen " and , ridiculously , has called on Israel to hold an " independent " inquiry into the incident .
Rudd also rushed to add that he understood the " unique security challenges facing Israel " and that he made his criticisms as a " friend of Israel " .
The Socialist Alliance condemns the Rudd ALP government 's hypocritical equivocation in the face of the near - universal condemnation of this latest Israeli attack .
Only the US government , which has neither condemned the attack nor called for the lifting of the blockade of Gaza , has a worse position .
Israel has repeatedly violated international law and must be bought to justice for these and other war crimes .
The shameless double standards applied by the US and Australian governments to the Israeli state 's serial flouting of international law makes them accomplices in crime .
Australia should follow the example of Cuba , Venezuela , Bolivia and Nicaragua in cutting diplomatic , military and security ties with Israel .
It should join the international Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions ( BDS ) campaign to isolate the apartheid and war - making state of Israel .

Stephen Smith must condemn Israel ’s attack , break diplomatic ties , says candidate for Perth
Perth Socialist Alliance media release May 31
Click here for Arabic translation .
Socialist Alliance candidate Alex Bainbridge who is running for the seat of Perth , currently held by Stephen Smith , has called on the Australian government to immediately condemn Israel ’s attack on the Gaza peace flotilla .
“ Australia must condemn outright Israel ’s attack on the flotilla carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza , ” said Socialist Alliance candidate for the seat of Perth , Alex Bainbridge .
“ Stephen Smith ’s response to date – to express regret and shock about the deaths , to ‘ proceed calmly ’ and to call on Israel to provide a detailed explanation – is inadequate , ” said Bainbridge .
“ Israel has engaged in an act of piracy in international waters against unarmed peace activists bringing humanitarian aid to Gaza – there is no way of justifying that assault , ” said Bainbridge .
“ Stephen Smith has called on Israel to ‘ ease ’ its blockade of Gaza which is another way of supporting the continuation of that blockade in a modified form , ” said Bainbridge .
“ In reality , any form of blockade against Gaza is an infringement of human rights – the blockade should be ended and Australia should call for this explicitly , ” said Bainbridge .
“ This shocking attack is a direct consequence of Israel ’s attempt to besiege the people of Gaza who want nothing more than an end to the unjust occupation of Palestine , ” said Bainbridge .
“ Israel ’s actions are so shocking that Australia should break diplomatic ties immediately until the flotilla and its passengers are released and allowed to travel unimpeded to Gaza , ” said Bainbridge .
“ Emergency protest actions are happening everywhere and I will be attending and promoting the Perth protest action at 5 pm at Wesley Church in the city today , ” said Bainbridge .
Emergency protest actions in Australia :
Sydney : Protest on Tuesday June 1 , 5.30 pm , Town Hall , organised by Coalition for Justice and Peace in Palestine .
Melbourne :
There will be a protest on Tuesday June 1 , 4.30 pm at the State Library .
Perth : A snap protest will be held Tuesday June 1 , 5 pm , Wesley Church , cnr William & Hay Sts , Perth .
Organised by Friends of Palestine .
Brisbane : A protest will be held on Tuesday June 1 , 5 - 7 pm , Brisbane Sq , Cnr Queen and George Sts .
Adelaide : Details coming soon - keep checking back here !
Canberra : Tuesday June 1 , 5 pm , outside Israeli Embassy , 6 Turrana St , Yarralumla .
Plus also a rally in Garema Place on Thursday 3 June at 4.00 pm ( organised by Australians for Justice and Peace in Palestine )
Newcastle : Tuesday June 1 , 4 pm , Sharon Grierson 's office , Hunter St

One of the great mysteries of modern politics today is how the state of Minnesota could have produced both Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R ) and Democrat Sen . Al Franken .
While Bachmann this week was accusing the Obama administration of “ fleecing ” BP , urging its execs not to be “ chumps , ” and suggesting that a $ 20 billion escrow fund for oil spill victims was a form of “ wealth redistribution , ” Franken Thursday night was wowing an audience of lawyers with a remarkably pointed critique of the Roberts court and its efforts to enhance the power of already powerful corporations .
The contrast could n’t be more different .
Speaking at the American Constitution Society ’s annual convention in DC , Franken offered up his unique blend of political criticism and comic delivery in a speech that sounded an awful lot like a rallying cry for Congress to push back against the Supreme Court ’s pro-business decisionmaking .
He honed in on the conservative Federalist Society and bashed the Roberts court for its overreach in cases like Citizens United , where the court answered questions it was n’t even asked .
“ I mean , I do n’t speak Latin .
But unless stare decisis means ‘ overturn stuff , ’ then maybe it ’s time for conservatives to stop calling other people ‘ dangerous radicals , ' ” he said .
Conservatives , Franken said , have “ distorted our constitutional discourse to make it sound like the Court ’s rulings do n’t matter to ordinary people , but only to the undeserving riff - raff at the margins of society .
So unless you want to get a late - term abortion , burn a flag in the town square , or get federal funding for your pornographic artwork , you really do n’t need to worry about what the Supreme Court is up to . ”
Much of Franken ’s speech concerned the real people whose lives are indeed affected by the court ’s decisions , including Jaime Leigh Jones , the KBR employee who was allegedly gang - raped by her co-workers in Iraq and whose case Franken has championed .
One of the themes of Franken ’s speech was the way conservative legal activists have changed the way they talk about the law to disguise what their real agenda is .
“ Do they want to undercut abortion and immigration and Miranda rights ?
Sure .
But those are just cherries on the sundae .
What conservative legal activists are really interested in is this question :
What individual rights are so basic and so important that they should be protected above a corporation ’s right to profit ?
And their preferred answer is : None of them .
Zero . ”
I could go on about all the interesting things he had to say , but print does n’t really do Franken justice .
ACS has just posted the video of his speech , and you can watch the whole thing .
It ’s worth a look .

Oil Industry Insider Says Oil Spill Flow Is Closer To 120,000 Barrels A Day
Doug Mataconis · · No comments
Matthew Simmons , an oil industry insider who has been a prominent proponent of the Peak Oil hypothesis , says that we ’re still not being told the complete truth about the oil leaking out of the sea floor in the Gulf of Mexico :
10 years ago today , Microsoft promised to build " the next generation Internet . "
The occasion was Forum 2000 , where Microsoft 's Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer announced .
NET , now one of the most popular frameworks used by software developers .
. NET seems like it has been around forever now , but on June 22 , 2000 , Ballmer mentioned the word " .NET " a whopping 62 times in his keynote address as he made his case to software developers .
" What is . NET ? " Ballmer said .
" .NET represents a set , an environment , a programming infrastructure that supports the next generation of the Internet as a platform .
...
It is also , though , and Bill [ Gates ] made the analogy , I think , with Windows here pretty well for its day , .NET is also a user environment , a set of fundamental user services that live on the client , in the server , in the cloud , that are consistent with and build off that programming model .
So , it 's both a user experience and a set of developer experiences , that 's the conceptual description of what is .
NET . "
It 's interesting that Ballmer was already using the word " cloud " , all the way back in 2000 before cloud computing was a commonly discussed set of technologies .
But in the decade since then , it was really Google and Amazon that became the poster child vendors for the evolution of the Internet and cloud computing services for businesses and developers .
Microsoft 's cloud vision , and .NET in particular , relies on Windows , of course , whereas much of the rest of the cloud computing world is based on open source technologies such as Linux and Xen virtualization .
Microsoft 's implementation of .NET can only be installed on Windows machines , but the framework has been a success , when measured by user satisfaction .
Microsoft .NET was rated the best overall framework by 425 software developers surveyed by the Evans Data Corp.
recently , " with two Google offerings -- App Engine and Web Toolkit ( GWT ) -- coming in just slightly behind Microsoft in overall satisfaction , " as the Microsoft Subnet recently reported .
The study rated frameworks by ten attributes , with ease of use being called the most important feature in a web development platform , ahead of performance and extensibility .
. NET 's first release occurred on Feb. 13 , 2002 , a year and a half after it was announced , and the latest version - . NET Framework 4 - was released just two months ago .
10 years into its life , .NET is still a major part of Microsoft 's cloud strategy .
The company just updated the Windows Azure software development kit to add support for .
NET Framework 4 , making it easier for developers to build applications in the cloud .
While it was already possible to build .NET applications on Azure , support for .
NET Framework 4 gives developers the same capabilities in the cloud as they have within their own networks , Microsoft said earlier this month .
In his speech at Forum 2000 , Ballmer downplayed the role of Linux in fueling growth of the Internet , saying " The Linux phenomenon continues to go along , but it 's a phenomenon that works well in times when things are quite static , and people just want to hack around in the detail .
I 'm not sure it 's a very good approach for taking new trails and affecting transformation . "
While Windows market share certainly dwarfs that of Linux , Ballmer has n't succeeded in killing off the open source competition , and many would argue that open source is what will fuel the next generation of cloud computing services .
After 10 years , Microsoft is still betting on .NET as a key component of the next generation Internet .
What role do you think .NET will play in cloud computing 10 years from today ?

Are you traveling to Arizona but worried about the state ’s new draconian racial profiling law ?
If so , check out a new service provided by the Service Employees International Union to help you know what you need to avoid bad encounters with that state ’s police .
The country ’s biggest labor union now provides a “ travel advisory hotline ” for summertime tourists fearful of being stopped by Arizona law enforcement officers under the new law known as SB 1070 .
( Call 1-800-958-5068 . )
Launched as part of the union ’s “ It Stops in Arizona ” campaign , the travel advisory hotline offers tips on how to avoid being racially profiled .
These include not wearing jeans .
“ Please wear slacks or khakis ” to avoid suspicion , the hotline advises .
Do your best to “ resemble a J. Crew or Ralph Lauren model , ” the hotline operator says , as “ working people come in many shapes and sizes ” and fitting into that category will arouse police suspicion .
The tongue - in - cheek messages conclude with an invitation to visit ItStopsInArizona.com , which makes a serious call for a boycott of travel to or doing business with Arizona .
SEIU Immigration Campaign Director Javier Morillo remarked , “ On behalf of working families in Arizona and on behalf of American values of fairness and equality , SEIU is pushing back online , in the courts , in the field and through a union - wide boycott to stop this harmful law before it goes into effect and before it spreads to other states . ”
He added , “ America wants serious solutions to our immigration problems – not frivolous policies , like Arizona ’s SB 1070 , that undermine public safety , waste millions of taxpayer funds and imperil our most basic civil rights . ”
SEIU last month joined a coalition of labor and civil rights groups in a lawsuit to strike down SB 1070 .
SEIU noted that SB 1070 actually puts Arizona ’s economy at risk .
It would force the state to pay for massive new immigration enforcement , diverting taxpayer dollars away from state services .
In a piece for HuffingtonPost.com , Arizona State Director for SEIU Scott Washburn wrote that passage of the law “ feels good ” because it seems like it might fix a serious problem .
But in fact , the law will impose new financial burdens on the state , and “ create an environment of panic and fear throughout the entire Latino community . ”
The law serves as little more than a distraction from the real causes of the fiscal and economic problems that face the state .
Indeed , massive deportations of immigrants , aside from the sheer cost of that activity , would cost the state billions in economic activity each year .

NEW ORLEANS —
At almost 300 years old , somewhat moldy from the remnants of Hurricane Katrina and surrounded by muddy water and swamps , this city is not exactly known for being lemony fresh .
The signature scent around Bourbon Street , after all , is the smell of spilled liquor .
But from the French Quarter to New Orleans East , people here have been complaining about a tinge to the air that is unsettling even by local standards .
Many suspect that it has something to do with the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , which has already leaked millions of gallons of crude about 50 miles off the Louisiana coast .
The authorities involved in the cleanup of the fallen Deepwater Horizon oil rig have been burning oil on the surface of the gulf and using chemical dispersants around the leak .
Could New Orleans possibly be smelling that , from more than 100 miles away ?
Many say yes .
But the mystery odor , which is stronger on some days and in some areas than others , is hard for residents to describe .
As The Hill writes in " Halter thanks progressive allies ahead of Ark. vote " :
Bill Halter is continuing to pull in significant amounts of campaign cash from national progressive groups .
He sent an e-mail to supporters of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee on Monday to thank them for helping him raise $ 250,000 ahead of Tuesday 's vote .
" Thousands of PCCC members gave $ 250,000 in small - dollar donations , which went to fund our grassroots field operation and TV ads , " Halter wrote in the e-mail .
" You also helped make over 200,000 phone calls to voters in the final days , allowing us take the lead in the polls . "
Halter is up against Sen. Blanche Lincoln in the runoff for the Democratic Senate nod for Arkansas .
A spokesman for PCCC said the group " has had senior staffers on the ground for the past couple months , leading Halter 's field operation . "
The photo below captures the moment Halter wrote the note onboard his campaign bus , according to the PCCC spokesman .
We 're less than 36 hours away from polls closing in Arkansas , and this is the critical period to get Halter supporters to the polls .

The Hammersmith Branch of the Socialist League , William Morris is fifth from the right in the second row .
By Graham Milner
With some great revolutionary figures in world history , and in international labour history in particular , it has been found necessary for historians or biographers to dig out their subjects from beneath " a load of calumny and oblivion " , " a mountain of dead dogs " .
[ 1 ]
With others , however , a different problem exists .
Lenin pointed to this when he wrote that the ruling classes , following upon the deaths of great revolutionaries , often attempt -- after having met the ideas and actions of such men and women during their lifetimes with " furious hatred ... and slanders " -- to turn them into " harmless saints ... by way of `consolation ' to the oppressed ... while at the same time emasculating and vulgarising the real essence of their revolutionary theories and blunting their revolutionary edge " . [ 2 ]
Where William Morris ( 1834 -96 ) , arguably the greatest revolutionary figure in British labour history , is concerned , the problem indicated by Lenin has been compounded by the fact that Morris was not only a significant political leader and thinker .
He was also an artist and craftsperson accomplished in many fields , such as painting , design and printing , and in addition to those accomplishments he was a major poet and creative prose writer .
In fact , and this is a point of some historical importance , Morris was , in the words of his biographer E.P.
Thompson , the " first creative artist of major stature in the world to take his stand , consciously and without shadow of compromise , with the revolutionary working class " . [ 3 ]
Partly because of the wide range of his creative activity , it was long possible for the " official " view of Morris to be one that tended to depreciate his involvement in the socialist movement .
[ 4 ]
The first major biography of Morris , published in 1899 , consistently downgraded his socialist commitment .
[ 5 ]
Mackail 's biography initiated what R. Page Arnot has characterised as the " bourgeois myth " about Morris . [ 6 ]
It had become possible by 1934 for Stanley Baldwin , the Conservative Party leader , to open a Morris centenary exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London with a speech lauding Morris the poet and artist , but totally avoiding the fact that Morris had been a revolutionary . [ 7 ]
Another side to the attempt to " canonise " Morris into a harmless establishment figure has come from within the official Labour Party - dominated labour movement in Britain .
Page Arnot has described the result of this attempt as the " Menshevik myth " , the notion that Morris was a mild , reformist , " ethical " socialist who thus fitted in with the requirements of the labour bureaucracy . [ 8 ]
Part of the source for this second myth may be traced to a memoir by John Bruce Glasier , a member of the revolutionary Socialist League of Morris 's day , who devolved into a sentimental , " ethical " Labourist and confidant of Ramsey MacDonald . [ 9 ]
Much debate and controversy has surrounded this memoir , but its reliability as a factual record of Morris 's views and activity has been effectively brought into disrepute . [ 10 ]
The " Menshevik myth " sought to dismember Morris 's heritage from any connection with revolutionary Marxism .
Three important works published since the Second World War have now gone a long way to deflating the anti-Marxist myths about Morris .
These are the works already cited in the notes , by Page Arnot , E.P. Thompson and Paul Meier .
Thompson 's book , William Morris : Romantic to Revolutionary , in particular , has been an extremely influential text , although it was largely ignored by the academic establishment when it appeared at the most intense phase of the Cold War in 1955 .
[ 11 ]
By the 1960s Thompson 's book was being cited as the standard work on its subject in general texts on British labour history . [ 12 ]
William Morris .
Some writers have claimed that the pendulum has swung the other way and that there is now a new Marxist orthodoxy to contend with in Morris studies . [ 13 ]
The point is , however , that Thompson 's book at least , whatever one may think of Meier 's , is in itself a major statement of " unorthodox " Marxism and is , as well as a great biography of William Morris , a considerable historical contribution to the reorientation of post - Stalinist socialist thought .
In his standard history of anarchism , George Woodcock wrote that this movement 's ideas were essentially " Protean " , as opposed to the allegedly single - faceted orthodoxy of socialism and Marxism . [ 14 ]
In the light of developments in the decades since Woodcock 's book appeared , with the extension of the colonial revolution , the mass youth radicalisation of the 1960s , the further breakup of the Stalinist monolith , and newer developments such as the Green movement , and now 21st century socialism , no one could seriously dispute that Marxism too is as Protean as the libertarian trends examined by Woodcock -- having many different faces .
The problem for the historian , where Morris is concerned , is now essentially to try to make an objective analysis of just what kind of Marxism he believed in .
This essay will look at the practice and theory of Morris as a Marxist , by examining briefly the genesis of his world outlook , his involvement as a political activist in the nascent socialist movement of the 1880s and 1890s in Britain , and by attempting to analyse the character of his contribution to Marxist and socialist theory .
Romanticism
Romanticism formed the essential matrix of Morris 's early intellectual awareness and of his initial rebellion against the strictures of a Victorian upper middle - class upbringing .
From childhood Morris was steeped in the novels of Walter Scott and the poetry of Keats , Shelley and Byron . [ 15 ]
Romanticism has been variously chartacterised , [ 16 ] but few could disagree with E.J. Hobsbawm 's comment that once bourgeois industrialism had established itself by the early 19th century , " romanticism unquestionably became its instinctive enemy " . [ 17 ]
In fact a tradition of social criticism developed in England , basing itself on romanticism , which struck at the foundations of utilitarianism and liberal capitalism . [ 18 ]
Two central figures in this tradition at mid-century were Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin : both of these men were cited by Morris as having influenced his intellectual development . [ 19 ]
Carlyle 's excoriating attacks on the evils of Victorian industrial civilisation were enthusiastically received by the young Frederick Engels , [ 20 ] which shows to some extent the creative confluence of " Morrisian " and Marxist thought .
Later , Carlyle 's denunciation of the " cash nexus " at the heart of capitalist society , in Past and Present , [ 21 ] was to appear , slightly rephrased , in the Communist Manifesto of 1847 . [ 22 ]
Ruskin's influence on Morris was evidently profound , and the latter described Ruskin as having been at one point " my master " . [ 23 ]
The medievalist slant of Ruskin 's social criticism is apparent from a reading of " The Stones of Venice " ( 1851 -53 ) , but the most important point there is the aesthetic attack Ruskin makes on the capitalist division of labour , which he saw as having been initiated by the Renaissance . [ 24 ]
There is an authoritarian , hierarchical element in Ruskin 's outlook , which is typical of the " feudal socialism " criticised by Marx and Engels in the Manifesto , but it should be remembered that the positive side of this form of socialism was also presented there . [ 25 ]
By the 1870s Morris was an established poet , whose " Earthly Paradise " ( 1868 -70 ) had been received with great critical acclaim . [ 26 ]
He was known , through the activities and products of his " Firm " , as a designer and craftsman of originality and strength . [ 27 ]
Yet he was not satisfied with these achievements ; he disliked the middle - class clientele of the Firm and regarded his poetry as a spare - time occupation .
His move towards political involvement stemmed , in large part , from disillusionment with the prospects of art under capitalism .
As he later wrote to a friend :
... practical conflict with the philistinism of modern society ... forced on me the conviction that art cannot have a real life and growth under the present system of commercialism and profit - mongering . [ 28 ]
Morris 's first political experience was gained through his involvement in the " Bulgarian Agitation " of 1876 - 78 .
One of the great radical agitations of the 19th century , the movement against Turkish atrocities in the Balkans and against British support for the Ottoman Empire drew in broad layers of middle - class and working - class support behind an essentially anti-imperialist program . [ 29 ]
Morris became treasurer of the Eastern Question Association and issued a famous manifesto " To the Working - Men of England " , in May 1877 :
Working men of England , one word of warning yet : I doubt if you know the bitterness of hatred against freedom and progress that lies at the hearts of a certain part of the richer classes in this country ....
These men cannot speak of your order , of its aims , of its leaders , without a sneer or an insult : these men , if they had the power ... would thwart your just aspirations , would silence you , would deliver you bound hand and foot for ever to irresponsible capital . [ 30 ]
Morris quickly became disillusioned with the Liberal Party leadership and its Radical allies as they manoeuvred to contain the outburst of mass energy around the Turkish question . [ 31 ]
When Gladstone 's return to government in 1880 was followed by an Irish Coercion Act and a naval and military assault on Egypt , Morris began to look for a solution beyond bourgeois radicalism . [ 32 ]
About this time , in the Fortnightly Review , appeared a series of articles on the subject of socialism by John Stuart Mill , which persuaded Morris , probably against the author 's intentions , of the efficacy of basic socialist doctrine . [ 33 ]
Socialist commitment
Morris began looking for a socialist organisation to join .
He had reached the point cited by Marx and Engels in the Manifesto of 1847 , where " a section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift and joins the revolutionary class , the class that holds the future in its hands " . [ 34 ]
His commitment was to be wholehearted , and to permit of no backsliding .
What sort of movement was Morris joining when , in January 1883 , he became a member of the Democratic Federation ?
Although it has been claimed that the socialism that emerged in Britain in the 1880s was " wholly new " , [ 35 ] more considered studies have traced the origins of the movement back into the radicalism of earlier Victorian politics . [ 36 ]
This is not to suggest that there was no qualitative leap : there was unquestionably a hiatus between the collapse of Chartism after 1848 , and the emergence of socialism in the 1880s .
But in any case the Chartists had never been socialists . [ 37 ]
Karl Marx , the great leader of international socialism , had lived for decades in England virtually as an unknown exile .
His books were treated with patronage by complacent bourgeois critics , [ 38 ] and his death in 1883 went all but unnoticed in the British press . [ 39 ]
Engels regarded the quiescence of the British working class in the period after the Great Exhibition of 1851 , and the prevalence of Liberal politics within its trade union leadership , to be essentially a function of British international economic dominance , and he saw the appearance of a new socialist movement there in the light of the ending of British absolute supremacy in the world market , under the pressure of growing competition from Germany and the USA . [ 40 ]
The relative decline of British industrial predominance was compounded by conjunctural slumps in the trade cycle which led to increased unemployment and hardship , expecially for unorganised working people . [ 41 ]
The " Great Depression " of 1873 - 96 tended to undermine to some degree the position of the labour aristocracy , which underpinned the " Lib - Lab " alliance , and the crisis stimulated some new layers of workers into industrial organisation and political activity . [ 42 ]
Although the original program and perspectives of the Democratic Federation had reflected the influence of radicalism , [ 43 ] secularism [ 44 ] and positivism , [ 45 ] the organisation had by 1883 , largely under the influence of its moving spirit , H.M. Hyndman , adopted a socialist program derived from the central ideas of Marx . [ 46 ]
Indeed , Hyndman had written and circulated a short book , England for All , which drew extensively on Marx 's Capital , although this was not acknowledged . [ 47 ]
Hyndman was one of the central leaders of the socialist agitation in its early days , and remained an important figure in the movement until the First World War . [ 48 ]
An ex-Tory stockbroker , Hyndman was described by Lenin in 1911 as a " bourgeois philistine who , being the pick of his class , finally makes his way to socialism , but never completely throws off bourgeois traditions , bourgeois views and prejudices " . [ 49 ]
Hyndman was the first major indigenous Marxist theoretician in Britain and , although his work undoubtedly shows a doctrinaire slant , as critics have pointed out , [ 50 ] it nevertheless reveals , as with the Historical Basis of Socialism in England ( 1883 ) considerable analytical powers and a wide acquaintance with the international socialist movement . [ 51 ]
The fact that the Democratic Federation , or Social Democratic Federation ( SDF ) , as it later became known , adhered so quickly to revolutionary ideas , is partly an indication of the state of play in the international labour movement in the early 1880s .
For one thing it showed the influence of the growing Social Democratic Party in Germany , [ 52 ] as well as the influence of German exiles living in England . [ 53 ]
Two Germans , who had been former members of the First International , Weiler and Jung , steered Ernest Belfort Bax , who became a collaborator of Morris in the Socialist League , in the direction of Marxism . [ 54 ]
But of course not all socialists of the 1880s and 1890s period were Marxists , or even revolutionaries , and some of them came together in the Fabian Society , founded about the same time as the SDF .
The Fabians , whose ideas had coalesced into a doctrinal form by the end of the 1880s , with the publication of the Fabian Essays , [ 55 ] promoted a frankly reformist perspective , strongly influenced by utilitarian philosophy . [ 56 ]
This grouping was , however , essentially restricted to a core of " bourgeois intellectuals " , [ 57 ] removed from the working - class movement , and its influence on the latter has often been greatly overestimated . [ 58 ]
It has been pointed out that there were in any case at this early stage no hard and fast divisions between the different tendencies on the socialist left , and sometimes individuals could straddle more than one current . [ 59 ]
Morris rapidly emerged as a leader of the SDF , having soon steeped himself in the theory and practice of revolutionary socialism . [ 60 ]
Far from being a dilettante , as have so many of his class who have attempted to cross the " river of fire " [ 61 ] and join the proletarian movement , Morris threw himself into all spheres of movement work , including regular street selling of the party newspaper Justice , and an arduous round of public lecturing and open - air speaking . [ 62 ]
In 1884 he co-authored , with Hyndman , a pamphlet entitled A Summary of the Principles of Socialism . [ 63 ]
Socialist League
A leadership crisis emerged almost immediately in the SDF .
The fundamental problem was the character of Hyndman .
It has been said that " ... there never was a more arbitrary leader of a democratic movement " . [ 64 ]
But the differences that emerged within the SDF and led to the split of 1884 - 85 also turned around a programmatic question .
It was the old problem of the maximum and minimum program -- how to bridge the gulf between the day - to - day struggle for " palliatives " and reforms , and the ultimate goal of the overturn of capitalist society and the construction of socialism . [ 65 ]
This was no minor problem and was never really resolved by any of the socialist parties of this era . [ 66 ]
Hyndman was accused of political opportunism by a growing tendency within the SDF and with harbouring personal political ambitions . [ 67 ]
His evident jingoism and heavy emphasis on electoral politics lent support to these accusations .
Hyndman 's later career , his parliamentary bloc of 1885 with the Tory party , [ 68 ] and his support for British naval supremacy and the First World War , [ 69 ] to some extent proves that his critics were correct .
But the SDF leaders who split to form the Socialist League , among whom Morris was the most prominent , although they cannot be accused of opportunism , exhibited some degree the ultra - leftist errors criticised later by Lenin in his pamphlet Left - Wing Communism : an Infantile Disorder . [ 70 ]
In fact the group that split actually had a majority of the SDF executive and by breaking away in the fashion that they did this group confused the membership and prevented a full airing of the differences . [ 71 ]
Their conduct can be contrasted with that of Lenin 's faction at the second congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party .
Lenin 's faction also had a narrow majority at this congress .
In the Russian case the Bolshevik faction , as it became known , insisted on its right to lead the party , and it was the minority that split away . [ 72 ]
Morris himself claimed that a drawn - out brawl " would [ have been ] a sorry spectacle to offer the bourgeois world " , [ 73 ] but such a view avoids the obvious questions concerning the rights of the membership .
The split 's damaging effect on the socialist movement can be overemphasised . [ 74 ]
Tom Mann , later to become a great industrial union leader , stayed with the Hyndman faction , and characterised relations between the SDF and what became the Socialist League as " friendly rivalry " . [ 75 ]
The SDF executive members who split thus reconstituted themselves , and Morris drafted a " Manifesto of the Socialist League " , adopted at a general conference in July 1885 , which declared for the principles of " Revolutionary International Socialism " . [ 76 ]
The strategic concepts expressed in this manifesto focus around a theme that Morris was always to adhere to in his Socialist League period -- the belief that the purpose of a revolutionary organisation is fundamentally an educational , or " propagandist " , one .
New members will be recruited to the party , " made " into socialist cadres and then , when the masses move , the body of revolutionaries will be " ready to step into their due places and deal with and direct the irresistible movement " . [ 77 ]
In this schema , the dialectic between party and class is essentially absent .
As Jack Lindsay has written , " The concept of educating the workers through struggle through a succession of interlinked struggles aimed at raising their standards of living and giving them confidence , was nowhere present . " [ 78 ]
The Socialist League contained many talented men and women among its members , including Eleanor Marx , Edward Aveling and Belfort Bax . [ 79 ]
In its initial period the Socialist League received the patronage of Engels , [ 80 ] but his correspondence reveals an at times aloof attitude to the nascent British socialist movement , and his remarks about Morris in particular -- " untalented politician " , [ 81 ] " sentimental socialist " [ 82 ] -- suggest only a grudging tolerance . [ 83 ]
Engels has often come under criticism for some of the formulations of his later years , [ 84 ] but his positive contribution to the international socialist movement far outweighs any shortcomings . [ 85 ]
The evolution of the Socialist League , in which Morris himself played the central role , was characterised essentially by a dialectic of conflict between its parliamentarist " right " wing and its anarchist " left " .
This conflict eventually led to splits and then disintegration .
Morris attempted to hold the league together , [ 86 ] though his strong anti-parliamentarist position pushed him , at times , close to the anarchist wing .
Eleanor Marx criticised him for this . [ 87 ]
Opposition on principle to participation in bourgeois parliaments was rejected by Karl Marx , [ 88 ] and criticised in classic terms by Lenin during the early years of the Comintern . [ 89 ]
It would be too easy to catalogue Morris 's errors in the field of political organisation and tactics during his period as central leader of the Socialist League . [ 90 ]
But it should be pointed out that , for instance , he did not know how to fight on two fronts in his position as " mediator " of the Socialist League 's conflicts . [ 91 ]
Yet strengths are evident , as well as weaknesses .
His actual record as a party organiser has not perhaps been brought out sufficiently in the research to date , but the correspondence with J.L. Mahan , the Northern SL leader , gives a good indication that he was conscientious and sensitive in relations with the branches . [ 92 ]
In any case his public presentation of the socialist message was indefatigable ; he toured up and down the country relentlessly , addressing gatherings large and small , both in and outdoors , and the drafts of many of his talks and lectures have been preserved . [ 93 ]
Regrettably , the major struggles of the decade found the league often tailending other forces .
The " Free Speech Fight " ( 1885 - 86 ) [ 94 ] and the Unemployed Agitation ( 1886 ) [ 95 ] are to some extent exceptions .
But when major opportunities emerged at the end of the decade , with the rise of a militant new industrial unionism , [ 96 ] the league leadership responded with only a lukewarm commitment , repeating sectarian and ultimatist errors made in the Northumberland miners ' strike of 1886 - 87 . [ 97 ]
The dock strike of 1889 was assessed by Engels as a major step forward for the British working class , and for the previously unorganised workers of the East End of London in particular . [ 98 ]
But the Socialist League and the Social Democratic Federation looked upon the strike with suspicion , and Mann , Tillet and Burns , the socialist strike leaders , had to act more or less as independents .
Perhaps the finest achievement of the Socialist League was the publication and distribution of Commonweal , one of the best quality journals ever produced in the history of the British labour movement .
Most commentators have agreed that the paper set a high standard while under the editorial control of Morris . [ 99 ]
Yet it has to be faced that Commonweal was not really a " combination " paper , [ 100 ] as a revolutionary newspaper should strive to be : it was more a theoretical journal than a newspaper .
In 1888 the Socialist League 's trajectory lurched to the left , following the defeat and resignation of the tendency around Eleanor Marx and Edward Aveling , which had been advocating a more positive attitude towards participation in the mass movements , and use of the electoral tactic .
[ 101 ]
The anarchist influence grew and Morris was compelled to give combat .
He wrote in Commonweal :
Freedom from authority means the assertion of the advisability or possibility of an individual man doing what he pleases , always and under all circumstances ; this is an absolute negation of society , and makes Communism as the highest expression of society impossible . [ 102 ]
But the anarchist influence in the Socialist League grew strong enough to have Morris removed from editorial control of the paper .
By 1890 his branch in Hammersmith , London , had decided to form itself into a separate society and leave the Socialist League to the anarchists .
[ 103 ]
It has been said of the Social Democratic Federation and , by extension , of the Socialist League that , despite their shortcomings , the major positive contribution to the labour movement in Britain of these organisations was the training of cadres in socialist ideas .
[ 104 ]
Even though the " bearers " of these ideas often quickly passed through the organisations , they could take the ideas and any organisational skills into the broader working - class movement , or the general community .
Some Socialist League cadres in the provinces in particular played an important role in the broad labour movement .
Tom Maguire , for example , was instrumental in guiding the formation of the Independent Labour Party in West Yorkshire . [ 105 ]
In his last years Morris reconciled himself with the Social Democratic Federation . [ 106 ]
While his stance on the question of parliamentarism matured , his basic outlook on strategy and tactics remained fairly similar to the one he had had during his Socialist League days .
But a trenchant passage from a lecture he delivered in March 1893 anticipates arguments later developed by Rosa Luxemburg in the fight against Eduard Bernstein 's revisionism : " Most anti-socialists and even some socialists are apt to confuse ... the cooperative machinery towards which modern life is tending with the essence of socialism itself " .
[ 107 ]
As a socialist he was always firmly committed to the road of revolution , rather than reform .
One of Morris 's last public speeches , occasioned by the Jameson Raid of 1895 - 96 , attacked the machinations of British imperialism in southern Africa . [ 108 ]
Anti-imperialism continued to be a strong point with him until the end .
Contribution to socialist theory
Having looked at Morris 's political record , we now turn to the question of his contribution to socialist theory .
In my view the central preoccupation of Morris , a theme that runs like a red thread through all his writings and lectures , is the problem of the degradation of work ( or labour activity ) under the capitalist mode of production , and the urgent requirement for a socialist transformation of society to remedy this situation .
[ 109 ]
Ultimately Morris 's aim was the birth of a communist world , where the division of labour is superseded and replaced with authentic human relations based on free interchange .
[ 110 ]
Closely related to this vision of the future was his belief that art , in the broadest understanding of the concept , should be reintegrated with life activity in general and with labour activity in particular . [ 111 ]
These themes are absolutely central to the Marxist tradition .
The concept of " alienated labour " is crucial for an understanding of Marxism .
Morris , writing and thinking to a certain extent in a different tradition from the one that formed the matrix of Marx 's own intellectual development , [ 112 ] reached conclusions essentially similar to those of the early Marx , the Marx of the Grundrisse , and the Marx of the chapters on commodity fetishism in volume 1 of Capital , and indeed of the whole of that work . [ 113 ]
The appearance of E.P. Thompson 's biography of Morris in 1955 reflected to some degree the beginning of the rediscovery of the early Marx in post - war Europe , [ 114 ] particularly the Marx of the " Paris Manuscripts " , [ 115 ] and The German Ideology , [ 116 ] texts that were unknown even to Lenin .
The theme of alienation that runs through these works has been at the basis of at least the two major strands in post - war philosophy and social thought . [ 117 ]
Important critical works , such as Istvan Meszaros ' Marx 's Theory of Alienation [ 118 ] have firmly established the importance of the concept in Marxist theory despite attempts by Althusserian structuralists to place an intellectual ban on it . [ 119 ]
Morris undoubtedly made major contributions to the Marxist theory of alienation , particularly in its aesthetic dimension .
The concepts he developed were enriched by a profound grasp of history , which is clear from a reading of such works as the lecture Art and Labour ( 1884 ) and the book he co-authored with Belfort Bax : Socialism : Its Growth and Outcome ( 1893 ) . [ 120 ]
Morris admitted that he had little aptitude for pure economic studies , yet his writings indicate a firm grasp of some central Marxist economic concepts , such as the division of labour and surplus value . [ 122 ]
He certainly did tend to underestimate the importance of the national aspirations of oppressed peoples in cases like Ireland , [ 121 ] although he was far from unusual among European socialists in this respect ; even Marx and Engels themselves showed inconsistencies of this question . [ 123 ]
Morris ' vision , and he was a visionary , is best seen in the utopian romance News from Nowhere ( 1891 ) .
Paul Meier , the French scholar , has written an important book establishing the firm links between Morris ' outlook in that book , and the perspective of the communist future developed by Marx in The Critique of the Gotha Programme . [ 124 ]
Originally inspired by the negative example of Edward Bellamy 's Looking Backward , a regimented " state socialist " utopia set in the 21st century , [ 125 ]
Morris 's book has been described aptly as a " scientific Utopia " [ 126 ] and the " first utopia which is not utopian " . [ 127 ]
Apart from its vision of a future communist society , which depicts the Thames Valley 200 years hence , when the restraints of the division of labour have largely been overcome and where a totally new attitude to work and leisure prevails , [ 128 ] the most striking feature of News from Nowhere is its historical realism -- the detailed description in it of the transition from the old society . [ 129 ]
A class struggle view is sharply in evidence here . [ 130 ]
Conclusion
In conclusion we could briefly look at Morris 's historical status with the traditions of the British and international labour movements .
Historians have unhesitatingly considered that Morris was " admitted to be the most influential socialist of his day in Britain " , [ 131 ] and " the greatest of English socialists " . [ 132 ]
His influence on the Independent Labour Party and the labour movement as a whole in Britain is well established , but even today one can read accounts that tie in Morris as a " father figure " of reformist Labourism , which is something else again . [ 133 ]
Individual socialist leaders of the pre-World War I working - class movement in Britain have testified to the great influence Morris had on them . [ 134 ]
Morris 's influence has been detected in currents as diverse as the Guild Socialists [ 135 ] and the ultra-sectarian Socialist Party of Great Britain . [ 136 ]
But Morris 's central significance lies in the direct inspiration he gave to the broad revolutionary left of the labour movement in Britain , from the Social Democratic Federation , through the early Communist Party , and down to the anti-Stalinist left of the post - World War II period . [ 137 ]
Morris 's international stature is in some ways an open question .
Perry Anderson has maintained , in a footnote in his Considerations on Western Marxism , that Morris " unjustly remained without much influence even within his own country , and was unknown outside it " .
[ 138 ]
This is a surprising judgement .
We have seen that Morris had a quite definite influence on the British labour tradition .
But internationally as well , he was far from being " unknown " .
For one thing he had attended the founding congress of the Socialist International in Paris in 1889 , [ 139 ] and was received there as the " most distinguished British representative " .
[ 140 ]
He was elected to the International Executive Committee . [ 141 ]
And News from Nowhere has been described , in a major work on the history of international socialism , as " a classic of the movement " . [ 142 ]
The currency and influence of William Morris 's ideas and example will no doubt extend , both within the international labour movement and in society at large , as major interpretative works such as those by E.P. Thompson and Paul Meier continue to be discussed and subjected to critical appraisal .
Study of the contribution of this outstanding socialist should be among the priorities of those who are seeking a road to the full emancipation of humankind .

There are those who have claimed that no socialist upturn of any kind took place in this period .
Theodore Rothstein , From Chartism to Labourism ( London , 1983 : originally published 1929 ) holds that " the [ 1880s and 1890s ] ... represent the lowest point in the class consciousness of the English workers ...
The last quarter of the last century stands out in the history of the labour movement , not only of England but of the whole world , as a period of unparallelled stagnation , decay , and complete absence of any vitality " .
Thus the whole of the period that gave rise to the first mass socialist international is written off as a dead loss .

Hulse , Revolutionists in London , is an exception .
Hulse 's claim , on pp. 16 - 17 , that the socialist groups of the 1880s " filled the columns of their respective periodicals with criticisms of the other organisations " is patently untrue of Commonweal , and it is quite clear that Hulse cannot have looked through the files .

Marx , in the Critique of the Gotha Programme , developed the famous notion of a two - stage transition to communist society , the first stage of which ( socialism ) would be based on the principle of " from each according to his abilities , to each according to his work " .
Only with the supersession of " bourgeois right " and the full reintegration of the individual and the community , would it become possible for society to inscribe on its banners the slogan " from each according to his abilities , to each according to his needs " .
See Marx , Selected Works vol. 2 ( London , 1942 ) , pp. 564-66 .

It is possibly of interest to note in passing the extremely ignorant comment made by the critic Northrop Frye , in his article " The Meeting of Past and Future in William Morris " , Studies in Romanticism , vol. 21 , no. 3 ( Autumn , 1982 ) .
Frye considers that " the later Morris was , perhaps , that very rare bird , a Marxist uncorrupted by Leninism " , p. 311 .
Not only is this statement chronologically absurd , it betrays a total lack of knowledge of Lenin 's politics , particularly the politics of Lenin 's The State and Revolution .

The Los Angeles Unified School District school board wants all public school students in the city to be taught that Arizona 's new immigration law is un-American .
The school board president made the announcement Tuesday night after the district 's Board of Education passed a resolution to oppose the controversial law , which gives law enforcement officials in Arizona the power to question and detain people they suspect are in the U.S. illegally when they are stopped in relation to a crime or infraction .
Critics of the law say it will result in racial profiling .
The school board voted unanimously on Tuesday to “ express outrage ” and “ condemnation ” of the law , and it called on the school superintendent to look into curtailing economic support to the Grand Canyon State .
About 73 percent of the students in the school district are Latino .
But supporters of the law say the school board is way out of bounds and that the measure will just distract from the children 's education .
“ This is ridiculous , it ’s ridiculous for us to be involved in Arizona law , ” said Jane Barnett , Chairman , Los Angeles County Republican Party .
“ There is a 50 percent dropout rate in some parts of the school district — is this going to keep kids in school ? ”
According to its press release , " The Los Angeles Board of Education also requested that Superintendent Ramon Cortines ensure that civics and history classes discuss the recent laws with students in the context of the American values of unity , diversity and equal protection for all people . ”
" America must stand for tolerance , inclusiveness and equality , ” said Board President Monica García , according to the release .
“ In our civics classes and in our hallways , we must give life to these values by teaching our students to value themselves ; to respect others ; and to demand fairness and justice for all who live within our borders .
Any law which violates civil rights is un-American . "
In an e-mail to FOXNews.com , school district spokesman Robert Alaniz elaborated :
“ The Board of Education directed the Superintendent to ensure that LAUSD civics and history classes discuss the recent laws enacted in Arizona in the context of the American values of unity , diversity , and Equal Protection for all .
Much like a number of controversial periods and laws that are part of our history and are currently taught including :
-- Slavery
-- Jim Crowe laws and segregation
-- Native American reservations
-- Residential schools ( for Native Americans )
-- The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882
-- Anti-Irish racism in the 19th century
-- Racism against immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe in the 20th century
-- Anti-Semitism
-- Internment camps for Japanese Americans during World War II
-- The Mexican Repatriation Program ( 1929-1939 ) . "
The school district resolution also opposed another new Arizona law that bans schools from teaching classes that promote the overthrow of the government or advocate ethnic solidarity .
The school board called on Arizona 's leaders to reverse both of these “ misguided ” new laws , the press release said .
The board said the laws “ effectively sanction and promote unconstitutional racial profiling and harassment , ” and “ blatantly violate the civil rights of both Arizona residents and all visitors to the State . ”
They said Arizona ’s new laws also “ severely restrict the education of all children in Arizona by refusing to incorporate vital sections of history that incorporate the contributions of this country ’s many diverse groups . ”
The superintendent was also asked to investigate ways to curtail contracts with Arizona - based businesses and district travel to the state .
" We need to do everything in our power to help our students be global citizens , develop appreciation for the diversity in our midst , and reject any forms of racism or bias , " said Board Vice President Yolie Flores .
" This resolution highlights our commitment to ensuring that our students understand the ideals and constitutional rights that this great country is founded on , while also gaining an appreciation of the histories and cultural contributions of those who have helped build this nation . "
“ It is a sad day in America when the rights guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution are trampled upon under the color of law and authority , ” said LAUSD Board Member Martinez .
“ Everyone , regardless of their status in the United States , has the right to equal protection under our laws .
These Arizona laws are nothing but a knee - jerk backlash resulting from the lack of a comprehensive and well thought out immigration reform policy . ”
The LA County Republican chairwoman said she ’s been inundated with phone calls , e-mails and Facebook messages from people all over Los Angeles who say their school district has no business meddling in another state ’s laws when they ’ve got so many problems of their own to deal with .
“ This is really crazy , ” she said .
“ Everybody is upset about this . ”
Barnett called the school board resolution a “ pathetic stunt ” that distracts educators from what they should be focusing on : educating the students .
“ This is nothing we should be involved in .
Let the courts deal with this , ” she said .
“ We need to keep out of other people ’s states ’ business . ”
Nathan Mintz , the founder of the South Bay Tea Party and the Republican nominee for the 53rd State Assembly seat .
“ This is just another example of these embedded bureaucrats in California doing anything they can to deflect and distract from the poor job their doing of educating our children , ” said Nathan Mintz , the founder of the South Bay Tea Party and the Republican nominee for the 53rd State Assembly seat .
He said attacking Arizona ’s immigration law is just “ a distraction from the key issue of educating the kids in our schools . ”
“ We support Arizona , ” Barnett said .
“ In fact , I think we ought to go there right now for vacation . ”

UPDATE : On June 3 , The Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education offered the following official response to this article :
“ The Board of Education has directed the Superintendent to ensure that LAUSD civics and history classes discuss the recent laws enacted in Arizona in the context of the American values of unity , diversity , and Equal Protection for all .
This very important piece of current events would be taught in our classrooms along with a number of controversial periods and laws which are a part of our history and are currently being taught including : slavery ; Jim Crow laws and segregation ; reservations and residential schools for Native Americans ; The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 ; the anti-Irish racism in the 19th century ; racism against immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe during the 20th century ; anti-Semitism ; internment camps for Japanese Americans during World War II and the Mexican Repatriation Program during the 1930s .
Let ’s remember that these laws were all deemed as “ necessary ” ( in some cases for the security of our nation ) during particular times in our history .
To ignore what is currently happening in Arizona would be total denial of current events and a part of our history .
At the very least it ’s a discussion that should take place in the classroom . ”
There 's a lot to love about Tron , but for me it all pales in comparison to the lightcycles .

But you 'll want to hurry .

Tron Legacy Bike Appears in Meatspace
We 've seen the badass trailer for Tron Legacy , but now here 's a shot of one of the new light bikes …
Read more
The limited edition of five lightcycles — each made to movie spec , but with actual working parts — comes from the same outfit that brought you the $ 100,000 Batpod .
These babies will put a hurt on your savings , too , but at $ 35,000 they 're almost tempting enough to consider .
Especially since they 're a limited edition :
The Parker Brothers team is building 5 custom one off " Lightcycles " to the exact specs of the movie bikes .
Each bike will be black with an accent color - 5 bikes with 5 different accent colors ( red , blue , yellow , green , and orange ) .
There will only be one bike made per color so if you must have a certain color , you better call now ...
Now , about the bikes themselves , the wheels are custom made 22 " x 12 " dual hubless wheels with custom made tires ( Hoosier is custom making 5 sets just for us specifically for this project ) .
( Buyers will have the option of additional tires as needed )
The frame is 2 " cold rolled and boxed hardened steel with carbon fiber / fiberglass bodies .
Accent colors are neon glowing from behind frosted plexiglass and can be turned off or on with the flip of a switch .

Oh , and did I mention that each bike comes with a Tron helmet ?
And that you 'll be able to watch yours be built on YouTube ?
This .
This is what I want for my next ten birthdays and Christmases combined .

Tatiana Suarez will be showing at DC ’s street art gallery Art Whino .
She was nice enough to answer a few questions for RVA on the upcoming show and approach to her work .
If you are in the harbor area swing through and check the place out , its definitely worth it .
Megan Laurine :
Tell us a bit about yourself ; what are you into , what do you like to do outside of painting , any other jobs on the side ?
Tatiana Suarez : I ’ve been lucky enough to focus full time on my painting for the last couple of years .
When I ’m not painting , my side jobs include freelance design and illustration work .
As for what I do for fun , currently I enjoy watching movies .
Spending time hanging out with loved ones .
Chatting over some drinks .
On rooftops .
While playing dominoes .
Yep .
Megan Laurine :
Why painting as opposed to any other fine art medium ?
Tatiana Suarez :
It ’s just the medium I was introduced to really early on , and I just stuck with it .
Painting and drawing also runs in the family .
Plus it ’s fun and messy .

Art class was the only class since elementary that I looked forward to attending .
It was my only ‘ A + ’ class , haha .
I never went to art school , but my parents always had me enlisted in after school cartooning and painting classes .
In college I stopped painting and focused more on graphic design .
It was n’t until after a couple of years of working in advertising , that I decided to once again focus on developing my paintings .
All in all , it was a decision I ’m really glad I made .
Megan Laurine :
Where does your imagery stem from ?
Tatiana Suarez : Ladies , fashion , movies , life experiences , cultures & heritage , folklore , critters , colors , shapes …
Megan Laurine :
You include an odd assortment of creatures to accompany your figures , any particular reason why you choose the ‘ pets ’ that you do ?
Tatiana Suarez : I just really love animals , especially the unusual ones that others might find creepy .
I ’ve played momma to plenty of exotic pets growing up … from chameleons to sugar gliders .
Megan Laurine :
Is there a dialogue behind your work ; are there subtle narratives to be understood ?
Tatiana Suarez : Most of my work to date has been simply portraits , just focusing on the women , their emotions , and adorning them .
I keep them mysterious .
They are meant to be enjoyed by the viewer , and adapt to their own narrative .
Megan Laurine :
If you could characterize this body of work on the fly , which personal descriptions immediately come to mind ?
Tatiana Suarez : Curvy , colorful , seductive .
I like to picture drums thumping in the background , heh .
Megan Laurine :
What other genres of art are you attracted to outside of your own style of work ?
Tatiana Suarez : Cartooning , animation , illustration , digital art …
Megan Laurine :
Do you draw inspiration from any other artists , past or present ?
Tatiana Suarez : Of course !
Oof , there ’s way too many for me to name .
Here are a few from the top of my head : Gil Elvgren , Alphonse Mucha , James Jean , Audrey Kawasaki , Chet Zar , Dave Cooper , Rockin ’ Jelly Bean , Lori Early , Fafi , Nouar Boldy .
Just a few names that help make my mind tick .
Megan Laurine : Overall , what is your take on the New Brow scene in contemporary art ?
Tatiana Suarez :
It ’s great !
* thumbs up * Just an awesome opportunity to explore , experiment , challenge and create some honest , true to heart , attention - grabbing art .
Megan Laurine :
As an emerging artist , what do you think is the biggest challenge in the contemporary art world right now ?
Tatiana Suarez :
It ’s like anything else ?
So many people doing the same thing as you .
Be original .
Try and stand out .
Megan Laurine :
As artists , we all experience the evolution of our work ;
What do you see yourself doing next ?
Tatiana Suarez : Yes , always evolving and learning !
I ’m not too sure yet on what the future holds .
I plan on exploring my work , perhaps composing some more narrative , and personal pieces .
I want to continue painting on walls and have also been curious on playing with some 3D stuff , we ’ll see !
Megan Laurine :
What do you like most about your work , and what you do ?
Tatiana Suarez :
The entire process is always a ride I enjoy .
I go through so many changes and detours with my pieces , plenty of shape and color shifting .
When the piece finally starts coming together and I feel in control …it ’s really a great feeling .
I ’m just so lucky to be able to do what I love .
Megan Laurine :
What has been your greatest achievement so far as an independent artist ?
Tatiana Suarez :
Oh man , greatest achievement so far has been the opportunity to show overseas !
Seeing my name on art blogs I ’ve always followed , painting on a wall …
Megan Laurine :
What are you looking forward to most about coming back and showing in D.C. , any exciting things you ’re going be getting into ( well , besides hanging out with us .
haha ) ?
Tatiana Suarez : Well I just look forward to being in DC again , I was only there for a short period of time .
Meeting new people of course .
Honestly , I really have n’t had a chance to plan anything out yet , it ’s been hectic !
Megan Laurine :
Any shout - outs , words of advice , or general nonsense you ’d care to share with our readers ?
Tatiana Suarez : I would like to give a shout out to my friends and family for all of the support .
The awesome boyfriend for his patience , thanks for putting up with my crazy , freak - out moments in preparation for the show .
Some words of advice : Keep loving what you do and be dedicated .
Some general nonsense : Boop .

A 90 - year - old woman who went in to get her leg amputated last month at a hospital in Sankt Johann , Tyrol , had the wrong limb removed , Austrian media reported Friday .
The patient , who suffered from vascular disease , was meant to have her leg amputated below the hip and went in for the operation on June 16 .
After doctors realised they had removed her healthy leg , the elderly woman finally had the correct limb amputated in a second operation a few days later , reports said .
The prosecution in Innsbruck has now launched an investigation for " injury by negligence , " while the surgeon who handled the procedure has been suspended after 25 years on the job , the Austria Press Agency reported .
In a statement , the hospital said human error as well as a breakdown in safety measures were to blame for the mistake , adding that it would " do everything to guarantee this incident is clarified without fault . "
The patient 's life was not in danger and she was due to leave hospital in the next few days , the reports said .
Her relatives had asked the hospital not to make the incident public , the management told the Kleine Zeitung newspaper , which first reported on it .

While the Right howls that Obama is using the Gulf oil spill for political gain they forget that , in 1989 , after the Exxon Valdez President G.H. Bush used that disaster to pass the Clean Air Act .
The lesson being that it takes a disaster in order to get Americans and their politicians to take the environment seriously .
Apparently , this was before clean air became a liberal initiative .
You know , back when the conservatives were a willing part of humanity and before the science - denying nut jobs took over .
At any rate , the Exxon Valdez disaster made the public more receptive to the need for environmental protection and Bush was able to pass the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 .
Advertisements
According to PBS ’s American Experience ,
“ In his first year in office , President Bush announced his version of the Clean Air Act .
His support transformed the atmosphere on Capitol Hill and made passage of the bill possible .
The initiative ’s success was also inadvertently aided by the Exxon Valdez disaster .
The sight of millions of gallons of oil spilling into the ocean off the coast of Alaska in March 1989 created more favorable conditions among legislators and the American people for the passage of environmental legislation . ”
By the way , to put this into perspective , Alaskans were seeking $ 4.6 billion in punitive damages , an amount Exxon said was excessive .
President Bush never interjected himself into this , never forced BP to put money into escrow , and in the end his son ’s SCOTUS slashed Exxon ’s liability tenfold .
Just as Obama has been criticized in the Gulf for his lack of response , it was March 24 , 1989 when the Exxon Valdez went aground on Bligh Reef near Valdez and it took two weeks for President Bush to make an announcement about the spill .
The President ’s failure to respond in a timely manner resulted in what the press dubbed “ Pelican Gate ” and the resulting legislation was what ordered the President to direct the clean up of a private oil company in the event of a spill .
He can direct , but not overtake , which is an odd place to be , frankly .
Responsibility without authority in a sense , but I digress .
The real point is that Bush Sr was also charged with all of the attending accusations of not doing enough that Obama is .
Bush did n’t go to Alaska , did n’t talk with fisherman , did n’t force Exxon to put money in escrow – but he did use the disaster to pass major environmental legislation .
The very thing the Right is accusing Obama of doing .
Last night , in his Oval Office address , Obama announced :
“ One of the lessons we ’ve learned from this spill is that we need better regulations better safety standards , and better enforcement when it comes to offshore drilling .
But a larger lesson is that no matter how much we improve our regulation of the industry , drilling for oil these days entails greater risk .
After all , oil is a finite resource .
We consume more than 20 % of the world ’s oil , but have less than 2 % of the world ’s oil reserves .
And that ’s part of the reason oil companies are drilling a mile beneath the surface of the ocean – because we ’re running out of places to drill on land and in shallow water . ”
Thus putting the nation on notice that change was a comin’ .
The Right ’s accusation of using a disaster for political gain is flawed from the beginning in this instance because there is a legitimate problem and it needs to be addressed .
The change we need is not political gain , it ’s reality .
To deny this is quite frankly bizarre at this point .
The oil spill is the result of lax regulations and rampant deregulations accumulating over the past 40 years but brought to new lows during Bush Jr’s 8 years at the helm .
New regulations are necessary .
Furthermore , the claims that offshore drilling is safe are almost patently absurd at this point .
Under what definition of safe do the many oil spills we ’ve encountered fall ?
The Deepwater Horizon spill is an example of what can happen .
And it is happening .
Perhaps it did n’t need to happen , but then , we would have to have strict regulations in place and costly fail - safe devices mandated in order to mitigate the risk .
And yet the Right is arguing against these .
They want us to rely upon the goodness of BP ’s heart .
But we already know that oil companies have no heart .
We saw that in the Exxon Valdez disaster , when Exxon kept Alaskans tied up in court until The Supreme Court ordered that punitive damages be no more than $ 507.5 million , down from the $ 2.5 billion ordered by a U.S. appeals court and the jury ’s original verdict of $ 5 billion .
It would be illogical to rely upon any company that has a fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders to willingly pay the Gulf residents what they ’re due .
And yes , if you ’ve been paying attention to the Right , this was Palin ’s claim to fame on Fox — that she righted this situation .
Sister Sarah to the rescue or some such thing .
However , Reuters reported :
“ Palin ’s claims of victory for the plaintiffs and of playing a role in achieving that victory are highly distorted , said the chief attorney for the approximately 32,000 plaintiffs that sued Exxon over damages from the worst oil - tanker spill in U.S. waters .
“ That is the most cockamamie bullshit , ” said Dave Oesting of Anchorage , lead plaintiff attorney in the private litigants ’ civil case against Exxon and its successor , Exxon Mobil Corp .
“ She did n’t have a damn thing to do with it , and she did n’t know what it was about . ” ”
Given this , it ’s probably best if the President continues to disregard Mrs. Palin ’s rather frantic and rash pleas for attention and determination to insinuate herself into the fray at any cost .
Let us get down to the business of serious governing and leave the half - term governor to explain the many oil spills that took place during her book tour last year .
The time has come for an alternative energy bill to be passed .
The Republican Senators needs to get off their collective behinds and get this thing done .
Stop stalling the bill !
For once , boys , think of your country first .
We ’re 40 years behind and in dire circumstances .
Wesley Warren , director of programs for the NRDC , said to Newsweek : “ Politics is the art of the possible .
The President is trying to create the public demand and set a time limit for the Senate to act or get out of the way . ”
If Exxon Valdez brought about any good , it brought us the Clean Air Act .
Let the Deepwater Horizon spill bring us an Alternative Energy Bill and sensible regulations overseen by a cleaned out and separated MMS Dept of Interior .
If any President can use a tragedy to bring about positive and necessary change in the people , it is this President .
Keep your fingers crossed .

The distant galaxy ( bright yellow ) is seen as it was 11 billion years ago
Europe 's Herschel space telescope has spied a far - distant galaxy with the aid of a cosmic " zoom lens " .
The observatory is already one of the most powerful astronomical tools ever built , but its abilities can be boosted thanks to a neat trick of gravity .
By viewing a huge cluster of galaxies , Herschel has been able to study in detail an even more distant object .
THE HERSCHEL SPACE TELESCOPE
The flagship European telescope is sited over a million km from Earth
Its instruments sense long wavelength radiation - from the far - infrared to the sub-millimetre
Its 3.5 m diameter , silicon - carbide mirror is the largest mirror ever flown in space
Herschel is designed to probe clouds of gas and dust to see stars being born
The observatory will investigate how galaxies have evolved through time
The mission will end when the Herschel detectors ' helium refrigerant boils off Herschel in sound and pictures
This is possible because the gravity of the foreground cluster magnifies the light of the background galaxy .
In a new picture released by the European Space Agency ( Esa ) , this far - off galaxy is seen just a couple of billion years after the Big Bang .
" If the cluster were not there , we might not be able to see the galaxy , " commented Professor Seb Oliver from the University of Sussex , UK .
" It would certainly have appeared much , much fainter ; and we think we are seeing back to an epoch of really important star formation , " he told BBC News .
The gravitational lensing technique has famously been used in the past by the Hubble Space Telescope , and it was to an old Hubble lens that Herschel turned on this occasion .
Abell 2218 is a colossal aggregation in space some two billion light - years from Earth in the northern constellation Draco .
Its compact mass is equivalent to many thousands of galaxies , and this huge concentration of matter distorts and maximises the light from the objects that sit behind it .
The way this natural zoom lens in the sky works is a beautiful consequence of Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity .
In Hubble 's images of Abell 2218 , far - distant galaxies appear as multiple arcs and arclets smeared across the field of view .
In Herschel 's observation of the same scene using its Spire instrument , the distant galaxies appear as slightly fuzzy blobs .
The bright yellow blob in the centre of the new Herschel image is a galaxy seen as it was 11 billion years ago .
The differences in the Hubble and Herschel pictures are a direct consequence of the varied wavelengths at which the two telescopes operate .
Hubble sees the Universe in the optical and near - infrared , and these wavelengths produce very sharp forms in the telescope 's images .
HERSCHEL AND HUBBLE VIEW THE ABELL 2218 GALAXY CLUSTER
The huge concentration of matter in Abell 2218 distorts and magnifies the light from the objects that sit far behind it
In Hubble 's image of Abell 2218 ( right ) , these distant galaxies are seen as multiple arcs that smear across the field of view
In Herschel 's image ( left ) , Abell 2218 is centred on the cross -hair .
Most Hubble features are transparent at Herschel wavelengths
The large yellow blob just below the cross -hair is a distant galaxy .
Its light has been boosted by the foreground cluster
This far - off galaxy is seen as it was about 2.6 billion years after the Big Bang , providing a glimpse into early star formation
Other structures that can be seen in the image ( blue blobs ) are also galaxies , but these are in the foreground cluster
The two pictures demonstrate how the Hubble and Herschel space telescopes can be used together to probe the Universe
Herschel , on the other hand , is sensitive to much longer wavelengths , in the far - infrared and sub- millimetre range , and its pictures are naturally much softer .
But it is this ultra-long - wavelength sensitivity that allows Herschel to see the processes that initiate star formation in clouds of very cold gas and dust - a perspective completely hidden from Hubble .
Dr Michael Zemcov of the California Institute of Technology says : " Images like this show that Spire has opened up the possibility of observing at sub-mm wavelengths in a way that was just not possible before ; this kind of clarity is unprecedented at these wavelengths .
" Now that these data are available to the entire astronomical community , we will really be able to test our understanding of objects like galaxy clusters and , more profoundly , the formation of structure in the Universe from soon after the Big Bang right up to the present day . "
The new imagery is part of the Herschel Multi- tiered Extragalactic Survey ( HerMES ) , a project to study the evolution of galaxies in the distant Universe .
It is the largest project using Herschel data .
The European Space Agency 's billion - euro observatory was sent into orbit on an Ariane rocket on 14 May last year .
It is positioned far from Earth to give it an unobstructed view of deep space .

Jim Morrison liked to brag about his fast - lane lifestyle .
“ I ’m gonna get my kicks before the whole s – – thouse goes up in flames , ” he was fond of saying .
Turns out his body was the
s – – thouse .
And like an arsonist in leather pants , he burned it to the last cinder , a spectacle that nobody close to him enjoyed watching .
“ It was very upsetting to sit by and watch him deteriorate , ” Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek tells
The Post while reminiscing about the Lizard King ’s most debauched moments .
The dark side of Morrison ’s fame and charisma is revisited in the new documentary “ When You ’re Strange : A Film About The Doors , ” out on DVD Tuesday , also featuring guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore .
Loaded with previously unreleased concert footage , family films and a candid interview with Morrison ’s Navy - officer father , director Tom DiCillo ’s film chronicles the group ’s dizzying success , drug -
induced hardships , chaotic concerts and six classic albums .
Here are some of the film ’s maniacal Morrison moments , along with Manzarek ’s recollections :
 West Hollywood , 1966 : Morrison drops so much acid at the Whiskey A - Go - Go that he collapses onstage .
“ I took LSD , too — it helped open the doors to perception , ” Manzarek says .
“ LSD could show you heaven , but it could also show you hell .
A bad acid trip could take away all the swirling energy that makes you live .
We really did n’t take it before shows , though .
Well , maybe Jim did .
Normally , John , Robby and I would smoke a joint and drink some beers before [ going ] onstage . ”
 Los Angeles , 1968 : The band ’s sessions for “ The Soft Parade ” are constantly upended by Morrison ’s erratic behavior .
“ I think aggravating is the perfect word , ” he says .
“ We would sit there and hope the good Jim Morrison would show up .
Sometimes he did and the studio sessions were fantastic .
But then ‘ Jimbo ’ would appear , completely drunk and unable to string together a sentence without slurring .
It was the height of his alcoholism .
“ The guys in the band would try and help him , but it did n’t help .
He was an Irish poet and what do they do ?
Drink and drink and drink . ”
 Miami , 1969 : Morrison whips out Jim Jr. at the Dinner Key Auditorium .
Cops promptly arrest him for indecent exposure .
“ Sure I was scared — the crowd was in a frenzy , ” Manzarek says .
“ I thought they were going to grab Jim and tear him to pieces .
I actually kept on playing the keyboard , though .
It was my job to keep the music going .
[ Laughs ]
I mean they were n’t going to attack me — I ’m only the keyboard player .
The lead singer is the one in danger .
By the way :
Do people even go wild at rock concerts anymore ? ”
 Paris , 1971 : Morrison dies in the bathtub of his apartment , apparently from a heroin overdose .
“ When I found out , it completely broke my heart , ” he says .
“ You could see my reaction in the film .
The group died spiritually , creatively and even financially .
It ’s really sad because it seemed Jim [ had ] resurrected his life .
He went out to Paris for a break after ‘ L.A. Woman , ’ and we planned to record a new album with him shortly after .
Unfortunately , he never came back . ”
In the following clip , Mythbusters host Adam Savage explains how the Discovery Channel rejected one of the myths his team wanted to bust after looking at the somehow gruesome but hilarious footage they had recorded for the show .

Editor 's Note :
There has recently been a flurry of discussion prompted by an article by raw - animal - product advocate Denise Minger , which criticizes The China Study and attacks its author , Dr. T. Colin Campbell .
Minger questions Dr. Campbell 's personal motives and attempts to impugn his character .
Dr. Campbell recently took time to review Minger 's observations and respond .
You can read Minger 's original article below , linked at the start of Dr. Campbell 's response .
Previously we at VegSource had looked at some of Minger 's anti-Campbell rhetoric .
One thing we were struck by early on was the fact that Minger apparently removes comments on her blog from scientific researchers who point out the flaws in her reasoning and in her understanding of accepted research methods .
In his report below Dr. Campbell notes an example of one researcher whose critical post was removed .
A cancer epidemiologist who says she posted criticism of Minger 's methods last week on Minger 's blog complained in a posting on VegSource that her critical post first appeared and then was removed from the Comments area of Minger 's blog .
In fact , Minger herself posted on VegSource in response to this epidemeologist 's complaint , and did not deny that the epidemeologist 's critical comments had been yanked .
After complaining on VegSource about the post disappearing , the epidemiologist 's post apparently reappeared on Minger 's blog .
( Minger subsquently said something about a " spam filter " being at fault . )
As the exchange showed , it was clear to the epidemologist that Minger was out of her depth , and she offered to give Minger some some assistance and teach Minger some proper methods of analysis .
In response Minger expressed excitement at hoping to attract professional researchers to help examine Dr. Campbell 's data in the future , and see if they can aid Minger in proving Dr. Campbell is wrong in some way .
Minger wrote that if she could enlist actual researchers who could help her poke holes in China Study data , " this could be a really great opportunity to grab the attention of the medical community . "
About the only community interested in the kind of thing Minger is attempting would be the pro-beef Weston Price Foundation and the meat industry .
Minger may find helpers coming forward from those ranks and offering their assistance ; many have already tried unsuccessfully for years to attack and undercut the message of Dr. Campbell 's life work .
On their own website , the Weston Price people express how thrilled they are that Minger has joined in their attempts to discredit Dr. Campbell 's work .
( In fact , Minger is a fan of the Weston Price Foundation and recommends their work to others .
You can read an expose about the Price Foundation at the end of Dr. Campbell 's article -- which includes the revelation that Price himself , the founder , actually recommended a vegetarian diet to his family as the most healthy . )
Of course , Minger expresses no interest in publicizing any of her work when it shows Campbell is correct .
We see this often ; someone trying to build some credibility on their own by taking aim at the biggest target they can find in hope that they can punch a hole , thus showing themselves to be smart enough to take down the big guy .
Unqualified to actually do any kind of study of her own , Minger hopes to find flaws in the peer - reviewed work of researchers from Oxford University , Cornell University , and the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine .
Except she 's not up to the task of taking on professional researchers who have to work to the most rigorous standards in academia .
These are slightly higher than standards for kids blogging on the web .
A critic 's post pointing out some of Minger 's errors disappears from her blog , and reappears when the critic starts complaining about it elsewhere on the web .
Minger then publicly admits that she could use help understanding Dr. Campbell 's research , because she does n't have professional expertise to analyze and interpret the data she 's pontificating about .
23 - year - old Minger lists her educational and professional qualifications on her Facebook page as writer , Catholic school teacher , summer camp instructor , and " Professional Sock Puppeteer . "
So we were mildly surprised that Dr. Campbell felt he needed to take the time to dignify Minger 's musings with a response .
Still , this is the internet , and I guess sometimes it does n't hurt to respond , even if the attacks constitute no more than a mosquito bite .
So just in case there are individuals who might feel there was merit to any of Minger 's scientific - sounding speculation , here is Dr. Campbell 's response :
Reply to Denise Minger
by Dr. T. Colin Campbell , PhD , author The China Study
Ms. Denise Minger has published a critique of our book , The China Study , as follows .
The China Study : Fact or Fallacy ? by Denise Minger - article found at : http://bit.ly/9s5pn8
It is both interesting and gratifying that there has been such a huge response , both on her blog and on those of others .
This is a welcome development because it gives this topic an airing that has long been hidden in the halls and annals of science .
It is time that this discussion begin to reach a much larger audience , including both supporters and skeptics .
I hope at some point to be able to read all of the discussions and the questions that have been raised , but present deadlines and long - standing commitments have forced me , for now , to focus on the most common concerns and questions , in order to respond in a timely manner here .
Kudos to Ms. Minger for having the interest , and taking the time , to do considerable analysis , and for describing her findings in readily accessible language .
And kudos to her for being clear and admitting , right up front , that she is neither a statistician nor an epidemiologist , but an English major with a love for writing and an interest in nutrition .
We need more people with this kind of interest .
I am the first to admit that background and academic credentials are certainly not everything , and many interesting discoveries and contributions have been made by " outsiders " or newcomers in various fields .
On the other hand , background , time in the field , and especially peer review , all do give one a kind of perspective and insight that is , in my experience , not attainable in any other way .
I will try to make clear in my comments below when this is particularly relevant .
My response can be divided into three parts , mostly addressing her argument 's lack of proportionality -- what 's important and what 's not .
Misunderstanding our book 's objectives and my research findings
Excessive reliance on the use of unadjusted correlations in the China database
Failure to note the broader implications of choosing the right dietary lifestyle
Before proceeding further , however , I would like to make a general comment about my approach in responding to Denise .
I believe Denise is a very intelligent person , and I can see how she might reach the conclusions she did ; this is easy to do for someone without extensive scientific research experience .
Having said this , there are fundamental flaws in her reasoning , and it is these flaws that I will address in this paper .
Some might wonder , " Why did n't he go through her laundry list of claims and address each one in the same order ? "
The answer is simple : these claims are derived from the same faulty reasoning , so it is this underlying problem that I will address .
I do in fact illustrate this point by addressing one of her claims regarding wheat , and the reader can assume that one could go through a similar exercise with all her claims .
A. Not understanding the book 's objectives .
The findings described in the book are not solely based on the China survey data , even if this survey was the most comprehensive ( not the largest ) human study of its kind .
As explained in the book , I draw my conclusions from several kinds of findings and it is the consistency among these various findings that matter most .
First and foremost , our extensive work on the biochemical fundamentals of the casein effect on experimental cancer in laboratory animals ( only partly described in our book ) was prominent because these findings led to my suggestion of fundamental principles and concepts that apply to the broader effects of nutrition on cancer development .
These principles were so compelling that they should apply to different species , many nutrients , many cancers and an almost unlimited list of health and disease responses ( e.g. , nutritional control of gene expression , multi-mechanistic causation , reversal of cancer promotion but not reversal of initiation , rapidity of nutritional response , etc. ) .
These principles also collectively and substantially inferred major health benefits of whole plant - based foods .
This earlier laboratory work , extensively published in the very best peer - reviewed journals , preceded the survey in China .
These findings established the essence of what can be called biological plausibility , one of the most important pillars establishing the reliability of epidemiological research .
[ Biological plausibility represents established evidence showing how a cause - effect relationship works at the biological level , one of the principles of epidemiology research established by the epidemiology pioneer , Sir Bradford Hill . ]
Unfortunately , this issue of biological plausibility too often escapes the attention of statisticians and epidemiologists , who are more familiar with ' number crunching ' than with biological phenomena .
The first 15 - 20 years of our work was not , as some have speculated , an investigation specifically focused on the carcinogenic effects of casein .
It was primarily a series of studies intended to understand the basic biology of cancer and the role of nutrition in this disease .
The protein effect , of course , was remarkable , and for this reason , it was a very useful tool to give us a novel insight into the workings of the cancer process .
[ Nonetheless , the casein effect , which was studied in great depth and , if judged by the formal criteria for experimentally determining which chemicals classify as carcinogens , places casein in the category of being the most relevant carcinogen ever identified . ]
Second , this survey in rural China , based on a very unique population and experimental format ( from several perspectives ) , resulted in the collection of an exceptionally comprehensive database that , to a considerable extent , permitted the testing of hypotheses and principles learned in the laboratory , both mine and others .
By ' testing ' , I mean questioning whether any evidence existed in the China database to support a protective effect characterized by the nutritional composition of a plant - based diet .
I was not sure what might be found but nonetheless became impressed with what was eventually shown .
The China project data afforded an opportunity to consider the collective interplay and effects of many potentially causative factors with many disease outcomes -- the very definition of nutrition ( my definition of nutrition is not about the isolated effects of individuals nutrients , or even foods for that matter ) .
The China project encouraged us not to rely on independent statistical correlations with little or no consideration of biological plausibility .
In the book , I drew my conclusions from six prior models of investigation to illustrate this approach : breast cancer , liver cancer , colon cancer ( minimally ) , energy utilization / body weight control , affluent disease - poverty disease and protein vs. body growth rates .
Using this strategy , I first inquired whether a collection of variables in the China survey ( ranging from univariate correlations to more sophisticated analyses ) could consistently and internally support each of these biologically plausible models and , second , I determined whether the findings for each of these models were consistent with the overarching hypothesis that a whole food , plant - based diet promotes health - - I could not discuss much of this rationale in a page - limited book intended for the public .
Most importantly , I cannot emphasize enough that the findings from the China project , standing alone , do not solely determine my final views expressed in the book .
That 's why only one chapter of 18 was devoted to the China survey project , which is only one link in a chain of experimental approaches .
I was simply asking the question whether there were biologically plausible data in the China database to support the findings gained in our laboratory , among others .
Because of the uniqueness of the China database , I believed that the evidence was highly supportive .
One of the unique characteristics of this survey was the traditional dietary practices of this cohort of people .
Mostly , they were already consuming a diet largely comprised of plant - based foods , thus limiting our ability to detect an hypothesized plant - based food effect -- thus making our final observations that much more impressive .
Third , in the book , we summarized findings from other research groups for a variety of diseases to determine the consistency of our model with their findings , according to my principles and concepts .
One of the most compelling parts of this exercise was the fact that so many of their findings , although published in good peer - reviewed journals , had been and were continuing to be ignored and / or distorted , a very disturbing and puzzling phenomenon .
This posed for me the question , why ?
My participation in extensive reviews of the work of others during my 20 - year stint working on or as a member of expert committees gave me a particularly rich opportunity to consider these previously published studies .
There still is , and for a long time has been , an intentional effort at various levels of science hierarchy to denigrate studies that speak to the more fundamental biology of plant - based diets .
The fact that there has been resistance , oftentimes hostile and personal in the lay community , speaks volumes to me .
Fourth , and most importantly , there is the enormously impressive findings of my physician colleagues , which came to my attention near the end of the China project data collection period and which were showing remarkable health benefits of plant - based nutrition , involving not only disease prevention but also disease treatment ( alphabetically : Diehl , Esselstyn , Goldhamer , Klaper , McDougall , Ornish , Shintani - and many others since the book 's publication : T. Barnard , N. Barnard , Corso , Fuhrman , Lederman , Montgomery , Popper , Pulde , Schulz , Shewman ) .
I cannot overemphasize the remarkable accomplishments of these primary care physicians .
In effect , their work affirmed my earlier laboratory research .
I should add that I knew none of them or their work during my career in the laboratory , thus was not motivated or biased to find ways to affirm their work .
It was the combination of these various lines of inquiry that made so compelling the larger story told in the book , at least for me .
Denise mostly ignores these fundamental but highly consistent parts of my story .
In that vein , I strongly believe that the findings of no single study in biology or even a group of similar studies should be taken too seriously until context is established .
Biology is not for engineers and number crunchers , as important as they may be , because , compared to their systems , biological response is much more complex and dynamic .
B. The use of ' raw ' univariate correlations .
In a study like this survey in China ( ecologic , cross- sectional ) , univariate correlations represent one - to - one associations of two variables , one perhaps causal , the other perhaps effect .
Use of these correlations ( about 100,000 in this database ) should only be done with caution , that is , being careful not to infer one - to - one causal associations .
Even though this project provided impressive and highly unique experimental features , using univariate correlations to identify specific food vs. specific disease associations is not one of these redeeming features , for several reasons .
First , a variable may reflect the effects of other factors that change along with the variable under study .
Therefore , this requires adjustment for confounding factors -- mostly , this was not done by Denise .
Second , for a variable to have information of value ( as in making a correlation ) , it must exhibit a sufficient range .
If , for example , a variable is measured in 65 counties ( as in China ) , there must be a distribution of values over a sufficiently broad range for it to be useful .
Third , the variables should represent exposures representative of prior years when the diseases in question are developing .
I see little or no indication that Denise systematically considered each of these requirements .
I should point out that when we were deciding to publish these data in the original monograph , we decided to do something highly unusual in science -- to publish the uninterpreted raw correlations , hoping that future researchers would know how to use or not use them .
We felt that this highly unusual decision was necessary because we were wary of those in the West who might have doubted the validity of data collected in China -- we had several experiences to suspect this .
But also , we believe that research should be as transparent as possible , simply for the sake of transparency , thus minimizing suspicion of hidden agendas .
We knew that taking this approach was a risk because there could be those who , knowing little or nothing about experimentation of this type , might wish to use the data for their own questionable purposes .
Nonetheless , we decided to be generous and , in order advise future users of these data , we added our words of caution -- written about 1988 - - as part of our 894 - page monograph .
I also have repeated this caution in other publications of mine .
It seems that Denise missed reading this material in the monograph .
As I was writing this , I discovered this comment from a self - described professional epidemiologist ( PhD , cancer epidemiology ) on one of the blogs ( A Cancer Epidemiologist refutes Denise Mingers China Study Claims due to incorrect data analysis - 30 Bananas a Day ! ) -- a comment that is relevant to the point that I am now addressing in this response .
I do not know this person but did find her comment interesting .
After reviewing Denise 's critique , she wrote the following for her ( Denise 's ) blog , only then to see it quickly and mysteriously disappear .
" Your analysis is completely OVER - SIMPLIFIED .
Every good epidemiologist / statistician will tell you that a correlation does NOT equal an association .
By running a series of correlations , you 've merely pointed out linear , non-directional , and unadjusted relationships between two factors .
I suggest you pick up a basic biostatistics book , download a free copy of " R " ( an open - source statistical software program ) , and learn how to analyze data properly .
I 'm a PhD cancer epidemiologist , and would be happy to help you do this properly .
While I 'm impressed by your crude , and - at best - preliminary analyses , it is quite irresponsible of you to draw conclusions based on these results alone .
At the very least , you need to model the data using regression analyses so that you can account for multiple factors at one time . "
This blogger is making the same point that I am making but I am puzzled why was it deleted from Denise 's blog ?
Lest it be forgotten , the main value of the China data set is its descriptive nature , thus providing a baseline against which other data sets can be broadly compared , either over time or over geographic space .
I must emphasize : the correlations published in our monograph CANNOT be blindly used to infer causality -- at least for specific cause - effect associations having no biological plausibility .
Nonetheless , they do offer a rich trove of opportunities to generate interesting hypotheses , relatively few of which have been explored to date .
In contrast , using models representing biological plausibility , which was determined from prior research , I simply wanted to see if they were consistent with the China survey data .
For the sake of understanding the downside risk of using univariate correlations , I 'll use this imaginary conversation involving a few correlations that Denise thought were relevant to her personal allergy to wheat , although many other examples from Denise 's treatise could serve the same purpose .
Denise makes a point concerning a highly significant ( but unadjusted ) univariate correlation between wheat flour consumption and two cardiovascular diseases plus a couple other diseases .
In doing so , she infers that wheat flour causes these cardiovascular diseases .
She also makes the point that " none of these correlations appear to be tangled with any risk - heightening variables , either . "
And further , she implies that I ignored this potentially important correlation , perhaps intentionally , because of my alleged bias against meat .
I use this particular example here because others who very much dislike my views have pointed out on the Internet that this example cited by Denise represents evidence of my lack of integrity .
The conversation goes like this , after Denise reminds me of these univariate correlations .
" Denise , that correlation of wheat flour and heart disease is interesting but I am not aware of any prior and biologically plausible and convincing evidence to support an hypothesis that wheat causes these diseases , as you infer . "
" Did you , by any chance , look for evidence whether there might be other variables confounding the wheat flour correlation , variables that change in parallel with wheat flour consumption ?
I presume you did because you said that ' none of these correlations appear to be tangled with any risk - heightening variables . '
" But just a minute , I found some , and they 're all highly statistically significant ( p<0.01 to p<0.001 ) . "
" Higher wheat flour consumption , for example , is correlated , as univariate correlations , with
lower green vegetable consumption ( many of these people live in northern , arid regions where they often consume meat based diets with little no consumption of vegetables ) .
[ By the way , Tuoli county data , to which you refer as my " sin of omission " intentionally were excluded from virtually all our analyses on meat consumption because this county ranked very high when meat consumption was documented at survey time , but much lower when responding to the questionnaire on frequency of meat consumption .
That is , these nomadic people migrate for part of the year to valleys , where they consume more vegetables and fruits . ]
lower serum levels of monounsaturated fats ( possibly increasing risk of heart disease ? )
higher serum levels of urea ( a biomarker of protein consumption )
greater body weight ( higher risk of heart disease ? ) "
" Interestingly , you might be interested to know that all of these variables are known from prior knowledge , i.e. , biological plausibility , to associate with higher risk for heart disease . "
" Denise , this is quite an oversight that could suggest the opposite conclusion from the one that you intended to convey .
Or was this bias reflecting your personal preference for eating raw meat and avoiding wheat flour ?
Any thoughts ? "
" Why did you highlight this relationship as a key example of my " sin of omission " , being even more ' troubling than the distorted facts in The China Study and the details that ( I ) leave out ? ' "
Incidentally , aside from Denise 's claiming there were no confounding factors , I might have taken her seriously when she posed a possible effect of wheat flour on heart disease , because it may be possible to gather prior evidence that could be considered as supporting the opposite point of view .
In fact , this would be a proper use of univariate correlations , simply searching for those correlations that might hint of supporting evidence for such an hypothesis .
If sufficiently convincing , then we could design a more analytical type of study .
This exercise is called hypothesis generation , which is one of the virtues of the China data set .
But Denise is doing something different , coming very close to almost randomly inferring causality without adjusting for confounding factors , without scanning the variables for analytical authenticity and without -- to my knowledge - - having prior evidence of biological plausibility for such an hypothesis .
Then , she uses this example as evidence of a " sin of omission " and a " distorted fact " on my part .
Using these rather inflammatory words infers serious personal indiscretion on my part .
Does she really mean this ?
There are different ways of using univariate correlations in a database like this .
It is not that these correlations are useless and should be ignored .
Rather , it is a question of using them intelligently .
By this , I mean first adjusting these correlations for confounding factors ( if and when possible ) then examining the individual variables of the correlations for authenticity .
Depending on the reliability of these correlations , they may be used to guide whether a hypothetical , cause - effect model , perhaps having preliminary evidence of biological plausibility , is on the right track .
The most critical expertise needed for their use is knowing the underlying biology , which is so often missing among trained statisticians .
The six models to which I referred in our book are those evaluated in this manner .
Yes , when possible , I also used univariate correlations ( along with statistical significance ) in support of these models but only after we had preliminary supportive data for the model ( only brief summarized in the book ) .
Here are a few representative publications of those supportive data for the six models that we explored in our book :

Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1994;59:1153S-1161S ) .
As I previously said , one of my interests in the China database was simply to see if there was evidence supporting the health benefits of a plant - based diet for these various models ( and many more ) .
The fact that we observed a slew of statistically significant results supporting this proposition , especially for a dietary experience having such low total fat and animal based foods , was quite remarkable .
Did every correlation among our 100,000 show the expected ?
This was my comment , verbatim , already published in our book ( that Denise did not acknowledge in her critique ) :
" Do I think the China Study findings constitute absolute scientific proof ?
Of course not .
Does it provide enough information to inform some practical decision - making ?
Absolutely .
An impressive and informative web of information was emerging from this study .
But does every potential strand ( or association ) in this mammoth study fit perfectly into this web of information ?
No .
Although most statistically significant strands readily fit into the web , there were a few surprises .
Most , but not all , have since been explained . "
In summary , Denise 's critique lacks a sense of proportionality .
She gives ( with considerable hyperbole , at times ) the analyses of the China data more weight than they deserve by ignoring the remaining evidence discussed in the other 17 chapters in the book .
The China research project was a cornerstone study , yes , but it was NOT the sole determinant of my views ( as I have repeated , almost ad nauseum in my lectures ) .
In doing so , and except for a few denigrating remarks on our experimental animal research , she also ignores the remaining findings that I presented in our book .
She seems not to understand what our laboratory research was showing .
Using univariate correlations mostly without adjustment for confounding factors , qualification of variable authenticity , and / or biological plausibility can lead to haphazard evidence , subject to the whims of personal bias .
Also , univariate correlations of this type can lead to too much emphasis on individual nutrients and foods as potential causes of events .
Also , as I already mentioned , she questions our omission of the Tuoli County data as if this was some sort of sleight of hand on my part ( in addition to my comments above , I already explained this omission in one of my papers and on my preliminary blog ) .
She over - interprets our very limited ' dairy ' data which only includes 3 counties ( of 65 ) that use a very different product from what we consider to be dairy .
And she continues to characterize my views in reference to veganism and vegetarianism ( I do n't even use these words ) as if I were motivated by an ideology instead of by my consideration of empirical data and biological plausibility .
Not only does Denise misrepresent and misunderstand the rationale for the science in The China Study , her choice of words do not facilitate what she hopes to achieve .
Her overall message , often embellished with adjectives and subjective remarks , appeals to some questionable characters sympathetic to or subservient to the Weston A Price Foundation , a farm lobbying group whose advocates and apologists have accused me of being a " fraud " , a " liar " , a " buffoon " and ( earlier ) an associate of a " terrorist " organization .
I doubt that this is what she wanted to achieve .
These individuals , for much too long , have been carelessly using or even ignoring science to further their own interests , such as advocating for the use of a very high fat , high protein diet mostly consistent with the diet that has caused us so much difficulty .
This name calling means nothing to me personally but it does indicate their desperation with our message .
They would be well advised not to use such tactics because it reflects on them , not me .
Whether Denise intended this is not clear , but the results of her critique is clearly apparent .
I must repeat for emphasis that no single study ( or even a group of similar studies ) is perfect in its design , in its data collection or in its interpretation of results .
From the perspective of developing a research career , I see two possible paths that a researcher may follow .
One option proceeds from experiment to experiment by probing ever deeper into the details of one of those experiments that they may happen upon where precision of measurement matters deeply and where the findings can become useful at some future time - indeed , they may " happen upon " an observation that becomes their life 's work very early in this process , maybe even at the outset .
A second option proceeds ' outwardly ' to better understand the broader implications of a series of findings , or experiments .
I did some of the first but eventually preferred the second , taking each finding not as something to refine into ' perfection ' but to ask whether it was sufficiently compelling to suggest the next obvious experiment that eventually might lead to an important network of findings .
Having done both , I strongly prefer the latter option because the whole , indicated by a network of findings , is often far more useful than its parts .
I also believed that this second option had more potential to meet the interests of the public who funded our research .
I also am very much motivated by the fact that there are far too many individuals needlessly paying a heavy personal price in their health for not having access to information of this kind that could have saved their lives , a moral issue for me .
Under no circumstances was I controlled by what my personal preferences might have been !
In the case of our project in China , I believe that its design , its uniqueness and its execution are virtually without parallel in its quality - thanks very much to my colleagues .
However , as trained people know , making specific inferences about causality is not appropriate in a study of this kind .
The concept of ' ecologic fallacy ' , wherein a univariate correlation is improperly used to diagnose or to treat an individual person , is well known .
In contrast , if one initially has a reasonably convincing and biologically plausible body of data and if the data are appropriately qualified , then using a study like to this to see if there is consistency , is appropriate
This is appropriate in my opinion if the hypothesis being addressed represents a comprehensive causal effect where many factors are acting in concert and where there may be multiple ways of examining the data ( e.g. , multiple factors being consumed , multiple clinical biomarkers of factor tissue status , multiple methods of measurement and , perhaps , even multiple outcomes ) .
This is what we did .
We began with a collection of previously developed cause - effect models ( previously published ) that we could test for consistency with the China data .
We found on balance considerable support in the China database for these models .
As I 've said many times , not all the evidence in the China database supported this conclusion , although the large majority did .
To find this degree of consistency in a population mostly using a low fat , high fiber , whole plant - based foods with little or no processed foods -- where I had thought that we would see little or nothing -- was impressive .
One cannot , as Denise has done , rely on univariate correlations to make conclusions , especially when they are focused on specific foods for specific diseases -- it is too easy to find what one wants to find .
I know that this discussion between Denise and me is difficult to judge by readers of this exchange without having access to the raw data base and without knowing how to use or interpret it .
Accepting this , therefore , I suggest that , in the final analysis , the reliability of any conclusion about complex cause - effect issues should be judged by its ability to predict health outcomes .
In this case , the results of people using a diet of whole , plant - based foods , as shown by physician colleagues ( previously mentioned , McDougall , Esselstyn , Ornish , Barnard , Fuhrman , et al ) as well as by many of the readers of our book are nothing less than incredible .
There is nothing else in medicine like it !
C. Denise 's failure to note the broader implications of choosing the right dietary lifestyle .
I suggest that those people who are so hostile to this message take another look at their reasoning .
There is far more to this story than the interpretation of the scientific data alone .
There are major issues of health care and health care costs , there are serious environmental issues that have not been adequately communicated to the public , and there are political , social and ethical issues that must be considered .
Of most importance , there are people who deserve to hear this message -- namely , the taxpayers who funded this work .
For me to do anything less than to report on these findings is both immoral and unethical .
In the current discussions about this issue , I would urge that it is vitally important that all of us keep these ideas in mind , while being very careful not to promote ideas simply for the sake of defending one 's own personal preferences .
I strongly believe that discussion of these issues focus outwardly for the sake of all of us , not just inwardly for the satisfaction of personal ego .
My greatest mistake throughout this process may have been our acquiescence to our publisher 's choice for our book 's title .
We suggested 200 possible titles , not one of which was ' The China Study ' .
But when we objected , he said that we already had signed the contract and this was his right and responsibility .
We felt locked in , especially because we had already explored publication with about 10 other publishers , some of whom had offered advances ( one very large ) , if we did it their way .
Because we had refused to accept their suggestions ( including at least half the book as recipes , going easy on the references and ' dumbing down ' the language ) , it seemed clear that we had no other choice than to go along with our new publisher who accepted our way of telling this story .
Obviously , the title of our book has been misleading for some because of the inappropriate weight suggested by the China project itself .
When these rather novel data are considered both in reference to biologically plausible , multi-factor models of causation and in reference to the large body of other kinds of studies discussed in the book , the China project database becomes very important .
But relying on the results of this study in isolation , especially when unadjusted univariate correlations are used , is not appropriate .
I should conclude by noting the suggestion of the professional epidemiologist , cited above , who suggested that ultimately Denise may wish to publish her findings in a peer - reviewed journal but who presently felt strongly that the current version would not be accepted .
I concur .

Unlawful Police Search of Cannabis Campaigner
Unlawful Police Search of Cannabis Campaigner ’s Home – Charges Suddenly Dropped
The founder of New Zealand ’s first cannabis club the Daktory , Dakta Green , today described a raid Monday on an 18 - year old cannabis law reform campaigner ’s house in Blenheim as “ completely over the top and unlawful ” .
“ However , because Police knew they had acted improperly in the first place , I am pleased that all charges against this young man have been dropped within 24 - hours of the illegal search and arrest , ” Dakta Green said .
However , Mr Green believes that Josh Lucas , an 18 - year old cannabis law reform campaigner was singled out due to local media attention about his intention to stage a rally in Blenheim protesting the current laws on cannabis .
“ Josh is a highly motivated young man who approached us with his plan to hold a midday march on June 10 , ” said Dakta Green .
“ He then got a bit of a story in the local newspaper , followed by a harshly negative editorial response , and now this . ”
“ I ’m simply appalled by the reaction of the Police .
He was raided at home twice in the same day and now , despite being told that charges are to be dropped , remains on 24 - hour curfew .
It ’s outrageous and draconian ! ”
“ The Police have turned up and searched his house without a warrant , expecting to find drugs there just because this young man has been brave enough to state his political views in public . ”
During the first raid , Police confiscated 3 grams of cannabis ( about 5 joints ) , a bong , and some knives spotted with black paint .
Mr Green said that when Police came back a second time , they remembered to bring a warrant and this time took away brochures , posters and other materials that Mr Lucas had been collecting in preparation for the June 10 rally .
" Attention Police : it is not illegal to campaign to change a law !
It is not illegal to possess posters and brochures which oppose cannabis prohibition laws . "
" When you act in this manner , you are acting politically .
It is not your job to take part in political debate .
Just who is giving you these orders ? " asked Dakta Green .
" Judith Collins must immediately reign in the police force or accept full responsibility and resign .
This is not a police state and we will not allow this to go on under her watch , " Dakta Green concluded .

[ Ladies , gentlemen : Tiger Beatdown is a classy publication , of sophisticated cultural leanings .
Sort of !
We do spend a lot of time talking about the Miley Cyrus !
And the Taylor Swift , and the Judd Apatow movies , and who is the best feminist on NBC ’s Thursday night prime - time programming ( there are so many choices ) .
However , here is one thing that we rarely talk about : Literature .
Which is sort of a strange omission , given that the one thing we know about You , the Reader , for certain is that you … well , that you read .
That one is a given !
Therefore , this week , we bring you What We Read When We Do n’t Read the Internet , a Tiger Beatdown THEME POST PARTY ( again !
And also , WOO ) dedicated to the Ladies and Lit Thing .
Leading us off : The Rejectionist ! ]
When I was younger I did that thing that some of us ladies do , the thing of working very hard to be The Girl Who Was Cool Enough to Hang Out With the Boys .
Being that girl was an exhausting job , fraught with peril ; it involved drinking a whole bunch , not talking much , constantly making sure the boys knew how much more down I was than other girls , and carrying around at all times one of the following three novels :
All the Pretty Horses , On the Road , or Junky ( even at the highest pinnacle of my internalized misogyny , I never made it through Henry Miller ) .
It was an unforgivable sign of weakness to read books about ( let alone by ) women , who sat around in kitchens popping out babies , harping on their menfolk , and doing the dishes .
Women were boring !
They were gross !
Passive !
Or just plain mean !
They did n’t think much !
They could n’t possibly do exciting things , like drive cars across the country or drive spaceships to the moon , kiss girls , duke it out with their fathers in a sudden eruption of years ’ worth of Repressed Sentiment , pursue villains craftily , or survive the streets of turn - of - the - century London as cunning and wily orphans .
A professed affinity for Manfiction was a central tenet of this precarious Cool Girl identity ; a Cool Girl was always ready to support the literary analysis presented by the dudes , even after consuming a fifth of bourbon at three in the morning .
What ’s a manfiction book , exactly ?
It is indeed , almost but not entirely exclusively , a book by a man ; but it is a particular kind of book by a particular kind of man , a Real Man , a virile , manly man , who gallops around on horses in between penning great works .
SOME MORE TELLING CHARACTERISTICS
OF MANFICTION
1 . There are n’t any ladies in it .
2 . Male characters cannot communicate with their sons , brothers , and fathers .
Or anybody else , really ; but they are particularly hampered in inter-man relationships ( this is important to emphasize regularly , because the only men who are capable of talking in polysyllabic phrases to other men are gay , and the only thing less manly than writing thoughtfully about women is writing about gays .
An inability to communicate is the literary equivalent of the empty seat between two dudes in a movie theater ) .
Instead of communicating the men will drink a lot , commit random acts of violence , beat their sons or pets , and drive around in trucks without speaking .
These men do not have daughters .
3 . There is at least one of the following : lots of poor people , cows , hunting , a farm , a blizzardy Midwestern town , terse silences , long journeys on horseback / foot , the dissolution of a marriage .
The dissolution of the marriage is frequently followed by extensive scenarios involving the aging and not -very - attractive male character finding a newfound sense of purpose with one or more very young , very buxom , and very blond ladies with voracious sexual appetites .
The poor people are never happy , as Authenticity can only be conveyed by poor people who are miserable and dissolute .
4 . Maybe there are a few ladies in it .
If those ladies are of color , they will be very sensual , with snapping black eyes .
They will spend the bulk of their time preparing the delicious cuisines of their native cultures .
Probably the adjective “ fiery ” will be used at least once in conjunction with this lady - character ’s appearance .
If the lady is a white lady , she will rest quietly for the duration of the novel , while a variety of man - types engage in fisticuffs over her person , trade her back and forth , or attempt to get in her pants , thus providing the manfiction with its Narrative Arc .
The lady wears a pretty dress which clings alluringly to her figure , unless she is a Bad Lady , in which case she dresses like a slattern ( i.e. wears pants ) .
Bonus points if the lady smells improbably of floral shampoo at all times .
If the lady is older than thirty she ’s definitely a sexless , emasculating bitch , unless she is a predatory but sordid vixen .
5 . Author cites the following as influential in interviews : Harold Bloom , Charles Bukowski , fatherhood ( of a son ) , alcoholism .
Author may have been married many times to one or more very buxom and very blond ladies with voracious sexual appetites , whose age is inversely related to his fame .
6 . But in general , there are n’t any ladies in it .
As reigning high priest of manfiction Cormac McCarthy noted in a relatively recent interview with the Wall Street Journal , it ’s hard to write about ladies .
( “ I was planning on writing about a woman for 50 years .
I will never be competent enough to do so , but at some point you have to try . ” )
It ’s so hard , in fact , that Cormac eschewed the ladies altogether in his most recent , Pulitzer - Prizewinning ( ladies do n’t win the Pulitzer ) novel The Road .
( Mom ca n’t hack the apocalypse and offs herself before the novel ’s action starts , conveniently leaving the stage open for The Most Epic Father - Son Journey of All Time . )
Why is it so hard ?
Is it that fulsome miasma of mystery that issues forth from our ladyparts ?
Our deep , fecund , and irrational thought processes , tied so inextricably to the miracle of childbirth ?
The moist cavern of our wombs ?
What makes us so damn inscrutable , ladies ?
Whatever it is , it ’s so gnarly that only a heroic feat of man-writerly prowess can get a lady into a work of manfiction at all .
It ’s much more challenging , obvs , for man-writers to write about ladies than it is for ladies to write anything at all , which is perhaps why men who do ( see : Atonement ) receive such fawning accolades .
When ladies write about ladies , it ’s a total cakewalk for us –because we already know how ladies work , thanks to our nonstop access to the monolithic feminine consciousness ; a consciousness that is , of course , identical from lady to lady , and smells a little bit like fish .
For years I read , and sometimes even loved , manfiction .
I was well into my twenties before it slowly began to occur to me that the ladies who surrounded me — smart , funny , fearless , awesome ; ladies who hitchhiked across the country solo , hopped trains , taught themselves homesteading , backpacked through the wilderness , played in bands , dressed sexy , dressed like boys ; lades who , in short , unapologetically lived their own lives on their own terms — were nowhere to be found in the books I was reading .
And I missed them .
I did n’t want to keep pretending I was Philip Marlowe while my secret heart knew Chandler ’s only option for me was to get prettier , grow out my hair , put on a sapphire - colored dress , and set to swooning .
I ’m not the first person to point out that a lifetime spent reading against yourself is both disorienting and miserable .
So I do n’t really read manfiction any more ; not because it ’s bad , but because it makes me tired and a little sad .
A lady is not a dishwasher , a font of mystery , a vortex , an unknowable object of desire .
A lady , like any other person , is just someone with her own set of stories .

Pathogens vs. Chemical Contaminants
Why are n't the regulatory agencies doing their job ?
If it 's broken , blame someone else
Dirty secrets of the meat industry
Ethanol waste being used as food
Nothing to see here , folks , just move along
Food " safety " laws will only make things worse
So how can food really be made safer ?
( Natural News ) The USDA 's Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ) recently issued a shocking report ( http://www.usda.gov/oig/webdocs/24601-08-KC.... ) about the condition of the nation 's industrial meat supply .
It turns out that a lot of the U.S. meat supply is tainted with veterinary drugs , pesticides and heavy metals .
According to the report , the USDA 's Food Safety and Inspection Service , or FSIS , continues to fail at properly monitoring the safety of the nation 's meat supply .
So tainted meat is regularly being approved for sale , much of which ends up in school lunch rooms where it is fed to -- guess who ? -- our children !
What 's truly disturbing about this is that the USDA knowsmeat it getting tainted but it 's doing nothing about it .
In fact , the agency regularlytoxic meat to make its way to store shelves without even trying to stop it .
We 're not talking about microbial pathogens here ; we 're talking about .
These contaminants are not cooked off like pathogens are , and they can actuallywhen cooked and become more harmful .
It is important to make this distinction between pathogens like E. coli versus chemical residues like pharmaceutical drugs and heavy metals .
The public usually thinks about food contamination in terms of pathogens but often does n't consider the The types of contaminants that are ending up in meat are things likeandthat industrial agriculture uses to keep animals from dying before slaughter .
You see , industrial farming is so filthy and unnatural that animals raised there would n't stand a chance without a steady stream of drugs to keep them alive .
The irony about the excess use of drugs and antibiotics is that these things actually end upthe diseases they are meant to treat and prevent .
But the conditions in which these animals live are typically so horrendous that they probably would n't make it to the slaughter without these toxic chemical interventions .
This is the same question being asked by OIG in its audit report .
The FSIS is tasked with heading up the national residue program with the help of the FDA and EPA , but none of these agencies are actually These agencies areto work together to establish tolerance levels for various pesticides , drugs and toxins in an effort to minimize their presence in the food .
But according to the report , , let alone test for them .
The agencies did jointly establish a Surveillance Advisory Team ( SAT ) and an Interagency Residue Control Group ( IRCG ) to help them accomplish program goals , but since none of them have actuallyto realistically achieving these goals , the whole program has basically gone nowhere .
So which agency is actually at fault for the meat safety failures ?
Well , it depends on which agency you ask .
They all blame each other .
Every year , the SAT is supposed to bring together the FDA , EPA and FSIS to establish which residues they will test for that year .
But each year , no matter what has been agreed upon , the FSIS continues to test for only According to the EPA , the FSIS is refusing its requests to test for more pesticides .
The FSIS , however , claims that the EPA has not established tolerances for many of those pesticides , so it can't test for them ( while also insisting that it just does n't have enough resources to do the testing ) .
For items that do get tested , the FSIS relies on the FDA to approve proper testing methods .
However the FDA only wants to use testing methods that are old and outdated .
When newer , better methods are recommended , the FDA is often unwilling or unable to use them .
The methods of these various agencies often conflict with one another , which is why the SAT was established in the first place .
It was meant to be the coordinator of the three agencies to help them communicate and get the job done .
But instead of coordinating , it seems to exist more as a formality while the three blame each other for not getting anything done .
The agencies are generally run so poorly and corruptly that it is surprising they getdone at all .
The only things they seem to have time to do is harass supplement makers and shut down , all whileto the industry players that are really causing most of the problems .
According to the report , meat plant violations are not a big deal to the FSIS .
The agency routinely allows plants that are in violation to continue operating .
In 2008 , one meat plant had , but the FSIS still classified the violations as " not reasonably likely to occur " and allowed the plant to continue operating as usual -- in the meat industry , eh ?
The meat industry gets away with a lot , and the things it gets away with are no small matter .
Take , for instance , the practice of cow " recycling " .
When a cow gets too old or sick to produce milk , she is handed over to a slaughter facility to be turned into meat .
( The industry term for these animals is " spent " dairy cows ) .
Why is this a problem ?
According to the report , the plants that process spent dairy cows represent
These same plants also process " bob " veal , or male calves that are born to dairy cows .
Dairy cows are given large amounts of antibiotics after they birth calves in order to treat birth - related infections .
Since dairy producers are required to wait a certain amount of time after administering the drugs before using their milk for human consumption , they just go ahead and Since the drugs never got a chance to clear out of the system , it eventually ends up in the veal meat at the store .
So when you eat veal meat , you 're essentially eating And if the calves ' mothers do n't recovery quickly enough with the antibiotics , the producer may sell them off to be slaughtered before they die .
That way they will at least makemoney off those cows .
Unfortunately , this results in even more antibiotics going into the beef food chain .
Hold on to your ( cowboy ) hats ... it does n't stop there .
Farmers are now actually feeding livestock the .
It 's not enough that industrial producers are recycling old , sick animals for human consumption , but now they are feeding them toxic bio - sludge as well .
Of course they 've given the sludge a politically - correct name , " distillers ' grains " , but it does n't change the fact that it is a waste byproduct that is harmful to animals forced to eat it .
The USDA has known since 2008 that animals who eat distillers ' grains are more likely to harbor dangerous pathogens like E. coli , but has stated that itSince the ethanol fermentation process requires a lot of antibiotics to control it , .
And not only that , distillers ' grains are loaded withlinked to an oxidative imbalance in pigs called ( MHD ) that can cause them to die suddenly .
No wonder pigs are sicker than ever ; they 're being fed toxic waste as food !
But large hog producers do n't really care because it saves them money , and the USDA does n't care because , well , they basically represent the interests of the animal slaughter industry ( the pork , beef and chicken industries ) .
As long as the ethanol producers are happy , the hog producers are happy , and enough organizations continue to sing the praises of distillers ' grains , then there 's no need to protect the public from the dangers of the tainted end result , it seems .
Nobody will notice , right ?
These are just a few of the many violations that the FSIS , FDA and EPA seem unconcerned about .
And this is n't merely my personal opinion :
These things are
The casual way in which the USDA report highlights the failures and gives lip service to fixing them would be humorous if it did n't have such disastrous consequences .
For example , much of this meat ends up in the The tainted meat usually comes from low - grade providers , so schools are quick to snatch it up and feed it to children because it 's dirt cheap .
And fortunately , it 's labeled , " Suitable for human consumption .
" Millions of American children , who are still in their developmental stages , are eating cheeseburgers filled with antibiotics , pharmaceutical drugs and toxic chemicals -- all thanks to the greed of powerful industries and the inexcusable depth of corruption within agricultural regulatory agencies .
This tainted meat also makes its way to grocery stores , big - box warehouses and even restaurants .
Anywhere you 're buying hamburger meat ( or just hamburgers ) , you 're likely to be chowing down on meat laced with toxic chemicals , antibiotics and other pharmaceutical drugs .
Yet , amazingly , these issues are never addressed publicly .
The general public has no idea that .
They have no clue that the regulatory agencies that are supposed to be protecting them can't even properly communicate with each other , let alone protect the public .
Whenever there is a recall , nobody talks aboutthe meat got tainted orit managed to pass by regulators without being stopped .
There is never a discussion about thein the meat system itself that encourage contamination .
Instead , regulators unleash a chorus of whining over how underfunded they are and how everything would be fixed if the entire food supply was simply irradiated before hitting store shelves .
Except irradiation does n't destroy heavy metals and pharmaceuticals .
It only makes the meatin the short term because it does n't make anybody sick the very next day .
The response to food contamination has been to devise food " safety " bills that experts claim will solve the problems of the food system .
But a closer look reveals that the bills actually do more to eliminate the good guys than to punish the bad guys .
Just last summer , the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 2749 , the " Food Safety Enhancement Act of 2009 " and a Senate version of the bill is likely to be voted on this summer .
But these food safety bills do n't actually make food any safer .
Basically these bills will give more power to agencies like the FDA ( who are already failing at their current tasks ) while greatly increasing the regulatory burdens on small growers and ranchers who produce high - quality , safe food .
Such bills completely avoid addressing theof food contamination and instead create larger bureaucracies with more unchecked power that will only be unleashed against small operators rather than agro-industry giants .
The idea is utterly insane , but as long as it claims to deal with " food safety " , most people will blindly accept it as something good .
After all , the politicians and the corporations that sponsor them would n't lie to us , would they ?
( Chuckle ... )
The entire food system itself will have to be radically reformed in order to truly make food .
Mass - produced food that 's factory - made by corporate conglomerates will never be the kind of thing we truly wish to feed our children .
Government subsidies for cash crops must end .
Policies that favor Big Agribusiness while destroying smaller growers and ranchers must be reversed .
It 's important for us all to oppose any and all food " safety " bills that threaten to eliminate the very operations that produce safe food .
Protections for local and family farms must be present in any legislation , otherwise they will be forced out of business .
The Cornucopia Institute is doing a lot of great work in this area , so be sure to check their website for regular updates : www.Cornucopia.org
Conscious consumers must also start seeking alternative sources of food that are not produced out of the current corrupt system .
Local farms , food cooperatives and community supported agriculture ( CSA ) are great sources of safe food , and they offer the opportunity to develop a relationship with the people who raise the food .
You can also choose to grow your own food at home .
Whether urban or rural , there are workable solutions to raising your own food at home , regardless of your situation .
Even those who do n't have any yard space can grow sprouts on a kitchen counter .
( That 's food , too ! ) Knowing the source of your food and how it has been raised is crucial to ensuring food safety for yourself and your family .
And remember :
You vote with your dollars .
It 's up to you to choose food products from small , local growers rather than the corporate agro-giants that would much prefer to just shove their dirty , contaminated beef down your throat at every meal .
Cheeseburger , anyone ?
The National takes viewers inside the country 's spy agency , the Canadian Security Intelligence Service ( CSIS ) , for a rare look into its highly - secretive counterterrorism and counterespionage activities , and discloses concerns from CSIS director Richard Fadden that some Canadian politicians are under the influence of foreign governments .
We continue to follow this story as more information comes to light .
Read about the challenges of filming at CSIS headquarters
This entry was posted by CBC News The National producer Marc Baby .
We knew from the start that our spy agency would be camera- shy .
The Canadian Security and Intelligence Service is , after all , a secret organization doing classified work , charged with protecting Canada ’s national security and interests .
They are up against a world of spies who would like nothing better than to get glimpses of who works for CSIS and how it operates , in order to potentially infiltrate them or thwart their efforts at fighting terrorism and espionage .
Over the course of their 25 - year - plus history , they have remained largely hidden in the shadows .
So while they allowed us inside their headquarters and regional offices with television cameras for the first time ever , there were lots of restrictions on and lots of negotiations about what we could and could n’t film .
Many doors remained closed to us , and it made for a challenging time for our production team .
Perhaps the most problematic restriction involves what CSIS considers its most valuable asset - its people .
With a few exceptions , those who work there ca n’t be filmed .
To identify them publicly is to blow their cover and destroy their ability to do their jobs .
But we needed visuals to be able to talk about what they do .
Filming staff was tricky .
We had to shoot lots of close - ups , where you see hands and feet , but not faces .
When we interviewed Intelligence Officer " Christina " ( not her real name ) , a CSIS veteran , we had to film her in silhouette and alter her voice .
For a generally inward - looking organization , CSIS ’s headquarters is surprisingly open and airy .
However , even in their common areas , we were n’t allowed to film anytime there was staff walking through , which was often .
When we tried to film staff using walkways between floors and in silhouette , CSIS nixed several shots because they said the people were identifiable by the shapes of their bodies .
There were some areas of CSIS ’s operations that we were n’t allowed any access to at all .
The Integrated Threat Assessment Centre ( ITAC ) , inside which CSIS agents and various police forces bring together intelligence and analysis to inform the Government of Canada of potential threats , was off limits - too sensitive .
Certain areas , like the forensic laboratory , had curtains concealing activities we were not allowed to see .
Even the smallest items were restricted .
Whether it was a family photo adorning a desk that our camera could catch , or a glimpse of someone ’s face , CSIS made sure we could n’t film it .
We were not allowed to film any part of their security systems .
At one point , we were filming staff entering the building , just taking close - up shots that would not identify anyone .
Our CSIS escort approved the shots before we filmed them , but hours later , they called us into a meeting room and said those shots were unacceptable .
You could see the colour of the entry cards as they swiped in .
Those shots will never air .
CSIS staff also kept a close eye on us at all times .
We were escorted everywhere , including our visits to the washroom ( they waited outside ) .
You ca n’t enter or leave the building without an escort .
Cellphones must be surrendered to CSIS security staff as you enter the building .
No transmitters are allowed , of any kind .
That rule affected some of our normal production gear .
We tend to use wireless microphones in the field , equipped with transmitters that send the signal back to the camera .
CSIS does not allow any wireless transmitters inside , so we had to hard - wire our sound gear to the camera .
This made working inside much more challenging and time consuming for us .
Paranoid ?
Possibly .
But CSIS is a target for all sorts of nefarious foreign agents , who themselves are targeted by CSIS .
Infiltration is a very real concern , and preventing the bad guys from learning about CSIS ’s operations is paramount to their continued operations .
Since its inception , CSIS has preferred to stay out of the spotlight and away from the camera ’s prying eye .
This year , they opened up and let us in , because Director Richard Fadden believes the culture of secrecy may have gone too far and needs to change somewhat .
But they still kept many secrets locked up tight .

The man believed responsible for a rampage at a Van Nuys video production facility that left one dead and two wounded is a struggling porn actor who faced the loss of his job , authorities said .
Stephen Hill , 30 , allegedly used a machete - style weapon in the attack , which occurred about 10:20 p.m. at a video distribution business on Hayvenhurst Avenue and Saticoy Street .
Los Angeles Police Department Det. Joel Price said Hill was both working and living at the offices of Ultima DVD Inc .
Price said Hill did production work and acted in several porn movies .
But on the night of the attack , he apparently faced the loss of his job and eviction from the office .
For the first time in more than a decade this former Mac user does n’t feel like a second - class citizen when it comes to printing , and it ’s all thanks to Hewlett - Packard and their first - class support for Linux .
Their software , HP Linux Imaging and Printing ( HPLIP for short ) comes bundled with most of the major Linux distributions and their derivatives , including the newly - updated Linux Mint on my desktop computer , and Easy Peasy on my netbook .
Here ’s how easy it was to set up my new HP Officejet j6450 on both .
1. Connect printer to my wireless network .
I actually messed up a bit in this first step .
I had learned some hard lessons about home networking with my NAS , and knew that a static IP address was important to create a permanent and unfaltering link to something that would n’t always be powered on .
Unfortunately I chose to assign a static IP to my HP via the printer itself , using its fax keypad and built - in display .
I must gotten something wrong because neither of my computers could find it .
In other words , it was a pebkac issue .
Resetting the network access and assigning a static IP through my router worked like a charm , though .
Lesson learned — or more accurately , reinforced .
2. Start printer utility on Linux OS and click on “ Add Printer ” .
3. Select my HP ( discovered automatically ) .
You can see in this screen grab that my exact model is n’t listed , but I figure HP knows its drivers better than me .
4 . Wait for the appropriate drivers to be retrieved .
Not sure if they were being downloaded from a server or just installed from my local CUPS database .
Either way , this took less than a minute .
5 . Choose printer names for my network and for me .
Name selection is entirely arbitrary , so long as the network moniker contains no spaces .
I ‘ve named my printer “ awesome ” .
And that ’s it .
I now have a printer that ’s accessible from any device on my network .
If I still had my Eseries Nokia I could probably print from that too .
Scanning also works without issue using Linux Mint ’s default Simple Scan app .
If I seem irrationally exuberant over such a simple matter I guess it ’s because I ’ve never had a printer that did n’t require the installation of kludgy software to make it work .
With the possible exception of networking considerations this is the first printing peripheral I ’ve ever bought that delivers on the promise of “ plug and play ” .
" I think it will be very well received , " Gartman said .
" I think every distressed bond portfolio in the world will say ' I get to own BP as a distressed bond issue ? '
I think that will fly . "
As CNBC reported earlier Thursday , BP may auction $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion in debtas early as next week in order to boost both liquidity , or cash , as well as confidence , according to people familiar with the matter .
The company is in talks with Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , Credit Suisse , Blackstone Stone Group , UBS about the offering , these people said .
" There will be portfolio managers out there itching to take that bond issue down , " Gartman said .
" You 'd be getting a huge premium for the privilege of owning it . "
Gartman 's comments come as BP CEO Tony Hayward was grilled by US lawmakers on Capitol Hill about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , the worst in US history .
" I'm embarrassed , " Gartman said of the hearings , which were often contentious .
" I 'm embarrassed by what I heard , I 'm embarrassed by the manner in which they treated this gentleman .
I 'm embarrassed by the manner in which the questions went on ... It was just incredible the way it continued to go on and on . "
BP 's London - listed stock price was up Thursday , while the company 's U.S. - listed shares were down slightly .
No -- GOPosexuality does n't threaten me at all .
Everybody should be allowed to be who they are .
Yes -- I 'm afraid if GOPosexuality is legalized I might become a GOPosexual .
The Christian religion is the foundation of most of Britain ’s culture and traditions .
The history of our nation is incomprehensible without some knowledge of it .
And yet , as we report today , and as anyone who has school - age children attending a non-religious state school will already know , the rudiments of Christianity are frequently poorly taught — if , indeed , they are taught at all .
A report by Ofsted has found that , although nominally required by the national curriculum , in many schools instruction is “ superficial ” , and is treated less seriously than the study of other religions .
Plasma gasification is a phrase heard often when discussion plasma-arc treatment or waste - to - energy technologies , however this entry looks to give a closer look as to what plasma gasification is and its associated reactions .
Plasma gasification is a thermal chemical conversion process designed to optimize the conversion of waste into the synthetic gas or ( “ syngas ” ) .
The chemical reactions take place under oxygen starved conditions .
The ratio of oxygen molecules to carbon molecules can be less than one in a plasma gasification reactor ( sometimes a stoichiometric amount of oxygen to achieve pyrolysis ) .
The following simplified chemical conversion formulas describe some of the thermo-chemical processes that are typically occurring in gasification .
Equation 1 . C ( fuel ) + O2 → CO2 + heat ( exothermic )
Equation 2 C + H2O ( steam ) → CO + H2 ( endothermic )
Equation 3 C + CO2 → 2CO ( endothermic )
Equation 4 C + 2H2 → CH4 ( exothermic )
Equation 5 CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 ( exothermic )
Equation 6 CO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O ( exothermic )
Some of the waste undergoes partial oxidation by precisely controlling the amount of oxygen fed into the plasma reactor ( see first reaction above ) .
The heat released in the above exothermic reactions provide additional thermal energy for the primary gasification reaction ( endothermic formulas above ) to proceed very rapidly .
At higher temperatures ( around 3,600 °F ) the endothermic reactions are typically favored .
Some plasma companies ( not PEAT however ) introduce supplementary fuels such as coal , petroleum coke or even other hot gases generated by plasma torches ( sometimes referred to as plasma - assisted gasification ) to maintain the desired plasma gasification temperatures in the reactor .
Additionally , plasma gasification currently appears to be the option being promoted most widely for larger scale waste - to - energy applications mainly because of its ability to produce the syngas from which energy can be recovered in high efficiency recovery units so offsetting the high energy requirements of plasma gasification .
The reducing atmosphere within the plasma gasification reactor avoids the formation of oxidized species such as sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ) and nitrogen oxide ( NOx ) .
Instead , sulfur and nitrogen ( organic - derived ) in the feedstock are primarily converted to hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) and nitrogen .
Finally , typical halogens in the feedstock are converted to inorganic acid halides ( HCl , HF , etc . )
BP Oil Disaster Solution : ' Just Blow It Up ' ?
Despite controversy , some still favor using explosives to plug BP oil well .
June 30 , 2010  --
Is it time to blow up the gushing BP oil well ?
Much like the oil spill itself , it 's an idea that keeps spreading despite efforts by the Obama administration to contain it .
Most recently , former president Bill Clinton voiced his support for the " just blow it up " solution .
It may become necessary to " send the Navy down deep to blow up the well and cover the leak with piles and piles and piles of rock and debris , " Clinton said at a weekend forum hosted by several news organizations .
" ... Unless we 're going to do that , we are dependent on the technical expertise of these people from BP . "
Clinton 's comments came weeks after government officials dismissed the explosive solution .
" I think we'd have to run out of a lot of things before we 'd consider something like that , " Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen told " Good Morning America " earlier this month .
He later said that even a non-nuclear explosion -- considered by some to be less controversial and less dangerous -- could also prove more hurtful than helpful .
Some who have floated the idea agree that it 's risky , but ask whether explosives would be any worse than the status quo -- up to 60,000 barrels of oil are leaking into the Gulf of Mexico each day and BP 's efforts to drill relief wells to plug the leak are more than a month away from completion .
" At what point do the real damages that pile up outweigh the potential risks of something like weapons use a couple of thousand feet below the sea floor ? " said Michael E. Webber , the associate director of the Center for International Energy and Environmental Policy at the University of Texas at Austin .
Webber was among the first to publicly raise the possibility of using explosives to seal the BP well ; he says that he does not necessarily support the idea , but maintains that it 's worth consideration .
Here 's how he and others say the explosives proposal could work :
Near the failed BP Macado oil well , another hole would have to be drilled some 3,000 feet down .
Explosives would then be lowered into that hole .
Detonating those explosives would create a cavity below the sea floor that would envelop a section of the neighboring BP well and plug it with rubble .
Blowing Up the Well Could Create More Leaks , Diplomatic Headaches
In a recent op - ed in the New York Times , Christopher Brownfield , a former nuclear submarine officer and a nuclear policy researcher at Columbia University , compared the solution to " stepping on a garden house ( to stop ) a stream of water . "
But opponents of the solution , including BP itself , argue it's a lot more complicated than that .
The explosion , they say , could potentially disturb rock formations that had helped contain some oil , resulting in new leaks .
" The problem with exploding a highly powerful device down there -- you essentially lose any and all control , " a BP spokesman said .
The explosion , he said , could create new " flow paths " for the oil .
" Now , instead of having leak coming from one wellhead , you would have it come from 100 different locations on the seafloor , " said Paul Fischbeck , an oil platform expert and a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University .
" How do you stop that ? "
Proponents counter that the depth at which the explosion would occur could prevent that possibility .
" If you go deep enough underground , nothing gets out , " said former Air Force Secretary Hans Mark , now an engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin specializing in national defense policy .
Mark and others point to the former Soviet Union 's strategy of capping out - of - control gas wells with below - ground nuclear explosions .
But others argue that the fact that the BP well is an oil well -- not a gas well -- and that it is underwater ( unlike the Soviets ' gas wells ) make the situation too different to be comparable to the Soviet experience .
There 's also the Soviets ' not - so - reassuring success rate : though the U.S.S.R. successfully plugged four gas wells with nuclear explosives , its last effort in 1981 failed .
" A 20 percent failure rate is way beyond anything that would be acceptable here , " said Fischbeck .
Choosing a nuclear explosive , in particular , could land the U.S. in a diplomatic pickle , nuclear policy experts warn .
" The United States has signed a treaty that we would not explode nuclear weapons under water or anywhere else , " said John Isaacs , the executive director of the Washington , D.C. - based Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation .
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , which nations began to sign in 1996 , puts a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing .
Were the U.S. to run afoul of the treaty , experts say , states like Iran might use that to justify their own nuclear weapons exercises .
Brownfield argues that conventional explosives could be used instead and so does Clinton .
" You do n't have to use nuclear weapons , by the way .
I 've seen all that stuff , just blow it up , " the former president said at last weekend 's media event .
But not everyone -- including proponents of the explosives idea -- is so sure .
Mark says it would take larger conventional explosives to match the power of nuclear ones , and they might prove trickier to transport .
It 's a " problem of getting to the pipe , " he said .
" You 'd have to get very close , and you 'd have to be very lucky . "
A good game in both tactical and entertainment terms – North Korea defended resolutely and their front two showed their technical quality , but Brazil ’s patience was rewarded in the second half .
Firstly , it ’s never nice when websites blow their own trumpets , but you can be assured that this is actually a vuvuzela ZM is blowing on :
“ With Brazil playing mainly on the counter - attack , and Portugal and Ivory Coast playing systems that rely on pace , North Korea ’s ultra - defensive style could frustrate teams early in games – you can imagine one of their opponents struggling to break them down early on , and going in 0 - 0 at half - time – whether North Korea will be able to defend resolutely for 90 minutes against a top - quality side is doubtful , however . ” ( here )
“ Do n’t be surprised if Brazil quietly fight their way to World Cup victory .
They ’ll keep the ball , tire the opposition but not look particularly dangerous .
Then , late in the game , they ’ll break at speed , rely on the skill of Kaka and Robinho , and win games comfortably without thrashing the opposition ” .
( here )
That essentially tells the story of how the game developed , hopefully demonstrating that studying the tactical characteristics of individual sides is a worthwhile exercise .
British television broadcasters acted like the scoreline was a shock to the world , when in fact the pattern of the game was logical when considering the philosophy and strategy of Brazil and North Korea .
The line - ups
Brazil set out as expected , with Elano getting the nod over Ramires for the right - sided midfield position .
Indeed , the Brazil team was actually set out with the numbers 1 - 11 on their backs , nice to see in the age of squad numbers .
North Korea ’s side featured one change from the predicted side , with Nam Song - Chol making way for Pak Chon Jin on the right - hand side of defence .
This was a crucial role , as the freest defender .
They maintained their usual formation , a five - man defence with a defensive midfielder just ahead , and the wing - backs got forward increasingly as the game went on .
The general pattern
Brazil struggled to break down the North Korean defence because their system and strategy is based around playing on the counter - attack .
They keep possession brilliantly , but can look slightly out of ideas when they get to the final third against teams playing ultra-defensively .
It ’s in situations like this when you can understand the Brazilian public ’s frustration about the use of too many functional players and not enough creators – Melo and Gilberto were possibly doing too much of the same thing tonight .
That said , credit must go for Dunga for persisting with the system , and to Brazil for having the patience to keep on playing short , neat passes across the pitch until they eventually found a way through .
A less talented ( or less confident ) side would have started to hit longer passes into the penalty area , especially with Luis Fabiano a decent target man and towering over the North Korean defenders .
Brazil were outnumbered whenever they attack , because of North Korea ’s five - man defence that became a six - man defence when Yong Hak - An followed Kaka deep .
Fabiano found it difficult because he was up against three defenders by himself , whilst Robinho and Elano both found wing - backs tracking them when they moved into attacking areas , and the Korean defenders were happy for Gilberto and Melo to have the ball in the centre .
That did n’t mean that those two players were encouraged the ball by the Koreans .
Their two front players , Hong - Yong Jo and Jong Tae - Se , looked to drop in front of the Brazilian holding midfielders , making it slightly more difficult for the centre - backs to play the ball forward towards them .
Full - backs key
As one would expect against a 5 - 3 - 1 - 1 , the Brazilian full - backs were completely free , and the breakthrough was always likely to come from one of them .
The surprising thing about Dunga ’s instructions tonight was that he did n’t push Maicon and Michel Bastos further forward – they were constantly free , and creating an overload on the flanks looked the best way to make the breakthrough .
Amongst their few goalscoring efforts in the first half were long - range shots that went close from both full - backs .
This showed that they were the free players , so why not move them higher up the pitch , closer to the goal ?
They would n’t have had quite as much space , of course , but they still would have caused confusion in the Korean defence .
Maicon ’s goal towards the beginning of the second half demonstrated this well .
Elano ’s goal came from a very similar position , and it ’s interesting that both the Brazilian goals came from the right - hand side , because that is the side of the pitch they work less often .
There is no permanent right - winger – instead Elano and Maicon both look to exploit that space – never at the same time , because they have a good understanding when Brazil have the ball .
One goes long , one comes short .
One stays wide , one moves central .
Robinho stays on the left and Kaka attacks towards the left – those are the two biggest threats , but can often dominate the opposition ’s thoughts to the point where they ’re oblivious to the threat on the right .
North Korea were impressive on the way they doubled - up on Brazil ’s creative players when they got the ball , but it was frantic chasing , closing down and blocking rather than a more intelligent , structured system .
We should certainly admire their ability to keep a clean sheet for so long , but there ’s probably only a certain amount of time they can keep that up .
With the defenders constantly looking to double - up and get in line to block shots , they were prone to the ball being switched across the pitch , and both goals came from left - right balls that exposed North Korea ’s ‘ weak side ’ .
Conclusion
The game largely panned out as expected , with Brazil patiently passing the ball and eventually finding a way past North Korea with technical quality in the final third .
Brazil ’s full - backs were given too much time on the ball , and this is a good example of why 5 - 3 - 2 systems died out .
North Korea traded ‘ pressure on the full - backs ’ for spare men at the back – probably a good strategy considering the nature of their defending , but with the talent of Bastos and Maicon , the goal was more inevitable than the half - time scoreline suggested .
This was a rather good introduction to Brazil for those who have yet to see them under Dunga .
They ’re not the wonderful , free - flowing side they have been in previous years , but they are solid , well - organised , keep possession excellently and generally pick up wins .
Whilst the specifics of the North Korean approach should not be copied because their defenders tended to be dragged around , the general defensive strategy worked well ( even if it was their natural game rather than a deliberate attempt to stifle Brazil ) because Brazil like to exploit space both in front and behind the opposition defence .
Deny them space , and you might succeed .
It ’s a few times we ’ve said that in this tournament .
The popularity of counter - attacking football amongst the best sides has bred a fear of attacking among the weaker sides , because they leave gaps at the back .
Those hoping for more goals might be disappointed – there ’s little to suggest that attacking football is the best way to cause the favourites problems .

UK study predicts increased floods and droughts will continue for decades after global temperatures are stabilised
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Global warming will continue to bring havoc to the world 's weather systems for decades after reductions are made in greenhouse gas emissions , a new study shows .
Scientists at the Met Office Hadley Centre in Exeter say climate change could bring greater disruption to the planet 's water cycle than previously thought .
The research suggests that increased floods and droughts could continue long after future efforts to stabilise temperature may succeed .
Vicky Pope , head of climate change advice at the Hadley Centre , said : " We can't say that if we manage to bring down our carbon dioxide emissions then we do n't need to worry any more .
There will still be changes beyond that point . "
A team led by Peili Wu used a computer model to analyse how the Earth 's water cycle could react to changes in future amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
It found that once carbon dioxide levels rise to a high level , even sharp reductions fail to prevent longlasting impacts on snow and rainfall .
This is down to accumulated heat in the oceans , which dissipates slowly and drives changes in the water cycle as it does so .
Writing in a paper to be published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters , the scientists say : " Our results suggest that relationships between precipitation and warming may significantly underestimate precipitation changes during periods of [ greenhouse gas ] stabilisation or reduction .
" The inertia due to the accumulated heat in the ocean implies a commitment to changes long after stabilisation . "
They add : " This effect must be taken into account when assessing the implications of various mitigation options for flooding , water supply , food production and human health . "
The study simulated the effects of a steady rise in carbon dioxide levels until the equivalent atmospheric concentration topped 1,000 ppm ( parts per million ) .
The current CO2 level is just over 390 ppm , and most policies aimed at tackling climate change suggest the world should not exceed 450 p pm - 550 ppm , though this would require significant curbs on carbon pollution .
In the study , the scientists then rapidly brought the CO2 level back down to pre-industrial levels of around 280 ppm .
In practice , this would be impossible – without geo-engineering techniques that could actively remove it from the atmosphere – but the scientists wanted to see what would theoretically happen .
The model showed that , while temperatures dropped sharply as CO2 was reduced , the disruption to precipitation continued for several decades .
How the rainfall may change for a particular region is a more complicated question , though the scientists said their model suggested significant drying in South America , Southern Africa and Australia .
Often players who were n’t considered part of the starting XI at the beginning of a tournament emerge to play a leading role by the knockout stages .
Here ’s six who hope to do that :
Javier Pastore , Argentina
Who is he ?
A 20 - year - old enganche who has impressed in his debut season for Sicilian club Palermo .
A creator rather than a goalscorer himself , he plays just behind the forwards and has both passing ability and a love for running directly at defences .
He only won his first cap two weeks ago against Canada .
Why should we watch him ?
Because Argentina do n’t really have anyone in his mould .
They have Carlos Tevez , Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero , but these are deep forwards rather than attacking midfielders .
Juan Veron plays in the role Pastore would look to fill , but doubts remain about his ability to compete for 90 minutes in the centre of midfield , and he has an unfortunate characteristic of looking like a luxury player when things are going badly .
Pastore would play slightly higher up the pitch and look to play the killer pass .
Fabio Coentrao , Portugal
Who is he ?
A 22 - year - old former left winger who has been pushed back to left - back at Benfica , where he has just won the league title .
He is incredibly skilful for a full - back , loves to get forward and has the stamina to do so for a whole game .
He does sometimes look like a winger playing out of position though , and gives away too many free - kicks .
Why should we watch him ?
Because he might provide the most penetration from any Portuguese player .
If Carlos Queiroz persists with a Pepe- Meireles - Deco midfield , Portugal will need their full - backs to provide support and direct running .
That ’s unlikely to come too much from Paulo Ferreira on the right , and Coentrao will be playing behind either Cristiano Ronaldo or Simao Sabrosa , both of whom like to cut in onto their stronger right foot .
An overlapping full - back is a must , and Coentrao will do that far more than the alternative , Duda .
Riccardo Montolivo , Italy
Who is he ?
A central midfielder with excellent passing skills .
Neither an attacking or defensive midfielder , he took over the Fiorentina captaincy in January .
At 25 , can no longer be described as promising – now needs to step up and prove his quality .
Why should be watch him ?
Italy lack a trequartista and their most talented midfield playmaker , Andrea Pirlo , may miss the first two games through injury .
Claudio Marchisio may be favourite in the centre of midfield for Marcello Lippi , but Montolivo offers a more intelligent option , and probably a closer resemblance to Pirlo .
Christian Eriksen , Denmark
Who is he ?
A small creative central midfielder for Ajax , at 18 he is the youngest player in the tournament .
He only has 15 senior club appearances and three international caps , but there have been calls for Morten Olsen to give him a starting place .
Why should we watch him ?
Because he is exactly what Denmark are lacking .
They are relying on a bunch of rather elderly players to create chances , and Nicklas Bendtner ’s injury problems are n’t helping the situation .
Eriksen offers a great turn of pace and direct running at goal , and could be a game - changer from the bench .
Michael Carrick , England
Who is he ?
A tall , deep - lying central midfielder who won three league titles and the Champions League in his first three seasons at Manchester United , but was still considered ‘ rubbish ’ by many .
Has justified the billing of ‘ rubbish ’ by turning in a fairly dreadful half - season for United .
Why should we watch him ?
Because Gareth Barry ’s return from injury is not guaranteed , and Carrick is the only other deep - lying midfielder in the squad .
A Gerrard - Lampard midfield partnership may work in the opening games against weak sides , but later on Fabio Capello will look to move Gerrard back to the left , where he likes to drift in and allow Ashley Cole forward on the overlap .
This is only possible if England retain possession , something they ’ve struggled at in recent tournaments , and as an assured passer , Carrick might be vital , perhaps in a 4 - 5 - 1 .
Danny Alves , Portugal
Who is he ?
A Venezuelan - born attacking midfielder , who has impressed in Russia with first Dynamo Moscow and then Zenit St Petersburg , who signed him for € 30 m two summer ago .
Plays centrally and drives directly at goal .
Why should we watch him ?
Because Portugal ’s midfield is far too functional and not creative enough , with Deco increasingly playing a static midfield role rather than looking to support the forwards .
Nani ’s injury has further damaged Portugal ’s creativity , and Alves basically gives Portugal exactly what they ’re crying out for .

Naked Riders on West Burnside .

Congratulations Portland !
Your penchant for pedaling pantless has set records once again .
Estimates from last night ’s World Naked Bike Ride put the number of riders at 11,000 - 13,000 people * .
Wow .
I think that would be the largest ride of its kind the world has ever seen .
( * Note : The initial estimate of 13,000 has been disputed by event organizers . )
People who watched say it took about 30 - 40 minutes for all the riders to pass by .
All reports from the field so far say the event itself was a big success .
A large ( and coordinated ) police presence helped the ride stay together by corking most intersections .
The route also “ worked beautifully ” according to one of the volunteers .
Organizers wanted to avoid the bottlenecks ( which can lead to excessive groping from bystanders ) that had occurred downtown in previous years so they spent more time on the east side .
The ride went through downtown via W. Burnside and went up Hawthorne Boulevard , passing by the Bagdad and Laurelhurst Theaters in Southeast .
Here ’s another photo from local photographer Jared Souney :

By all accounts , it was another amazing Naked Ride and a magical night to be on a bike in Portland .
The crew of volunteers and organizers from Shift deserve a huge thanks for making it all come together … as do the City of Portland , TriMet , the Portland Police Bureau , and all the other local agencies that allow this to take place worked together to make everything go smoothly .
Was it good for you ?
Chime in below to share your experience and let us know how it went .

Unfinished Business
Lester Tenney entered World War II as a strapping 21 - year - old , weight 180 pounds .
By the time he emerged from Japanese captivity in 1945 , he was a shattered , emaciated cripple .
His left arm and shoulder were partly paralyzed due to an accident in a coal mine where he ’d been sent as a slave laborer .
His overseers there — civilian employees of the Mitsui Corp. , not members of the Imperial Army — had knocked out his teeth in repeated beatings with hammers and pickaxes .
At war ’s end , he weighed in at 98 pounds .
It took him a year in U.S. Army hospitals to regain something like a semblance of his old well - being .
Sixty - five years later , Tenney and his fellow ex-prisoners of war ( POWs ) — the rapidly diminishing group of those who remain alive , that is — are still awaiting the full fruits of victory .
The Japanese companies that once abused Tenney and his fellow prisoners have never acknowledged responsibility for their crimes , let alone offered compensation or regrets of any kind .
( The companies needed the POWs to compensate for a wartime labor shortage . )
The Japanese government has only just begun to offer its regrets for what happened — far too late for most of the veterans , but , still , something .
Perhaps most depressingly of all , the U.S. government has spent years allowing the Japanese to get away with it — a policy of complicity that has its roots in the two countries ’ complex postwar relationship .
There are signs that this , too , may finally be changing .
Hope never dies , as they say .
I was reminded of all this recently , when the story popped up again .
Most Americans , I suspect , have never heard about this rather depressing tale — which brings us to yet another set of culprits : the media .
I must count myself among those responsible in this particular group .
A few years ago I was the Tokyo bureau chief for one of the big American news magazines .
I met Tenney in Japan and accompanied him as he spoke to Japanese school classes , and watched as he got his story out to the new generation .
But I was n’t able to interest my editors in the story .
It was n’t anything nefarious on their part .
They just were n’t terribly interested in Japan , and even less so in tales about Japan ’s bad behavior during the war .
Surely that was well - trodden ground — had n’t I ever seen The Bridge On the River Kwai ?
I ca n’t entirely blame them , I guess .
Forget , for a moment , the fact that an extraordinary 40 percent of the Allied POWs in Japanese hands never came back .
Forget the fact that those who survived suffered from the highest rates of " combat fatigue " — what we would today call post - traumatic stress disorder — of all of America ’s World War II veterans .
Forget the fact that selling the prisoners to some 60 different Japanese companies represented a crass violation of the laws of war — and that the way they were treated while working for the companies contravened the Imperial Army ’s own guidelines .
Forget the fact that Chinese and Korean prisoners and forced laborers are still pressing ( unsuccessfully ) to have their claims recognized by Japanese courts .
It was all a long time ago .
There ’s another problem .
This happens to be one of those stories that come wrapped in the myriad legal and political subtleties that tend to accompany explorations of sins committed by governments in the past .
In this case , for example , you have to do a bit of explaining about the peculiar history of the U.S. - Japan alliance .
In 1951 , as the Cold War was burning red hot in Korea , Washington realized that it needed a renascent Japan as its bulwark against communist designs on the Far East , and signed a set of agreements designed to wind up wartime claims and ensure Tokyo ’s loyalty to the Western camp in the decades to come .
In one of those documents the Japanese agreed to let the Americans station troops on their territory , while in another — the San Francisco Peace Treaty — the Americans agreed to give the Japanese a pass on reparations .
Article 16 of the treaty obligated the Japanese to pay a token amount to the International Red Cross " for the benefit of former prisoners of war " — but the text carefully avoided describing the payment as " compensation , " which might have created a precedent .
No further claims by POWs would be recognized .
The former U.S. prisoners themselves never got anything from Japan — and certainly not what they craved most , which was an official acknowledgment of the savage treatment that had been meted out to them not only by the Imperial Army in its prison camps , but also by the dozens of companies that used captured soldiers as laborers .
( None of the companies ever paid the men for their work at the time , it should be noted . )
It was not until 1995 , under Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama , that Japan offered its first , unequivocal official apology for Japan ’s wartime conduct .
Over the years the Australian , British , Canadian , Dutch , and New Zealand governments managed to convince the Japanese that it would be in their interest to offer the ex-prisoners a gesture of goodwill .
So Tokyo proceeded to invite ex-prisoners from those countries back to Japan on all - expense - paid trips — an odd form of ersatz apology .
But the American POWs were left out — and their own government was shockingly eager to leave it at that .
Raison d’état — in this case , the priority of keeping the U.S. - Japan alliance running smoothly — trumped justice .
" The Americans have been almost a hundred percent complicit in this , " says Mindy Kotler , a Washington - based Japan expert who works for the think tank Asia Policy Point .
" They allowed the Japanese to not be accountable .
They ’ve given them a pass on the same values we hold dear . "
When the U.S. survivors tried to push the Japanese to offer them similar treatment , the U.S. State Department sat on its hands — as did many in Congress .
Tenney testified before Congress on numerous occasions , but bills demanding action on the ex-prisoners ’ behalf inevitably died in committee , torpedoed by lawmakers eager to avoid tensions with Tokyo .
The stillborn legislation included one measure that would have paid each surviving POW a one - off sum of $ 15,000 in acknowledgment of their wartime suffering .
" Our Congress and our senators did a lousy job , " says Tenney .
( He then hastens to offer praise for the few who have stood up for the vets , naming Sens. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) and Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) and Rep. Mike Honda ( D - Calif . ) .
When the veterans tried to sue the Japanese companies that once exploited their labor , the U.S. Supreme Court did n’t even deign to consider their cases .
( State and Justice Department officials actually filed briefs opposing the veterans ’ claims in the lower courts on the grounds that they disturbed the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty . )
At least we can finally talk about a bit of progress .
Last year the Japanese parliament , the Diet , quietly issued an apology that finally included references to the POWs — one that amounts to official recognition of Japan ’s moral responsibility for the prisoners ’ wartime suffering .
And in May of last year the Japanese ambassador to the United States , Ichiro Fujisaki , offered an apology of his own , echoing the 1995 government declaration , at a San Antonio gathering of some of the surviving American prisoners .
Not all of the Americans were mollified , though Tenney says that the ambassador ’s sally " took a lot of courage , " given the bitterness among some of the veterans .
And now even the folks at Foggy Bottom seem to be coming around .
Within the past few months , the Japanese have offered to invite some of the remaining POWs over for visits , and U.S. diplomats have been working with officials in Tokyo to make it happen .
So far the sum of money involved — $ 180,000 — is pitiable , only enough for a mere seven men ( plus caregivers and spouses ) .
But even that small effort represents a break with a shameful past .
And the companies ?
" They ’ve never offered one dime , " says Tenney .
" Never an apology . "
It ’s actually hard to see what would prevent them from doing so — other than the shame of acknowledging their responsibility for acts committed long ago .
The ex-prisoners ’ demands certainly do n’t represent any economic threat .
( The company that exploited Tenney ’s labor , Mitsui , is today one of the world ’s biggest corporations — it owns a 10 percent stake in the drilling operation that is currently hemorrhaging oil into the Gulf of Mexico — and its website offers an elaborate declaration of its affirmation of human rights . )
And Tenney insists that it ’s not money he and his comrades are after — just a proper apology from corporate Japan .
You ’d think that would n’t be so hard to come by .
But you would be wrong .

ONLINE archaeology can yield surprising results .
When John Kelly of Morningside Analytics , a market - research firm , recently pored over data from websites in Indonesia he discovered a “ vast field of dead blogs ” .
Numbering several thousand , they had not been updated since May 2009 .
Like hastily abandoned cities , they mark the arrival of the Indonesian version of Facebook , the online social network .
Such swathes of digital desert are still rare in the blogosphere .
And they should certainly not be taken as evidence that it has started to die .
But signs are multiplying that the rate of growth of blogs has slowed in many parts of the world .
In some countries growth has even stalled .
Blogs are a confection of several things that do not necessarily have to go together : easy - to - use publishing tools , reverse - chronological ordering , a breezy writing style and the ability to comment .
But for maintaining an online journal or sharing links and photos with friends , services such as Facebook and Twitter ( which broadcasts short messages ) are quicker and simpler .
Charting the impact of these newcomers is difficult .
Solid data about the blogosphere are hard to come by .
Such signs as there are , however , all point in the same direction .
Earlier in the decade , rates of growth for both the numbers of blogs and those visiting them approached the vertical .
Now traffic to two of the most popular blog - hosting sites , Blogger and WordPress , is stagnating , according to Nielsen , a media - research firm .
By contrast , Facebook 's traffic grew by 66 % last year and Twitter 's by 47 % .
Growth in advertisements is slowing , too .
Blogads , which sells them , says media buyers ' inquiries increased nearly tenfold between 2004 and 2008 , but have grown by only 17 % since then .
Search engines show declining interest , too .
People are not tiring of the chance to publish and communicate on the internet easily and at almost no cost .
Experimentation has brought innovations , such as comment threads , and the ability to mix thoughts , pictures and links in a stream , with the most recent on top .
Yet Facebook , Twitter and the like have broken the blogs ' monopoly .
Even newer entrants such as Tumblr have offered sharp new competition , in particular for handling personal observations and quick exchanges .
Facebook , despite its recent privacy missteps , offers better controls to keep the personal private .
Twitter limits all communication to 140 characters and works nicely on a mobile phone .
A good example of the shift is Iran .
Thanks to the early translation into Persian of a popular blogging tool ( and crowds of journalists who lacked an outlet after their papers were shut down ) , Iran had tens of thousands of blogs by 2009 .
Many were shut down , and their authors jailed , after the crackdown that followed the election in June of that year .
But another reason for the dwindling number of blogs written by dissidents is that the opposition Green Movement is now on Facebook , says Hamid Tehrani , the Brussels - based Iran editor for Global Voices , a blog news site .
Mir Hossein Mousavi , one of the movement 's leaders , has 128,000 Facebook followers .
Facebook , explains Mr Tehrani , is a more efficient way to reach people .
The future for blogs may be special - interest publishing .
Mr Kelly 's research shows that blogs tend to be linked within languages and countries , with each language - group in turn containing smaller pockets of densely linked sites .
These pockets form around public subjects : politics , law , economics and knowledge professions .
Even narrower specialisations emerge around more personal topics that benefit from public advice .
Germany has a cluster for children 's crafts ; France , for food ; Sweden , for painting your house .
Such specialist cybersilos may work for now , but are bound to evolve further .
Deutsche Blogcharts says the number of links between German blogs dropped last year , with posts becoming longer .
Where will that end ?
Perhaps in a single , hugely long blog posting about the death of blogs .

From time to time , we ’ve tried to track whether or not the Biglaw layoffs have had a disparate impact on women or minorities .
There has n’t been a lot of hard evidence .
We did a story last year on layoffs at Squire Sanders that seemed to disproportionately affect women .
And this year we ran a report that contained statistics showing that minorities have been disproportionately hosed by the layoffs as well .
Of course , there are some good arguments that the difficulties experienced by women in larger law firms are gender - neutral .
This article on TechnoLawyer explores some of those concerns .
But there is one Biglaw issue that is undeniably gender - based .
Only women can give birth .
Lately we ’ve been getting information suggesting we should add another group to the Biglaw endangered species watch list : mothers .
Specifically , we ’re hearing that the New York office of K&L Gates apparently sports zero associate mothers .
There are some female partners at K&L Gates with children , but no female associate in the New York office has figured out how to breed and hang on to her job at the same time .
K&L Gates did not respond to our multiple requests for comment , but the statistics are quite shocking …
It ’s pretty hard to say that you are committed to gender diversity when every woman who gets knocked up disappears from your office .
Here are the facts as we understand them ( if you see errors , please email us ) :
1 . The New York office of K&L Gates has fired or laid off all of the female associates in the office who had children ( except for one who left because she had no work ) .
2. Between 2007 and late 2008 , six female associates had babies .
In December 2008 , two of the associates who were still on maternity leave were fired during performance evaluations .
In early 2009 , when the NY office had layoffs , two more of the new moms were “ laid off . ”
3 . Shortly after these layoffs , another mother left K&L - NY because she had less than 20 hours of work a month ( despite being part of a practice group that should have been booming in the economic downturn ) .
Finally , in December 2009 , the last remaining mother was fired during performance evaluations .
4 . There are no remaining “ mom ” associates in the New York office .
Ouch — that ’s a lot of mothers to let go during the recession .
It does n’t really mean much to have maternity leave , lactation rooms , and other “ Mommy perks ” if anybody who ever takes advantage of them gets laid off .
Apparently , this is a problem that K&L Gates has been made aware of , according to one source :
[ T ]he associates during a monthly associates ’ meeting raised concerns amongst themselves about the fact that almost all the moms had been terminated .
The firm has been especially vocal about its Diversity Initiatives and its alleged “ work life balance ” philosophy .
A group from the associates liaison committee raised the issue with management , but was given the usual runaround that it had nothing to do with their family status … .
Again , when we asked K&L Gates specifically about the status of female associates who have or are expecting children , the firm did not respond .
It does n’t appear that any of the laid - off mothers decided to go all Shinyung Oh on the firm .
But was n’t there a time when women were allowed to give birth without fear of getting canned ?
In any event , the events at K&L Gates suggest that this is not in fact the right time for Biglaw women to make babies .
It looks like the desire to survive at K&L Gates is at odds with the desire of any female associates to reproduce .
Arguably , men are still allowed to procreate at will .

Advertisement France coach Raymond Domenech has said some of his players may refuse to face South Africa because of Nicolas Anelka 's expulsion from the squad .
The Chelsea striker was sent home for verbally abusing Domenech during last week 's 2 - 0 defeat by Mexico .
When asked whether some of his squad might not play on Tuesday , the coach said : " It is a possibility . "
Domenech also labelled the players ' decision to boycott Sunday 's training session as " an aberration " .
They refused to take part in protest at Anelka 's expulsion , in a situation that has escalated to such an extent the French government have felt the necessity to intervene .
I told them [ the players ] they could no longer be heroes for our children .
They have destroyed the dreams of their countrymen , their friends and supporters .
Roselyne Bachelot
The forward was said to have abused Domenech at half - time during France 's second group game , which led to the 31 - year - old being substituted .
Anelka later refused to apologise when asked to do so by French Football Federation president Jean - Pierre Escalettes .
As a consequence , a statement was issued by the FFF stating that Anelka had been excluded from the squad , a measure supported by Domenech .
" Nobody can behave in such a way in the dressing room or elsewhere and high - level sportsmen and women have to lead by example through football , " he added .
The boycott of training led to FFF 's managing director Jean - Louis Valentin quitting his post .
France captain Evra was also involved in a heated argument with fitness coach Robert Duverne prior to the scheduled session , which required the intervention of Domenech .
Sports minister Roselyne Bachelot revealed an official investigation would be conducted into the incident after the tournament .
Acting on the instructions of French President Nicolas Sarkozy , Bachelot confronted the players and then held an impromptu media briefing at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein .
" The government has had to intervene as the reputation at France is at stake in this case , " said Bachelot .
" I told the players they had tarnished the image of France , " she commented .
" It is a morale disaster for French football .
" I told them they could no longer be heroes for our children .
They have destroyed the dreams of their countrymen , their friends and supporters . "

Bachelot also revealed that the players " applauded me and they were crying " after her speech , during which she asked them " How would you like people to remember you and what image do you want to leave behind ? "
According to a senior FFF official , the squad 's training boycott was prompted by several players .
" The three or four leaders are players past their prime who will never play a World Cup again , " FFF general secretary Henri Monteil told French daily newspaper La Charente Libre .
Later on Sunday , the French coach read out a statement on behalf of the players but was keen to add that he had not supported the boycott .
" We had to do something - the French people had a right to know , " added Domenech .
" What I should have said at the end of the message was that I did not support this action .
" With the FFF president and staff members , we tried to convince them it was stupid .
I disagreed with the document .
What they were doing was unthinkable .
" We 've wasted a lot of energy .
There are no words to explain what has happened .
I 'm hoping we will now have action on the pitch rather than off it . "
France are on the verge of making an early World Cup exit , having picked up only one point from two games .
They need to beat South Africa on Tuesday by a large score and hope that Uruguay and Mexico do not draw their match .

Meanwhile , in France , the national media have largely condemned the players ' actions .
French sports paper L'Equipe wrote : " A rebellion ?
No , a caprice .
A strike ?
No , cowardliness .
Do n't deceive yourself .
The republican solidarity that our players showed the world yesterday is an illusion .
" Evra has once and for all shown that he has muddled up the role of captain with that of a gang leader .
" Domenech , by lending a hand to this masquerade and reading out himself the players ' statement , has missed his final opportunity to show some style and courage . "
Newspaper Le Figaro added : " It is collective suicide ... the French team has heaped ridicule on itself in front of the whole world at Knysna .
" It was almost hallucinatory .
This is a psychodrama that will go down in the history of the World Cup .
The French team has been reduced to ashes . "

Facebook continues to face heat over privacy
Facebook 's announcement last week of simpler privacy settings was a good first step , users and privacy advocates said .
But the company is continuing to sweat it out from pressure around the world that it still is n’t doing enough .
And the biggest concerns revolve around their policy to share information about users unless their subscribers proactively opt-out .
Many have already seen the D8 conference video of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ( highly suggest following Twitter hashtag # D8 on his speech – the sweat !
the hoodie ! the drama ! ) , where the founder literally was under heat from privacy questions by The Wall Street Journal ’s Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher .
Today , the company ’s former head of privacy said the social network for near 500 million users has n’t gone far enough .
Chris Kelly , who is running for California Attorney General , said his former employer is still leaving its users vulnerable because of an opt - out policy for users who do n’t want their information shared with partner sites Yelp , Pandora and Microsoft 's Docs .
Specifically he emailed MoveOn ’s email listserve saying Facebook ’s opt - out policy for Instant Personalization – where a subscriber ’s list of contacts automatically appear on those partner sites .
” Today , I remain troubled by the news that Facebook still plans to offer only an opt - out to ‘ instant personalization ’— meaning that users ' information will be shared with third parties without clear consent , ” Kelly wrote to MoveOn ’s listserve .
He called on members to sign join the 171,00 - member strong Facebook group : “ Facebook : Respect my privacy . ”
Facebook said its instant personalization program is easier to shut off with new privacy settings announced last week .
In addition , Germany ’s consumer protection minister , Ilse Aigner , said Thursday that after meeting with Facebook ’s European policy director about the company ’s recent privacy changes , she had “ doubts as to whether these improvements will really bring a true turning point , ” according to the Associated Press .
Aigner said she plans to delete her Facebook account and said that her meeting with the company " unfortunately confirmed my skepticism . "
Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes said the meeting with Aigner was " constructive . "
" We appreciate Minister Aigner 's willingness to share her views with us on how we should further develop our model of privacy and user control and we will reflect on this , as we constantly do with others policy makers in Europe and elsewhere , " he said .
David Weigel , the Washington Post blogger assigned to cover the conservative beat , has resigned .
Weigel quits – and a debate begins
Blogger David Weigel ’s resignation from the Washington Post after emails he wrote disparaging conservatives were made public has touched off a raging Internet debate about journalistic objectivity and prompted Weigel ’s fellow Post blogger , Ezra Klein , to shut down the listserve where Weigel expressed his opinions .
The Post , which stood by Weigel after his first emails from Journolist were published and Wiegel apologized on his blog “ Right Now , ” apparently changed its mind when a new batch surfaced Friday .

“ Time to move on , ” Managing Editor Raju Narisetti told POLITICO Thursday night .
But Friday Kris Coratti , the Post ’s spokesman , said : " Dave offered his resignation and we accepted it . "
It was the second time an attempt by the Post to find a credible blogger to cover the right ended badly .
In 2006 , it hired Ben Domenech , founder of the RedState group blog , but allegations of plagiarism against Domenech quickly surfaced in the blogosphere , and he never started .
More recently , the Post has moved aggressively into the blogging space , hiring a cadre of young bloggers who had built their names at more opinionated sites , including Klein , Weigel and Greg Sargent .
But while Klein has been presented from the start as a liberal voice , Weigel ’s ideology was less clear .
A former writer for Reason magazine , he describes himself as having libertarian tendencies , but having voted for Obama .
Post National Editor Keven Merida told POLITICO ’s Ben Smith last month that he had never asked Weigel about his politics .
Weigel declined to comment , but Huffington Post ’s Sam Stein reported that Weigel offered his resignation Thursday night and heard from Post editors that his comments were not serious enough to cost him his job .
It was only after the Daily Caller published more emails that Post editors decided Weigel ’s position at the paper had become “ untenable , ” Stein wrote .
In the latest emails from the list , Weigel joked about wishing for the death of Rush Limbaugh and accused Republicans of " racism . "
A spokesman for the Daily Caller said the reporter had been working on the story on for several weeks .
The site crashed after the Drudge Report linked to it .
In his post announcing the shuttering of Journolist , Klein noted that it was ironic that it would be the Daily Caller , which was founded by conservative pundit Tucker Carlson , that ended up publishing leaked Weigel ’s emails from the listserv .
“ A few weeks ago , its editor , Tucker Carlson , asked if he could join the list , ” Klein wrote .
“ After asking other members , I said no , that the rules had worked so far to protect people , and the members were n't comfortable changing them .
He tried to change my mind , and I offered , instead , to partner with Carlson to start a bipartisan list serv .
That did n't interest him . ”
Klein added that , while he did n’t regret starting the listserv in 2007 , “ insofar as the current version of Journolist has seen its archives become a weapon , and insofar as people 's careers are now at stake , it has to die . ”
Fishbowl DC ran the first batch of e-mails Thursday .
They said , among other things , that Matt Drudge should " set himself on fire . "
After he learned that Fishbowl DC was about to publish some of the e-mails , Weigel apologized for his remarks on his blog , saying he was " incredibly frustrated with the amount of hate mail " he was getting after the Drudge Report linked to one of his stories about an encounter between Rep. Bob Etheridge ( D - N.C. ) and a videographer .
The reaction has , predictably , varied widely .
To Newsbusters , the right - leaning blog that had previously criticized the Post for putting Weigel on the conservative beat , the leaked emails confirmed what they already believed .
“ It seems that the Washington Post has little interest in an objective blog - based approach to the news -- something this humble blogger has noted previously , ” wrote Newsbusters ’ Lachlan Markay on Friday morning .
“ Likewise , Weigel seems to have little interest in covering the right with an even hand ; he has consistently shown his disdain for the movement and its members . ”
Others , like the Atlantic ’s Jeffrey Goldberg , argued Weigel had hurt the Post with a lack of professionalism .
“ The sad truth is that the Washington Post , in its general desperation for page views , now hires people who came up in journalism without much adult supervision , and without the proper amount of toilet - training , ” he wrote .
“ This little episode today is proof of this . ”
As the news of the resignation spread across the Internet Friday morning , a groundswell of support for Weigel sent out over Twitter and from other bloggers .
The New York Times ’ own young conservative , Ross Douthat , summed up much of the tone of the commentary : “ The real story here is n’t Weigel ’s public embarrassment — it ’s the shame of FishbowlDC for publishing private correspondence , and the disgrace of JournoList for harboring at least one would - be career wrecker .
The only decent response is to disband the email list — and to his credit , its founder is doing exactly that . ”
And Stein summed up the idea that the traditional media just does n’t get it , writing that Weigel 's resignation from the Post “ was a somewhat depressing reflection of the limits of the new media universe -- where the traditional powers have not quite yet reached a level of comfort with journalists who are transparent with their biases but , nevertheless , fair and accurate in their reporting . ”
“ Getting an exceptionally good sense of who my friends are today , ” Weigel Tweeted .
“ For the record , a whole lot of people are worse off than me .
I 'll be all right . ”

EVO 4G users , rejoice !
As of a few minutes ago , you can enjoy unlimited free WiFi / Bluetooth tethering using the Wireless Tether for Root users ( or simply android - wifi - tether ) app .
The app's main committer Harald Mue , who does n't even have the EVO in his possession , together with a community contributor Andrew Robinson ( who does have one ) have figured out what was going wrong with the EVO compared to other phones and together collaborated on a fix all within 2 days of finding the problem
Hey , wait a minute , was n't the EVO released the same 2 days ago ?
Community dedication never ceases to amaze me .
This is the change that did it by the way :
Prerequisites
The only prerequisite is , as always , a rooted EVO .
You can read about what root means here and get your EVO rooted in one click by following instructions here .
Really , there has never been a simpler way to root - you 'll be done in 5 seconds .
Download
Update 6/6/10 : android - wifi - tether does not yet work in infrastructure mode , i.e. your devices have to be capable of joining an ad - hoc network .
Android devices cannot as of right now , so your other mobile phone may not be able to do so .
Try a laptop or an iCrap .
Update 6/11/10 : Infrastructure mode and WPA2 are now supported by the latest release !
After you 've rooted , head over to android - wifi - tether 's download page and download a version that is at least 2.0.2.
pre14 - this is where EVO support is introduced .
You can do this right on your phone by going to the above url and downloading and installing the right .apk file .
Sprint's WiFi Hotspot
Update 6/11/10 : Infrastructure mode and WPA2 are : Infrastructure mode and WPA2 are now supported by the latest release !
Sprint offers its own version of the WiFi app , which supports stronger encryption ( WPA / WPA2 ) , while android - wifi - tether only supports a weak WEP .
However , Sprint 's hotspot app costs $ 30 a month while and roid - wifi - tether is free .
You 're paying Sprint $ 10 " premium data " per month already , so why not really take advantage of it ?
I 've been using it on my Hero for months , and it 's probably the most useful app on the market , hands down .
While being concerned about WEP , I also use a whitelist capability of android - wifi- tether , which only lets through my pre-approved WiFi MAC addresses .
While there is a way to get around that too , chances are the dude on the train next to you will not get a chance to do it ( really , it'd be quite complicated ) .
Now , there may still be bugs , but I and many other users confirmed the new pre14 release to be working .
Download yours , test it out , and report back please .
He did his best , but the face plant from 25 feet up was inevitable !
Canada 's long - awaited copyright modernization bill appeared today .
If passed , it would explicitly legalize DVRs , YouTube mashups , backups , and parodies — and it would slap strong , US - style restrictions on bypassing DRM .
Forget fair dealing ; as in the US , digital locks trump all .
The good , the bad , the ugly
Last time around , Canada 's tough attempt at reforming its copyright laws fell apart over widespread public anger .
The country learned its lesson , eventually embarking on a lengthy public consultation process before trying again .
The product of those consultations dropped today in the form of Bill C - 32 ( read a leaked version ) .
It provides a host of welcome changes to Canadian law and legalizes behavior that Canadians have been engaging in for years .
The highlights :
Time - shifting .
It 's finally legal , though with an odd caveat : " the individual keeps the recording no longer than is reasonably necessary in order to listen to or view the program at a more convenient time . "
In other words , no long - term archiving .
Also , no giving recordings away .

They 're now legal for all digital works , though you can't bypass DRM to make one and the source must be a legitimate copy .

Statutory damage distinctions .
Statutory damages now apply differently to non-commercial infringers and range from CAN$ 100 to CAN$ 5,000 in such cases .
Commercial infringers can be hit with up to CAN $ 20,000 per infringement .
Compare this to the US , where willful infringement can hit $ 150,000 even for noncommercial use .

C - 32 contains a section on " Non-commercial User - generated content " that makes mashups legal , even when they use copyrighted content .
So long as they are noncommercial , mention the original creator ( when " reasonable in the circumstances to do so " ) , and do n't have a " substantial adverse effect " on the market for the original work .

Parody .
Canada 's limited fair dealing rights get a boost , with named copyright exceptions for " research , private study , education , parody , or satire . "
When it comes to ISP liability , the bill skips the US " notice - and - takedown " model found in the DMCA .
Instead , it codifies a " notice - and - notice " regime .
If a rightsholder sends a copyright infringement letter to an ISP , the ISP does not need to take down or block access to that content ; instead , the ISP need only forward the notice to the subscriber in question .
This keeps the dispute over infringement between the two main parties , and keeps ISPs from getting involved .
The bill also ratchets up enforcement against P2P sites .
" It is an infringement of copyright for a person to provide , " says the bill , " by means of the Internet or another digital network , a service that the person knows or should have known is designed primarily to enable acts of copyright infringement if an actual infringement of copyright occurs by means of the Internet or another digital network as a result of the use of that service . "
But the big new enforcement piece is the DMCA - style DRM provisions .
Bypassing DRM wo n't be allowed except in a few narrow cases .
Just as in the US , the bill makes no exception for legal uses ; DRM trumps fair dealing .
Circumvention software and devices would also become illegal to sell or distribute .
It 's this provision that incenses copyright critics like law professor Michael Geist , who otherwise has a positive take on the bill .
" In other words , in the battle between two sets of property rights - those of the intellectual property rights holder and those of the consumer who has purchased the tangible or intangible property - the IP rights holder always wins , " he writes .
" This represents market intervention for a particular business model by a government supposedly committed to the free market and it means that the existing fair dealing rights ( including research , private study , news reporting , criticism , and review ) and the proposed new rights ( parody , satire , education , time shifting , format shifting , backup copies ) all cease to function effectively so long as the rights holder places a digital lock on their content or device . "
The bill remains open to amendment as it moves through the legislative sausage grinder .
Canadians who care about these issues would be well - advised to contact their MPs quickly , perhaps noting that ratifying the 1996 WIPO Internet Treaties ( one big goal of C - 32 ) does not actually require this sort of approach to DRM .
Ivory Coast were been labelled the dark horses of this tournament by many , presumably all of whom were fortunate enough to miss their pathetic display at this year ’s Africa Cup of Nations , where they recorded a 0 - 0 draw with Burkina Faso in the group stage , and were eventually knocked out by an average Algeria side .
To get to the knockout stages , the Ivory Coast must get past Brazil and Portugal .
To do this , they have appointed Sven - Goran Eriksson – England fans will appreciate the irony there .
In a sense you have to feel sorry for the Ivory Coast – for the second World Cup in a row they are the most - fancied African side , but find themselves drawn against two top - class teams ; last time they were up against Holland and Argentina .
Drogba absence
Today ’s news that Didier Drogba will miss the tournament is an absolutely huge blow for the Ivory Coast .
As captain and main goalscorer , the Ivorian system was essentially entirely based around him .
Like with Chelsea , Drogba is at his best when he ’s the main man , and for his national side he was afforded that status as much as any other striker in international football .
His replacement will probably be Aruna Dindane , who spent last season on loan to Portsmouth ( and along with Bakari Kone , who will now be the ‘ first deputy ’ for the forward roles , has just signed for Qatari league club Lekhwiya ) .
With the greatest of respect due to Dindane , it ’s a big drop in quality .
Even more crucial might be the fact that he is a completely different player – he is half a foot smaller , to start with – and with Drogba playing a fairly classic target man role in national colours , it may necessitate a change of plan for Eriksson .
Continuity from previous regime
Elsewhere , Eriksson appears to have changed the first XI very little from Vahid Halilhodzic ’s favoured side .
Despite being a committed 4 - 4 - 2 man himself , the Swede has clearly recognized that the identity of the Ivory Coast ’s best players almost necessitates playing a 4 - 3 - 3 , for he has pacey wingers , physically imposing midfielders , attacking full - backs ( and a striker who liked playing upfront on his own ) .
The one player who plays in a slightly unfamiliar role in the side is Yaya Toure .
At club level he plays in a holding midfield position and often drops in as a centre - back when needed , but for the Ivory Coast , he plays a much more dynamic role , as he was used to doing during the early part of his club career .
He will probably be the most advanced midfield player , with Didier Zokora taking the holding role .
The identity of the third midfielder remains to be seen , but the most likely choice is Cheick Tiote , who spent most of the season as a substitute for Steve McClaren ’s FC Twente team .
He is a less physical player than his two midfield partners and is more of a ball - player , with the tendency to drift into wide midfield positions to receive the ball in space .
The back four operate as you would expect – Emmanuel Eboue charges forward from right - back , whilst there is a mirror image on the opposite side with Siake Tiene , who is presumably preferred over the solid Stuttgart left - back Arthur Boka because of his attacking ability .
Upfront , Saloman Kalou will switch sides with with Gervinho .
The pacey Lille striker will see Drogba ’s absence as his cue to step up and become the Ivory Coast ’s most dangerous forward , and could emerge as a star of the tournament .
This all assumes that Eriksson wo n’t completely change his system in Drogba ’s absence – a 4 - 4 - 2 would probably feature the same eleven players , but with Kalou dropping to one wing , Tiote shifting sideways to the other , and Gervinho moving to a central striking position .
A 4 - 4 - 1- 1 would see Dindane as the lone striker with Gervinho offering support from deep .
Lone striker formations have become increasingly popular in recent seasons , but as Liverpool have found with Fernando Torres ’ injury problems , and Arsenal have with Robin van Persie ’s long - term lay - off in recent months , the team can look completely blunt if you have to do without your best striker .

In a first - of - its kind lawsuit , an IT - staffing firm has accused one of its former employees of violating the terms of her non-compete agreements through her conduct on LinkedIn .
The lawsuit , filed in federal court in Minnesota by TEKsystems , charges former employee Brelyn Hammernik of soliciting TEKSystems ' employees and clients using LinkedIn .
The lawsuit alleges that after Hammernik left TEKsystems in November 2009 , she " communicated " with at least 20 TEKSystems contract employees and " connected " with about 16 of them using the Linked In professional network .
TEKsystems contends that Hammernik 's actions were on behalf of her new employer and constituted a violation of the noncompete and nonsolicitation contracts that she signed when joining TEKsystems as a recruiter in January 2007 .
Does merely connecting on a professional social networking site constitute a violation of noncompete and nonsolicitation contracts ?
The case could " have far - reaching implications for the law governing restrictive covenants in employment , " Renee Jackson , a Boston - based labor and employment attorney with Nixon Peabody LLP , wrote in a blog post .
The lawsuit raises the interesting legal question of whether the mere act of connecting with other professionals on a social networking site constitutes a violation of noncompete and nonsolicitation contracts , Jackson wrote .
" Does the mere existence of a network of professional contacts equal solicitation ? " wrote Jackson , who declined to be interviewed for this story , citing conflict issues .
It also raises the question of whether complying with a nonsolicitation restriction would require individuals to disconnect and de-friend colleagues and customers of former employees until the restriction period expires , Jackson noted .
According to TEKsystems , its restrictive covenants specifically forbade Hammernik from contacting its employees for the purposes of recruiting them , for a period of 18 months after leaving the company .
TEKsystems names two other former employees and Horizontal Integration , Hammernik 's current employer in its lawsuit .
The suit against Hammernik was filed in March , but the case has flown largely under the media radar so far .
The TEKsystems complaint lists a specific example of a Linked In communication where Hammernik appears to be inviting a employee of the firm to join her new company .
That one exchange could be seen as a clear violation of Hammernik 's noncompete agreement , Jackson said .
But even here it 's unclear if she would have some wiggle room if Hammernik 's contract did not specifically mention social - media communications , she wrote .
" Does the medium matter , or just the message ?
Would such communication be treated the same as e-mail , or does ' social media ' require its own standard ? "
Jackson wrote .
Rob Radcliff , an attorney with Gruber , Hurst , Johansen & Hail LLP , who has represented IT recruiting firms in noncompete cases , said it 's the first time where social - media communications are being used as direct evidence of a non-compete violation .
Radcliff said Hammernik could have a hard time defending herself based on the Linked In communications that TEKsystems has highlighted in its complaint .
But what is unclear is how the company might have gotten its hands on the communications , and how many other examples the company might have of similar exchanges , Radcliff said .
" In terms of the violation , the only evidence appears to be the Linked In communication , " he said .
" You got to wonder if the other communications were similar . "
Typically , unless there is some " draconian provision " , noncompete agreements should not prevent employees from using sites such as LinkedIn to remain in touch with other professionals and update contacts on their whereabouts , he said .
It 's only when they use such sites to openly solicit that the could run into trouble , as happened in this case , he said .

Center Henrik Sedin has become the first player in the 40 - year history of the Vancouver Canucks to win the Hart Trophy , awarded " to the player adjudged to be the most valuable to his team " as selected by the Professional Hockey Writers ’ Association .
Sedin garnered 46 first - place votes among the 133 ballots cast and accumulated 894 points to edge the two - time defending Hart Trophy winner Alex Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals , who was the top selection on 40 ballots and earned 834 points .
Sedin flourished in 2009 - 10 despite having to play 19 games without his twin brother and career - long linemate Daniel , who missed a large chunk of the season with a broken foot .
With 112 points – 30 more than his previous career - high – Henrik became the first player in franchise history to win the Art Ross Trophy as NHL scoring champion .
Sedin easily led the League with 83 assists , 14 more than runner - up Joe Thornton of San Jose .
Five of Sedin ’s career - high 29 goals were game - winners .
With a plus - 35 rating , Henrik Sedin has been a plus player in every one of his nine NHL seasons with the exception of his minus - 2 rookie year .
Minutes from the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee , the Fed ’s main policy - making arm , indicated that a few officials had a new worry : deflation .
Those officials believe that inflation  which is running at about half the Fed ’s desired range of 1.7 to 2 percent  has been so low that it could turn into a dangerous spiral of falling prices like the one that has plagued Japan since the mid-1990s .
“ Forecasts are very uncertain , but I do n’t view deflation as a near - term risk for the United States , ” Mr. Bernanke told Mr. Shelby , noting that inflation expectations had remained stable .
“ I think the Federal Reserve does have the capacity , the tools , should deflation occur  which , again , I do n’t believe is very likely  to reverse it , and we would be very assiduous in doing that , ” the chairman added .
“ I do n’t consider that to be a very high risk at this point . ”
Mr. Bernanke ’s testimony took a more cautious tone than he did in February .
The chairman noted weakness in the housing market , “ with the overhang of vacant or foreclosed houses weighing on home prices and construction . ”
He called the slow recovery of the job market “ an important drag on household spending . ”
And he noted that the growth in private payrolls  about 100,000 jobs a month in the first half of the year  was “ insufficient to reduce the unemployment rate materially . ”
The Fed expects the economy to grow this year by 3 to 3.5 percent , picking up only slightly , to 3.5 to 4.5 percent , in 2011 and 2012 .
The unemployment rate is projected to drop to 7 to 7.5 percent by the end of 2012  still far higher than the 5 to 5.3 percent that the Fed now considers to be full employment .
Mr. Bernanke said of the committee ’s last meeting : “ Most participants viewed uncertainty about the outlook for growth and unemployment as greater than normal , and the majority saw the risks to growth as weighted to the downside . ”
The Coast Guard seized about 30,000 pounds of shrimp apparently taken from an area in the Gulf of Mexico off the Louisiana coast that is closed to fishing because of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill .
The brown shrimp were confiscated from two fishing boats about 35 nautical miles south of Terrebonne Bay Sunday , according to the Coast Guard .
The shrimp were released back into the Gulf .
Keep an Open Eye could not find the official announcement , but there were several hundred confirmations that Microsoft ’s Kin is dead as a product .
The best coverage to be found on the demise of Kin is from Engadget – What Killed the Kin .
Here are some of the salient points :
It seems that after doing some initial work on these phones based around Danger ’s proprietary Sidekick OS , Andy Lees — the SVP of Microsoft ’s mobile division — instructed everyone to go back to the drawing board and rebuild the OS based on Windows CE .
It appears the company did n’t want a project that was n’t directly connected to its Windows kernel .
This move allegedly set the release of the devices back 18 months , during which time Redmond ’s carrier partner became increasingly frustrated with the delays .
Apparently when it came time to actually bring the Kins to market , Big Red had soured on the deal altogether and was no longer planning to offer the bargain - basement pricing deals it first had tendered .
The rest , as they say , is history …
But wait , there ’s more — the Kin team is being refocused onto the WP7 project , but that ’s not the only shakeup going on .
Our source said there had been rumblings that Steven Sinofsky — president of the Windows and Windows Live groups — is making a play for the entire mobile division as well in an attempt to bring a unified , Windows - centric product line to market .
If these rumors are true , the push inside the company could move to align all forthcoming projects with an overarching strategy that leads back to the introduction of a much more cloud - and mobile - centered Windows 8 release .
This goes directly against what we heard reps preach at both WMC and MIX10 this year , where the mantra was “ the phone is not a PC . ”
If things go according to this plan , like Ballmer said at D8 , “ They ’re all PCs . ”
This is indicative of the wrenching organzational and strategic changes going on at Redmond as light and mobile takes mindshare and increasing chunks of market share in consumer computing .
Now the probability of Windows 7 Phone making a Christmas debut may be wavering .
But Microsoft is not alone .
Consider the problems at Cupertino where the Apple Mac PC developers have had to endure high 2 x and 3 x price points just when Windows was so vulnerable ; yet the Mac OS X developers are vulnerable since they have yet to match Windows on the graphics performance by a factor of 30 % or more despite having identically the same hardware [ CPU , GPU , RAM and hard disk ] to work with .
And the Palm people at HP with some of their ranks depleted will also be under the gun to deliver webOS on not just an HP Phone but also a tablet or printer interface as as well .
And will RIM and Intel / Nokia be able to deliver timely touch + gesture OS updates to their product lines .
Clearly , the light and mobile heat is on across the Tech industry .
Update July 06 , 2010 : NYTimes has a feature article on the demise of the Kin coming on the heels of the Courier termination , the Vista disaster , and the shortfall of a number of other consumer products .
Tim O’Reilly is cited to support the argument that Microsoft software costs more and does not provide instant and complete availability , nor access to as many platforms as Open Source software lead by Google and others .
In effect , Microsoft has lost and is losing a generation of software developers – tough argument and how completely true will determine how well Redmond recovers from its current innovation trough .

Lawsuit seeks damages under organized crime laws
Oil firm BP “ manipulated ” the Bush administration into softening regulation of oil drilling , leading to the environmental disaster unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico , a lawsuit filed in a Florida courtroom alleges .
The suit , which describes the Gulf spill as “ an ecological Armageddon that could literally destroy the marine and coastal environment and way of life for generation of Americans , ” was filed on behalf of a Pensacola Beach property developer who says he and countless other property owners along the Gulf coast will lose large sums of money as the spill devalues their properties , reports the Pensacola News - Journal .

Lawyer Mike Papantonio , an occasional TV pundit who is leading the lawsuit , makes no bones about the fact his client sees the Bush administration as being primarily responsible for the spill .
“ The only way that happened was because there was a concerted effort to take all of the teeth out of regulations , ” he said , as quoted at the News - Journal .
In an unusual twist , the civil suit is being pressed under the US ’s RICO Act , a federal law passed in 1970 designed to deal with organized crime .
In effect , the lawsuit alleges that BP and the Bush administration acted as a crime syndicate .
The suit refers to “ a 2000 retreat for government officials hosted by former Vice President Dick Cheney with the goal of drafting a national energy policy , ” reports the News - Journal .
As Raw Story reported in April , Anne Womack Kolton , a former press secretary for Cheney who once defended the secretive energy policy meetings , has been hired by BP for its public relations effort on the oil spill .
Some legal experts doubt the RICO tactic will work .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s quite unusual to say that the [ criminal ] enterprise is created between private industry and the government , ” Stetson University law professor Michael Allen told the News - Journal .
“ I ’m not sure RICO sweeps that broadly and I am not sure what legally this action will bring to the table considering all of the other actions out there . ”
Allen was evidently referring to the fact there are now nearly 200 lawsuits pending against BP over the oil spill , the US ’s largest environmental disaster to date .
An inspector - general ’s report earlier this year indicated that the federal agency charged with overseeing oil reserves , the Minerals Management Service , largely failed to live up to the most minimal expectations of it .
The report showed the MMS to have allowed oil companies to fill in their own inspection reports , and at least one MMS inspector had admitted to a methamphetamine addiction that caused him to be high while carrying out inspections .

The report also found that , from 2005 to 2007 , MMS inspectors accepted numerous gifts , including meals and tickets to sporting events , from at least one oil company .

Activists protesting outside this year ’s meeting of the secretive Bilderberg Group say American citizens attending the meeting may be breaking the law .
The 56 - year - old group , which hosts some of the world ’s most influential financiers and politicians on annual basis , is alleged to have been the driving force behind the launch of several wars and behind a push to create a single global government — a claim that many observers describe as not credible .
ADVERTISEMENT
Among the attendees of previous years ’ meetings were former President Bill Clinton ; former UK prime ministers Tony Blair , Gordon Brown and Margaret Thatcher ; World Bank head Robert Zoellick ; Fed chairman Ben Bernanke ; and US statesman Henry Kissinger .
The Independent reports that this year ’s attendees include Jean - Claude Trichet , head of the European Central Bank , and Queen Reina of Spain .
Russia Today reports of “ rumors ” that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is attending this year ’s meeting .
Though , of course , there is no way to be certain who is at the conference .
This year ’s meeting is taking place this weekend in Sitges , Spain , a beach resort town south of Barcelona .
Like every year , the meeting is closed to the press , and its agenda and list of attendees are secret .
Some protesters outside the meeting say the participation of US citizens in the meeting is forbidden by law .
One protester told RT that the Logan Act of 1799 forbids US citizens from negotiating in secret with representatives of foreign governments .
Thus , if any American attendee were to come to an agreement on any issue , it could be a violation of federal law .
With Europe focused on the debt crisis in Greece and other countries , European protesters focused on the Bilderberg Group ’s alleged involvement in the creation of the European Union and Europe ’s monetary union .
Daniel Estulin , an investigator who has written two books about Bilderberg , told RT that the big question at this year ’s meeting is whether the Euro will survive the continent ’s fiscal crisis .
ADVERTISEMENT
But Estulin said people are mistaken to think the Bilderberg Group is working towards a world government .
“ Their plan is not about creating one world government , as so many people mistakenly believe , but rather creating what they call themselves the ‘ aristocracy of purpose ’ between North American and European elites . …
In other words , the creation of ‘ One World Company Ltd . ’
And to have one world company , you ca n’t have countries , you need to have economic blocks . ”
‘ BALONEY ’
Members of the Bilderberg Group themselves may share some of the blame for the concerns about the group secretly pushing for a global government .
In a 2001 book , author Jon Ronson quotes Denis Healey , one of Bilderberg founding members , as saying : “ To say we were striving for a one - world government is exaggerated , but not wholly unfair .
Those of us in Bilderberg felt we could n’t go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and rendering millions homeless .
So we felt that a single community throughout the world would be a good thing . ”
But not everyone considers this to mean that Bilderberg is building a new world order .
Investigative journalist Chip Berlet told Russia Today that the myriad conspiracy theories surrounding the Bilderberg Group are nonsense .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ This idea that the Bilderberg Group is a secret elite force that controls the world economy and is building a new world order is a giant pot of spoiled borscht made from rotten beets , ” he told the Russian news service .
Berlet noted that “ there are 15 or 20 other similar groups that have secret meetings ” and that “ most meetings between corporate leaders and government officials are secret . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The theories about Bilderberg are “ a hoax carried out by people who believe an elaborate fairy tale , ” he said .
But Berlet admitted that “ from a [ public relations ] perspective it ’s idiotic to have secret meetings with secret guest lists and a secret agenda .
Of course that encourages conspiracy theories . ”
He added that “ the organization itself has no power .
This idea that this is a plot that is carried out by 30 or 40 countries is baloney . ”

Today probably marks the official death of climate legislation in the United States .
Lindsey Graham , the only Republican even nominally favorable toward any kind of carbon pricing plan , has announced that he ca n’t support the Kerry - Lieberman bill because it does n’t allow enough offshore drilling (! ) , and without Graham there ’s pretty much zero chance of getting any further Republican support .
So the odds of passing climate legislation , already slim , have now dropped to zero .
The only option left is a pure energy bill , something that accomplishes very little , and accomplishes that little solely by offering up subsidies to every special interest you can imagine .
By coincidence , Stanford researcher Jon Krosnick has an op-ed in the New York Times today that suggests this is exactly what the American public wants :
When respondents were asked if they thought that the earth ’s temperature probably had been heating up over the last 100 years , 74 percent answered affirmatively .
And 75 percent of respondents said that human behavior was substantially responsible for any warming that has occurred .
…. Fully 86 percent of our respondents said they wanted the federal government to limit the amount of air pollution that businesses emit , and 76 percent favored government limiting business ’s emissions of greenhouse gases in particular .
Not a majority of 55 or 60 percent — but 76 percent .
Large majorities opposed taxes on electricity ( 78 percent ) and gasoline ( 72 percent ) to reduce consumption .
But 84 percent favored the federal government offering tax breaks to encourage utilities to make more electricity from water , wind and solar power .
And huge majorities favored government requiring , or offering tax breaks to encourage , each of the following : manufacturing cars that use less gasoline ( 81 percent ) ; manufacturing appliances that use less electricity ( 80 percent ) ; and building homes and office buildings that require less energy to heat and cool ( 80 percent ) .
So there you have it : the American public believes in global warming and wants the government to do something about it .
However , the American public does n’t want to do anything — carbon taxes or cap - and - trade — that might actually work .
But they do want to open the federal goody bag and dole out subsidies and tax breaks to everyone under the sun , presumably because these all sound like pleasant things to do and they ’re under the impression that they ’re all “ free . ”
Whether they work or not is n’t really on their radar .
And it looks like that ’s what Congress is going to deliver .
We are , in this case , getting exactly the government we deserve .
A government of children .

1Yes , I ’m feeling bitter about this at the moment .
Anyone have a problem with that ?
As a New Zealander , I was both delighted and concerned to discover that my country is considered the most peaceful in the world by the 2010 Global Peace Index ( GPI ) , a publication developed by an international panel of peace experts in collaboration with the Economist Intelligence Unit and published by the Institute for Economics and Peace .
On one hand , I think the world needs initiatives like this .
The study ’s founder , Steve Killelea calls the GPI “ a wake - up call for leaders around the globe ” , and I hope he is right .
But , given the factors it examines — such as levels of violence and crime within a country , plus military expenditure and wars — the GPI unfortunately glosses over some interesting realities .
First , if you do believe peace can be achieved at the end of a gun , it unfairly vilifies countries like the United States who , though they account for 54 percent of global military spending , tend to use this spending to ensure the “ peace ” of their allies and neighbors .
So countries sheltering under the military wings of a world power can happily slide up the index by letting the US ( and the other top spenders like Russia , the UK , France and China ) slide down .
Being a strong believer in nonviolent solutions to conflict resolution , I commend the GPI for bringing people ’s attention to the scale of military spending by these countries .
Most of the time I think what the US would call “ ensuring peace , freedom and stability , ” is just another name for exploitation and empire - building .
Unfortunately , the beneficiaries of this so - called “ peace ” are never challenged about their complicity in global conflict .
And complicit we are .
The New Zealand government sent troops to support the US - led invasion of Afghanistan immediately after the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
They have been there ever since .
According to Jonathan Steele of The Guardian between 20,000 and 49,600 people may have died of the consequences of the invasion .
It is estimated that in Afghanistan there are 1.5 million suffering from immediate starvation , as well as 7.5 million suffering as a result of the country ’s dire situation .
No matter .
The NZ government uses rhetoric about “ security ” and “ fighting terrorism ” as a justification for the continued involvement of the NZDF ( Defense Force ) .
The language used by the government creates the image of altruistic action by the military .
Soldiers are “ peacekeepers ” sent to do “ reconstruction ” — which obscures the reality that the Afghani government was installed by the US for economic reasons .
It was only after the media revealed that the NZSAS ( Special Air Service ) was there that the government admitted to their involvement .
They loudly trumpet the “ reconstruction team ” as “ humanitarian aid ” when in fact they are there to prop up the US military occupation .
A few years later , many of the New Zealand public watched in horror as the US invaded Iraq alongside the United Kingdom and smaller contingents from Australia and Poland .
When this invasion first occurred , Kiwi activists organized some colorful protests and marches to raise awareness , which further bolstered the general anti-US sentiment in the country .
Our Government at the time assured us we would n’t be involved in the war , and reassured by that fact , we allowed ourselves to sit back and busy ourselves again with the important business of disliking everything American .
How wrong we were .
Research by investigative journalist Nicky Hager makes it clear that our very own Government Communications Security Bureau ( GCSB ) have been heavily focused on supporting the US War on Terror since September 11 , 2001 .
When the US switched it ’s attention to Iraq , so did we .
It seems while New Zealand sits happy at number one on the GPI , our own tax dollars are funding an intelligence operation that supports the very same wars we once condemned .
We have become , unwittingly , a vital cog in the intelligence grabbing that so erroneously frames the crimes against humanity being perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere by the United States of America .
And that ’s only the wars we are involved in .
Internal conflicts are happening all around the world and they are causing death and poverty on a massive scale .
In Sudan for instance , 4.9 million people are now displaced .
Poverty fuels conflict .
Conflict exacerbates poverty .
In fact , the same researchers that produce the GPI estimate that violence costs the global economy $ 10.5 trillion a year .
That sure puts our measly Aid spending ( currently somewhere around $ 119.6 billion ) in perspective huh ?
As the famous economist Jeffrey Sachs once said , “ aid for the poor guarantees security for the rich ” .
What a no - brainer , right ?
Instability will grow where poverty festers .
Yet economically rich countries continue , for the most part , to fail dismally in their commitments to overseas aid and development .
New Zealand ’s track record is particularly dismal .
We committed to a United Nations target that all developed countries should give 0.7 percent of Gross National Income ( GNI ) as Official Development Assistance ( ODA ) by 2015 .
The 0.7 percent figure may sound complicated , but it is actually quite simple .
For every $ 100 earned in the country , the country gives 70 cents in aid .
Currently however , New Zealand gives only 0.3 % of GNI as ODA , despite repeated campaigning by the NGO sector and NZ public .
That puts us roughly 18th in the OECD , behind big military spenders like the UK and France , and behind the Aussies whom we love to criticize for their involvement in Iraq .
And since the 0.7 percent that we promised to give is ( obviously ) a percentage , not a figure in absolute terms , the actual amount rises and falls as our GDP rises and falls .
Our commitment to ODA is more of a moral statement than a financial one , and we can be doing a lot better .
Finally , does the GPI really pick up on what ’s going on at home here in New Zealand ?
We might be the world ’s safest nation for some , but not if you ’re a child or a woman .
Looking at UNICEF and OECD reports on Child Poverty in “ developed ” countries , New Zealand has a poor record of standards in caring for its children on just about every index .
One in six New Zealand children lives in poverty , meaning they are more likely to live in poverty than any other group .
A third of children live in overcrowded conditions , and we have the highest rates of youth suicide in the entire OECD .
This is unacceptable in a country as wealthy as New Zealand .
Violence against women is another issue that continues to persist as one of the most heinous , systematic and prevalent human rights abuses in the world .
The GPI has been criticized for not including indicators specifically relating to violence against women and children .
If it did , New Zealand might not enjoy its celebrated status .
In one national survey , 35 percent of the women interviewed reported being physically assaulted by an intimate partner .
I ’m not trying to be overly critical of New Zealand .
We have our issues , but we have plenty to be proud of as well .
We enjoy a heritage of peacemakers and heroes , like Te Whiti and Tohu , Kate Sheppard , and Sir Edmund Hillary , and strong stands on issues like Apartheid and Nuclear Power .
But that is no license to rest on our laurels .
If we are to be true to our heroes , we must continually strive ever upwards and onwards .
If we are truly to be ranked as peaceful , we should follow in the philosophy and footsteps of our pioneering peacemakers from Parihaka , when they reminded us :
Vendors using Competing Prefixes
IE Mobile for Windows Phone 7 has decided to implement support for - webkit - text - size - adjust .
They 'll also be adding their own duplicate vendor - specific prefix , - ms - text - size - adjust .
That 's right , Microsoft will be adding support for another vendor 's non-standard implementation .
Is this good or bad ?
The general consensus on Twitter would indicate that this is a bad thing but while there is a scenario where this could go terribly wrong , I have n't found a real world example to back it up .
So why is this a bad thing ?
Vendor - prefixed implementations may change
The point of a vendor prefix is to avoid a situation where an implementation changes before becoming a standard , thereby breaking all sites that come before it .
This is a good thing .
A vendor can continue to revise the syntax under a prefixed property without breaking things when they finally do become standard and implementations drop the vendor prefix .
If a competing vendor implements a vendor prefix , they run the risk that changes to the competing browser will then break their implementation .
For example , if Webkit changes how - webkit - text - size - adjust works then Microsoft will be in a tough situation because their implementation will break .
The problem is , any developer who implemented - webkit - text - side - adjust before the change will also find their implementations broken in newer versions of the browser .
Has there been a situation where a browser has changed the syntax on a vendor - prefixed property that has broken previous implementations ?
I can't think of any but feel free to chime in on the comments .
Of note , browsers have implemented syntax changes on non-prefixed properties like background that have broken previous implementations .
Multiple backgrounds , for example , break on browsers that do n't support it , requiring the background property to be specified twice .
( The situation is exacerbated by the fact that vendor - prefixed properties in multiple backgrounds will be ignored in other browsers , requiring backgrounds to be specified three or four separate times to support all current browsers . )
Mimicking another vendor 's prefix is like using no prefix at all
This argument is a misdirection and not the case at all .
If every browser implemented a single vendor 's prefixed property then the property would become standard and the prefix would be dropped .
For example , imagine - moz - opacity was implemented by all browsers before becoming standard .
The property becomes opacity and we all move on .
I 'd prefer this over - webkit - opacity , - moz - opacity , -o - opacity and opacity all having to be set .
It 's perfectly possible for all browsers to agree on an implementation using a prefixed property before re-implementing it with a non-prefixed standards - based property .
The simpler the syntax , the easier it is to expect that the implementation wo n't change .
The - webkit - text - size - adjust property is a perfect example of this .
It 's very simple and extremely unlikely that the implementation will change .
Implementations may change but syntax won't
Sometimes browsers do n't get the implementation correct .
Border radius is a prime example of this .
Firefox 2 , for example , had a problem with their implementation that caused the rounding to be unbalanced .
( I recall Happy Cog having an issue with this when working on the WordPress admin a couple years back ; I can't find the article , though . )
Had another browser implemented it like Firefox , the implementations would no longer match .
This situation is a little different because of expectations .
In this case , the implementation had a bug .
This was n't a style preference or syntax issue .
It was a bug in how a particular edge case was rendered .
Border - radius implementations across all browsers still do n't match the specification in a lot of edge cases ( something that IE9 is looking to address ; my apologies if Opera has already done this in 10.5 ) .
This is a grey area and I can see good points and bad points against this .
The question is whether a feature is implemented by a web developer based on the expectation set forth by these edge cases .
For example , if I expected all browsers to overlap border corners to compound transparency values then I 'd be terribly disappointed when this started to get fixed in subsequent implementations .
In this last case , how does one browser mimicking the implementation of another change this situation ?
I 'm not sure it does .
It 's like - beta prefixes and that 's bad
A - beta prefix had been bandied about on the W3C style list where browser developers and the public at large discuss CSS implementations .
The problem with the - beta prefix is that it prevents versioning of a particular feature .
Right now , vendor prefixes essentially act as a versioning process .
One browser implements it using Syntax A . That 's version 1 .
Other browsers ponder it and implement it using Syntax B .
That 's version 2 .
The vendor prefixes for each browser acts as the versioning system .
In the case of something like CSS gradients , browsers have implemented different vendor prefixes : - webkit - gradient versus - moz - linear - gradient and - moz- radial - gradient .
The syntax may be different but so is the property name which essentially means that they are two separate implementations .
Microsoft could theoretically implement both syntaxes and still not break anything .
Theoretically and hypothetically speaking
The night Mekisha Murray became one of only four Harris County Democrats to lose a judicial race , her husband had a quick and stinging analysis : " You have your mother to blame for this . "
And perhaps , she did .
But more so , the discriminating voters of Harris County , who apparently were turned off by Mekisha 's uncommon , or ethnic - sounding name .
Curiously , the only other three Democrats who failed in their challenges of vulnerable GOP judicial incumbents also had unusual names : Ashish Mahendru , Andres Pereira and Goodwille Pierre .
Well - funded top - ballot headliners like Barack Obama may have been able to overcome the obstacles presented by their funny - sounding names .
But voters seem less tolerant further down the ballot .
Murray , who was vying for the 351st criminal district court bench , earned 542,423 votes , compared with 555,403 for incumbent Mark Kent Ellis .
" Everyone , before they meet me , thinks I 'm black , " says Murray , a 34 - year - old former prosecutor - turned - defense attorney .
" And I 'm not saying that 's bad .
I 'm just saying that people prejudge .
And it 's just not right . "
Murray , with her fair hair and skin , is about as white as they come under the Texas sun .
But she 's spent her whole life battling the burdens of the name her hippie parents gave her .
( They told her it 's Native American . )
In elementary school , she 'd come home crying after traumatic teasing from Clear Lake classmates who accused her of being white on the outside , black on the inside .
She says the name helped shape her character and gave her a taste of prejudice blacks still experience in this country .
But problems persisted throughout her career .
At the district attorney 's office , a trial bureau chief kept confusing her with another prosecutor named Tiffany , who happened to be black .
When she sent out resumes , she got few responses , despite what she believes is an impressive one .
( She worked on the South Texas Law Review and , during her tenure at the DA 's office , she said she lost only one felony case , which she tried out of principle . )
" I am a damn good attorney and I 'm two years out of the DA 's office and I can't get my practice off the ground .
I 'm still running ads in the Greensheet . "
Her election last week was the final straw .
Murray has decided to change her name .
Mekisha will soon become plain Jane .
When we spoke Wednesday , she told me she was in the process of typing up the petition .
It 's not that drastic of a change , Murray says , because she 's the spitting image of her late grandmother , named Jane , and family members have always called her " little Jane . "
After a few days , Murray 's mother gave her blessing on the change , which she says is n't so much about politics as the need to draw more clients .
Murray is the sole breadwinner for her husband and 10 - year - old son now that her husband , a former sheriff 's deputy , is attending law school .
And she just spent $ 15,000 of her own money on a failed campaign .
I asked her if she felt like she was giving in to those who would stereotype and prejudge her ?
" Yes , definitely , " she said unflinchingly .
" But the real world is the real world .
You have to do what you have to do to eke out an existence .
Right now , I 'm a one - income family and I have to pay the bills .
And if I have to be Jane , then I have to be Jane .
But I 'll always be Mekisha .
" We can't kid ourselves , " she went on .
" I 'm a white girl , so I 'm going to have a white girl name . "
She would n't be the first to bow to the forces of name discrimination .
Judge wised up
Republican Cathy Cochran , a court of criminal appeals judge , first ran in 1994 under her married name , Cathy Herasimchuk , despite advice from many .
" I had said , ' Oh , do n't be silly .
The voters will know and understand the real me and they wo n't be daunted by the name Herasimchuk . '
And of course that proved spectacularly wrong , " said the judge , who placed last in that three - person primary .
When Gov. Rick Perry appointed her to the court in 2001 , she was wise to the name game and reverted to her maiden name Cochran .
So did her husband , who was happy to shed the cumbersome Ukrainian moniker .
Plus , he figured , she 'd taken his name for 35 years , so he'd take hers for the next 35 .
Then there 's the case of Ashish Mahendru and R.K. Sandill .
Both ran this past election as Democrats for civil district court judgeships .
Both are Indian Americans .
But only one will don a black robe come January .
After consulting his wife , and his parents , Ravi K. Sandill took the advice of a consultant and traded his name for his initials because , as he puts it , " at the end of the day , there 's a little bit of ethnic bias . "
" I was doing what I thought I needed to do to win , " said Sandill , who unseated 23 - year incumbent Republican Judge Sharolyn Wood in the 127th Civil District Court .
If Mahendru has any regrets , he 's not letting on .
He lost to Sharon McCally , the GOP judge with the highest percentage of votes , despite the fact that he outspent her 32 - to - 1 .
According to campaign finance reports , he spent $ 104,973 to her $ 3,299 .
" I 'm not John Smith , " Mahendru told me .
" I just knew I 'd have to work twice as hard and pound the pavement and try to do the right things to connect with people and I think we did . "
Sometimes , in politics , that 's just not enough .

Goatse Security iPad Hacker Busted For Drugs
Weev from Goatse Security has been arrested for drug possession .
Police officers claim to have found cocaine , ecstasy , LSD , and schedule 2 and 3 pharmaceuticals during a search of his home .
Weev was mentioned in the 2008 NYT article on web trolls .

It seems like the longer the Gulf oil disaster remains in the news , the more opportunities for BP to be revealed as negligent or intentionally deceitful pop up .
Yesterday , ABC News correspondent Matt Gutman found himself engaged in the latter when he was watched and questioned by a BP manager as he set up his laptop to talk on Skype by the shore in Orange Beach , Alabama– and near a cleanup crew .
“ You mind if I ask why you ’ve set up a camera right here while my guys are working ? ” the manager asked Gutman as the latter used his computer .
BP workers walking up and down the shore are visible in the background .
While the manager did n’t ask Gutman to leave , since he was told he would only be there for about five minutes , he still checked up on Gutman , seemingly to make sure that he did n’t ask the workers for interviews .
Gutman explains that it was common for BP managers to check up on him , and that journalists were being kept on watch .
He added that , even if the top officials had made it policy not to bar employees from talking to journalists , he was still having a hard time getting anyone to talk about their company and the cleanup effort on the record .
Even getting answers to questions like “ who do you work for ? ” was difficult , he explained .
This is n’t the first time BP has been accused of trying to block journalists by keeping them away from shores and telling employees not to talk to them .
But BP insists that they have done nothing of the sort , with COO Doug Suttles releasing a letter on Wednesday saying “ BP has not and will not prevent anyone working in the cleanup operation from sharing his or her own experiences or opinions ” and , furthermore , they are open to having the free press report on what they see by the Gulf .
Except here is video proving that , if not prohibiting employees from speaking to the press , they have been giving reporters a hard time for doing their jobs– or even looking like they are doing their jobs– and tainting the integrity of a company which Americans are increasingly reluctant to believe about anything at all .

It 's unclear how President Barack Obama will fulfill his promise to repair decades of damage to Gulf Coast ecosystem .
Obama
Gulf vow will be tough to keep
In his Oval Office speech on the BP oil disaster , President Barack Obama declared he would reverse the devastation caused by crude oil on the area 's shoreline , but pledged his administration would also address “ decades of environmental degradation ” and “ multiple economic disasters ” that have ruined the fragile Gulf Coast .
“ Beyond compensating the people of the Gulf in the short term , it ’s also clear we need a long - term plan to restore the unique beauty and bounty of this region , ” said the president , in a speech that initially inspired hope among viewers and listeners throughout Texas , Mississippi , Louisiana , Alabama , and Florida .

With those words , however , Obama also promised to rejuvenate the Gulf Coast ecosystem — a Herculean task that experts say could take decades , cost tens of billions of dollars and ultimately fail to satisfy conflicting demands in the region .
On Monday , Ray Mabus , Secretary of the Navy and former Governor of Mississippi , begins a visit to the Gulf Coast , 13 days after he was announced as the head of the Gulf Coast Restoration Plan .
According to his office , Mabus will travel throughout the Gulf Coast through Friday to begin his assessment of the area and meet with state and local officials .
He will also face the challenge of applying the President 's hopeful rhetoric to a complex reality .
While the commitment from Obama seems evident , the funding , strategy , and plan itself seem unclear .
BP will pay for efforts to undo the oil spill damage but the company is one of many actors — including the federal government , according to some environmentalists — responsible for the decades of Gulf Coast deterioration that Obama promised to reverse .
Each of the Gulf Coast states have different ideas on how to restore the coastal ecosystem .
And they must balance environmental interests against a wide variety of economic ones , including the seafood , commercial shipping , tourism and oil and gas industries .
According to Gulf Coast environmental experts , any effective recovery plan would become the largest environmental restoration project in the nation ’s history , far surpassing the $ 12 billion cost to repair Florida 's Everglades .
Mabus still has to address the big , multi-billion - dollar question : who will pay ?
“ The administration is trying to extract money from BP , ” explained Douglas Brinkley , a presidential historian from Rice University .
“ BP is saying , ‘ Nuh-uh — time out .
Your wetlands were damaged prior to the oil spill . ’ ”
Another complication Mabus will face is where to draw the line :
Who wins , and who loses ?
What portion of the 1,680 miles of American coastline in the Gulf of Mexico will the government define as eligible for restoration ?
Certainly , Louisiana qualifies , as a state that lost 217 square miles of land on the two days of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina combined , with another football field of marshland lost every 38 minutes .
Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - La. ) has indicated that help cannot come fast enough .
She has proposed a new governing authority for the Mississippi River Delta and Louisiana coast , hoping to overhaul existing federal agencies and bypass many of the bureaucratic hurdles to restoration .
The coastal region of the Gulf of Mexico is home to half of the United States ’ coastal wetlands , and to a wealth of resources , wildlife , and natural habitats .
But its coastline is carved with pipelines , and the Mississippi River , which empties into the Gulf , is " over - channelled " : altered from its natural course to facilitate shipping .
At the same time , the Gulf provides 1.2 billion pounds of fresh seafood and produces 30 percent of the nation 's domestic crude oil production .
Any efforts to reverse the complex , long - term ecological problems along the coastline -- including vanishing wetlands and habitats -- must balance nature against jobs and billons of dollars in annual revenue .
Given that challenge , experts like Stan Senner , Director of Conservation Science at the Ocean Conservancy , said Obama might not realize the scope of the commitment he made .
Senner , who was Alaska 's top environmental restoration and cleanup officer after the Exxon Valdez oil spill , said that fixing the oil - damaged ecology around Prince William Sound was incredibly difficult , even with a much smaller , limited oil spill and only one state involved in the cleanup .
Although the President vowed to create a cleanup plan “ designed by states , local communities , tribes , fishermen , businesses , conservationists , and other Gulf residents , ” Senner said he feels left in the dark .
“ I think the initial concern is simply a lack of information about what the government really is intending to do .
What does this look like ? ” asked Senner .
“ Mr. Mabus has been named somehow in charge of this Gulf Coast Restoration Plan .
I really do n’t know what that means and how organizations like mine , much less the public , are supposed to be engaged in that process . ”
For an effective cleanup , Senner said , the government must create an integrated , effective , efficient and well - funded plan , one that would address the complexities of both ecology and industry in the Gulf Coast , without “ just divvying up the pot and saying , ‘ Okay Alabama , you get this , Louisiana , you get this , Mississippi , you get this . ’ ”
Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , however , was concerned from the minute he heard “ plan ” in the President 's Oval Office address .
Citing the 2004 creation of the Gulf of Mexico Alliance , a partnership between the Gulf Coast states meant to “ enhance the ecological and economic health of the Gulf of Mexico , " Barbour said he and other local leaders already have a blueprint for restoring the ecosystem .
“ We do n’t need Washington to tell us what our recovery plan ought to be .
I thank Secretary Mabus and I hope he will be an advocate for what the Gulf States decide , ” Barbour told POLITICO in an interview .
“ But the most important thing is that the plan be developed by the people in the Gulf States , not dictated down by Washington … and when I say the states ought to direct this , I say it literally . ”
While Barbour wants to restore the ecological health of the area , he said he is skeptical of any projects that involve rerouting the Mississippi .
While many experts say rerouting the river is the key to undoing decades of damage and wetlands erosion , Barbour said that it would strain commercial shipping industry .
In the meantime , the U.S. must continue to protect , and maximize , the interests of the oil and gas industries , he said , calling Obama ’s deepwater drilling moratorium a “ horrible policy . ”
In Florida , meanwhile , many feel that they are the most victimized by the BP oil spill .
“ A lot of folks talk about how Louisiana and Mississippi are innocent victims , ” said Jim Beever , Principal Planner at the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council .
“ But remember , those areas have made partnerships with oil drilling .
Florida has not .
Florida is against offshore oil drilling . "
Beever and his team have worked for years to identify the dollar amount needed to restore the Southwest coast of Florida — mangroves , marshes , habitats , and estuaries — and determined the final figure of $ 15.4 billion .
He said he expects the administration to address Southwest Florida as part of the Gulf Coast Recovery Plan , even though oil from the Deepwater Horizon disaster has not yet reached its shores .
In Lousiana an aide to Landrieu , who specializes in coastal wetlands restoration , said that a proper plan for the state would cost $ 50 billion spread out over thirty years .
He added that the government should begin the recovery immediately , emphasizing that while the National Resource Damage Assessment — a Department of the Interior program that evaluates impact after oil spills — may take months to determine the effect of the BP disaster , long - term coastal restoration is a separate issue .
“ When you have starts and stops and unreliable funding , the very thing you ’re trying to preserve is washing away , ” said the aide , who spoke on condition of anonymity , who added that Louisiana has already received approval for several environmental projects that still await funding .
“ That process of authorizing projects and waiting for the government to appropriate money is not going to work , and when you combine that with the competing interests of multiple agencies it grinds it to a halt . ”
Keith Ouchley , Louisiana State Director of the Nature Conservancy , has also drafted recommendations , which he hopes will be incorporated into the federal plan , since Mabus 's ground assessment is late in coming .
" We ’re being proactive in this and we are going to reach out ourselves and see if we can't provide some feedback , ” he said .
The recommendations include creation of a Gulf of Mexico Restoration Trust Fund , built from a per - barrel tax on oil .
Brinkley said Obama needs to be more clear about all that this recovery will entail , explaining that there cannot be a middle ground to restoration , as in past years .
“ We as a country have only two options , ” he said .
“ We can either say , ‘ It ’s a wasteland down there .
Forget this way of life .
It ’s an oil and gas field and let ’s use it as an industrial zone , ’ ” Brinkley said .
“ Or , we can say , ‘ Save the wetlands . ’ ”
Pride Toronto ( PT ) has reversed its May board resolution banning the term “ Israeli apartheid ” and will instead require all participants to sign and abide by the City of Toronto ’s non-discrimination policy .
Queers Against Israeli Apartheid ( QuAIA ) — the target of the ban — has declared a victory and congratulated the queer community for pushing PT to reverse its censorship decision .
" This is a victory for the Palestine solidarity movement , which has faced censorship and bullying tactics from the Israel lobby for far too long , ” said QuAIA member Tim McCaskell in the release .
PT ’s reversal follows outrage in Toronto ’s queer community , as many condemned the organization for its restrictions on free speech
in the parade .
Read all of Xtra ’s coverage of the issue here .
Michael Went was one of the founders of the Pride Coalition for Free Speech , a group that formed in the wake of the announcement .
They ’ve been working around the clock to organize subversions and competing events since .
Those events included one that attracted 400 people and two others where angry queers marched on the PT offices .
An hour after PT sent out its late - afternoon press release , Went was sitting at a roundtable at a Latin America Pride Coalition for Free Speech meeting to discuss plans for Pride Week .
He was beaming .
" I ’m feeling pretty good right now , ” says Went .
Brad Fraser , another member of the coalition , says the ban would not have been lifted had it not been for the popular revolt of queer people over the last month .
" It ’s a tremendous victory for anyone who dared to speak out , ” says Fraser .
“ I do n’t think anyone ’s conscience would have turned them around on their own accord , least of all Kyle Rae . ”
On May 25 , QuAIA members and free speech supporters protested at the PT offices .
In response to the ban on “ Israeli apartheid , ” both the grand marshal and honoured dyke rejected their appointments .
On June 7 , more than 20 former PT honorees returned their awards in protest .
Matthew Cutler was at that press conference , where he returned a youth award to PT .
Like Went , he too hopes the community can begin healing .
" I do n’t know that there is an ability to apportion credit .
I think we all played a role , ” says Cutler .
“ There were many weeks of people feeling as though they were voiceless , and that they were n’t being listened to .
With today ’s decision , it ’s pretty clear that we were being listened to . "
This ends PT ’s second censorship battle this year .
In March , PT announced it would vet signs through an “ ethics committee , " a move that was roundly condemned and was rescinded two weeks later .
Xtra tried to reach PT executive director Tracey Sandilands at her office , but she chose not to comment .
A staff person promised that someone from PT would get in touch tomorrow ( June 24 ) .
Hundreds packed the June 7 meeting at The 519 , where plans were hatched to protest Pride Toronto ’s censorship decision .

Pride Toronto has announced that its recent resolution to restrict the use of certain language during the 2010 parade has been replaced by the requirement that each participating group read , sign and agree to abide by the City of Toronto ’s Declaration of a Non-Discrimination Policy , and that all groups that uphold this policy are welcome to participate in the 2010 Pride parade .
During a meeting between members of the board of directors , the executive director and well - respected LGBT community leaders Pastor Brent Hawkes of the Metropolitan Community Church , human rights lawyer and Pride Lifetime Achievement award winner Doug Elliott , and 519 executive director Maura Lawless , the board unanimously voted in favour of a proposal presented by the three .
The proposal is two - fold : the purpose in the short term is to resolve the impasse that the organization has found itself in since moving to disallow the term ‘ Israeli apartheid ’ in the parade , based on complaints from community members and the assertion by the City of Toronto that the phrase contravenes various city policies .
The decision caused widespread dissatisfaction in the queer community and allegations of censorship .
The first motion places the responsibility for determining a violation of city policy back in the hands of the city , as our review process has not established that violation .
The second motion establishes a representative advisory panel of community leaders that will lead a broad - based community consultation process with diverse queer communities to recommend a set of strategic principles and a decision - making framework that will help shape future festivals .
“ We are extremely grateful to the community leaders that took the time to work on this proposal and help us examine ways to resolve this impasse , ” says Pride senior co-chair Genevieve D’Iorio .
“ The Board ’s intention has always been to make the best decision possible to ensure the success of Pride , and we believe that this proposal is a really constructive way forward . ”
“ There are a large number of people that are sad at the way the community is currently torn over this issue , ” says Pastor Brent Hawkes .
“ Pride has found itself in the middle of a difficult situation , and we felt it was time to step in and see how we could help . ”
Doug Elliott agrees .
Recently , during a keynote address at the Law Society of Upper Canada ’s Pride Event , Elliott spoke out about the history of Pride and the way it has changed over the years .
“ It ’s not always possible to meet everyone ’s demands , ” he says , noting that some of the demands Pride has experienced are ‘ unrealistic . ’”
This solution upholds city policy without unfairly requiring Pride to interpret that policy regarding a controversial legal question .
Hopefully this will allow a harmonious parade this year , while a consultative process unfolds to allow community members to have their say in a constructive way about the future rules for the parade and the ongoing relationship between Pride Toronto and the broader LGBTTIQQ2SA communities . ”
In a recent press release The 519 called for public consultation and offered its support and resources to help find a resolution .
Lawless stated , “ This proposal reinforces how important it is that the diverse queer communities help shape the future of Pride , and I think the Board has shown great courage and foresight in committing to consultation and planning for the future . ”
The two motions comprising the proposal are as follows :
That the board of directors approve the following resolutions :
1 . Be it resolved that the motion of May 21st regarding language restrictions of groups participating in the 2010 Pride parade be replaced by the requirement that each participating group read and sign and confirm to abide by the City of Toronto ’s Declaration of a Non-Discrimination Policy and that all groups that uphold this policy are welcome to participate in the 2010 Pride Parade .
Any groups that refuse to sign will not be permitted to participate .
2 . Be it resolved that Pride Toronto appoint a panel of LGBTTIQQ2SA leaders and friends to recommend a policy to protect and advance the qualities of Pride and ensure it is true to its core values and principles .
The mandate of the group would be to consult with the community to develop recommendations to ensure a Pride that values and promotes freedom of speech and individual expression , inclusiveness and respect , pluralism and diversity , equity and fairness , celebration , humour and fun , and to make recommendations regarding Pride Toronto ’s ongoing working relationship with the broader LGBTTIQQ2SA communities .
Over the coming days , parade participants will receive a copy of the city ’s Anti-Discrimination Policy with a request to sign and return it ahead of the parade .
Meanwhile , the team at Pride Toronto will be working hard to finalize arrangements for the 30th anniversary festival .
We look forward to the community coming together to celebrate what Pride means to each individual member .
Edward Kennedy died last year of brain cancer at 77 , after a long political career at least partially redeemed the disgrace of fleeing his Chappaquiddick car accident , but the Massachussetts senator was subject of scores of death threats before and after the assassination of his brothers , documents released by the FBI revealed last night .
Five years after Jack was gunned down in Dallas and soon after Robert was shot in Los Angeles , one letter warned he was next .
" Ted Kennedy number three to be assassinated on Oct. 25 , 1968 .
The Kennedy residence must be well protected on that date . "
In 1985 , he and President Ronald Reagan were named in another threatening missive .
" Brass tacks , I 'm gonna kill Kennedy and Reagan , and I really mean it . "
The FBI has released more than 2,200 pages of documents after multiple freedom of information requests , saying on its website : " These threats originated from multiple sources , including individuals , anonymous persons and members of radical groups such as the Ku Klux Klan , ' Minutemen ' organizations and the National Socialist White People 's Party . "
Some threats were passed on to law enforcement agencies and Kennedy himself but there is no indication any were anything other than threats .
The FBI did investigate at least one itself , concerning allegations that Robert 's killer , Sirhan Sirhan , had attempted to hire a fellow prisoner to end Edward 's life , too .
The prisoner told the FBI he was offered $ 1 m and a car but declined .
Kennedy revealed in his book True Compass that , after his brothers ' violent deaths , he was startled by loud nouises and would dive to the ground when a car backfired .
The FBI documents reveal relatively little about the 1969 accident at Chappaquiddick Island , off the Massachussetts coast , in which a young woman , Mary Jo Kopechne , died .
Kennedy was driving when the car left a bridge over a pond .
He swam to safety , leaving his 28 - year - old companion who was not found until 10 hours later .
The files show the FBI was told almost immediately of the accident and Kennedy 's involvement but kept his identity quiet at the start .
The Boston FBI office relayed word to Washington headquarters on 19 July , 1969 , after being notified by Dominic Arena , the police chief in Edgartown , Massachusetts .
The report said : " Stated fact Senator Kennedy was driver is not being revealed to anyone . "
The FBI said last night however it had " no investigative role in this case , since there were no violations of federal criminal law involved .
Although there was a mistaken contemporary report about FBI involvement in the case , the Bureau was not asked to provide support to the local police investigation . "
Kennedy , then 37 , pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and received a suspended sentence and probation .
He later wrote that his actions were inexcusable , but he was afraid .
He said he " made terrible decisions " and had to live with the guilt the rest of his life .

The climate in atheism right now has suggested a certain kind of tension .
As I go around and give talks and meet different people , I ’ve been talking about what I call poetic atheism .
It ’s an alternative , in a sense , to an atheism that rallies only to science .
I ’m a little critical of science .
It overplays its hand sometimes .
But for the most part , I ’m not at all suggesting this as an alternative , but rather an “ and . ”
There ’s really no reason why we act as if we have to cede all the other aspects of culture to the religious world , and only cling to science as being the only side that ’s on the side of the atheists .
In fact , almost all the great poets have conversations in their poetry about doubting God , and even go all the way to dismissing .
It ’s such a strong tradition that it ’s almost amazing that we ’ve missed it and that we have n’t been leaning on it as much as we could .
I ’m sort of what I ’ll now call a Reagan atheist — came in real early .
I was still a pretty young person .
I went for my Ph.D. in history and I was going to study history with cultural history , mostly looking at poetry and history in Europe .
But Columbia University just kept threatening to hire a cultural historian and never quite did .
While I was there , I fell in with the historians of science .
I found it was just such an incredibly rich and poetic way of thinking about history .
I did my dissertation on a group of scientists in late 19th - century France who were such atheists that they formed the Society of Mutual Autopsy [ in 1876 ] in order to cut open each others ’ heads and prove to the Catholic Church that there was no soul .
They did this for 30 years .
They all had come of age under the [ Second ]
Empire , when the church had so much control of the culture that they really missed their youth .
So that when , in 1871 , the Third Republic comes in — it ’s another eight years before it ’s really a republican republic — and these guys are older , they have this sort of adolescent spirit .
They never got the chance to really be themselves .
That ’s why , after they formed the Society of Mutual Autopsy , they quickly begin to die , and they can dissect each other .
It sounds funny now , and it is .
It was even funny then .
They meant it to be .
They knew that the Society of Mutual Autopsy was a provocative title , and they published their statistics all over the journals in France .
It ’s funny now , because we do n’t think of most people thinking of the soul as something you could disprove in such a straightforward way .
But the reason that ’s the case is because of them .
That is , we forget that every time the religious move into a slightly more ephemeral , harder to disprove level , it ’s because somebody pushed them there .
It ’s because we pushed the definition of soul and said , “ No , I do n’t think that the brain is just meat that holds this thing that ’s the soul . ”
This is about the time that Darwin ’s On The Origin of Species comes out .
It takes about 10 years for it to get translated into French , and it ’s translated by a woman , Clémence Royer , who ’s an atheist .
She writes a preface that ’s like an eighth of the size of the book , all about how this book means there ’s no God .
It ’s huge in France , and actually takes about 15 years before Darwin disowns it and gets a more straightforward translation .
But yes , evolution comes into France with a totally atheist pedigree .
It ’s an amazing story .
A little earlier , Paul Broca , whom you may have heard of from Carl Sagan ’s book Broca ’s Brain ( which really is n’t much about Broca ) , had become the first person to find a relationship between brain morphology and personality , ability and traits .
He finds what we still call Broca ’s aphasia .
If you have a lesion on the third left frontal circumvolution of the brain , you will have trouble speaking .
It ’s the first thing we find , that here ’s this personality or trait of a live human being , and that you can do an autopsy after death and see this is where it is in the brain .
These anthropologists decided it was the proof to show the Catholic Church that the brain thinks .
It ’s weird , there ’s no question .
Consciousness in this meat is very strange .
But it does seem to be the case , and there ’s no reason to make up some more strange things and add to it .
Why do that ?
So Broca joins the Society of Mutual Autopsy and helps conduct the first autopsies , and his is the third brain they dissect .
Like I said , they do this for 30 years .
It ’s hard work , this brain science , and Broca kind of got lucky .
But in any case , these guys are not all such great scientists .
As I dug into it I found they were atheists first .
They used to have a “ Diderot dinner , ” which was a way of just slightly camouflaging what they were doing .
They would meet as atheists , and then when Broca and Darwin came out with their discoveries , they decided to go into anthropology , very specifically to make it an atheist vanguard , which they do .
They get God off the stationery in France .
They do a lot of small things that were almost tittered at , but it really is a huge change in culture , especially for France , which was , you know , the eldest daughter of the Catholic Church for centuries .
Eventually in 1905 , they get separation of church and state .
They were n’t finding new things , yet they kept doing it , and they were advertising it in places so that people all over France joined and sent in yearly dues .
I actually went to France and I did n’t know this stuff existed , but I found this box of their material , down in the basement of the Musée du Louvre .
In any case , people all over France joined .
The dues they paid were to help defray the cost of sending their brains to Paris for the anthropologists to dissect when they died .
What I found was that this really was a secular version of Catholic Last Rites .
These people lived in a culture that was so infused and suffused with the burial rites within the Catholic Church that they kind of transmuted them , and they had these materialist deathbed scenes .
They kept relics of each other .
They wrote these testimonies , these confessionals , about why they were so angry with the Catholic Church , why they believed in science and why they believed in the future and in progress .
But it felt a little sad to know that whereas with the religious version , you yourself were going to be part of the future paradise , here they wanted to attach their death in some way to the progress of the future .
It was sort of anthropology of anthropology .
Ancient atheist tradition
When I was trying to do general research on atheist groups through history , I found I really could n’t trust any of the books that were out there .
Most of them were from the religious side , and they argued that there were no atheists anywhere .
The few that were from the atheist side , I ’m afraid , were also a little bit too skewed to be of real use .
So it seemed straightforward to me to go through history and put together the atheism that I knew was there , because if you ’re an atheist you notice it when you ’re reading these little monographs of history .
Throughout all these different cultures , there it is .
But then when you look at the surveys , it disappears .
I guess people just do n’t want to take it on .
What amazed me when I started doing the research for Doubt was that not only was there atheism through all of known history , but it was a very cohesive movement — a movement that knew about itself in all these different periods , so that the early heroes were the heroes century after century .
Epicurus was one of the great ones .
Ecclesiastes and Job , two books that are in the bible , were both taken as atheist tracts that could be read , and were read , and were reinterpreted to argue this point throughout history .
The earliest atheism I found that was clear and as straightforward as you could want were the Carvaka , the ancient Carvaka in 600 B.C. in India .
They were before the Buddha , and we think the Buddha was influenced by them .
The Buddha says that his program is all , there ’s no spirit to it .
It ’s just like exercise .
You do it , and you will be released .
But the Carvaka say that all of religion is human made .
They say if there could be a soul without a body , there would also be mangoes hanging in the air without a tree , but there are n’t .
They say if , when your parents die , you burn them on a pyre so that they ’ll go to heaven , why not burn them now and save yourself the trip ?
They say the priests made it up to make money , and they go all the way to saying nature is sufficient .
Nature is sufficient .
Look at how it makes itself by reproducing patterns .
It falls into patterns .
The most - complicated patterns stick and they stay and they reproduce .
And they say there ’s no reason to make up some extra thing .
Just as you see the world now , the same things that are making it happen now must have made it all come into being .
They ’re really quite sophisticated .
They really even go all the way to what we think of as Hume ’s idea of not really being sure of cause and effect , because one happens and then the other happens .
They get to some freaky edges because they go all the way with it .
It lasts for centuries and centuries , the Carvaka .
Everything we have of it , as with so much of the history of doubt , is from polemics against it .
Because all of it was burned except these brilliant arguments against it that quote long passages , whole stories , whole texts .
It ’s funny that way .
Equally funny is how much we find atheists among the priests ’ children , because they ’re the best educated .
We see that in culture after culture , and again these things get saved .
What also gets saved is the atheism of famous and important doctors , whose work is so lauded in the culture that people just do n’t throw the stuff away , even though some of the texts are just about how the natural world is all that there is , and it ’s sufficient .
This is before the notion of science , but they do n’t have any trouble at all .
Look , Democritus had no electron microscope .
How did he come up with atoms ?
The answer is pretty straightforward .
How could all of this be here ?
What ’s it all made of ?
If you have a herring and you cut it in half , you have two pieces of herring .
How many pieces can you cut it up into ?
Do you get to a point where something is so small that it ’s no longer a herring , but some building block ?
It ’s a conceptual idea , just the way a tree blooms out a flower and then an apple from it , and then if you keep watching it rots and then goes back and it disappears .
It ’s just like the ocean waving .
The wave is n’t so much there ; it just clearly comes into being and goes with the substance , remaining the same .
People can observe that without having advanced science .
They can also just look around and say , “ If I do n’t believe in any sort of extra story , there must be some other explanation , and it must have something to do with the way nature reproduces itself . ”
‘ Here be dragons ’
The thing about relying entirely on science is it misses a lot of the subtleties that you can get by looking at some of the other factors that have been around the whole time .
For one thing , it misleads us into thinking that before science , there could n’t really be atheism , and there is atheism all over the world throughout history .
There are places where it disappears for a while , but it ’s never gone entirely .
I thought when I wrote Doubt that there would be a section in the middle where I said , “ Dark Ages , you know , here be dragons , ” and then we would come back .
There is no such thing .
The Roman Empire sort of collapses east , so that all the philosophers , all the people who know all the philosophy are in Byzantium , and when Justinian and Theodora kick them out , they go farther east .
They go into the Muslim world , where they ’re welcomed because they ’re all such great doctors , because philosophy and doctors go together at this point .
They ’re chased , as they ’re translated from language to language to language , all the way around the Mediterranean .
But when the Muslim world has it , that ’s the Muslim Golden Age .
By the time Islam comes around , the Jews and the Christians thought the age of prophets was over , so the Muslims had to find some way of arguing that they , too , were prophets .
They looked to Deuteronomy , and it says miracles make for prophets .
So the evidentiary miracle of Islam is the Koran .
That ’s what they came up with .
The atheist Muslims , who , as I said , are these best - educated people , sit around and make fun of the Koran .
This goes on for a good hundred years .
Then that , too , is sort of chased out , and it comes back into Spain .
Maimonides gets it .
And you get negative theology , which is incredibly secular stuff , saying you ca n’t even say God exists ( but they ’re saying that it ’s within negative theology ) .
We have not had much evangelism within atheism throughout history .
Throughout most of history , you know where we are — we ’re in the universities .
You come and find us .
We do n’t have to do outreach .
What ’s changed now are a couple of things .
One , Freud changed a lot .
Freud was one of the first of the great atheists who said : Let ’s try to convert everybody .
He said they deserve it .
They deserve the truth .
Before it had always been :
Let the fools have the nonsense , but , if you have compassion and you do think people have the capability of going through some difficult periods but then coming out to reality , well then you ’re sort of honor - bound to try .
[ Pierre ]
Bayle is the first one , 200 years before Freud , saying that it ’s very clear that morality is human .
We have famous atheists of great morality .
Spinoza is one that ’s always brought up .
Spinoza keeps using the word “ God , ” but he says it ’s exactly the universe .
There ’s nothing extra that ’s God .
Which everyone immediately understood as pantheism , which everyone immediately understood was atheism .
He never denied it , but he himself kept using this notion .
Another thing I was very concerned with was how come there were so many brilliant people who seemed to believe in God through history ?
But when I looked , what I found is , they do n’t !
They like the word .
St. Augustine says , look , I was going to be an Epicurean , that was enough , I was going to be a Platonist , that was enough .
None of these have ideas of God in them .
Plotinus later takes one of the o’s out of the “ good ” that Plato talks about and makes that into the God .
That ’s Plotinus .
Science is not static
Throughout history , the notion that we can do this all by ourselves remains strong .
But I think it ’s worth pointing out : Science changes a lot .
You do n’t necessarily want to say that you ’re getting all the strength of your intellectual meaning from something that changes every decade , such as medical science .
It ’s tough .
Certainly when you get to physics and cosmology , you get a couple of centuries ’ worth .
For example , if you like the Renaissance , you like the art .
You do n’t want to use their toilet paper .
You do n’t want to use their child - rearing manuals , and you do n’t want their science .
It ’s not that science is n’t good , but it ’s a method .
The very method has in its own concept the notion that it ’s fallible , that you ’re going to be adding to it , that you ’re going to be fine - tuning it .
That ’s the methodology you want to use .
But so much of life is about human experience .
And human experience does n’t all fit into the science box .
Maternal love can be understood through selfish genes , but that ’s not what ’s going on between a mother and a child .
It feels like it flattens that experience to look at it that way .
So we tend to look at them in two separate places , right ?
We understand it this way , and then we feel it over here .
But that ’s entirely unnecessary , because it ’s real because it ’s real .
If there is no God — and there is n’t — then we made up morality .
And I ’m very impressed .
People say they like the idea of a God because then we ’re being watched .
Someone else has meaning .
What could that even mean ?
Why would you want a record more than you want the chord ?
The reality of our lives is the reality of our lives ; it ca n’t get any realer .
Meaning , the meaning that we feel , is the meaning .
Durkheim , at the end of the 19th century , said that what we thought was God is the community .
And that ’s a really potent notion .
What we thought was God , what we thought was religion , is n’t falsified by the fact that we do n’t believe in God .
You can lean back into the everlasting arms of humanness .
We ’re here , too .
That feeling of being able to lean back into something larger than yourself , that feeling of communing with something you ca n’t entirely explain , all that is part of the human experience .
We do n’t have to reduce it or take it apart .
We get to just enjoy it .
But we have to somehow separate that from the philosophical belief if we put all of that into science .
Is n’t this life enough ?
I ’m often at universities , and lately I ’ve been bringing up the vampire stories to say , see ?
Nobody thinks eternal life has no problems .
It ’s a real problem .
Half of the Earth , the Eastern world , had the idea of constant rebirth , and they wanted out .
That ’s what satori is ; that ’s what nirvana is :
Get out .
While we ’re alive , we ’re hardly using this life .
We ’re hardly using the moments that we are actually in .
Who wants another ?
It ’s sort of our business to pay attention here .
The notion of our departed friends — hey , they made it into existence , and now they ’re safe in the first reel .
It does n’t change anything to have some other creature out there that you put all of these other things on .
These emotions are fundamentally human .
It ’s in poetry and philosophy that human beings have expressed that throughout history .
I was extraordinarily moved by finding out , in writing Doubt , how cohesive this is , how many men and women have been involved .
How much it ’s been consistent through the Middle Ages , where only now historians are translating the heretics ’ papers of the Inquisition — and a lot of them are n’t just heretics who believed different malarkey .
A lot of them say , I do n’t believe any of it .
They say they do n’t believe any of it partially because they ’re aware of the ancient texts of criticism and general critique of all sorts of supernatural things , but also sometimes just because they look around and they say , this world is not providential .
This world is n’t fair .
Why pretend it is ?
Morality seems more human .
The universe , not so much .
In Doubt , I talk about the way that we ’re human and the universe is n’t .
And religions are all about either saying that the universe really is human , it really does have love and intention and memory and purpose and narrative , and other religions try to get all those things out of us , a sort of a Zen approach .
We are like the universe , without ego .
The universe does seem to be a place , not a mind .
It has rocks and space , and brains are usually gray and squishy .
In my experience , there ’s really no crossover .
Need to get ‘ out ’ more
People throughout history have known doubt , have cherished it , nurtured it and shared it with each other , but as I said , usually not in an evangelical way .
But folks , with democracy , we have no choice .
Freud gave us a little bit more hope that we ’re not just destroying people ’s dreams .
For a long time , I was hesitant about trying to bring the message elsewhere .
You know , why should I bother the people who like believing these things ?
But then I realized , if I love someone , I do that work , right ?
I ’m not going to leave them believing in things that are n’t the case .
I want them to have the best reality possible .
And so with that notion , I decided that I would have to risk speaking what I saw to be the truth , to allow people to have the best tools possible to deal with a very strange situation .
There is no magic of the Trinity that ’s weirder than consciousness .
This is it .
We have all the magic .
It is what it is , and it does n’t make it any more special or magical to add something extra to it .
What makes it special and magical is to share it , and also to commune with it in oneself .
Religion has a few things right : community , meditation and ritual .
By meditation I mean either thinking nothing or dwelling on good texts on a sort of regular basis — to remember the situation that we ’re in .
Because if you forget it , it comes back and smacks you .
You have to remember death .
You have to remember what the situation is .
Because it makes life much richer , and it also protects you from too much surprise .
It would be wonderful if more of us knew the history of atheism , realized that we ’ve been sold a bill of goods .
It ’s the Cold War that really shut down the 20th century ’s ability to see our own history .
It ’s time to get rid of that .
The most murderous tensions are no longer with an atheist state but with a fundamentalist world .
There ’s more freedom now to start looking at that , and changing that .
But we ’re in kind of a wonderful time .
There ’s potential for change , we feel the change already happening , and the answer about when we ’ll be more able to be entirely out is up to us .
The more out we are , the more out we can be .

Over the last two days various Fox News personalities including Bill O’Reilly , Glenn Beck , and Sarah Palin has been pushing a new falsehood that Barack Obama turned down international aid for the Gulf oil spill .
While trying to play up the Obama ’s inept narrative the FNC crew neglected to mention that Canada , Germany , Mexico , Netherlands , Norway are all in the Gulf .
Fox News opened the day yesterday with Glenn Beck spreading the lie on Fox and Friends :
Advertisements
Beck said that Obama , ” needs to explain why we have n’t — why we turned down all the international help .
They offered it within a couple of days .
We said no . ”
Of course if Beck said it , then Palin had to run with it as she did last night on The O’Reilly Factor :
Palin said , “ What the federal government should have done was accept the assistance of foreign countries ; of entrepreneurial Americans who have solutions that they wanted presented they can’t even get a phone call returned .
The Dutch they are known and the Norwegians , they are known for dikes and for cleaning up water and for dealing with spills .
They offered to help and yet no they too , with the proverbial can’t even get a phone call back .
That is what the Norwegians are telling us , and what the Dutch are telling us , and then the entrepreneurial Americans , the company in Maine that has the boom and the absorbents . ”
The story was told again tonight on The O’Reilly Factor by Dick Morris and Bill O’Reilly via Media Matters :
Morris said , “ We did n’t get foreign ships in because he still has n’t waved the stupid Jones Act . ”
The only part of the Fox News story that is true is that the Jones Act has not been waved , but as a press release from the Unified Command for the BP Oil Spill noted yesterday , “ Currently , 15 foreign - flagged vessels are involved in the largest response to an oil spill in U.S. history .
No Jones
Act waivers have been granted because none of these vessels have required such a waiver to conduct their operations in the Gulf of Mexico …
Even if the Jones Act applies , a foreign flagged vessel can still conduct certain planned operations as part of the BP oil spill response if the vessel is an oil spill response vessel and meets the requirements of 46 USC § 55113 . ”
What about those Norwegians that Sarah Palin was so upset about last night ?
Well it turns out that they are already there along with several other countries .
Once again , from the Unified Command , “ To date , the administration has leveraged assets and skills from numerous foreign countries and international organizations as part of this historic , all - hands - on - deck response , including Canada , Germany , Mexico , Netherlands , Norway , the United Nations ’ International Maritime Organization and the European Union ’s Monitoring and Information Centre .
In some cases , offers of international assistance have been turned down because the offer did n’t fit the needs of the response . ”
Surprise , surprise , Fox News is not telling their viewers the truth .
FNC has a masterful ability to keep repeating a lie until it is accepted as truth by their audience .
The Fox News agenda is to turn Obama into George W. Bush .
The newest lie about the president turning down international aid fits in with their two year old narrative that Barack Obama is in over his head , which is why voters need to put the GOP back in charge .
The disheartening element to all of this is that there are a couple of million people who watch Fox News every day and the majority of them do n’t understand that they are being brainwashed by right wing propaganda .
All that the rest of us can do is stay vigilant and be ready to debunk the mistruths of Fox News at all times , and hopefully we can expose Fox News for what it really is and open people ’s eyes , even if it is only one viewer at a time .

So what ’s the biggest time - bomb for Obama , America , capitalism , the world ?
No , not global warming .
Not poverty .
Not even peak oil .
What is the absolute biggest ?
One like the trigger mechanism on a nuclear bomb .
One that ’ll throw a wrench in global economic growth , ending capitalism , even destroying modern civilization .
The one that – if not solved soon – renders all efforts to solve all the other problems in the world , irrelevant , futile and virtually impossible .
Yes , that one .
News flash : the “ Billionaires Club ” knows : Bill Gates called billionaire philanthropists to a super - secret meeting in Manhattan last May .
Included : Buffett , Rockefeller , Soros , Bloomberg , Turner , Oprah and others meeting at the “ home of Sir Paul Nurse , a British Nobel prize biochemist and president of the private Rockefeller University , in Manhattan , ” reports John Harlow in the London TimesOnline .
During an afternoon session each was “ given 15 minutes to present their favourite cause .
Over dinner they discussed how they might settle on an ‘ umbrella cause ’ that could harness their interests . ”
The world ’s biggest time - bomb ?
Overpopulation say the billionaires .
Too many people !
Yes , over - population is the world ’s # 1 problem .
And yet , global governments with their $ 50 trillion GDP , are n’t even trying to solve the world ’s “ over - population problem . ” G - 20 leaders ignore it .
So by 2050 the Earth ’s population will explode by almost 50 % , from 6.6 billion today to 9.3 billion says the UN .
And what about those billionaires and their billions ?
Can they make stop the trend ?
Sadly no .
Only a major crisis , a global catastrophe , a collapse beyond anything prior in world history will do it .
Here ’s why .
Civilizations collapse fast , crises trigger , leaders clueless
“ One of the disturbing facts of history is that so many civilizations collapse , ” warns Jared Diamond , an environmental biologist , Pulitzer prizewinner and author of Collapse : How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed .
Many “ civilizations share a sharp curve of decline .
Indeed , a society ’s demise may begin only a decade or two after it reaches its peak population , wealth and power . ”
Other voices are darker , shrill : “ We ’re past the point of no return . ” “ It ’s already too late . ” “ The end is near . ”
As with Rome ’s collapse , it happens fast .
Clueless leaders are caught off - guard , like Greenspan , Bernanke and Paulson a couple years ago .
Call it “ WWIII — the Population Wars . ”
A few years ago Fortune analyzed a classified Pentagon report predicting that “ climate could change radically and fast .
That would be the mother of all national security issues ” Population unrest would then create “ massive droughts , turning farmland into dust bowls and forests to ashes . ”
And “ by 2020 there is little doubt that something drastic is happening … an old pattern could emerge ; warfare defining human life . ”
War will be the end - game : For capitalism , civilization , earth ?
Diamond ’s 12 - part equation is very simple , fits perfectly with a global warfare scenario : “ More people require more food , space , water , energy , and other resources …
There is a long built - in momentum to human population growth called the ‘ demographic bulge ’ with a disproportionate number of children and young reproductive - age people . ”
And if the “ bulge ” stops for any reason , game over .
Economic “ growth ” ends , killing capitalism .
So look closely : Diamond ’s equation has 12 time - bombs .
But note , the first two are the biggest triggers in the formula .
The other 10 are derivative variables driving what we call the “ WWIII - Population Wars ” equation .
We ’ve expanded on Diamond ’s source data .
One .
“ WWIII - Population Wars : ” the “ Over- Population Multiplier ”
According to TimesOnline : A few months before the billionaires meeting Gates noted : “ Official [ UN ] projections say the world ’s population will peak at 9.3 billion [ up from 6.6 billion today ] but with charitable initiatives , such as better reproductive healthcare , we think we can cap that at 8.3 billion . ”
Still , that ’s 23 % more than today ’s 6.6 billion .
Can it be stopped ?
In a recent special issue of Scientific American , population was called “ the most overlooked and essential strategy for achieving long - term balance with the environment . ”
Why ?
Population ’s the new “ third - rail ” for politicians .
So they ignore it .
Yet , if all nations consumed resources at the same rate as America , we ’d need six Earths to survive .
Unfortunately that scenario is unstoppable .
Because by 2050 , while America ’s population grows from 300 million to a mere 400 million , the rest of the world will explode from 6.3 billion to 8.9 billion , with over 1.4 billion each in China and India .
Two .
“ WWIII - Population Wars ” equation : “ Population Impact Multiplier ”
Diamond warns :
“ There are ‘ optimists ’ who argue that the world could support double its human population . ”
But he adds , they “ consider only the increase in human numbers and not average increase in per-capita impact .
But I have not heard anyone who seriously argues that the world could support 12 times it ’s current impact . ”
And yet , that ’s exactly what happens with “ all Third World inhabitants adopting First World standards . ”
Folks , we oversold the “ American Dream . ”
Now everyone wants it .
Not just 300 million Americans , but 6.3 billion people worldwide are demanding more , more , more !
“ What really counts , ” says Diamond , “ is not the number of people alone , but their impact on the environment , ” the “ per-capita impact . ”
First World citizens “ consume 32 times more resources such as fossil fuels , and put out 32 times more waste , than do the inhabitants of the Third World . ”
So the race is on : “ Low impact people are becoming high - impact people ” aspiring “ to First World living standards . ”
The American Dream is now the “ Global Dream . ”
Warning : The “ Impact Multiplier ” will drive the global “ WWIII - Population Wars ” equation even if there is zero population growth to 2050 !
In Diamond ’s masterpiece , Collapse , the two key variables are what we call the “ Over- Population Multiplier ” and “ Population Impact Multiplier . ”
Now let ’s closely examine Diamond ’s other ten variables that are driving our “ WWIII - Population Wars ” equation :
1. Food .
Two billion people , mostly poor , depend on fish and other wild foods for protein .
They “ have collapsed or are in steep decline ” forcing use of more costly animal proteins .
The UN calls the global food crisis a “ silent tsunami . ”
Food prices rise making it worse for the 2.7 billion living below poverty levels on two dollars a day .
In “ The End of Plenty , ” National Geographic warns that even a new “ green revolution ” of “ synthetic fertilizers , pesticides , and irrigation , supercharged by genetically engineered seeds ” may fail .
Why ?
A joint World Bank / UN study “ concluded that the immense production increases brought about by science and technology the past 30 years have failed to improve food access for many of the world ’s poor . ”
Meanwhile , a Time cover story warns that America ’s “ addiction to meat ” has led to farming that ’s “ destructive of the soil , the environment and us . ”
2. Water .
Diamond warns : “ Most of the world ’s freshwater in rivers and lakes is already being used for irrigation , domestic and industrial water , ” transportation , fisheries and recreation .
Water problems destroyed many earlier civilizations : “ Today over a million people lack access to reliable safe drinking water . ”
British International Development Minister recently warned that two - thirds of the world will live in water - stressed countries by 2015 .
Water will trade like oil futures as wars are fought over water and other basic essentials noted earlier in Fortune ’s analysis of the Pentagon report predicting that warfare will define human life in this scenario of the near future .
3. Farmland .
Crop soils are “ being carried away by water and wind erosion at rates between 10 to 40 times the rates of soil formation , ” much higher in forests where soil - erosion rate is “ between 500 and 10,000 times ” replacement rate .
And this is increasing in today ’s new age of the 100,000 - acre mega - fires .
4. Forests :
We are destroying natural habitats and rain forests at an accelerating rate .
Half the world ’s original forests have been converted to urban developments .
A quarter of what remains will be converted in the next fifty years .
5. Toxic chemicals .
Often our solutions create more problems than they solve .
For example , industries “ manufacture or release into the air , soil , oceans , lakes , and rivers many toxic chemicals ” that break down slowly or not at all .
Consider the deadly impact of insecticides , pesticides , herbicides , detergents , plastics … the list is endless .
6. Energy resources .
Oil , natural gas and coal .
Pimco manages $ 747 billion : equity , bonds and commodity funds .
Manager Bill Gross recently described a “ significant break ” in the world ’s “ growth pattern . ”
He ’s even betting we ’re past the “ peak oil ” tipping point , heading down .
Consumer shopping will continue declining as economies grow very slowly in the future and “ corporate profits will be static . ”
In a recent issue of Foreign Policy Journal warns of the “ 7 Myths About Alternative Energy . ”
Are biofuels , solar and nuclear the “ major ticket ? ”
No , “ they ’re not , ” never will be .
7. Solar energy .
Sunlight ’s not unlimited .
Diamond :
We ’re already using “ half of the Earth ’s photosynthetic capacity ” and we will reach the max by mid-century .
In “ Plundering the Amazon , ” Bloomberg Markets magazine warned that Alcoa , Cargill and other companies “ have bypassed laws designed to prevent destruction of the world ’s largest rain forest … robbing the earth of its best shield against global warming . ”
Free market capitalism may be the enemy of survival .
8 . Ozone layer .
“ Human activities produce gases that escape into the atmosphere ” where they can destroy the protective ozone or absorb and reduce solar energy .
9. Diversity .
“ A significant fraction of wild species , populations and genetic diversity has been lost , and at present rates , a large percent of the rest will disappear in half century . ”
10 . Alien species .
Transferring species to lands where they ’re not native can have unintended and catastrophic effects , “ preying on , parasitizing , infecting or out - competing ” native animals and plants that lack evolutionary resistance .
In spite of the clear message in Diamond ’s 12 time - bombs , he still says he ’s a “ cautious optimist . ”
What fuels his hope ?
Our leaders need “ the courage to practice long - term thinking , and to make bold , courageous , anticipatory decisions at a time when problems have become perceptible but before they reach crisis proportions . ”
Unfortunately , history tells us that cautious leaders are myopic , driven more by self - interest and nationalism than courage and long - term thinking .
Eventually they ’re caught off - guard and their worlds collapse , fast .
They only respond to crises .
And yes , out of crisis may come opportunity .
And as Nobel economist Milton Friedman put it in his classic , Capitalism and Freedom : “ Only a crisis – actual or perceived – produces real change ” because in the aftermath of crisis “ the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable . ”
Too many , however , delay and respond to crises with too little , too late .
Bottom line :
The betting odds are 100 % that global leaders will wait for a Pentagon - style “ black swan ” crisis before acting .
Unfortunately , that delay positions the “ WWIII - the Population Wars ” dead ahead .
G - 20 politicians will ignore the UN ’s 9.3 billion population prediction .
And Bill Gates well - intentioned 8.3 billion forecast also falls far short , by ignoring the “ Population Impact Multiplier . ”
Wake up world , a global disaster is dead ahead : droughts , poverty , pandemics , global warming , wars everywhere .
But is this a “ Black Swan ? ” No .
Why ?
Because this crisis is in fact 100 % predictable using Diamond ’s simple 12 - timebomb equation .
Failure to solve his equation quarantees triggering the “ WWIII Population Wars . ”
Bet on the odds .
US secretary of state strikes a note worthy of Fidel Castro or Hugo Chávez during tour of Peru , Ecuador and Colombia
It is a call you would expect from Fidel Castro or Hugo Chávez : soak Latin America 's rich to help the poor and build a fairer society .
" In many places it is a simple fact that the wealthy do not pay their fair share .
We can't mince words about this . "
The latest newspaper column from Cuba 's retired communist leader ?
Another anti-capitalist broadside from Venezuela 's president ?
Step forward Hillary Clinton , secretary of state for the gringo empire , aka the United States .
Clinton has made tax equity a theme of a four - nation tour through the region this week , saying wealthy elites are starving governments of funds for infrastructure and poverty relief .
" Despite progress in some places , tax and budget systems are ineffective and inefficient in much of the hemisphere , " she said in Ecuador 's capital , Quito .
" Levels of tax evasion are unacceptably high as much or more than 50 % in some of the region 's economies when it comes to personal income tax . "
Before anyone could give her a Che Guevara T - shirt she added : " This is not class warfare or us - versus - them rhetoric .
It is a matter of recognising that this is not a zero-sum game and that the winner - takes - all approach to our economic future is shortsighted and obsolete .
More inclusive growth will make our entire economies stronger and more competitive over the long term , to the benefit of all . "
Clinton visited Peru and Ecuador earlier this week and is due today in Colombia before flying on to Barbados .
That inequality and poverty scar the region is hardly news but Latin Americans are unaccustomed to being lectured about it from the power that spent much of the cold war plotting against leftist governments and shoring up rightwing allies .
Clinton , facing tough diplomatic battles with some of her hosts over trade and politics , is thought to have chosen equity as a theme to give Washington a progressive makeover .
It seemed to help melt Ecuador 's leftist president , Rafael Correa , an occasional icy critic of the US , who said governments that sought equality used to be branded communist dictatorships .
Calling his guest " dearest Hillary " at a joint news conference , Correa expressed admiration for her and Barack Obama , and signalled improved relations .
" The new left that I represent is not anti anything .
We are not anti-capitalist .
We are not anti-American .
We are not anti-imperialist .
We are pro-dignity , pro-sovereignty , pro-social justice , pro-good life for our people .
We are in favour of the good things .
" We love the United States very much . "

At the turn of the 20th century , observers estimated the brown pelican population in Louisiana at close to 50,000 .
But by 1961 , no nesting pair could be spotted along the state ’s entire coast , according to LaCoast , a Coast Guard Web site .
Like another subspecies of the brown pelican found in California , the local birds had been hard hit by DDT and other pesticides , which acted to thin the shells of their eggs .
The eggs were crushed when the adults sat on them .
( DDT was banned in the United States in 1972 . )
In 1968 , Louisiana took birds from a surviving Florida colony and reintroduced them along the state ’s southern coast in three spots .
One was Queen Bess Island , which had been the site of one of the last breeding pairs before extinction , said Kerry St. Pé , program director of the nearby Barataria - Terrebonne National Estuary Program .
Still , the birds struggled , threatened this time by the loss of their habitat .
The local wetlands , hurt by levees in the Mississippi that blocked sediment from flowing downstream and by canals cut by oil companies looking to lay pipe , were sinking into the gulf at an astonishing rate .
Queen
Bess was going under as well until 1990 , when a coastal restoration project financed a rock barrier around the island , which stabilized it .
The pelican colony began to flourish and the birds ’ offspring helped repopulate the coastline , Mr. St. Pé said .
Last year , the birds were officially taken off the endangered species list .
But the oil spill , experts said , could change that .
Like all birds , pelicans are very sensitive to oil , said Melanie Driscoll , director of bird conservation for the National Audubon Society ’s Louisiana Coastal Initiative .
It prevents them from regulating their body temperature when it gets on their feathers , she said , and in Louisiana the pelicans are subject to overheating .
The oil can also poison the fish the pelicans feed on and seep through the shells of pelican eggs , killing the embryos .
The potential for damage was frighteningly apparent at the rescue center set up here by the International Bird Rescue Research Center with BP and federal and state officials .
All day Thursday , oiled birds , including the 29 brown pelicans , arrived at the makeshift veterinary emergency room built in a hangar on a former military base .
They were carried from Coast Guard helicopters in dog kennels and cardboard boxes with air holes punched in them .

Most of the birds were so thoroughly coated in crude that they could not stand up .
Some were stuck to the floor of their cages .
Workers wiped off thick globs of oil with towels , then gave them fluids and fed them a fish slurry .
Wikipedia's " crowdsourced knowledge " model has created a spectacular resource , but everyone knows the big caveat : if the data 's important , do n't trust the online encyclopedia without verifying it first .
So how well would a similar crowdsourcing model work for a detailed street - level map of the world ?
Several years ago , that question led to the creation of OpenStreetMap.org , a wiki - style world map that anyone can edit .
Several friends in the UK got fed up with the government 's stingy approach to data distribution ( Ordnance Survey has crafted ultra - detailed maps of the UK with public funds , but that data must be licensed for private use ) , and decided to do something about it .
The obvious question was " why bother ? "
Terrific maps from Google , Microsoft , and others already had a significant lead and were often free ( as in beer ) to embed and use .
But location services were exploding , and all were premised on mapping data .
The lack of any high - quality , worldwide , free , and open - source map remained a problem .
" Most hackers around the world are familiar with the difference between ' free ' as in ' free beer ' and as in ' free speech , ' " says OpenStreetMap in its list of frequently asked questions .
" Google Maps are free as in beer , not as in speech .
If your project 's mapping needs can be served simply by using the Google Maps API , all to the good .
But that 's not true of every project .
We need a free dataset which will enable programmers , social activists , cartographers and the like to fulfill their plans without being limited either by Google 's API or by their Terms of Service . "
A street - level map of the world might sound audacious , but OpenStreetMap has exploded in popularity — after starting with a few friends , more than 250,000 have now contributed mapping data to the project .
Soon , the map achieved amazing accuracy , especially in Europe where it originated .
Take a look at Germany , for instance , where open mapping has become a craze .
The Zoologischer Garten Berlin ( the Berlin Zoo ) exists in Google Maps , of course , but it has little detail ( though it does have satellite maps , which OpenStreetMap lacks ) .
Dedicated locals have used OpenStreetMap 's tools to do Google one better by mapping all of the zoo 's animals ; if you want to plot your visit to the lair of the " Gro?er Panda , " you can .
Even restroom locations are helpfully plotted .
OpenStreetMap 's take on the Zoologischer Garten Berlin
The Google Maps version
Platform !
As the map took off , it became clear that something more was needed to truly enable developers .
The map data alone was valuable , but how much more valuable would it be to create a mapping platform that could handle commercial loads , provide back - end routing services , handle geocoding and reverse geocoding , and build tools for working with the data and crafting new apps from it ?
Thus CloudMade was born .
After a year of building out the platform ( with much of the work being done by Ukrainian developers ) , CloudMade now has 10,500 developers using its mapping platform .
Every week , the platform pulls the newest data from OpenStreetMap , creating something new : the ability for frustrated map users to correct those annoying local errors , then see the changes propagate out to apps within a week .
Corrections are made " by people who know their area , " says CloudMade VP Christian Petersen .
And while one might assume that the bulk of the work being done is in places like the US or Europe , Petersen says that " 67 percent of all the mapping being done right now is outside of those markets . "
CloudMade hopes to profit by offering free access to its platform in exchange for a cut of ad revenue from free applications ( devs can also pay upfront if they want ) .
Where available , baseline map data was imported from open datasets , like the US government 's TIGER data from the Census Bureau .
But in many places like Europe , most of the map was handcrafted and began with a blank canvas .
The results are impressive : a spin around the map shows fairly detailed work already done on places like Mumbai and La Paz , though truly remote locations like South Georgia island have no features yet .
Unexpected challenges popped up along the way .
In China , for instance , the state puts tough limits on private mapping .
" Doing business in China is challenging " says Petersen .
And the occasional edit fray breaks out over sensitive maps , such as those depicting the divided island of Cyprus .
But Petersen believes that the crowdsourced approach to the underlying data works well — better than commercial alternatives , in fact .
" Passion wins , " he says , noting that pro mapping companies might send data collectors into an area once a year or so and update their maps even less frequently .
When local users are involved , local changes are made quickly .
Clean up your neighborhood
The accuracy of the data was put to the test last week when a company called skobbler released a free turn - by - turn , GPS - based map program for the iPhone based on the CloudMade platform .
Given the price of competing GPS navigation software , this sounds like a revolution .
Are people ready to fix their own maps ?
Sadly , the program does n't work well .
Crashes were common in our testing , response could be slow , and the interface was non-intuitive .
Users have given it a two - star rating .
Even the official press release featured a telling quote : " Although we know we 're not quite ready to challenge the expensive premium navigation solutions , we 'll quickly get there , " said skobbler co-founder Marcus Thielking .
Such problems can be fixed .
But there 's a deeper issue : will consumers trust a mapping program that encourages them to tap a " ladybug button " every time they run into a map problem ?
( The button sets a flag in OpenStreetMap that locals can use to investigate and correct errors . )
Users may balk at helping to create the map they 're relying on , but people once said the same thing about Wikipedia .
Certainly , the underlying maps are getting a workout ; CloudMade says that 7,017 edits are made every hour .
The process is addicting .
A quick look at my own neighborhood revealed a tiny error — a road mistakenly extended up a private driveway about a block away .
I created an account at OpenStreetMap , zoomed into the problem area , and hit " edit . "
A Flash - based map editor popped up , overlaying OpenStreetMap data on a satellite picture of the area pulled from Yahoo .
Fixing the area was a simple matter of dragging and clicking , and voila — I had made a small difference in the world .
( OpenStreetMap provides numerous editing tools , while CloudMade offers some with a bit more polish .
All affect the same underlying map data . )
Applying a diversion to the Brooklyn Bridge
Twenty minutes later , after cleaning up pond boundaries at a nearby park , adding a fire station , and fixing a road that mistakenly drove through some homes , I reluctantly moved on to other things .
The map 's level of detail is already superb , and editing was enjoyable .
Having such a free and open resource on the Web seems like a Good Thing .
Now , if CloudMade can partner with some truly outstanding developers and turn out some well - written code , it could soon be an extremely Useful Thing , too .
The commercial real estate bust is in full swing .
This $ 3 trillion mortgage market is standing to push hundreds of banks into failure and adding additional strain to the embattled FDIC .
Commercial real estate ( CRE ) is a good indicator of where things are heading economically because it is a reflection of what revenues are being brought in by certain properties .
For example , a strip mall owner will lease out space to clients that ideally will earn more money each month to cover their rents .
That is typically how CRE deals went down .
But for the past decade people invested in CRE with the implied notion that they could always sell the underlying CRE for a higher price irrespective of the actual revenue stream the real estate could produce .
For CRE this is sin number one .
Commercial real estate values went on a 91 percent tear from 2001 to 2008 :
Source : MIT Center for Real Estate
That 91 percent gain has been nearly wiped out since 2008 with a 42 percent price decline .
A 7 year rally can evaporate in one year .
Many banks have been trying to put off confronting dealing with poor performing CRE loans but they are now coming due in full force :
“ ( SF Chronicle )
The commercial real estate meltdown has caught up with one of the largest apartment complexes in the country – San Francisco ’s Parkmerced .
The loan on the property is headed for default , according to the development ’s owner .
“ Parkmerced and its lenders engaged a special servicer ( a company that specializes in handling loans in default ) to support the payments of the loan on the property , ” said Seth Mallen , an executive vice president of Stellar Management , co-owner of Parkmerced , in a statement released Wednesday .
The statement did not disclose the amount owed , much of it coming due in October , but real estate analysts have said there are two notes amounting to $ 500 million or more .
“ We knew the October date was looming .
This was a decision to move to the servicer so that our financial obligations will continue to be met , ” said P.J. Johnston , a spokesman for Stellar Management , a New York real estate company .
He did not name the servicer . ”
$ 500 million in notes are coming due .
How many residential homes would have to fail to meet that number ?
And keep in mind this is for a CRE deal with apartments which are usually easier to value .
What is the occupancy rate ?
What are market rents ?
What other costs do you have per year ?
Normally this is how you value an apartment deal .
But here , clearly what happened in the California real estate craze someone purchased this apartment not looking at cash flows but looking at appreciation numbers .
Parkmerced is no tiny deal spanning over 116 - acres and having 1,683 rental units in 11 towers .
The place was purchased for $ 700 million and has had improvement made since that time .
Run the quick numbers :
$ 700 million / 1,683 = $ 415,923 per unit cost
I went online to check monthly rental rates :
Studios : $ 1,850 1 bed / 1 bath : $ 1,795 2 bed / 2 bath : $ 2,595 3 bed / 3 bath : $ 3,380
Now who really knows what the current occupancy rate is in this market .
But anyone can tell you that for $ 415,000 per unit costs you better have near full occupancy at the higher price range .
Is it any wonder that this place is now under scrutiny of default ?
This has garnered national media attention simply because of the deal size .
But there are thousands of these deals on smaller scales all around the country .
People bet on appreciation instead of focusing on cash flows .
This was a big mistake in the CRE market and is going to drown hundreds of banks that the FDIC insures .
Just look at one aspect of the loan equation here :
Why do you think banks have stopped lending in this arena ?
The market is completely saturated with vacant real estate .
Commercial real estate either has a market or sits empty .
At least with residential real estate if you drop prices low enough you will get buyers .
With CRE if you built a complex with no foot traffic you ca n’t give the stuff away .
The loan is only one aspect of costs .
You have utilities and other fixed overhead .
The fact that banks have pulled back from this market tells us no good deals are coming to the table .
Why would you construct any more CRE today with so much vacant property ?
So many of these CRE deals are now coming due and have shorter refinancing windows of 3 , 5 , or even 7 years and the note is fully due .
Which bank in their right mind would refinance a loan out ?
The too big to fail have a large enough taxpayer money buffer to ignore these deals and sit back pretending CRE values are still high .
But smaller banks either have to get the borrower to pay or hope that another sucker bank will take the loan off their books .
This is not happening .
A $ 3 trillion market will collapse many small time banks and the FDIC is going to be extremely busy for years to come .

An Israeli settler attacked a Palestinian old woman and her grandson , on Wednesday , in Beit Safafa neighborhood of east Jerusalem .
Isaac Herkovic , an Israeli settler , took over the house of Shiha Ali , 80 years old , last month .
Ali was on her way along with her grandson to the protest tent outside their occupied house when Herkovic attacked Ali .
Ali sustained cuts and bruises all over her body from the attack her grandson sustained an injury to the head .
Ali ’s son called upon human right groups to intervene to stop the settlers ’ attacks .
The story of Ali ’s home started 18 years ago when settlers claimed that the house was theirs .
Ali went to court , but settlers started their attacks on the family in order to make them leave the house .
Last month they came and forced the old woman out , at night , and took over her house .
BRAVE BOY : Michelle Lemon with her son Elijah , 16 months .
He suffers from Prune Belly Syndrome , which has resulted in severe damage to his kidneys .
Elijah Lemon 's happy face belies his rare condition , Prune Belly Syndrome , which saw him born without stomach muscles .
As a result , urine is forced back to his kidneys , which have been severely damaged .
One kidney does not function at all and the other is failing .
The 16 - month - old is also deaf , possibly as a result of drugs administered to treat his condition .
Solo mum Michelle Lemon , from Lyall Bay , says life is a battle at the moment as the family wait for a kidney donor .
She is calling for a change to legislation to make it easier to harvest organs from braindead patients .
" We are playing a waiting game on keeping him alive .
I could keep him wrapped in a plastic bubble but I and his two siblings [ Michael , 4 , and Sophie , 7 ] have to have some sort of life .
" He has moderate to severe hearing loss .
He does n't speak and is learning sign language . "
Because Elijah 's syndrome was pre-existing , he falls outside guidelines for dialysis treatment and will eventually require a kidney transplant .
That will not happen until he puts on weight – he is 9kg – and has had surgery to improve his overall health .
" He would need muscle transposition surgery , which is done in the US , probably between the age of two and four .
" They take the thigh muscles , leave them attached at the hip , and flip them across the stomach to make abdominals . "
Elijah has developed strong back muscles in place of his abdominals to control breathing and hold up his internal organs if he stands .
He is monitored while sleeping , as he often stops breathing .
He has been admitted to hospital " dozens of times " , usually to have his bladder drained or to be treated for urinary tract infections .
Early ante-natal scans detect Prune Belly Syndrome and pregnancies are usually terminated .
But Ms Lemon planned a home birth and had a scan only about six weeks before Elijah was due .
" I would n't have terminated and I would n't have done anything differently . "
In most Western countries , braindead patients are kept alive on the assumption they are donors .
In New Zealand , medics assume the patient has opted out of donating until the family prove otherwise .
And even if a patient registers on their driver 's licence their wish to be a donor , it is not legally binding on their family .
" People tick a box on their driver 's licence and think that 's enough .
So many people die needlessly believing their organs will be used and they 're not .
It is just wrong , " Ms Lemon says .
There were 43 deceased donors of organs last year , 31 in 2008 and 38 in 2007 .
Elijah 's condition is so rare – Ms Lemon is aware of three cases in New Zealand – that there is no national support group that could help raise funds for overseas trips , operations and transplants .
Organisers say it would be ' barbaric ' to allow group to take part , but Israelis say Islamists would try and ' cure ' them all
A delegation of gay residents of Tel Aviv has been banned from joining a gay pride march in Madrid because authorities in the Israeli city have not condemned the recent attack on the Gaza flotilla .
" After what has happened , and as human rights campaigners , it seemed barbaric to us to have them taking part , " explained Antonio Poveda , of Spain 's Federation of Lesbians , Gays , Transexuals and Bisexuals .
" We do n't just defend out own little patch . "
The Tel Aviv group have reacted angrily to the decision , claiming that the Madrid activists were getting their priorities wrong by mixing the nine flotilla deaths with gay pride .
" I cannot recall anyone asking the Tel Aviv city hall to either support or condemn in this case .
That is not their job .
I also do n't recall Madrid 's gay organisations condemning any of the Palestinian terrorist attacks on cafes or buses , " Eytan Schwartz , a spokesman for the city told Spain 's El Mundo newspaper .
" Do n't they know that Islamist fundamentalists do n't just want to finish off Israel , but that they also believe homosexuals should ' cure themselves ' or die ? "
" It is shameful that they should join with pro-Palestinian and fundamentalist groups which are not exactly tolerant with homosexuality , " he said .
" Why do they mix politics with a gay pride procession ?
We were invited as an apolitical association and we do not represent the government , " Mike Hamel , one of the Israeli invitees , said .
Schwartz said that Tel Aviv had also extended an invitation to Madrid to send a gay delegation to the city .
Among other things , Tel Aviv had planned to take the Spanish organisers of the march to Gaza so they could witness a place " that is controlled by the fundamentalists of Hamas , who do not respect any human rights and believe that homosexuals should be killed , " Schwartz said .
" We invited the organisers of the gay pride event in Madrid to join a march this Friday in Tel Aviv , the only place in the Middle East where you can be gay in public , " he said .
" They would be able to talk to Arab gays who travel here secretly because they would be murdered at home if they revealed their sexuality . "
" We did that Chaser - type thing of publicly dissing him and then asking questions later , " Morrow said .
Although Rasmussen struggled to offer a succinct explanation of Wave to the Chaser 's Craig Reucassel during the interview , it gave Reucassel an idea .
" The next day we were doing some collaborative writing for our new iPhone and iPad app and Craig said ' Maybe we should give Wave a go , ' " Morrow said .
" Since then we 've been using Wave for quite a lot of Chaser 's content .
We sent Lars a slightly sheepish email , having paid the crap out of it , " Morrow said .
Morrow said the Chaser team had been using a mix of email and Skype to share material , but found Wave to be " a pretty good all - in - one substitute " for creating and editing content , and polling the popularity of different headline ideas between team members .
Wave is like a combination of email and instant messaging .
It was built to foster the sharing of rich content such as documents , maps , images and video for any group endeavour , and the Chaser team are not the first to question its complexity .
When it was first suggested to Google co-founder Sergey Brin in 2007 , he said he thought Wave sounded " kind of crazy " .
Although Brin now firmly believes in its future , its launch has not had a smooth ride , said Rasmussen , who is a senior engineer at Google Australia .
" We had a lot of interest after we first showed a demo and then when we got it out into peoples ' hands there was a fair bit of disappointment because it did n't change the world overnight .
" It was very immature – buggy and crashy and slow .
But primarily it was new and people did n't quite know what to do with it . "
Rasmussen said
Wave was tested out by 5 million people during its beta preview phase and retained 1 million active users who began " waves " of conversation on all manner of subjects ranging from a youth debate on climate change to a brunch club collaborating with members over future breakfast venues .
" We find it good because you can actually insert replies and comments paragraph by paragraph .
So you can try a gag a different way , put little edits in , and you can tell when everyone has read it , " Morrow said .
" Within a posting you can have a voting box so you can see if that headline has three ' yes ' votes and that others have n't seen it , " he said .
As for its complexity , he said none of the team found it hard to get to grips with it once they started using it , even though some team members were less than tech savvy .
" We run the gamut from early adopters that put Madonna and Angelina Jolie to shame , to people who are still using Claris Works from 1972 , " he said .
Although adoption of the tool has been limited by its invitation - only status , Google opened up the application to the public two weeks ago .
" I predict The Chaser will be even funnier in the future and I am perfectly prepared to take credit for that , " Rasmussen said .

“ Muslims are calling for the executions of homosexuals in America , ” Dean said on YCR ’s May 15 radio show on AM 1280 the Patriot .
“ This just shows you they themselves are upholding the laws that are even in the Bible of the Judeo - Christian God , but they seem to be more moral than even the American Christians do , because these people are livid about enforcing their laws .
They know homosexuality is an abomination . ”
“ If America wo n’t enforce the laws , God will raise up a foreign enemy to do just that , ” Dean continued .
“ That is what you are seeing in America . ”
“ The bottom line is this … they [ homosexuals ] play the victim when they are , in fact , the predator , ” Dean said , before going on to make a claim that has no basis in fact : “ On average , they molest 117 people before they ’re found out .
How many kids have been destroyed , how many adults have been destroyed because of crimes against nature ? ”
President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaUnseemly brawl unlikely to change a thing
It 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach MORE is directing government agencies to stop hiring lobbyists for boards and commissions .
The move is a continuation of Obama ’s efforts to curb the influence of special interests in the federal government .
On his first day as president , Obama signed an executive order that limited the ability of lobbyists to serve in government positions related to their previous lobbying activities .

The White House has allowed several waivers on its lobbyist ban for key administration positions , including former Raytheon lobbyist William Lynn who now serves as deputy defense secretary .
“ Although lobbyists can sometimes play a constructive role in communicating information to the government , their service in privileged positions within the executive branch can perpetuate the culture of special - interest access that I am committed to changing , ” he said in a statement issued Friday .
In September , Obama first announced his intention to stop hiring lobbyists to serve on the advisory boards of federal agencies .
Obama is now making it an official policy of his administration and directing the heads of executive departments and agencies not to make any new appointments or reappointments of federally registered lobbyists to advisory committees and other boards and commissions .
The OMB will write proposed agency guidelines on the policy within 90 days .
A key House panel voted Wednesday to cut off almost $ 4 billion in aid to the government of Afghanistan pending an investigation into charges that Afghan officials are blocking corruption probes and huge amounts of foreign aid is being stolen .
The bipartisan move by the foreign aid appropriations subcommittee comes after The Washington Post reported that top officials in President Hamid Karzai ’s government were blocking corruption probes of political allies and amid widespread assumptions that Afghan powerbrokers are moving millions of dollars out of the country .

The panel ’s chairwoman , Rep. Nita Lowey , D - N.Y. , is instead demanding that the Government Accountability Office conduct an audit of billions of dollar of past U.S. aid .
“ We have an obligation to every American to ensure that their hard earned tax dollars are not squandered through corruption and graft , ” Lowey said .
Military operations funded through a separate bill would not be affected , nor would humanitarian aid .
The House is slated to vote as early as Thursday on legislation funding President Barack Obama ’s $ 33 billion military aid request , which would fund the president ’s surge of 30,000 troops .
And the bill in question , a $ 53 billion measure funding foreign aid for the upcoming budget year , retains the money in placeholder accounts that could still be tapped before the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year .
“ I do not intend to appropriate one more dime for assistance to Afghanistan until I have confidence that U.S. taxpayer money is not being abused to line the pockets of corrupt Afghan government officials , drug lords and terrorists , ” Lowey said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Rep. Kay Granger of Texas , top Republican on the panel , agreed with the aid cutoff .
“ The administration ’s policy of providing direct assistance to the government of Afghanistan assumes a great deal of risk and with ongoing corruption inside the Afghan government , it is difficult to justify , ” Granger said .
But Rep. Mark Kirk , R - Ill. , worried that the move could imperil important projects such as improvements to Kandahar ’s electrical system , which he said is an important step to winning over the residents of the area to the U.S. mission .

An Australian hedge - fund manager filed a lawsuit seeking more than $ 1 billion in damages from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , accusing the Wall Street firm of fraudulently selling a " now notorious " financial instrument called Timberwolf .
The collateralized debt obligation collapsed when housing prices tumbled in 2007 , resulting in steep losses to the $ 78 million invested by Basis Capital , the hedge - fund manager .
The lawsuit , filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York , seeks at least $ 56 million in damages related to Goldman 's alleged " false representations " and more than $ 1 billion in punitive damages .
" Goldman was pressuring investors to take the risk of toxic securities off its books with knowingly false sales pitches , " said Eric L. Lewis , a partner at law firm Baach Robinson & Lewis who is representing Basis .
The hedge fund that bought pieces of Timberwolf had to be liquidated in late 2007 after its heavy losses from bets on the subprime - mortgage market .
Michael DuVally , a Goldman spokesman , said the suit " is a misguided attempt by Basis , a hedge fund that was one of the world 's most experienced CDO investors , to shift its investment losses to Goldman Sachs . "
The hedge - fund firm " made its investment at market levels — levels that it deemed attractive , " Mr. DuVally added .
In addition to the suit , the Securities and Exchange Commission is probing a number of mortgage - related deals created by Goldman , Morgan Stanley and other major Wall Street firms .
Florida has consistently snagged the dishonorable title as the nation 's most dangerous state for cyclists and pedestrians .
But on Tuesday , it was Miami - Dade that got the crummy prize .
Twelve cyclists died in the county in 2009 , seven more than the year before , and the most of any county in the state , according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety 's annual crash report , released yesterday .
Plus 65 pedestrians died on our streets , the most in the state and a dishonor we 've won consecutively since 2005 .
In injuries for cyclists , we rank second , with 454 , behind Broward .
So what gives ?
Should n't a county tailor - made for biking have fewer deaths on the road ?
There are several answers to that question .
Most activists point to the lack of bicycle lanes and proper public transportation .
According to the Metropolitan Planning Organization , there are only 61 miles of bike lanes in the Miami - Dade .
By comparison , in the most populous county in the nation , Los Angeles , there were 33 deaths resulting from accidents in 2008 .
But , of course , L.A. has at least 400 miles of bike lanes .
To recap , here are just a few of the accidents we 've covered :
The first major cyclist death this year was Christopher Le Canne's .
Besides the drunk driver who hit Le Canne , a drunk motorcyclist ran over a biker near the Soyka complex in April , a bus driver crushed a Miami Beach 's cyclist 's legs in May , and another bus driver struck again later that month .
On the upside , the report shows that at the state level , cyclist and pedestrian deaths have decreased by 15 percent and 4 percent , respectively .
For the full report , visit the Highway Safety site .
Crash stats go back as far as 1994 .
Area politician has some explaining to do
Rand Paul is predictably walking his statements on the Civil Rights
Act back as fast as he can .
" Let me be clear , " he says in a statement released today .
" I support the Civil Rights Act because I overwhelmingly agree with the intent of the legislation , which was to stop discrimination in the public sphere and halt the abhorrent practice of segregation and Jim Crow laws . "
And that is , to be fair , a lot clearer than he was when he could n't answer the question " should [ the ]
Woolworth lunch counter have been allowed to stay segregated ?
Sir , just yes or no . "
But unfortunately for Paul , this is n't over .
Not by a long shot .
There is a category of scandal that I call " area politician believes kooky but harmless thing . "
A candidate who thinks he was abducted by UFOs would fit here .
It 's weird , but it does n't have many implications for public policy .
What 's gotten Paul in trouble , however , is that he 's so skeptical of government power that he's not even comfortable with the public sector telling private businesses that they can't discriminate based on race .
That , I fear , does have public policy implications .
For instance :
Can the federal government set the private sector 's minimum wage ?
Can it tell private businesses not to hire illegal immigrants ?
Can it tell oil companies what safety systems to build into an offshore drilling platform ?
Can it tell toy companies to test for lead ?
Can it tell liquor stores not to sell to minors ?
These are the sort of questions that Paul needs to be asked now , because the issue is not " area politician believes kooky but harmless thing . "
It 's " area politician espouses extremist philosophy on issue he will be voting on constantly . "

One of the more impressive feats in online poker history was accomplished yesterday when PokerStars pro Boku87 completed his $ 5 to $ 100 k challenge .
German poker player Thomas “ Boku87 ” Boekhoff started the challenge back in July of 2009 .
The Team PokerStars online member started the challenge with $ 5 and 0 FPPs , and set a goal of making 100 k within 12 months .
Several months short of the deadline , at 5:24 on May 19th , Boku87 posted the following on 2+2 :
challenge successfully completed
Will post screenshot of bankroll and graphs tomorrow
When asked , Boekhoff broke down the 100 k profit as roughly 54 % winnings from play and 46 % from cash bonuses earned via the PokerStars VIP Program .
For many observers , it was n’t a matter of if so much as when Boekhoff would complete the challenge .
This is the mega - grinder who first really made a name for himself by taking on all comers in one of the more famous prop bets in history when he successfully turned $ 100 into $ 10,000 in just 14 days .
For successfully winning that first challenge , Boekhoff earned not only the $ 9,900 from playing , but an additional $ 32,000 from the prop bet from a variety of opponents willing to offer him 3 - 1 odds .
Ironically , when Boekhoff was asked following his successful completion of that challenge if he ’d ever try another , he had this to say : “ Maybe , ” he said , “ but certainly not during summer .
If I come up with another bet I will do it in October or November . ”
For both challenges , Boekhoff had to play by very strict bankroll guidelines – he could n’t just keep leapfrogging limits and taking quick shots to inflate his bankroll .
Instead , the challenges were conquered the old fashioned way – by long days of sick volume .
How sick ?
Reference this now - famous video of Boekhoff mutli-tabling 51 SNGs – without Table Ninja .
Full screen shots of bankrolls and graphs will be added when Boekhoff posts them .
The second challenge did n’t generate quite as much attention as the first , and there ’s a good argument to be made that it was n’t much of a challenge at all – certainly not a feat that anyone would be willing to lay 3 - 1 against as so many were for the first challenge .
The lesson for aspiring prop bet creators : keep your challenges short , succinct , and difficult enough that people will follow along simply to see whether or not you fail .

Goldman
Sachs took billions in taxpayer bailout money that it did n't need .
We 're calling on the Treasury Department to demand it back .
We 've busted through our goal of 5000 -- can you help us reach 7,500 before we deliver the petitions Wednesday ?
SIGN THE PETITION TO THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT :
" Goldman Sachs got an extra $ 13 billion in taxpayer bailout money thru a secret deal it cut with AIG .
Now Goldman admits they do n't need the money !
The Treasury Department should demand our money back . "

Mycorrhizas
The word mycorrhiza is derived from the Classical Greek words for ' mushroom ' and ' root ' .
In a mycorrhizal association the fungal hyphae of an underground mycelium are in contact with plant roots , but without the fungus parasitizing the plant .
In fact the association is commonly ( but by no means always ) mutually beneficial .
Through photosynthesis a chlorophyll - containing plant makes simple carbohydrates ( using carbon dioxide , water and sunlight ) .
While it is clear that the majority of plants form mycorrhizas , the exact percentage is uncertain , but it is likely to lie somewhere between 80 % and 90 % .
In many of these associations between 10 % and 30 % of the food produced by the plant moves through to the fungi .
A point about spelling - youll often see mycorrhizae as another older spelling of the plural of mycorrhiza .
While the classical Greek word for mushroom is part of the word mycorrhiza , there are many mycorrhizal fungi which have fruiting bodies other than mushrooms .
An example is Hydnum repandum .
It s superficially mushroom - like ( stem and cap ) , but below the cap there are spines rather than gills .
Theres more about the fruiting bodies of mycorrhizal fungi later on .
This section gives some basic facts about mycorrhizas .
As these associations are important for plant health , they have been extensively researched , both in Australia and overseas .
Hence , there is a lot of information available , both on the internet and in printed form .
An excellent mycorrhizal website , especially from an Australian perspective , has been created by Mark Brundrett of the University of Western Australia [ http://mycorrhizas.info/].It deals mainly with ectomycorrhizas and VA mycorrhizas ( both of which will be explained shortly ) and gives much detailed information , numerous illustrations , many references and links to numerous other mycorrhizal sites .
Further in this section there will be links to specific areas within that site .
Another very useful website , with links to numerous other sites and bibliographies of printed information , is the Mycorrhiza Literature Exchange .
[ http://mycorrhiza.ag.utk.edu/]
The webpage of the new International Mycorrhizal Society ( formed in 2002 ) [ http://www.mycorrhizas.org/] may eventually replace the Mycorrhiza Information Exchange .
The printed references given in the button give useful overviews and are the source of much of the information presented here .
Ill make special mention of the first of these because it is very recent and with copious references .
It also has further information on all the topics discussed below and contains some interesting hypotheses about the evolution of mycorrhizas .
Different types of mycorrhizas
Physically , there are several forms of mycorrhizas , with different forms of hyphal arrangement or associated microscopic structures .
Youll find micro-photographs of some of these structures in the introductory section of the this site .
[ http://mycorrhizas.info/#intro]
In vesicular - arbuscular mycorrhizas ( or VA mycorrhizas ) the fungal hyphae penetrate root cells and form intricately branched , shrub - like arbuscles within the cells and , at times , bladder - like vesicles as well .
These associations are often called just arbuscular mycorrhizas , since not all the fungi that are involved form vesicles .
There will not be much here about the fungi involved in VA mycorrhizas , not because they are unimportant , but because the fungi that are involved are outside the scope of this website .
The VA mycorrhizas certainly are very important and are well - covered here [ http://mycorrhizas.info/vam.html].
They are the most abundant type of mycorrhiza and the most ancient .
It is likely that these fungi originated between 350 and 450 million years ago and probably played an essential role in the colonization of land by the plants .
The hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi form a mantle around the root and also grow into the spaces between root cells - but do not penetrate the root cells .
The hyphae form a net - like covering , called a Hartig net , around the cells .
You ’ll find out a lot more about ectomycorrhizas ( and see some very nice photographs of Hartig nets ) here [ http://mycorrhizas.info/ecm.html].
While the VA mycorrhizas are the most abundant , no more than a few hundred species of fungi are involved , whereas over 6,000 species of fungi are involved in ectomycorrhizas .
Many of the worlds dominant forest trees form ectomycorrhizas and the ectomycorrhizal fungi produce many of the commonly seen fungal fruiting bodies in Australian forests or gardens .
To give just two examples , there are numerous species of Amanita and Cortinarius in Australia and these two fungal genera form ectomycorrhizal associations with various native tree species in a wide variety of habitats .
Therell be more about ectomycorrhizal fungi a little later .
In ericoid and orchid mycorrhizas [ http://www.anos.org.au/groups/newzealand/biology/fungi.htm] the hyphae penetrate the root cells but neither arbuscles nor vesicles are formed .
Woollsia pungens
Plants in the order Ericales are the dominant species in many arctic or sub-arctic areas of the northern hemisphere and many of the Ericales are more commonly collectively known as " heaths " .
The bulk of these plants form ericoid mycorrhizas .
Examples of Australian heath plants are the genera Epacris , Leucopogon and Woollsia .
These and similar plants are often collectively called the epacrids and ericoid mycorrhizas have been found on many of the Australian epacrid plants .
The reference given in the button contains much up - to - date information about mycorrhizas on epacrids and is the source of the various facts about Australian ericoid mycorrhizas given further on .
Thelymitra ixioides
a terrestrial orchid
The terrestrial orchids ( of which Australia has many species ) form mycorrhizas and need fungal partners in order for seedlings to survive beyond the germination stage .
In at least some species the orchid needs the fungus throughout the orchids life .
In these associations the orchid gets the better deal and in effect harvests the fungus .
Other types of mycorrhizas , not yet found in Australia are arbutoid mycorrhizas , ectendomycorrhizas and monotropoid mycorrhizas .
In effect , these are variants of ectomycorrhizas .
The ecology and roles of mycorrhizas
In many cases there is an exchange of nutrients between the two organisms , but in some mycorrhizal associations the benefits flow one way rather than both ways , as in the orchid example noted above .
Where there is an exchange , the fungus receives some of the carbohydrates photosynthesized by the plant and the plant obtains various inorganic nutrients and trace elements which the mycelium has extracted from the soil .
Photosynthesis provides a chlorophyll - containing plant its source of carbon .
Other important nutrients , such as nitrogen , potassium and phosphorus ( as well as various trace elements ) come from the soil .
Usually those other nutrients will be dispersed in the soil , so necessitating the exploration of a large volume of soil if the plant is to get the required amounts of those nutrients .
In addition , the non-carbon elements will be present in the soil in various chemical compounds - some of which are readily soluble and easily absorbed by roots whereas others are insoluble ( and therefore inaccessible to plant roots ) .
If a plant were to use roots to explore a large volume of soil , it would require a considerable expenditure of energy by the plant .
Making use of fungal hyphae saves this expenditure .
Moreover , the very fine fungal hyphae can explore much finer cavities than roots and are also capable of exploiting compounds that are inaccessible to roots .
Various mycorrhizal fungi also help protect the associated plants against pathogenic fungi , a number of soil microbes , heavy metals and toxic compounds .
Experimental studies have shown that many photosynthesizing plants fail to develop into strong individuals , if deprived of their mycorrhizal partners .
All in all , the plants get a fair return on the 10 - 30 % of photosynthesized carbohydrates that pass through to the attached mycelia .
Mycorrhizal associations can be fairly complex , with numerous mycelia ( from more than one fungal species and of more than one type of mycorrhiza ) simultaneously latching onto the roots of one plant .
Conversely , a given mycelium may be attached to more than one plant , perhaps even to plants of different species .
This latter plant - mycelium - plant connection allows the carbon produced by one plant to move through the attached mycelium to another plant .
In this way , a seedling growing in heavy shade ( and therefore unable to make much use of the sunlight ) can benefit from the photosynthesizing activities of some other , better - placed plant .
These intricate , multiway connections have led some people to refer to the underground roots - and - mycelia network as the " wood wide web " !
In the world there are over 400 species of plants which lack chlorophyll .
These achlorophyllous plants are found in many families and the majority rely on fungal associates for the carbohydrates which chlorophyllous plants would produce via photosynthesis .
In some cases an entire plant family is achlorophyllous ( such as the Monotropaceae in the northern hemisphere ) while in others ( such as the Orchidaceae ) only certain genera lack chlorophyll .
You can find photos and information about achlorophyllous plants here http://staff-www.uni-marburg.de/~b_morpho/imhtopic.html
In Australia the orchids Gastrodia sesamoides ( the Potato Orchid ) , Dipodium punctatum ( the Spotted Hyacinth Orchid ) and the two species of the genus Rhizanthella ( Rhizanthella gardneri and Rhizanthella slateri ) lack chlorophyll .
The Rhizanthella species are unusual because they are underground orchids , whereas both Gastrodia and Dipodium produce above - ground flower spikes .
The fungi involved in these associations are quite varied , both in terms of species and lifestyles .
For example the species of Gastrodia ( both in Australia and overseas ) are associated with species of Armillaria ( a genus of virulently parasitic fungi , which the orchids manage to keep under control ) .
The Western Australian underground orchid Rhizanthella gardneri forms an orchid mycorrhiza with a fungus that also forms ectomycorrhizas with Melaleuca ( one of the Australian native Tea Trees ) .
Incidentally , this also shows that some fungi can form more than one type of mycorrhiza .
The eastern Australian species , Rhizanthella slateri , pictured here , has been rarely seen .
It was discovered in 1931 on Alum Mountain , in Bulahdelah on the New South Wales north coast , and these photos ( taken in 2002 ) are also of specimens growing on Alum Mountain .
The fungal associate of this species is unknown .
Rhizanthella slateri
Rhizanthella slateri
All such orchids are directly parasitic on the associated fungi .
The carbohydrates that end up in Gastrodia and at least the Western Australian Rhizanthella originated in other living plants , so you could also look at these orchids as being indirectly parasitic on other plants .
Orobanche australiana
Not all the achlorophyllous plants have fungal associates .
Some attach directly to the roots of host plants and the best known are probably the Broomrapes , which constitute the genus Orobanche .
Here is an Australian example , Orobanche australiana , and this link http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/Scrophulariaceae/Orobanche.Gallery.html leads to a photo gallery of Orobanche species from around the world .
Another example is the genus Balanophora .
Both Balanophora and Orobanche are flowering plants , but are often mistaken for a fungi .
The mycorrhizal associations formed by a particular plant need not be static .
Over time , the fungi that are involved can change .
Some may associate only with young plants , others come into the picture only when the plant is a few years old - while some may stick around and it is possible that , depending on conditions , there are some which come and go .
A study of the ericoid mycorrhizas on several epacrid species in the south - west of Western Australia showed that the mycorrhizas were seasonal .
The area has a Mediterranean climate with cool , wet winters but hot , dry summers .
The mycorrhizas are formed on the very fine hair roots that grow out from the main roots .
In summer many of the hair roots die but regrow , and become mycorrhizal , in the wet winter months .
Similar studies around Sydney , not subject to a Mediterranean climate , didnt show this die - regrow pattern and studies in the northern hemisphere also show year - round persistence of mycorrhizal roots in most species .
In summary it seems that , except in very dry conditions , ericoid mycorrhizas are present and functioning all year round .
Finally , the formation of the mycelium - root connection is not just a simple matter of fungus - meets - plant , fungus - hooks - onto - plant .
There are soil bacteria , known as mycorrhizal helper bacteria , which promote the formation of mycorrhizas .
You ’ll find out much more about the roles of mycorrhizas here [ http://mycorrhizas.info/roles.html].
Which plants form mycorrhizas ?
It has been estimated that at least 80 % and perhaps up to 90 % of the world 's plants form mycorrhizas of one form or another and you will find mycorrhizal associations from well - watered forests to the arid areas .
The table on this page [ http://mycorrhizas.info/ozplants.html] gives the mycorrhizal status of numerous genera of Australian plants .
Many of the imported garden trees in Australia are also mycorrhizal , for example beeches , oaks , firs and pines .
Banksia praemorsa
Though a great many Australian plants form mycorrhizas , especially VA mycorrhizas , there are some noteworthy exceptions .
For example , many genera in the Proteaceae ( which includes the widespread genera Banksia , Grevillea and Hakea ) do not form mycorrhizas .
Even in artificial conditions , when attempts are made to force mycorrhizas these genera seem to actively resist mycorrhizal formation .
While 80 - 90 % of plants form mycorrhizas , the proportion of mycorrhizal plants in a particular habitat may be markedly different from the percentage range just given .
Depending on the plant composition of an area the proportion of mycorrhizal plants may be virtually 100 % or less than 50 % .
Given what was just said about the Proteaceae , just think of an area of Australian bushland dominated by Grevillea and Hakea with just a few eucalypts and a scattering of other plants .
Liverworts are another group of plants with fungal associates .
Though liverworts are plants they lack both roots and the internal nutrient conducting systems found in the ferns and flowering plants .
Liverworts have anchoring filaments , called rhizoids , which are superficially root - like in appearance but , unlike roots , do not draw water or minerals from the soil .
Instead , water and minerals are absorbed through the liverwort surfaces .
So , strictly speaking , liverworts cannot form mycorrhizas , since these have been defined as requiring roots .
However , a number of liverworts form fungal associations that physically resemble mycorrhizas , with fungal hyphae found in the liverwort rhizoids .
The functions of some of these liverwort - fungus associations still need to be determined .
In the northern hemisphere heath plants ( in the family Ericaceae ) and some groups of liverworts can form associations with the same group of fungi .
Fungi that are either the same as ( or very similar to ) the northern hemisphere ones have also been observed in ericoid mycorrhizas with Australian epacrids as well as in mycorrhiza - like associations with some Australian liverworts .
One suggestion is that the liverwort rhizoids serve as a source from which the fungi can colonize plant roots .
However , the nature of the association ( if any ) between liverworts , fungi and northern hemisphere heaths ( or Australian epacrids ) is unknown but is being investigated .
Almost all liverworts contain chlorophyll and so produce simple sugars through photosynthesis , just as the majority of other plants do .
The genus Cryptothallus , found in the northern hemisphere , is an exception and lacks chlorophyll .
As in the case of the achlorophyllous orchids mentioned above , Cryptothallus relies on its fungal partner for nutrients .
Which fungi form mycorrhizas ?
The fungi that form mycorrhizas are quite varied .
Ectomycorrhizal fungi produce many of the easily seen fruiting bodies that you commonly come across .
There are many mushroom - producing ectomycorrhizal fungi and examples of Amanita and Cortinarius were given earlier .
These are large mycorrhizal genera , with many species worldwide .
While there are many native Amanita species in Australia , there are also some introduced species .
For example , Amanita muscaria ( commonly called the Fly Agaric ) and Amanita phalloides ( known as the Deathcap [ see DEATHCAP SECTION ] ) have been introduced unintentionally .
Youll commonly see the first of these near pine or birch trees and the latter near oak trees .
However , in Tasmania Amanita muscaria has been found growing in native Nothofagus forests - with not a pine or birch tree anywhere to be seen .
Amanita muscaria has also been introduced to New Zealand , where it has been found in native forests with Kunzea and Leptospermum .
While some fungi may have preferences for particular plants , the Tasmanian and New Zealand reports show that at least some mycorrhizal fungi can take up new partners .
There has also been a report of Amanita phalloides associating with eucalypts in Canberra ( but this requires more investigation ) and there are records of that species in a eucalypt plantation in Tanzania and near eucalypts in Algeria .
Apart from Amanita and Cortinarius there are many more species of mushroom - producing ectomycorrhizal fungi in various genera - Hebeloma , Inocybe , Lactarius , Paxillus , and Russula to give a few examples of commonly seen genera .
As noted at the beginning of this mycorrhizal section , there are numerous non-mushroom , ectomycorrhizal fungi and youve already seen the example of Hydnum repandum , which was pictured right at the start .
The majority of truffle - like fungi are mycorrhizal and examples of these are the introduced species Melanogaster ambiguus ( which is found growing near introduced oak trees ) , this native species of Setchelliogaster and Peziza whitei , another endemic Australian species .
Some of the coral fungi , many boletes , such as the native Phlebopus marginatus and the introduced Suillus luteus ( which is found under non-native pine trees ) and a few powdery , superficially puffball - like fungi ( such as Pisolithus and Scleroderma ) are mycorrhizal .
The earthstar - like Astraeus hygrometricum ( introduced to Australia ) is known to be ectomycorrhizal with various northern hemisphere tree species .
Species of Morchella can grow quite well as saprotrophs , but some overseas studies suggest that the species of Morchella may sometimes form ectomycorrhizas .
The corticioid fungi commonly produce their flat , sheet - like fruiting bodies on the underside of dead wood , twigs and similar plant litter on the forest floor .
It would be excusable to suppose that these are all saprotrophic fungi , feeding on the dead plant matter on which the fruiting bodies are formed .
That is often the case but in the northern hemisphere there are about a hundred species of corticioid fungi that are mycorrhizal , many of them in the genus Tomentella .
A probable mycorrhizal Tomentella has been found in Australia recently , but the majority of Australian corticioid fungi are poorly studied .
The mycorrhizal nature of a few of those hundred corticioid species in the northern hemisphere has been known for a long time , but in most cases the mycorrhizal evidence was discovered in the late 1900s .
These corticioid genera contain confirmed ectomycorrhizal species : Amphinema , Byssocorticium , Byssoporia , Piloderma , Pseudotomentella , Tomentella , Tylospora .
Tylopsora fibrillosa is not known from Australia and the photo was taken in a Sphagnum bog in Estonia .
The whitish bloom growing over the Sphagnum plants is the Tylospora fruiting body and is lined with the spore - producing basidia .
These corticioid genera are suspected to contain ectomycorrhizal species : Athelia , Lindtneria , Tomentellopsis , Trechispora .
There are more photographs of fruiting bodies of ectomycorrhizal fungi here [ http://mycorrhizas.info/ecmf.html].
Many of the VA mycorrhizal fungi do not produce fruiting bodies , the spores often being produced on hyphae in the soil near plant roots .
Where fruiting bodies are formed they are usually more - or - less spherical in shape and truffle - like , in that they are hidden in the soil or leaf litter .
Many fruiting bodies are small , only a millimetre or so in diameter , though some can get to a couple of centimetres or more in diameter .
The fungi are neither ascomycetes nor basidiomycetes and are outside the scope of this website .
Identification of the fungi present in ericoid mycorrhizas is mostly based on the physical , chemical or DNA analyses of the hyphae found in roots , since fruiting bodies are rarely found .
Understandably , there is still very much to be learnt about the fungi involved .
The best known ericoid mycorrhizal fungus , Hymenoscyphus ericae , is an ascomycete that produces small disc - like fruiting bodies up to 1 mm in diameter .
However , it appears the fruiting bodies have never been seen in the wild and have been produced in laboratory experiments , only with considerable difficulty .
While there is still much ignorance about the species of fungi involved , the various chemical , physical and DNA studies indicate that there is considerable similarity between the northern and southern hemisphere fungi that form ericoid mycorrhizas .
Orchids form mycorrhizas with various macro and micro fungi .
The association with the mushroom genus Armillaria was mentioned above , but a number of orchids are known to form associations with macrofungi in the genera Ceratobasidium , Sebacina , Thanatephorus , Thelephora , Tomentella and Tulasnella .
Many of these form inconspicuous fruiting bodies , sometimes being no more than powdery or cobwebby coatings on forest litter .
A thousand words
Since a picture is worth a thousand words , heres a simple diagram ( plus a few words ) which portrays some of the complexities described earlier .
So , what s going on ....
A phone rings in an office with no sign in a San Jose industrial park , and a caller places an order for delivery .
But it ’s not your ordinary delivery service — the caller wants pot , not pizza .
A driver for the Green Access collective then loads packages of marijuana bearing names of strains like Bubble Berry and Grapefruit and heads out , often to San Mateo County , to make a delivery in what is an increasingly common way for medical marijuana to change hands .
But whether it ’s legal or safe depends on whom you ask .
One thing many experts do agree on is that demand for delivery service is going to grow as people discover it .
After the Obama administration signaled that federal authorities would stop raiding medical marijuana dispensaries complying with California law , several dispensaries have tried to open in San Mateo County in the past year and failed .
So delivery services are stepping in to fill the void , experts said , setting up a clash with law enforcement .
That ’s because many cities in San Mateo County are trying to regulate medical marijuana dispensaries or keep them out altogether .
San Mateo County ’s lone dispensary faces closure after being denied a license .
And most Peninsula cities , including Redwood City and South San Francisco , have enacted temporary bans while they consider the issue .
Only San Mateo , San Carlos and the unincorporated areas of San Mateo County have ordinances that allow them .
While cities and dispensaries battle over whether they can operate on the Peninsula , the number of delivery services is quietly building .
About 14 services offer to bring medical marijuana to homes in the South Bay and the Peninsula .
At least two of them are based in San Mateo County , but many more are from other parts of the region , with one offering to deliver directly from a farm in Mendocino County .
It is no surprise that delivery is becoming a popular option on the Peninsula , said Kris Hermes , spokesman for medical marijuana advocacy group Americans for Safe Access .
Delivery services are particularly pervasive in areas where authorities have clamped down on dispensaries , he said .
There are other attractions to home delivery for medical marijuana buyers .
Experts said it is easy and private , and the price is about the same as in dispensaries .
“ It just seems logical that it will expand , ” said Martin Mayer , attorney for the California Police Chiefs Association .
“ It ’s convenient .
We ’re lazy people . ”
For Farsh Fallah , head of operations for Green Access , the decision to open a medical marijuana delivery service instead of a dispensary was a logical step .
City councils up and down the Peninsula denied him permission to open a club before he gave up and started his delivery operation in San Jose in December .
Fallah said he screens people who order marijuana from him and limits the amount of cash and marijuana that drivers carry to ensure safety .
So far nothing bad has happened ; he will soon begin accepting credit card payments to add another layer of security for drivers .
But to Cmdr. Marc Alcantara , who heads San Mateo County ’s narcotics task force , delivery services are dangerous for all involved : A driver can be sent to a phony drop - off where crooks wait with guns to rob him .
Medical marijuana prescription holders can be ripped off by an unscrupulous service or get less than what they paid for .
Though he said there have n’t been any reported cases of medical marijuana deliverers being held up on the Peninsula , plenty of grow operations have been robbed .
“ You can have a predator who robs the money and steals the product , ” Alcantara said .
But personal safety is one of the benefits of deliveries for a 37 - year - old San Mateo resident , who asked that her name be withheld to protect her privacy .
She said she did n’t feel quite safe walking out of medical marijuana dispensaries in San Francisco or Oakland with a bag of cannabis .
While she has never heard of anyone getting mugged , that possibility of “ let ’s jump them and take their stuff ” was always in the back of her mind .
Also , by ordering and having it delivered to her home , she avoids the possibility of running into somebody on the street , like a boss or co-worker , who would question what she was doing .
“ I feel safer , ” said the woman , who began using medical marijuana after developing lupus and later multiple sclerosis .
“ It ’s more private . ”
Whether delivery services are legal is another question .
As far as police , city officials and prosecutors from Santa Clara and San Mateo counties are concerned , delivering marijuana , even if it is medical , is illegal in most cases .
The Santa Clara County District Attorney ’s Office says there is just one exception .
If a caregiver is responsible for a medical marijuana user too sick to pick up cannabis , the caregiver can transport the marijuana .
All other instances would be governed by state drug laws , which make it a crime to transport marijuana .
No one in either county has been arrested while delivering medical marijuana or prosecuted for it , officials said .
“ We ’re not out there to get individuals or collectives operating in the spirit of the law .
We ’ve got bigger fish to fry , ” said Alcantara , who added that though it is not now a priority to bust delivery services , enforcement could start at any time .
San Mateo County prohibits delivery , with a few exceptions .
For example , a medical marijuana dispensary that has been licensed by the county can deliver in unincorporated areas .
But none have gotten the county ’s stamp of approval since the ordinance was passed last spring .
In fact , the San Mateo County Sheriff ’s Office sent a letter to Green Access in February warning that “ the distribution of marijuana is illegal , subject only to the narrow state law exception for collective cultivation of marijuana . ”
Fallah ’s attorney , Scot Candell , sent a letter in response , and no action has been taken since .
Candell said cities can prohibit dispensaries from setting up in their jurisdiction using zoning rules , but they ca n’t stop a delivery service from driving into their towns .
“ They do n’t have the authority to say what is traveled on their streets and brought to somebody , ” he added .
Hermes said a delivery service is essentially a mobile medical marijuana collective , and collectives are allowed under California law .
He added that people who are too sick to drive to a dispensary have no other way of getting their marijuana .
But the legal debate over medical marijuana and delivery services might be rendered moot come November , said Mayer .
Voters will decide whether they want to make marijuana legal for personal use .
“ It passes , and we do n’t have these discussions anymore , ” he added .
Ralph Nader not ruling out 2012 presidential bid
It 's not like Republicans need more good news right now , but here it is .
Ralph Nader , who has mounted five campaigns for president -- four of them as a third - party spoiler -- declined to rule out a 2012 bid during an interview with former New York City public advocate Mark Green .
In the interview , flagged by Celese Katz of the New York Daily News , Green asked Nader , point blank , whether he 'd run in 2012 .
" I want the progressive agenda to be on the ballot , " Nader said .
" I 'd rather have someone else do it , like Jim Hightower or Mark Green .
I 've really lost faith that the Republicans ( sic ) will even support progressives in their own party . "
That 's not a " no . "
Green declined his interest in a third party bid as soon as Nader finished speaking , and Hightower is n't the kind of name you drop if you 're actually looking at a political successor .
Nader , who will turn 78 in 2012 , began the Obama era by asking whether the first black president would become an " uncle tom for the corporations , " and followed that up with a utopian novel ( of disputable literary merit ) about billionaires saving the world from conservatives .
He is , in other words , a flawed vessel for whatever progressive anger against Democrats exists in 2012 .
But he 's not ruling out a run .
And at least one current tea party leader has experience in helping him get onto the ballot .

June 17 , 2010 : Bill Simmons ' NBA Finals chat
Time is an illusion caused by the passage of history ( Douglas Adams 1952 - 2001 ) .
The way that we deal with time is central to a major current schism in physics .
Under classic Newtonian physics and also quantum mechanics – time is absolute , a universal metronome allowing you determine whether events occur simultaneously or in sequence .
Under Einstein ’s physics , time is not absolute – simultaneity and sequence depend on who ’s looking .
For Einstein , the speed of light ( in a vacuum ) is constant and time changes in whatever way is required to keep the speed of light constant from all frames of reference .
Under general relativity ( GR ) you are able to experience living for three score and ten years regardless of where you are or how fast you ’re moving , but other folk might measure that duration quite differently .
But even under GR , we need to consider whether time only has meaning for sub - light speed consciousnesses such as us .
Were a photon to have consciousness , it may not experience time – and , from its perspective , would cross the apparent 100,000 light year diameter of the Milky Way in an instant .
Of course , that gets you wondering whether space is real either .
Hmm …
Quantum mechanics does ( well , sometimes ) require absolute time – most obviously in regards to quantum entanglement where determining the spin of one particle , determines the spin of its entangled partner instantaneously and simultaneously .
Leaving aside the baffling conundrums imposed by this instantaneous action over a distance – the simultaneous nature of the event implies the existence of absolute time .
In one attempt to reconcile GR and quantum mechanics , time disappears altogether – from the Wheeler - DeWitt equation for quantum gravity – not that many regard this as a 100 % successful attempt to reconcile GR and quantum mechanics .
Nonetheless , this line of thinking highlights the ‘ problem of time ’ when trying to develop a Theory of Everything .
The winning entries for a 2008 essay competition on the nature of time run by the Fundamental Questions Institute could be roughly grouped into the themes ‘ time is real ’ , ‘ no , it is n’t ’ and ‘ either way , it ’s useful so you can cook dinner . ’
The ‘ time is n’t real ’ camp runs the line that time is just a by - product of what the universe does ( anything from the Earth rotating to the transition of a Cesium atom – i.e. the things that we calibrate our clocks to ) .
Time is the fire in which we burn ( Soran , Star Trek bad guy , circa 24th century ) .
‘ Time is n’t real ’ proponents also refer to Boltzmann ’s attempt to trivialise the arrow of time by proposing that we just live in a local pocket of the universe where there has been a random downward fluctuation of entropy – so that the perceived forward arrow of time is just a result of the universe returning to equilibrium – being a state of higher entropy where it ’s very cold and most of the transient matter that we live our lives upon has evaporated .
It is conceivable that another different type of fluctuation somewhere else might just as easily result in the arrow pointing the other way .
Nearly everyone agrees that time probably does n’t exist outside our Big Bang universe and the people who just want to get on and cook dinner suggest we might concede that space - time could be an emergent property of quantum mechanics .
With that settled , we just need to rejig the math – over coffee maybe .
I was prompted to write this after reading a Scientific American June 2010 article , Time Is An Illusion by Craig Callender .

The top judicial and law enforcement bodies in China have issued new guidelines that seek to halt the use of torture in obtaining confessions or witness testimony , especially in death penalty cases .
The rules , announced Sunday , would nullify evidence gathered through violence or intimidation and give defendants the ability to challenge confessions presented during their trials .
The new regulations were issued weeks after the authorities conceded that the confession used to erroneously convict a farmer for a murder was based on torture .
The case came to light only after the supposed victim turned up alive and the defendant had spent 10 years in prison .
It has provoked national outrage .
“ Judicial practice in recent years shows that slack and improper methods have been used to gather , examine and exclude evidence in various cases , especially those involving the death penalty , ” said a statement released by the central government .

Sen . John Barrasso , R - Wyo. , charged the Obama administration with keeping oil and gas drilling experts off its seven - member commission in favor of people who philosophically oppose offshore exploration .
And Sen. Robert Bennett , R - Utah , said there was a huge conflict of interest in putting environmental advocates on a panel responsible for investigating the spill and recommending new safety mandates for offshore drilling .
Obama launched the commission last month and tasked it with conducting a six - month probe of the Deepwater Horizon disaster and a rigorous review of drilling safety .
Its findings could dictate the future of offshore drilling and lead to major changes in the way the government polices oil and gas production along the nation 's coasts .
Scientists , engineers
The roster of members includes science and engineering experts , as well as a renewable energy advocate who has complained about America 's oil addiction and a marine science professor who recently appeared to endorse a delay of planned drilling along the East Coast .
There are no representatives with deep ties to the oil and gas industry , although one of the co-chairmen , William Reilly , was administrator of the EPA under President George H.W. Bush and a director of ConocoPhillips before temporarily stepping down to serve on the commission .
The other co-chairman is Bob Graham , a Democratic former Florida governor and U.S. senator who has opposed offshore drilling near the Sunshine State .
The panel 's just - appointed executive director , Richard Lazarus , is a legal expert at Georgetown University who has represented environmental groups in arguments before the Supreme Court .
The commission 's makeup already has drawn criticism from oil and gas industry boosters and in some newspaper editorials .
In a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing Thursday , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar defended the commission 's members , saying they were " very distinguished people ... who will transcend partisan politics and ideology " in investigating what caused the Deepwater Horizon rig to explode April 20 .
Barrasso and Bennett targeted Frances Beinecke , president of the Natural Resources Defense Council , one of several environmental groups that unsuccessfully defended the Obama administration 's deep - water drilling ban against a legal challenge in a court hearing Monday .
Bennett called Beinecke 's appointment troubling because she " has an ideological position with respect to drilling and , indeed , heads an organization that 's filed a lawsuit on this area . "
In a blog entry on NRDC 's website Thursday , the group 's New York City - based litigation director , Mitch Bernard , defended Beinecke as an independent and said she had been excluded from all decision making and communications about the council 's legal work since her appointment .
Barrasso said the panel 's makeup defied Obama 's assertion that he wants an independent review of the oil spill .
" The commission 's background and expertise does n't really include an oil or drilling expert , so … people across the country are wondering about the administration 's goals , " Barrasso said .
" Is it really about making offshore energy exploration safer ?
Or is it about shutting down our offshore and American oil and gas ? "
Promises fairness
Salazar dismissed the senators ' criticism .
" What is wrong is the playing of politics with this issue , " Salazar said .
" This is an issue of a national crisis . "
Salazar likened the group to the commissions that have investigated other disasters , including the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle and the partial meltdown of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant .
The panel members are elder statesmen and stateswomen , Salazar said , adding that he was confident the commission would be thorough and even - handed .
When studying areas where it does n't have expertise , he said , the panel will interview professionals who do .

MILWAUKEE — Rhonda Dannenberg , a suburban mother of three , stuck her nose in six glasses of beer at the MillerCoors brewery here and swished a bit of each in her mouth .
Then she delivered the kind of frank verdict that 's shaking up the mens - club world of beer tasting .
" I got a strong bruised fruit , " Ms. Dannenberg , 36 years old , said of one of the Miller Lite batches , drawing a few nods from the three other women and two men at the table .
" Slight cardboard taste .
Oxidized .
Unacceptable . "
At many companies , the assembled panelists would have been men , typically brew masters and other technical types .
And it makes sense .
To judge from TV commercials , men like beer better than women do and sometimes even seem to like beer more than they like women .
But the British company SABMiller PLC decided several years ago to reach deeper into its employee pool to find adept tasters , inviting marketers , secretaries and others to try their hand .
The company concluded that women were drinking men under the table .
" We have found that females often are more sensitive about the levels of flavor in beer , " says Barry Axcell , SABMiller 's chief brewer .
Women trained as tasters outshine their male counterparts , he says .
Republicans , who have long denounced government spending and employed the rallying cry of " too much government intervention " to stir up public anger against the federal government , are changing their tune in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster .
Republican lawmakers from Gulf states have started pushing for more federal resources and dollars to go to the recovery effort , and are denouncing the federal government for not getting involved sooner .
Senator Richard Shelby ( R - Alabama ) asked the federal government to step up its work deploying booms to protect the coast from advancing oil .
Senator Jeff Sessions ( R - Alabama ) said " the federal government does have a role " in responding to the crisis and inferred that federal regulators should have been more vigilant in overseeing drilling and preparing for such a disaster .
Representative Mike Pence ( R - Indiana ) said the government should have deployed its resources sooner , instead of letting BP , a private company , be " in charge of the response for the first 12 days . "
The calls contradict conservatives ' cries for limited government in the wake the 2008 financial meltdown .

Our friends over at “ This Week in Lady News , ” who pore over the right - wing blogs so you do n’t have to , stumbled upon a company in South Florida that has a novel idea for protecting brown people in Arizona :
White yourself out with a downloadable mask !
A Gringo Mask® !
“ The objective of this effort is to protect , support , and dignify our Hispanic community , with the firm idea of getting out and standing up to the SB1070 law , ” say the creators of www.gringomask.com ( the website is also available en espanol ) .
They ’re offering “ his ” and “ hers ” versions of the cutout masks that will theoretically enable the wearers to blend in with their white co-nationalists .
As TWILN writes :
The group ’s gringo mask is a lovely surrealist reminder that , in their words , “ all Americans do not have blue - eyes and blonde hair … [ and ]
Hispanics are not all the same either .
Therefore nobody should be judged based on their appearance . ”
Amen !
There is one catch , though :
You ’ll need to provide your own rubber band to fasten the mask .
Hopefully the Office Depot clerk wo n’t ask for ID when you ’re buying them .

The University of Cincinnati is now not only willing to work with transgender and genderqueer students when it comes to housing , it is now explicitly stated on the UC Housing and Food Services ’ FAQ page of its
Web site :
Is there a transgender / genderqueer policy in the residence halls ?
Traditionally students are placed with a roommate based on natal sex .
Students with concerns about their placement should contact Housing and Food Services at ( 513 ) 556-6461 or UCHousing@uc.edu prior to receiving a housing assignment .
While the policy is very vague , GenderBloc — a radical queer student group focusing on transgender and genderqueer activism at UC — recommends new students preference Daniels Hall floors 11 and 12 when filling out the housing application .
These floors provide the best accommodations for transgender and genderqueer people as they have single rooms , single - stall bathrooms and shower rooms with fewer stalls .
Woman has her foot treated using maggot therapy with amazing results .
Maggots have been known for centuries to help heal wounds .
Military surgeons noted that soldiers whose wounds became infested with maggots had better outcomes than those not infested .
William Baer , while at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland , may have been the first in the Northern Hemisphere to have intentionally applied larvae to wounds in order to induce wound healing .
During the late 1920's , he identified specific species , raised them in the laboratory , and used their larvae to treat several children with osteomyelitis and soft tissue infections .
He presented his findings at a surgical conference in 1929 .
Two years later , after treating 98 children , his findings were published posthumously .
MDT was successfully and routinely performed by thousands of physicians throughout the 1930 ’s , but soon it was supplanted by the new antibiotics and surgical techniques that came out of World War II .
Maggot therapy was occasionally used during the 1970's and 1980's , but only when antibiotics , surgery , and modern wound care failed to control the advancing wound .
The first modern clinical studies of maggot therapy were initiated in 1989 , at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Long Beach , CA , and at the University of California , Irvine , to answer the following questions : 1 . " Is maggot therapy still useful today ?
" 2 . " Should maggot therapy be used as an adjunct to other treatments , not merely as a last resort ?
" 3 . " How does maggot therapy compare to other treatments at our disposal ?
" The results of those controlled comparative clinical trials and the many studies and reports that followed , indicate that MDT is still useful today as a safe and effective treatment tool for some types of wounds .
Those studies also demonstrated that there is no reason to withhold MDT until all other modalities have been exhausted , nor use it only as a “ last resort . ”
Indeed , while published accounts of “ pre-amputation MDT ” show a limb salvage rate of over 40 % , the success of MDT when used earlier in the course of treatment ( say , as a 2nd or 3rd or 4th line treatment ) is even more dramatic .
Current status of maggot therapyIn 1995 , a handful of doctors in 4 countries were using MDT .
Today , any physician in the U.S. can prescribe maggot therapy .
Over 4,000 therapists are using maggot therapy in 20 countries .
Approximately 50,000 treatments were applied to wounds in the year 2006 .
In January 2004 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) began regulating medicinal maggots , and allowed the production and marketing of one particular strain of Phaenicia sericata larvae marketed under the brand name Medical Maggots ( TM ) .
In February , 2004 , the British National Health Service ( NHS ) permitted its doctors to prescribe maggot therapy .
Patients no longer have to be referred to one of a few regional wound - specialty hospitals to get maggot treatments .
The BioTherapeutics , Education & Research Foundation was established in 2003 for the purpose of supporting patient care , education , and research in maggot therapy and the other forms of symbiotic medicine ( diagnosing and / or treating diseases with live animals , such as maggot therapy , leech therapy , honey bee therapy , pet therapy & sniffer dogs , ichthiotherapy , bacteriotherapy etc ) .

Israel 's navy has shot and killed four Palestinians wearing diving gear off the Gaza coast , officials say .
The Israeli military said it believed those on board the boat were planning a terrorist attack .
Hamas officials in Gaza say four bodies have been recovered and two people are missing .
It comes a week after nine pro-Palestinian activists died in an Israeli raid on an aid flotilla trying to break Israel 's blockade of Gaza .
Israel withdrew its forces from Gaza in 2005 , but still controls the sea off the territory 's coast .
The Israeli military said the boat was carrying " a squad of terrorists wearing diving suits on their way to execute a terror attack " .
A spokesman said a naval force had hit its target , but did not give any more details of the operation .
The country 's Haaretz newspaper quoted an Israeli army source as saying the incident took place at about 0430 local time ( 0130 GMT ) , and that the boat had been heading north to Israel from waters off the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza .
The al - Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigades , a militant group linked to Fatah , has reported that four of its men were killed and a fifth is missing , according to Israeli media .
The men had been training off the Gaza coast , the militant group was quoted as having claimed .
The Israeli Defence Forces ( IDF ) said there were no Israeli casualties .
ANALYSIS
This appears to have been a fairly major operation by the Israeli Navy .
Witnesses in Gaza say helicopters were used .
It is not uncommon to hear machine - gun fire out at sea early in the morning off the Gaza coast .
Israel often fires warning shots at Palestinian fishing vessels that it says have strayed too far out .
Israel continues to occupy and control Gaza 's territorial waters - if there were militants planning an operation off the coast this would be unusual but not unheard of .
In February , militants floated explosive devices off the coast of Gaza that washed up on Israeli beaches to the the north of the territory .
They were detonated by Israeli security forces and nobody was hurt .
All this adds to the tension along the Gaza coastline .
There has been sporadic rocket fire out of Gaza into Israel since last week 's naval attack on the Gaza aid flotilla .
Israeli Foreign Ministry official Yigal Palmour said the latest incident reinforced the need for Israel to maintain a tight cordon around Gaza .
" This is the explanation why the border , both land and sea border with Gaza need to be strictly and tightly controlled .
We can't allow Hamas to carry out attacks at will on Israelis , on Israeli territory , " he told Reuters TV .
The latest Israeli operation comes as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas visits Turkey for a regional security summit along with Iran and Syria .
Mr Abbas , who heads the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank , is expected to pay his respects to the nine activists killed last week , eight of whom were Turks and one a US national of Turkish origin .
Mr Abbas 's government is the bitter rival of Hamas , which took control of Gaza from his Fatah movement in 2007 .
The deaths have sparked global condemnation but defiance from Israel , which insists it has the right to defend itself .
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Israel of " state terrorism " , and is calling Gaza a " historic cause for Turkey " .
Another aid ship , the Irish - owned Rachel Corrie , was intercepted by Israel on Saturday and officials have begun deporting its crew and activists .
' European role '
France and Britain have called for Israel to accept a " credible and transparent " investigation into the deadly Israeli raid on 31 May .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner suggested that the EU could play a bigger role to ensure that humanitarian supplies reached Gaza , and that weapons were kept out .
Image caption William Hague ( left ) will seek a consensus with other EU nations
Mr Kouchner also said Europe needed to work harder to convince Israel that its blockade of Gaza was not working , and nor was it in the long - term interests of the region .
His comments followed talks with British counterpart William Hague , who said Europe would maintain pressure on Israel .
But Israel 's US ambassador Michael Oren said his country would reject the proposals , and reiterated that an internal inquiry would be held .
Meanwhile , the Iranian Red Crescent has announced it will send two aid ships to Egypt for onward delivery to Gaza through the Rafah crossing later this week , Iranian state media report .
Also on Monday , US Vice - President Joe Biden met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Sharm el - Sheikh .
They had a 90 - minute meeting " about a full range of bilateral issues " , a spokesman for the US Embassy said , but there were no further details of the discussions released .
Americans generally like to hear good news .
They like to believe that a new president will right old wrongs , that clean energy will replace dirty oil and that fresh thinking will set the economy straight .
American pundits tend to restrain their pessimism and hope for the best .
But is anyone prepared for the worst ?
Meet Michael Ruppert , a different kind of American .
A former Lost Angeles police officer turned independent reporter , he predicted the current financial crisis in his self - published newsletter .
From the Wilderness , at a time when most Wall Street and Washington analysts were still in denial .
Director Chris Smith has shown an affinity for outsiders in films like American Movie and The Yes Men .
In Collapse , he departs stylistically from his past documentaries by interviewing Ruppert in a format that recalls the work of Errol Morris and Spalding Gray .
Sitting in a room that looks like a bunker , Ruppert recounts his career as a radical thinker and spells out the crises he sees ahead .
He draws upon the same news reports and data available to any Internet user , but he applies a unique interpretation .
He is especially passionate about the issue of " peak oil , " the concern raised by scientists since the seventies that the world will eventually run out of fossil fuel .
While other experts debate this issue in measured tones , Ruppert does n't hold back at sounding an alarm , portraying an apocalyptic future .
Listening to his rapid flow of opinions , the viewer is likely to question some of the rhetoric as paranoid or deluded , and to sway back and forth on what to make of the extremism .
Smith lets viewers form their own judgments .
It ’s Monday morning in Oakland , California , as I ’m writing this .
I ’m sipping a cup of coffee , looking at the rolling hills behind Berkeley from a coffee shop in Rockridge .
Clouds are rolling in from the Bay , it ’s absolutely stunning .
A few days ago Maren Kate of Escaping the 9 - 5 interviewed me about achieving online business success ( I ’ll let you know when the Interview goes live on Twitter , ) and it got me thinking : it ’s almost been a year since I had a ‘ job ’ in the assumed sense of the word .
In hindsight , it seems so silly that I had one to begin with .
There are just so many benefits to not having one these days .
Having a job might be good for some people , but it is n’t for everyone –contrary to what everyone will tell you .
The long hours , the designated tasks , having to run plans by colleagues or bosses before putting your plans into action seems like far too much to ask after a year of minimalist freedom .
We grow up with this idea that we ’re supposed to train for the “ workforce ” .
Most of our parents had jobs , all of our friends want to get jobs , all of the advertisements tell you to buy stuff in order to make you happier at your job .
Having a job is in many ways a lot easier than choosing not to have one .
When you have a job , you typically are told what to do .
Someone at one point or another wrote the call script for your life , and all you have to do is follow along until the clock hits 5 , and then it ’s happy hour .
We did n’t always have jobs .
Seth Godin likes to bring up this little fact in his Linchpin sessions : at the first factories they literally had men pushing carts of gin back and forth on the factory floor .
People were so unaccustomed to working for hours straight that their owners had to keep them drunk all day in order to keep them happy enough to continue to do a good day ’s work .
Gradually we ’ve trained a workforce that ’s a little more into the idea of working long hours , so the gin carts are now mostly unnecessary – though I ’ve known plenty of colleagues who kept bottles of whiskey in their desk drawers just to stay sane when they had to stay late .
Why minimalism can free you from being required to have a job .
The brilliant thing about minimalism , when applied in the strictest sense of the philosophy , is that it can free you from needing to have a job .
When you live with less than 100 things , you do n’t need disposable income to stay happy .
When you free up your schedule , you can pursue work that matters .
When you stop the weekend shopping sprees , you do n’t need a huge house to store all of that stuff you do n’t need .
This all leads to having a base life - overhead which is much smaller than everyone else .
When you have less overhead , you can have the freedom to begin working for yourself .
I wo n’t spend too much time on how minimalism can reduce your overhead .
If you ’re interested in pursuing a minimalist life , check out my e-book The Art of Being Minimalist , or my friend Daniel Richards ’ new e-book Doing With Less .
What I ’m interested in conveying to you is the benefits of not having a job .
Yes , not having a job is n’t for everyone .
Some people enjoy being told what to do , and other people have jobs they really love .
I would n’t want anyone to leave a situation that they really enjoyed simply because of an article I wrote .
The most important fact to consider is that not having a job is n’t easy .
Starting a minimalist business with no -overhead that runs itself can be challenging .
It might involve long hours in the beginning , and relies on individual creativity to succeed .
No one can hand you the magic bullet that will tell you how to create income that does n’t come from having a job .
Ultimately you need to trust yourself , and follow the path that feels right for you .
HHere are 27 reasons why you should never have a job
1. Financial security .
Creating your own business can be much more financially secure than having a job .
At a job , all of your income is in one basket , which is the farthest thing from financial security that I can think of .
Many people with jobs live in endless fear of losing them , because if they did the money just stops coming .
If you screw up , or say the wrong thing , poof !
There goes all of your income , your benefits , and sometimes your social life all at once .
2. Diversified income streams .
When you have your own business , you can concentrate on having diversified income streams .
A job pays you all at once , and if you lose it all of your money goes away .
With a minimalist business , you can develop variable income sources .
If one dries up , the others still thrive .
Some income will be small and occasional , other income will be large and regular .
The most important aspect is that it ’s all coming from different sources , and nothing can go wrong with them all at once , like when you have a job .
3. Contribute value to your legacy .
When you have a job , you ’re contributing value to the legacy of an organization that is bigger than you .
That usually means that the legacy is separate from your own .
Yes , you can create great work at a company , but chances are you wo n’t be bragging about the stunning TPS report design you did at company X to your grandchildren .
When you create your own business , you ’re contributing value to your own lasting legacy .
4. Live anywhere .
When you create your own business , especially on the Internet , you can live anywhere in the world .
For instance , last week I moved from Brooklyn , NY to Oakland , CA .
I never could have done that if I had to go into an office , because they would decide where I lived .
Some job markets are stronger than others .
In my experience , strong job markets usually coincide with expensive or crappy living conditions .
By freeing yourself from location , and not having a job , you can live anywhere in the world .
A great resource for learning to live anywhere is Karol Gajda ’s How to Live Anywhere , coming June 8th .
5. Unlimited vacation .
Face it , two weeks of vacation a year is a crime .
Whoever decided people should work 50 weeks out of the year was absolutely insane .
How this was adopted as an industry standard is beyond me .
When you create your own business , you can develop a more flexible vacation schedule .
25 weeks a year ?
Go for it !
6 . Choose your own path .
When you have a job , chances are you ’ll be told exactly what to do every day .
Handle this client , print that TSP report , sit at your desk for 8 - 10 hours a day !
When you create your own business , you can choose your own path .
Obviously , this also means that you can choose the wrong one .
But in my experience , even the wrong paths are much more interesting than sitting at a desk all day .
Yes , you ’ll make mistakes .
Yes , it is n’t easy .
But would n’t you rather have an exciting life than a dull one under fluorescent lights ?
7. Flexible schedule .
One of the best reasons not to have a job is having a flexible schedule .
At a job you have to be there Mon -Fri 9 - 5 , or something like that .
When you create your own job , you can work when you ’re most productive .
Some people work best in the middle of the night , others work best in the afternoons .
I ’ve found that I can usually create quality material in a few hours every week , freeing myself to do other things that matter to me , like practicing Yoga .
8. Avoid reactionary workflow .
There ’s an always - on mentality that is quickly coming to dominate our society .
We feel like we must be on our crackberries and iPhones every single hour of the day , just in case something happens .
The reality is that nothing important really happens , our minds only make it that way .
When you do n’t have a job , no one will force you to answer your email in the middle of the night .
This frees you up to focus on the work that matters , and creating powerful passive income streams .
9 . You do n’t have to conform to other people ’s expectations .
It ’s no secret that one of my favorite small business writers is Chris Guillebeau , who writes The Art of Non-conformity , and his small business guide The Unconventional Guide to Working For Yourself .
We often forget how weird it is to opt - out of the the idea of having a job , but it is pretty strange for a lot of people .
The best part of not having a job is that you do n’t have to conform to other people ’s expectations .
You can be weird if you want to be , and no one will fire you for it .
The funny thing is , weird is one of the best niches to set up your small business in — there ’s too much regular out there already .
10 .
Making money in your sleep .
Oh , have I mentioned when you start your own online business , there ’s a very real possibility that you ’ll make money in your sleep ?
Well , there is .
There ’s nothing like checking your email ( once a day ) and seeing that you made all the income you need to survive using automated means while you were taking a snooze .
It ’s definitely worth quitting your job to experience that freedom .
11 . Freedom to be a leader .
Jobs are built around conformity , that ’s why everyone is expected to wear ‘ work appropriate clothing ’ that they purchased at J. Crew .
What does conformity do ?
It makes it possible for upper management to keep the lower levels in line , on task , and compliant .
When you opt out of having a job , it frees you to be a leader .
A leader has to stand out , and have vision .
A leader has to show people the way by telling the truth as it is .
The truth is that business casual is n’t something you have to subject yourself .
12 . Choose work that excites you .
Most jobs are made up of mundane activities that someone higher up in the food chain asked you to do .
File that TPS , buddy , or you ’re going to be stuck in middle - management forever !
When you do n’t have a job , you can choose work that excites you .
Do you want to create a product that teaches people how to live a passionate life , like my friend Henri Juntilla ?
Go for it !
13 . Surround yourself with people you care about .
When you have a job , someone else chooses who you spend your time with during 60 % of your life .
In some of these cases , you ’re stuck with people who you do n’t particularly care for .
These might be company lifers , or dead - eyed soul - sucked individuals who opted out of living life years ago .
When you work for yourself , you can pick your own social circle .
As my friend Glen Allsopp likes to mention , you ’re going to be as successful as your social circle .
So pick people to hang around with who have a lot of money coming in –they also will be more inclined to buy you beers than boring company lifers .
14 . Sleep whenever you want .
Different people sleep different .
For instance , now that I ’m in California , I ’ve been waking up early in the morning ( by California standards ) , because I used to wake up at 10 am in New York .
When you have a job , someone else is determining when you wake up .
Maybe you ’re the kind of person who enjoys staying up until 4 am working on projects that matter to you ?
If you do n’t have a job , you totally can .
15 . The ultimate ROWE environment .
One of the newest fads in workplace civil rights is the idea of the Results Only Work Environment ( or ROWE ) .
My friend Jeffrey F. Tang wrote an article about ROWE here .
Well , not having a job is the ultimate ROWE , because the only thing that matters is your results .
When you have a job , unless you work at a hip progressive ROWE company , chances are you ’re only rewarded for sitting at a desk ( 6 hours Facebook , 2 hours actual work !
Yay !.)
Well , some people do n’t work well sitting at desks , believe it or not .
When you start your own business , only the results matter , no one cares if you get them while plopped in a desk .
16 . Work on projects which will change the world .
The most profitable projects , in my experience , are also ones that change the world .
When you work at a job , chances are no one really wants you to do any world changing .
They just want you to maintain the status - quo .
When you do n’t have a job , this frees you to work on projects that will change the world .
Maybe you want to teach people how to live without their cars , like my friend Tammy Strobel does in her e-bookSimply Car - free .
Or maybe you want to sew sustainable puppy blankets .
The change you make is up to you .
17 .
You only have to make yourself ( and maybe your significant other ) happy .
When you have a job , you have to make your boss happy , your colleagues happy , and if you do n’t well , then that single source of income we talked about earlier is on the line .
When you do n’t have a job , the only person you have to make happy is yourself –and possibly your significant other .
What I ’ve discovered , in my nearly a year of not having a job , is that it ’s much easier to make yourself happy when you ’re not trying to make everyone else happy at the same time .
18 . Prepare your own food .
This is key .
When I used to have a job , I ’d constantly get food out .
I ate at my desk , because I was afraid if I was away for more than 15 minutes all hell would break loose .
When you work for yourself , you can also work in your kitchen ( which I do often ! )
This means you can prepare healthy food , that tastes good .
You can also make your own coffee ( so much better than office coffee . )
Making your own hot food while you take a break from work is so much better than packing a lunch and heating it up in the microwave .
19 .
No waiting for retirement .
Just wait until you ’re 65 , then you can do whatever you want .
Seriously ?
I think you should do things while you ’re young , athletic , and the ladies ( or lads ) still like you to look at you .
Face it , waiting for retirement to get more than 2 weeks of vacation is a crime against your humanity .
When you work for yourself , you can retire whenever you want for however long you need — as long as you have the resources .
The truth is that we need time off to rejuvenate our ability to live .
I like to take weeks at a time when I do very little except Yoga , reading , and wandering aimlessly .
You ca n’t wander aimlessly on a Wednesday morning when you have a job .
The funny thing is , the best ideas come when you ’re not working for them .
Bonus : take a year off every seven years like Stefan Sagmeister does .
20 . Time to focus on the important .
When I had a job , I never had enough time to do what was important to me .
On the forefront of my mind was always the task at hand at my job , whether or not I actually cared .
When you do n’t have a job , you can focus on what is important to you .
This is different for everyone , as everyone is different .
21 . Cool people do n’t have jobs anymore .
Face it , it ’s so cool to tell people that you ’re self - employed .
However , it ’s not cool to brag about the fact that you have the best hours , a flexible work schedule , and that you get to work on things that matter in front of people who have jobs .
Do n’t rub it in , the best self - employed rockstars show , they do n’t tell .
22 . Work from wherever you want .
Today I edited this post from the awesome kitchen in my brand - new apartment in Oakland ’s hopping Temescal ‘ hood , I wrote most of the post while I was grabbing a coffee over in Rockridge .
One of the biggest benefits of working for yourself is that it does n’t matter where you work .
You could be on a beach somewhere , you could be at a coffee shop , you could backpack through India .
Location does n’t matter when you ’re living the digital lifestyle .
23 . Working for yourself is the best way to approach work in a recession .
Look around you , no important businesses are hiring anymore .
Big businesses are hunkered down and waiting for us to come out of this recession .
You can either wait until the recession is over to find the job you truly desire , or you can settle for less than the best .
The Subway sandwich shop near me is hiring “ Sandwich Artists ” , but that does n’t mean you should apply there .
24 . Showers in the middle of the day .
This probably goes without saying , but it ’s pretty sweet to be able to take a hot shower in the middle of a Monday afternoon .
That would n’t be possible at a job .
25 . Multiple paydays .
When you have a job , all of your income comes from one place , and you know when it comes .
This means if the section of the economy where your job is located collapses , your only paycheck is on the line ( as mentioned above . )
But it also means that you know exactly when you ’re being paid .
When you do n’t have a job , your pay can come from all different directions , and at different times .
This replaces the monotony of knowing with the fun uncertainty and improvisation that comes with multiple paydays .
26 .
You do n’t have to sit at a desk under fluorescent lights all day .
Sitting at a desk all day has been proven to be incredibly bad for your health .
Some people are incredibly product at desks , but many of us are n’t .
I think of most of my ideas when I ’m walking .
Maybe you think of your ideas while standing on your head .
Sitting at a desk all day is just something we do because someone told us to , not because it ’s a useful practice .
27 . Uncertainty keeps you on your toes .
Jobs seem so certain .
You ’re protected from the harsh realities of the world in a lot of situations .
This can be a good thing , but it also keeps you in the dark .
I ’m convinced that we grow with uncertainty .
It makes us thrive , because we ’re constantly adapting and changing our strategies .
This means that you ’ll never stop learning when you ’re working for yourself , as your free to try new things and take new paths .
The reality of the situation is working for yourself is one of the best ways to improvise and ultimately survive in this boom - and - bust economy .
Does that mean that you wo n’t have to work hard ?
certainly not .
There are no magic ‘ get rich in your sleep ’ solutions , there is only the hard work that you need to do to set yourself up to leave your job and set out on your own .
I do n’t have all of the answers , but I do know that working for yourself is so much better than having a job .
Is it for everyone ?
certainly not .
But if you want to pursue a freer reality , this may be the answer you ’re looking for .

Image caption Eating a lot of meat may promote good conditions for pregnancy
Girls who eat a lot of meat during childhood tend to start their periods earlier than others , a study suggests .
UK researchers compared the diets of more than 3,000 12 - year - old girls .
They found high meat consumption at age three ( over eight portions a week ) and age seven ( 12 portions ) was strongly linked with early periods .
Writing in Public Health Nutrition , the researchers said a meat - rich diet might prepare the body for pregnancy , triggering an earlier puberty .
During the 20th Century , the average age at which girls started their periods fell fairly dramatically , although it now seems to be levelling off .
Meat is a good source of zinc and iron , requirements for which are high during pregnancy Dr Imogen Rogers , Study leader
This is widely thought to be due to better nutrition and rising levels of obesity , which has an impact on hormones .
In the latest study , the team used data from a group of children followed from birth .
At the age of 12 years eight months , they split the girls into those who had already started their periods and those who had not .
Comparing their diets at the ages of three , seven and 10 , they found that meat intake at a young age was strongly linked with earlier periods .
In fact , at age seven there was a 75 % increased chance of having a period by age 12 in those eating the most meat compared with those who ate the least .
Although this finding was independent of body weight , the study repeated previous research showing that bigger girls tend to menstruate early .
' Plausible link '
Starting periods at an early age has been linked with an increased risk of breast cancer , possibly because women are exposed to higher levels of oestrogen over their lifetime .
But the researchers stressed there was no need for young girls to cut meat out of their diet as those with the highest meat consumption were eating a lot .
The seven - year - olds in the highest meat category were eating 12 or more portions a week , and the three - year - olds were having more than eight portions .
Image caption Eating a lot of meat may promote good conditions for pregnancy
Study leader Dr Imogen Rogers , senior lecturer in human nutrition at the University of Brighton , said weight could not be the only factor in girls having periods earlier as the average age had not gone down further with increasing levels of obesity .
She added : " Meat is a good source of zinc and iron , requirements for which are high during pregnancy .
" A meat - rich diet could be seen as indicating suitable nutritional conditions for a successful pregnancy . "
Dr Ken Ong , paediatric endocrinologist at the Medical Research Council , said there had been " vast shifts " in the timing of first periods over the past century .
He added that the link with meat consumption was a " plausible " one .
" This was not related to larger body size , but rather could be due to a more direct effect of dietary protein on the body 's hormone levels . "

All cobras are venomous , but the aptly named spitting cobra goes one step further to spray blinding venom from its fangs at would - be predators .
Remarkably , these serpents can hit a victim 's eyes from more than 5 feet ( 1.5 m ) away even as they are moving with roughly 90 - percent accuracy .
It turns out these snakes achieve their extraordinary aim by predicting where their targets are going to be in roughly half the time it takes to blink an eye .
To analyze how these reptiles were such dead shots , functional morphologist Bruce Young at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell stood behind a sheet of plastic and recorded the venom sprays of spitting cobras in South Africa as they aimed for his eyes .
Curiously , the snakes wiggled their heads right before letting fly .
A colleague of Young , herpetologist Guido Westhoff at the University of Bonn in Germany , had also seen this head shake in the cobras , so the researchers and their colleagues worked together to figure out what it might accomplish .
To provoke the serpents to spit , " I just put on the goggles and the cobras start spitting all over , " Young said .
He also donned a visor fitted with accelerometers to track his head movements .
At the same time , the other researchers filmed the cobra 's movements at 500 frames per second , or roughly 20 times faster than the average camera speed .
For six weeks ,
Young taunted the snakes by weaving his head about in front of them , triggering more than 100 spits .
When they analyzed Young 's movements , they found that 200 milliseconds before the cobras spat , Young suddenly jerked his head , the movement that must have set the serpents off .
In that fifth - of - a - second time after the head jerk — roughly half the time it takes to blink an eye — the snake predicts where the victim is going to be , the researchers figure .
During that split - second , the snake also wiggled its head the same way the target 's eyes moved in order to accurately guide the venom stream .
The snake also moves its head slightly while spraying the venom to spread it out over space for a better chance to hit the eye .
" All they need is one tiny fraction of the venom to hit the cornea , one little droplet , " Young said .
" I 've seen what happens even when dilute venom hits the cornea .
It 's basically instantly incapacitating . "
This ability to intercept a moving target with such accuracy suggests a level of braininess not attributed to snakes or other reptiles previously , the researchers noted .
" There 's probably a lot more complexity among snakes when it comes to neural processing and sensory systems than we generally recognized , " Young told LiveScience .
" For instance , while cobras seem dominated by their sense of vision , we can see if rattlesnakes , which tend to live in a world dominated by smell and sometimes heat , have any equivalent behavior . "
The scientists detailed their findings May 14 in the Journal of Experimental Biology .
A just - released report by the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California - Berkeley finds that the ridership projections prepared by Cambridge Systematics ( CS ) for the California high speed rail system are " not reliable . "
Authors Samer Madanat ( director of ITS - Berkeley and a professor of civil and environmental engineering ) , Mark Hanson ( UC - Berkeley professor of civil and environmental engineering ) and David Brownstown ( chair of the Economics Department at UC - Irvine ) essentially reported that the projections had such large error margins that the system could either lose a lot of money or make a lot of money :
... the combination of problems in the development phase and subsequent changes made to model parameters in the validation phase implies that the forecasts of high speed rail demand - and hence of the profitability of the proposed high speed rail system - have very large error bounds .
These bounds , which were not quantified by CS , may be large enough to include the possibility that the California HSR may achieve healthy profits and the possibility that it may incur significant revenue shortfalls .
Biased High Speed Rail Projections : Given the overwhelming history of upwardly biased ridership and revenue projections in major transport projects , it seems far more likely that reducing the margins of error would produce projections with much smaller ridership numbers and major financial losses .
Major research by Oxford University professor Bent Flyvbjerg , Nils Bruzelius ( a Swedish transport consultant ) and Werner Rottenberg ( University of Karlsruhe and former president of the World Conference on Transport Research ) covering 80 years of infrastructure projects found routine over -estimation of ridership and revenue ( Megaprojects and Risk : An Anatomy of Ambition ) .
The evidence is so condemning that Dr. Flyvbjerg has referred to the planning processes for such projects as consisting of " strategic misrepresentation " and " lying " ( his words ) to advance projects that might not otherwise be implemented .
Broad Concern about the Reliability of California High Speed Rail Projections :
The University of California report joins other reports that have questioning the veracity of the Cambridge Systematics projections .
During the run-up to the 2008 statewide bond issue , the California Senate Transportation and Housing Committee , chaired by Senator Alan Lowenthal ( D - Long Beach ) indicated concerns .
Illustrating continuing concerns , the committee commissioned the University of California study .
Doubts have been expressed by the California Legislative Analyst and the California State Auditor .
The Reason Foundation Due Diligence Report , authored by Joseph Vranich and me in 2008 estimated the ridership projections to be at least 100 % high ( see High Speed Rail : Untimely Extravagance presented at the Heritage Foundation last week in Washington ) .
Investment Grade Projections Far Lower :
The Cambridge Systematics ridership projections publicized that were used in the statewide bond election were more than 150 % above the " investment grade " projections that had been produced by Charles Rivers Associates for the California High Speed Rail Authority a decade ago .
Even " investment grade " projections can be high , as the recent bond default and bankruptcy of the Las Vegas Monorail indicates .
In that case the " investment grade " ridership projections were 150 % above the actual achieved average , nonetheless bond holders lost their investments .
( Our 2000 report accurately projected the Monorail ridership ) .
Undermining GHG Emissions Reduction Claims : Meanwhile , the California high speed rail proposal has come under criticism with respect to its environmental claims .
The high speed rail line has been promoted as a means for reducing greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions in the state .
Yet another recently released University of California report indicates that it could take as long as 71 years to save enough GHG emissions by attracting airline passengers and drivers to cancel out the emissions produced in constructing the project .
More defensible ridership projections could lengthen this period considerably .
Response to Criticism :
The body of the University of California high speed rail study is 10 pages , followed by approximately 40 pages of comments and response by Cambridge Systematics and a letter from the California High Speed Rail Authority requesting that the University of California authors to consider the comments .
This review is performed by the University of California authors , as they reject virtually all Cambridge Systematics criticisms in the final four pages of the report .

Since 2009 when Sarah Palin boycotted all , non conservative political media , her behavior has been picked up on by Republican Tea Party candidates like Sharron Angle and Rand Paul with the result being that voters are now expected to make a decision on these candidates without much information , which can only lead to disastrous consequences for our democracy .
After proving that she was not ready for primetime during the 2008 presidential campaign , Sarah Palin did what any paranoid egomaniac that is unable to see her own shortcomings or take responsibility for her own mistakes would do , she blamed the media .
Remember that in her book , Going Rogue , Palin accused Couric of , “ badgering ” her and having a , “ partisan agenda . ”
This is the genesis of Palin ’s blame the media mindset .
Other Republicans saw that Palin was rewarded for her blame the media self victimization shtick , by the right wing crowd , and it was no time until other gaffe machine candidates like Rand Paul and Sharron Angle followed Palin ’s lead in 2010 .
Advertisements
An often overlooked element of Palin ’s media boycott strategy is the effect that it has on the flow of information .
Palin ’s paranoia has resulted in her only appearing on friendly media outlets , or ones that pay her , like Fox News .
David Weigel summed up how Palin controls the flow of information last year , “ The problem is that Palin has put the political press in a submissive position , one in which the only information it prints about her comes from prepared statements or from Q&As with friendly interviewers .
This is n’t something most politicians get away with , or would be allowed to get away with .
But Palin has leveraged her celebrity — her ability to get ratings , the ardor of her fans and the bitterness of her critics — to win a truly unique relationship with the press .
She is allowed to shape the public debate without actually engaging in it . ”
This strategy is a problem for our democracy .
When political candidates refuse to talk to the media , they are also refusing to talk to the people .
There is a line between a campaign or a political leader ’s desire to control the message , and the suppression of information .
Republican candidates , like Rand Paul and Sharron Angle , who refuse to talk to the media are hiding from voters .
How can voters make an informed decision when candidates refuse to be questioned ?
The answer is that they can’t .
Candidates who do n’t answer questions from the media , if elected will turn into officeholders who deem themselves above being held accountable by the media or their own constituents .
Information is the lifeblood of democracy , and when candidates can pick and choose what questions they will answer it changes our democracy for the worse .
Palin , Paul , and Angle all love to talk about freedom , but the ultimate hypocrisy is that they do n’t believe that the press is free to ask them questions .
A true leader does not hide from unfriendly questions .
President Obama has given interviews to Fox News , even though he knows going in that they are his harshest critic .
If the President of the United States can do it , then why ca n’t Sarah Palin ?
Can you imagine the howls from the Right if Barack Obama only appeared on MSNBC ?
Why does Palin , along with Rand Paul and Sharron Angle get a free pass ?
Sarah Palin is undermining a fundamental lynchpin of our democracy , and what is most frightening is that most people and members of the media do n’t notice or care .
Palin fans revolt over Terry Branstad endorsement
Remember when Sarah Palin endorsed Carly Fiorina for U.S. Senate and her Facebook page overflowed with fans of Chuck DeVore ?
We 're seeing a sequel unfold right now .
Last week Palin endorsed Terry Branstad for governor of Iowa .
The four - term political retiree , coming back for a fifth term with a huge poll lead , has been attacked by conservatives for a less - than - Goldwaterian record ; Mike Huckabee endorsed Bob Vander Plaats , the unsuccessful 2006 lieutenant governor nominee who went on to run Huckabee 's 2008 Iowa caucus campaign .
Comments on Palin's Facebook page are mostly running against her choice .
Below the fold are some of the first few garment - rending cries :
Sarah ...
You blew it on this one ....
Branstad is another one of the " good ol ' boys " of the Republican party that you opposed and got rid of in Alaska ...
Bob Vander Plaats is the true conservitive in the race that you should have backed ...
There is still time for you to change your mind !
Sarah , I think you made a big mistake endorsing Terry Branstad for governor in Iowa .
# 1
He is supported by liberal & moderate republicans , he is politics as usual .
# 2 it makes you appear to be just another mainstream Republican who really does n't want true change in our political system .
You sat with Dennis Prager in Denver and nodded your head .
Terry Brandstad is NO DENNIS PRAGER !
If you really believe what Dennis Prager said in Denver you must rescind your endorsement of Brandstad !
I hope someone is really reading these comments .
Sarah , I 'm disappointed .
You missed it on this one .
Iowa needs to move forward and not backwards .
A vote for Branstad takes us backwards .
Why revisit the past ?
A vote for Bob Vander Plaats will take us forward and out of the mess we are in as a state that has been controlled by liberals long enough .
Sarah - I am terribly disappointed in your endorsement of Terry Branstad .
He is part of the " Republic Establishment " in Iowa , and IS NOT the best for Iowa .
Rod Roberts is more aligned with what your values , and I am amazed that you do not see that .
I wish you would have considered your decision a little more carefully .
I only hope you are not becoming a part of the " Republican Establishment " too .
I pray God has better things planned for Iowa and Iowans .
Let 's assume for a moment that Palin is considering a 2012 run .
If so , this endorsement makes even more sense than the Fiorina endorsement .
Barring a meltdown , the widely - liked Branstad is going to be governor of Iowa in seven months .
Even if he stays neutral in the presidential race -- as Gov. Chet Culver ( D - Iowa ) and Gov. Tom Vilsack ( D - Iowa ) did in the open Democratic primaries of 2008 and 2008 -- this endorsement adds to Palin 's win record , erasing some of the bad taste of her Vaughn Ward , Tim Burns , and Doug Hoffman endorsements .
Via HotAir , which also grabbed this video from IowaRepublican of Branstad learning of the endorsement and then , chuckling , declining to immediately endorse Palin .
Google 's telephony management application Google Voice is now open to all U.S. residents , as the company on Tuesday removed the requirement for prospective users to receive an invitation in order to sign up for the service .
Already , there are 1 million people with Google Voice accounts .
Service features include a single phone number that , when called , rings a person 's multiple lines , such as their home , office and cellular phone .
Google Voice also offers voicemail message transcription , free calls to the U.S. and Canada , low international calling rates , conference call capability and a central , Web - based voicemail inbox .
A subset of Google Voice features can also be used by people who do n't want to get the single Google " phone number for life , " but rather use one of their existing lines .
( See Related : Hands On With Google Voice -- This Is Really Cool )
" We 're proud of the progress we 've made with Google Voice over the last few years , and we 're still just scratching the surface of what 's possible when you combine your regular phone service with the latest web technology , " wrote Google Voice Product Managers Craig Walker and Vincent Paquet in an official blog post .
Google acquired the core Google Voice technology in mid-2007 when it bought a company called GrandCentral .
At the time , Google closed new sign - ups for the GrandCentral service .
It re-released the service by invitation only in March of last year with its new Google Voice name and a new set of features .
Last year , the telephony service was at the center of a nasty dispute when Apple rejected Google 's Voice application for the iPhone , saying that it duplicated native iPhone capabilities .
Google cried foul , characterizing the decision as unfair , but months later found a way around Apple 's block by releasing a version of the Voice application for mobile browsers .
Google and Apple are former corporate " best friends forever " now turned rivals , as they compete in more and more markets , such as mobile platforms ( Google 's Android vs. iPhone ) , online advertising services ( Apple 's iAd vs. Google 's AdWords ) , Web browsers ( Apple's Safari vs. Google Chrome ) and PC operating systems ( Mac OS vs. Google Chrome OS ) .
Google Voice also drew unwanted attention last year when transcripts of some of its users ' voicemail messages showed up in search results .
Google soon modified the application so that users can continue to share these transcripts on public Web pages , while keeping them out of the reach of search engine crawlers .
( CNN ) -- Scientists at Ohio's Cleveland Clinic are touting a new prototype vaccine to prevent breast cancer as " promising . "
This follows tests performed on mice by the researchers .
The scientists said a single vaccination was shown to prevent breast cancer tumors from forming in mice , and also stymied the growth of existing tumors .
The vaccine contains a protein found in most breast cancers , but not found in healthy women , except during lactation , according to Dr. Vincent Tuohy , the study 's principal investigator and an immunologist at the Cleveland Clinic 's Lerner Research Institute .
Tuohy says this allows the vaccine to direct a woman 's immune system to target this protein without damaging healthy breast tissue .
" We can protect women from breast cancer , but if it destroyed their normal breast , it 's an unacceptable side - effect , so we had to avoid that , " Tuohy said .
Tuohy now wants to move forward in testing the vaccine in human patients .
Enrollment could begin next year according to the Cleveland Clinic .
Tuohy acknowledges cancers have been cured in mice before without that success transitioning to humans , but thinks this vaccine 's chances of success are " promising . "
" It 's kind of like an application of immunologic judo , using the natural changes that occur in a woman 's needs , " said Tuohy .
" A decrease in the use of the breast for breastfeeding , and an increase in the breast 's risk of developing tumors .
We 're taking advantage of that .
That has n't been done before . "
The inspiration for the research comes from the childhood vaccination program that has been successful in preventing diseases like polio and measles , according to Tuohy .
" It just struck me as a giant hole in our health care that we do n't have preventive vaccines that mimic the childhood vaccination program for adult diseases like breast cancer , " said Tuohy .
The tests have been restricted to mice so far .
Tuohy said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will guide researchers through what type of toxicity studies they want done , and usually they require other species -- rats , for example .
Tuohy says he does n't anticipate any difference in results between mice and rats , but he would not second - guess the FDA on their request for tests on different species .
The FDA has granted approval to two cancer - prevention vaccines : cervical and liver cancer .
However , these vaccines target viruses , while the one tested by the Cleveland Clinic targets cancer formation .
If any human testing proves successful , the strategy would be to vaccinate women 40 and over as well as younger women with a heightened risk of breast cancer .
Tuohy says there is no funding for human trials at this point , but it has been applied for .
However , he speculates it will take at least 10 years to get the vaccine to normal , healthy women at risk of developing the cancer .
" We have to try it .
It looks to me to be extremely promising , and until I see a better idea I 'd like to try this . "
Dave Prentis , the general secretary of Unison , a union that represents many public service workers , nonetheless told the Press Association news agency that Mr. Cameron ’s speech was “ a chilling attack on the public sector , public sector workers , the poor , the sick and the vulnerable , and a warning that their way of life will change . ”
The prime minister laid the blame for the situation squarely on what he called “ reckless ” spending by the Labour government , which was in power for 13 years before being defeated in last month ’s election .
He said that as the financial crisis was “ Labour ’s legacy , ” so , too , would be the spending cuts .
Labour argued that spending would help stimulate the economy , Mr. Cameron said , “ conveniently forgetting that if you start with a large structural deficit , ramping up spending even further is likely to undermine confidence and investment , not encourage it . ”
Details of proposed spending cuts have not been public .
The chancellor of the Exchequer , George Osborne , plans to set out the principles underlying his spending plans on Tuesday and to announce an emergency budget June 22 .
Mr. Cameron said the cuts would come after wide consultation with members of the British public , driving home a recurring theme in his election campaign that “ we ’re all in this together . ”
“ It is precisely because these decisions are so momentous , because they will have such enormous implications , and because we cannot afford either to duck them or to get them wrong that I want to make sure we go about the urgent task of cutting our deficit in a way that is open , responsible and fair , ” he said .
He said the financial situation had been worsened by the sovereign debt crisis in Europe .
“ The global financial markets are no longer focusing simply on the financial position of the banks , ” he said .
“ They want to know that the governments that have supported the banks over the last 18 months are taking the actions to bring their own finances under control . ”
As a cautionary tale , he mentioned Greece , where profligate spending led to a huge budget deficit and a downgrading on financial markets .
While Britain ’s economic position is stronger than Greece ’s , he said , “ Greece stands as a warning of what happens to countries that lose their credibility , or whose governments pretend that difficult decisions can be avoided . ”
She added : " We want to develop the factory in the next three to five years and to use solar power , water power and recycled heat from the machines to reduce its carbon footprint .
One day perhaps we can give Thornton 's a run for their money . "
Anxious that Wikileaks may be on the verge of publishing a batch of secret State Department cables , investigators are desperately searching for founder Julian Assange .
Philip Shenon reports .
Plus , Daniel Ellsberg tells
The Daily Beast : " Assange is in Some Danger . "
( This story has been updated to reflect new developments on Assange 's whereabouts , including the cancelation of a scheduled appearance in Las Vegas . )
Pentagon investigators are trying to determine the whereabouts of the Australian - born founder of the secretive website Wikileaks for fear that he may be about to publish a huge cache of classified State Department cables that , if made public , could do serious damage to national security , government officials tell The Daily Beast .
The officials acknowledge that even if they found the website founder , Julian Assange , it is not clear what they could do to block publication of the cables on Wikileaks , which is nominally based on a server in Sweden and bills itself as a champion of whistleblowers .
“ We ’d like to know where he is ; we ’d like his cooperation in this , ” one U.S. official said of Assange .
American officials said Pentagon investigators are convinced that Assange is in possession of at least some classified State Department cables leaked by a 22 - year - old Army intelligence specialist , Bradley Manning of Potomac , Maryland , who is now in custody in Kuwait .
And given the contents of the cables , the feds have good reason to be concerned .
As The Daily Beast reported June 8 , Manning , while posted in Iraq , apparently had special access to cables prepared by diplomats and State Department officials throughout the Middle East , regarding the workings of Arab governments and their leaders , according to an American diplomat .
The cables , which date back over several years , went out over interagency computer networks available to the Army and contained information related to American diplomatic and intelligence efforts in the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq , the diplomat said .
American officials would not discuss the methods being used to find Assange , nor would they say if they had information to suggest where he is now .
" We 'd like to know where he is ; we 'd like his cooperation in this , " one U.S. official said of Assange .
Assange , who first gained notoriety as a computer hacker , is as secretive as his website and has no permanent home .
He was scheduled to speak Friday in Las Vegas at an Investigative Reporters and Editors conference .
But the group ’s executive director , Mark Horvit , tells The Daily Beast that Assange canceled the appearance — he was on a panel to discuss anonymous sources — within the last several days as a result of unspecificed “ security concerns . ”
Horvit said he communicated with Assange through email and did not know where he might be .
Last week , Assange was scheduled to join famed Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg for a talk at New York 's Personal Democracy Forum .
Assange appeared via Skype from Australia instead , saying lawyers recommended he not return to the United States .
Julian Assange , in April 2010 , discussing confidential sources in the digital age
Assange was in the United States as recently as several weeks ago , when he gave press interviews to promote the website ’s release of an explosive 2007 video of an American helicopter attack in Baghdad that left 12 people dead , including two employees of the news agency Reuters .
Wikileaks has not replied directly to email messages from The Daily Beast .
However , in cryptic messages he sent this week via Twitter , Wikileaks referred to an earlier Daily Beast article on the investigation of Manning and said that it “ looks like we ’re about to be attacked by everything the U.S. has . ”
In an earlier post , the site said that allegations that “ we have been sent 260,000 classified U.S. embassy cables are , as far as we can tell , incorrect . ”
This morning , a new Wikileaks tweet went out : " Any signs of unacceptable behavior by the Pentagon or its agents towards this press will be viewed dimly . "
Pentagon investigators say that particular post may have been an effort by Wikileaks to throw them — and news organizations — off the track as the site prepared the library of State Department cables for release , officials said .
“ It looks like they ’re playing some sort of semantic games , ” one American official said of Wikileaks .
“ They may not have 260,000 cables , but they ’ve probably got enough cables to make trouble . ”

In another cryptic Twitter message , the site said that while the State Department might be alarmed about the prospect of the release of classified cables , “ we have not been contacted . ”
American officials were unwilling to say what would happen if Assange is tracked down , although they suggested they would have many more legal options available to them if he were still somewhere in the United States .
Manning has reportedly admitted that he downloaded 260,000 diplomatic cables and provided them to Wikileaks .
In Internet chat logs first revealed by Wired magazine , Manning also took credit for leaking the 2007 video to the website .
“ Hillary Clinton and several thousand diplomats around the world are going to have a heart attack when they wake up one morning and find an entire repository of classified foreign policy is available , ” Manning wrote of the diplomatic cables , according to Wired .
Wikileaks has not confirmed that Manning is a source of any information posted on the site .
“ We do not know if Mr. Manning is our source , but the U.S. military is claiming he is , so we will defend him , ” Wikileaks said in another Twitter message .
Manning was turned in to the Pentagon by a former computer hacker based in California , Adrian Lamo , after Manning approached Lamo for counsel .
Manning is believed to have contacted Lamo after reading a recent profile of him in Wired .
In the chat log revealed by Wired , Manning bragged to Lamo about having downloaded a huge library of State Department cables , as well as the 2007 video of the helicopter attack , and having provided the material to Wikileaks .
Manning took credit for having leaked a classified diplomatic cable that has already appeared on the site — a memo prepared by the United States embassy in Reykjavik , Iceland , that described a meeting there between American and Icelandic officials over that country ’s banking meltdown .
The January 2010 memo may have been of special interest to Wikileaks given the site ’s close ties to Iceland , where Assange has based himself at times and where he worked with local lawmakers to draft free - speech laws that give broad freedom to journalists to protect their sources .
A profile this week in The New Yorker magazine depicted Assange feverishly at work with Icelandic colleagues in Reykjavik in March as he organized the release of the 2007 video of the helicopter attack .
The edited video was given the title Collateral Murder , and its release infuriated officials at the Defense Department .
With its network of whistleblowers , Wikileaks has published documents and videos on its site that have outraged other foreign governments .
To protect the site from attack by intelligence agencies , Assange has placed Wikileaks on several Internet servers , making it all but impossible for any government to shut down the site entirely .

We ’ve now seen half of the 32 teams that will be contesting this tournament , and whilst we have n’t yet sampled the three most exciting sides – Holland , Brazil and Spain – it is undeniable that Germany have been by far the most impressive so far .
The starting XIs
Germany lined up as predicted – with an attacking band of three behind Miroslav Klose .
In defence Philip Lahm started in the right - back role he ’s become used to at Bayern this season , whilst his club teammate Holger Badstuber came in on the left .
Australia sprung a slight surprise in their starting line - up , as they fielded no conventional striker .
Instead they played a loose 4 - 4 - 2 shape with Tim Cahill just behind Richard Garcia , who tended to drift towards his usual right - wing position .
German brilliance
Firstly , the Germans were fantastic .
The technical quality of individuals was remarkable – almost every outfield player comfortable on the ball .
Bastian Schweinsteiger and Sami Khedira passed the ball quickly and intelligently from the centre of midfield , whilst the timing of Lukas Podolski and Thomas Muller ’s runs was exceptional .
Philip Lahm provided a constant outlet on the right - hand side and Miroslav Klose ’s movement upfront dragged the two Australian centre - backs around all game .
Most impressive of all was Mesut Ozil , who picked up the ball in a variety of positions , but invariably ended up playing it into a dangerous area .
One has to question the tactics of Pim Verbeek , however .
His decision to omit Josh Kennedy , their usual striker , hinted that he would try and pack the midfield with six players , or leave Cahill on his own upfront and get midfield runners supporting him .
Instead , the reason Verbeek selected that XI was because he wanted intense pressing from the front of the pitch , with each Australian working hard to close down the Germany players , even when the centre - backs received the ball from Manuel Neuer on the edge of their own area .
The idea was to stop Germany building from the back , but their back four were relatively comfortable even when subjected to pressure from Australia ’s forwards and wingers , with Lahm and Arne Freidrich in particular happy to take a touch and play a simple pass sideways , and Germany managed to play their way out of the back quite easily .
Not only was the pressing unsuccessful in forcing the German defence into mistakes , it also caused problems further back , in five separate ways .
Why Australia ’s pressing failed
Firstly , if you ask your forwards to close down , you need your midfielders to do the same , to prevent an easy ball into midfield .
The knock - on effect of this is that your defence then has to play a high line , to prevent players between the lines getting too much time on the ball .
Therefore , Lucas Neill and Craig Moore were playing an extremely high defensive line against pacey players like Klose , Podolski and Muller , and it was so easy for Germany to knock the ball through the Australian backline to their forwards rushing onto the ball .
Secondly ( on a related note ) , with Germany playing two direct wingers and three players capable of playing a defence - splitting pass , the high line of the Australian defence meant that the angle of the through - ball between the centre - backs and full - backs , towards an onrushing winger , was very easy .
This is an extremely popular ball in modern football ( at Barcelona , for example – Inter ’s deep line against them in the second leg of their Champions League semi- final made it an impossible pass to play ) and Muller and Podolski thrived on it all day .
Thirdly , and most crucially , it ’s difficult to press effectively if you have a numerical disadvantage in the centre of midfield , as was the case for Australia in this game .
In a straight 4 - 4 - 2 v 4 - 4 - 2 , it ’s relatively easy as each player has a direct opponent in front of them to close down .
With a 4 - 4 - 2 v 4 - 2- 3 - 1 , however , Australia were leaving Germany ’s main playmaker with time and space on the ball .
Australia ’s forwards pressed the centre - backs , their wingers pressed the full - backs – but when the central midfielders did the same to Khedira and Schweinsteiger , it left Ozil free .
Or , even if they did n’t press them , it was still Germany ’s three creative midfielders up against Australia ’s two in the centre of midfield , with the Australian wingers out of the game in a defensive sense .
Ozil was allowed the ball , and used it brilliantly .
Fourthly , it “ forced ” Germany to move the ball swiftly from defence to attack , which played into their hands considering the good technical qualities of their midfielders and the direct nature of their wingers .
They were happy to conduct lightning - quick counter - attacks , and the fact Australia were actively attempting to move up the pitch suited Germany perfectly .
Finally , it ’s simply not the way to play against Germany .
“ We always have trouble playing against teams that pack their defence , just as we did against Azerbaijan ” , said Philip Lahm after his side could only draw with Finland last October .
With this in mind , playing high up the pitch was precisely the opposite strategy of what was required .
Australia switch formation
Australia shifted to 4 - 3 - 3 for the final 15 minutes of the first half , and after being briefed on their new instructions by Verbeek at half - time , and with Brett Holman replacing the out - of - sorts Vince Grella , looked like getting more of a hold on the game in the second half .
Germany no longer dominated possession because they did n’t have an extra man in the centre of midfield , with Carl Valeri dropping deep to pick up Ozil , who was less visible in the second half .
How effective it would have been in getting Australia back in the match , we shall never know , because it was game over as soon as Cahill was dismissed just before the hour .
Conclusion
Australia were poor both technically and tactically , and the loss of Cahill for the next game against Ghana ( at least ) is a huge blow .
They lacked creativity in wide areas and a natural striker , and barely posed a goal threat aside from set - pieces .
Their lack of quality makes it difficult to judge Germany , but they did look very , very good .
They retained the ball in midfield very well but also moved it forward quickly when needed , and the most impressive thing was that the players were all on the same wavelength despite the fact it is a relatively new XI .
They were not tested defensively and the two central midfielders rarely had to track any midfield runs or get tackles in , but each player was composed on the ball and understood their role well .
Muller and Podolski worked hard on the flanks and Ozil was given something approaching a free role – drifting deep and to the right , and taking advantage of the fact no - one was picking him up .
The next match against Ghana will be a much more rigorous test , but Germany are a fine team .

Something strange is afoot in the atmosphere of Saturn 's moon Titan , according to data sent back from the Cassini mission .
Data returned from a spectrometer on Cassini indicates that there 's a large flux of hydrogen in the moon 's atmosphere , with the gas forming in the upper atmosphere and being removed from the atmosphere at Titan 's surface .
We do n't currently know what process is ensuring its removal , but the amounts of hydrogen being taken out of the atmosphere are consistent with an earlier proposal of methane - based life .
Titan 's atmosphere is rich in hydrocarbon compounds , and chemical changes in the upper atmosphere are driven by the arrival of ultraviolet light from the sun .
One of the expected results of the UV exposure is the liberation of molecular hydrogen from methane via a process that produces more complex hydrocarbons .
With little oxygen to react with , the molecular hydrogen should remain stable .
Some of it will escape into space , but a new paper indicates that a substantial amount of that hydrogen migrates down through the atmosphere towards Titan 's surface .
Since it 's not accumulating there , some chemical process must be removing it from the atmosphere ; right now , we do n't know what that process is , and , as NASA 's own news piece on the topic notes , the first option for scientists is to consider simple chemistry .
However , the abstract of the paper notes that this level of hydrogen consumption is consistent with an earlier prediction of methanogenic life .
In short , the life would get its energy by " burning " the hydrogen with a carbon source instead of oxygen , releasing methane ( CH 4 ) in the process .
The source of the carbon is where a second paper ( not yet online ) comes in .
Models of Titan 's upper atmosphere suggest that significant amounts of acetylene should be produced by the reactions there , and this would provide an excellent source of carbon to any hypothetical metabolisms .
The surprise of the second paper is that there 's very little acetylene to be found on Titan 's surface .
Two chemical enigmas certainly do n't constitute life , and the authors of the latter paper provide a variety of ways to account for the acetylene shortage that do n't involve an organism .
It 's also important to remember that there wo n't be anything resembling liquid water on the surface of Titan , so anything alive there would have to be living in a methane / ethane soup ( not to mention at temperatures nearing - 200 °C ) .
Scientists are a cautious bunch , and it's likely that these results will remain in limbo for a while .
The discovery of plumes of methane in the atmosphere of Mars was another chemical enigma that might be evidence for life .
It 's been about a year and a half since their announcement and nobody has come up with a satisfying explanation for their presence ( at least as far as I 'm aware ) , but the scientific community is nowhere close to ready to call that conclusive evidence for life .

Corporations from AT&T to U.P.S. say business is finally picking up  and investors are cheering .
Robust quarterly results from some of the nation ’s bellwether companies galvanized Wall Street on Thursday .
Stocks soared in a broad rally that lifted the Dow Jones industrial average more than 200 points .
Big names like AT&T , Caterpillar , U.P.S. and 3 M posted surprisingly strong sales and profit figures for the second quarter .
Even more encouraging , many also issued upbeat forecasts for the rest of the year , suggesting that , for them at least , a recovery of sorts was at last taking hold .
“ It is all about economic and earnings momentum , ” Alan M. Gayle , senior investment strategist for RidgeWorth Capital Management , said of the swift response from the markets .
Whether the euphoria will last is uncertain .
Quarterly earnings season is now in full swing , and a rush of other results is due over the next week .
Disappointments could await .
Indeed , after the markets closed Thursday , Amazon.com posted results that missed analysts ’ expectations .
From Bloomberg :
The U.S. Justice Department told BP Plc , Transocean Ltd. and three other companies associated with the Gulf of Mexico oil spill to provide the government with advance notice of corporate actions that may deplete assets that could cover judgments against them .
The letters , dated June 23 and provided to Bloomberg News in response to a Freedom of Information Act request , also went to Anadarko Petroleum Corp. , Halliburton Co. and Moex USA Corp. , and described “ significant ” potential liability for each of the companies .
Each of the letters said the U.S. has a “ compelling interest ” to ensure the companies do n’t “ deplete those assets that would be available to satisfy a judgment ” should they be found liable to the U.S .
Attorney General Eric Holder has said the American people wo n’t pay for cleanup costs and that the government will take the steps needed to ensure those responsible cover the costs .
The letters ask for notice of events including disbursements , sales , restructuring and acquisitions .
London - based BP is the operator of the well pouring crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico ; Anadarko , based in Woodlands , Texas , owns 25 percent of the well .
Transocean , based in Geneva , owned the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded in an accident that killed 11 workers and sent oil gushing .
Halliburton , based in Houston , provided drilling services .
Mitsui & Co. , based in Tokyo , owns a majority stake in Moex , which holds a 10 percent stake in the well .
What it is
SouthOrd E500XT Electric Lock Pick
Who uses it
Locksmiths , detectives , military personnel
YouTube is full of videos demonstrating how to pick a lock with everything from a paper clip to a wiper blade .
But most of these rudimentary techniques work on only a limited number of pin-tumbler locks .
If you want to be sure you can compromise all of them , you need SouthOrd 's $ 170 electric pick set .
Pin-tumblers use five or more pins to prevent the lock 's central cylinder from turning ; E500XT slams those pins up and out of the way .
To use the 10 - inch - long device , place the picking needle and tension tool — basically an L - shaped stainless steel bar — inside the keyway .
Pulse the 8,000 - rpm motor to deliver powerful vibrations that knock the pins clear , allowing the tension tool to turn the lock mechanism .
The whole process takes about 20 seconds .
Just do n't think the SouthOrd pick is an easy ticket to a career as a cat burglar :
It sounds like gears grinding on an ' 86 Yugo .

Artistes Need Communities ,
Communities Need Artistes ,
The New Power of the Arts .
I remember years ago , Michael Longley - now unquestionably our most illustrious resident poet in Northern Ireland - saying that he felt the politicians here were failing the people .
He went further and said he thought it would be up to the artistes in our community to forge a new dialogue to help resolve the troubles in Northern Ireland .
At the time , I thought he was a crackpot , off his head , probably taking tablets - that 's what I thought at the time .
Today I 'm not so sure .
When we reflect on some of the theatre work that has been produced over the last twenty or so years , we can begin to see how a dialogue was , and has been , in fact taking place .
If you look at the plays of Graham Reid , Christina Reid , myself , Charabanc Theatre Company , etc. in the 80's , it has to be recognised that large numbers of people from all sections of our community went to see these plays , not just in conventional theatres , but in community centres , social clubs , leisure centres , etc. - in the very heart of communities .
These plays had the power to make people laugh , to move them and to create debate long after the final curtain .
In the 90s , we could look at the work of Dubblejoint Theatre Company , Marie Jones and Just Us and the packed houses they played to in the heart of West Belfast .
The political dialogue , or propaganda  whatever takes your fancy  was clearly palpable and above all , relevant .
In my opinion , The Wedding Community Play which took place throughout 1998/ 9 , took this kind of political dialogue to a new level .
The very people from the most troubled areas of Belfast  and all the personal and family connections , hurts , prejudices , rivalries , traditions , etc. that that entailed  came together and entered into a dialogue about the nature of their society .
It was blunt , humorous , painful , joyous , enlightening , life - changing etc.  and that was before a word was spoken !
We know The Wedding Community Play didnt change the world , but perhaps it changed something for the fifty participants who felt that this medium  the medium of the arts  was a real and tangible way to debate and articulate their lives .
This kind of dialogue and debate simply would not have happened in these communities twenty , thirty or forty years ago .
Without community theatre , these people have to rely on our politicians engaging  in the main  in a kind of arms length , emotionally arrested war mode , flinging and flying or words , ideas and insults .
Perhaps the other art forms have not been so successful in creating a dialogue within the Northern Ireland community .
For instance , in spite of the politically provocative work of some of our best known visual artistes , such as Joe McWilliams , Dermot Seymour , Jack Packenham , the Delargeys , etc. in my opinion , their work has not reached significant levels of public debate and dialogue , largely because of the preponderance of showing the work in conventional spaces .
Spaces that are forever doomed to be inhabited only by the adventurous , the moderately temperate , the anger - sealed few .
It could be argued that the work of politicallymotivated street muralists , such as Danny Devanny , has had more of an impact on the city of Belfast than all the aforementioned artistes put together .
Only the work of Rita Duffy stands out as a politically engaging artiste who is not only concerned with the content of her work but  and this is crucial  is concerned enough to ensure her work is seen by a wide section of the population in unconventional spaces and places .
Disappointingly it may be concluded by most that the works of our best known poets has not had the kind of impact on society that is might have up to this point .
I say this , knowing poetry , will never rival football in the popularity stakes .
Heaney is an obvious exception , in that he is popularly read and exposed to large numbers of young people at school level .
His politically orientated poems have been few and far between and he would never gain a political mantle .
The best known of the other , - e.g. Muldoon , Mahon , Montague , McGuckian , Paulin , Carson , etc. have largely written , it might be argued , into some kind of large underground pipe that is not visible to the vast majority of the people in Northern Ireland .
Here , I think , Michael Longley , has the potential and the power to transcend all of this .
He is reaching a stage where his work is becoming " popular " ; and , above all , he shows a keen interest in being relevant .
The next five years will be interesting .
Against my better judgement , I am coming around to Michael Longleys point of view regarding the possible impact of artistes on real life in Northern Ireland .
However , I probably come at this from a different angle to Longley .
As a consequence of my work , both in mainstream arts and community arts , I now firmly believe that in order for art to mean anything to large numbers of people , there must be an engagement by the artiste with the community .
Obviously , since I believe art , in all its forms , enhances and civilises us , both as individuals , and as communities , I am equally certain that communities need artistes .
When the Belfast European Partnership Board announced its funding criteria for its second tranche of Peace 1 funds three years ago , it stipulated a preference for applications that were ( i ) citywide and ( ii ) proposed by a consortium of groups .
This created debate within the Community Arts Forum .
We finally decided that we would form a consortium and apply .
We also decided that our project would be called the " New Belfast " Community Arts Initiative .
The Initiative would involve five separate but linked projects

Stupefying English signs in China photographed by the Western media
Along with China ’s continuous economic development , our country ’s internationalization is quickly increasing .
To meet and adapt to these new changes , many places have begun to use signs in both Chinese and English .
However , given that our country ’s ordinary people ’s English language level needs to be improved , hilarious and stupefying English signs can easily be seen all around .
Just how stupefying are these stupefying translations ?
Let ’s take a look at the photographs “ New York Times ” and “ Der Spiegel ” journalists have taken on the streets of China .
I am not sure if these photos were really taken by Western media .

ROBERT , La. ( AP ) — Federal officials responding to a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico say no dead , oiled birds have been found in Texas .
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Nancy Brown said Monday that an official tally released Sunday was incorrect .
She blamed the mistake on a clerical error made while compiling figures from different states .
A new report on wildlife harmed by the oil spill will be released later Monday .
Texas General Land Office spokesman Jim Suydam ( SOO ' - dam ) says there were no reports of oiled birds in Texas .
He says the spill 's westernmost limit is about 100 miles east of the Texas - Louisiana border .
The April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig off Louisiana triggered the worst oil spill in U.S. history .
The Lewis Chessmen Unmasked exhibition in Edinburgh brings together the British Museum and the National Museum of Scotland ’s collections of the Lewis Chessmen – a set of medieval gaming pieces , originating most likely from Trondheim in the 12th or 13th century , which were discovered on the Hebridean island of Lewis sometime between 1780 and 1831 .
Individually hand - carved from walrus ivory , and numbering 93 pieces in total – 82 of which are held by the British Museum , the remaining 11 by the National Museum of Scotland – the Lewis Chessmen are world famous for their mysterious origins , unique design and curious , almost comical expressions , which range from moody kings to a frightened - looking warder biting down on his shield .
They even made a cameo in the film Harry Potter and the Philosopher ’s Stone .
People do n't like DRM in large part because it removes much of their control over things like e-books , music , and movies .
Want to loan a DRMed song to a friend ?
You probably can't , even though sharing a physical item like a CD remains trivial .
A new IEEE working group has an ambitious plan to change this and return control over " digital personal property " to consumers .
DRM 's electronic tethers would be cut , but rightsholders would not need to remove all limits on sharing .
Instead , digital personal property enables the same sort of private sharing that is easily possible with physical objects while still preventing worldwide mass distribution .
Living in a material world
It sounds almost futile : making digital goods " rivalrous " ( after being taken , someone else is deprived of their use ) when copying is the basic activity of digital devices .
But the IEEE P1817 working group has a plan to do exactly this .
Engineer Paul Sweazey has been the driving force behind the idea , which we profiled a year ago when the IEEE first consented to study the idea .
A few weeks ago , the idea graduated to working group status ; the group will hold its first meeting July 14 in Santa Clara , California .
The " digital personal property " idea involves two major pieces : a title folder and a playkey .
The title folder contains the content in question , it 's encrypted , and it can be copied and passed around freely .
To access the content inside , however , you 'll need the playkey , which is delivered to the buyer of a digital media file and lives within " tamper - protected circuit " inside some device ( computer , cell phone , router ) or online at a playkey bank account .
Controlling the playkey means that you control the media , and you truly own it , since no part of the system needs to phone home , and it imposes no restrictions on copying ( except for those that arise naturally from fear of loss ) .
The playkey , unlike the title folder , can't be copied — but it can be moved .
To give your friends and family access to the file in question , you can send them a copy but must also provide a link to the playkey .
Under the DPP system , though , anyone who can access the playkey can also decide to move it to their own digital vault — in essence , anyone can take the content from you , and you would no longer have access to the media files in question if they did so .
According to the P1817 working group , this means that :
[ P] roduct ownership is perpetual , and the tethers are severed that connect your purchases to their vendors .
No one can restrict how you privately use or share them .
However , because they are copyrighted , rightsholders retain the legal right to control public dissemination of their works .
Just as a printed book can be lost if you share it publicly ( i.e. , with strangers ) , you must be careful to share only privately ( i.e. , with those you trust . )
That 's because anyone who shares either of your playkeys can take both of them and move them to his own device and his own online playkey bank !
The availability and mobility of playkeys lets you electronically share , lend , borrow , give , take , donate , and resell digital property , just as you do with your physical possessions .
And since playkeys remain singular , unique , and protected from counterfeiting , copyright holders know that your sharing will remain a private , non-public matter .
The entire system is predicated on the fear of loss ; share with people you do n't know , and at some point your playkey will probably be moved to someone else 's control .
Making digital goods act like physical objects might sound like a bizarre step backward .
Did n't we gain quite a lot with the shift to digital , non-rivalrous items ?
We certainly did , but Sweazey argues that a truly non-rivalrous system makes commerce too difficult , even impossible , and that we need to create ways for the digital world to mirror the constraints of the physical one .
If it sounds odd , consider that traditional DRM vendors have tried to do the same thing for more than a decade already .
The digital personal property approach both removes tethers to corporate DRM servers and liberates sharing , and sounds like an effort to make DRM 's basic approach palatable enough that it wo n't bother people .
Certainly , DRM alone has not proved enough to dissuade people from buying products , so long as it is remains out of their way most of the time ; consider DVDs , Blu-ray discs , Apple 's FairPlay , the Kindle 's e-book DRM , console games , and Apple 's App Store .
If P1817 gets major support from vendors and rightsholders , it might prove acceptable to consumers , finally removing some of the ridiculous limitations on backups and format shifting that traditional DRM has eviscerated .
P1817 has a tough road ahead , and there 's still something of the " cram the genie back in the bottle " to the whole approach .
But those who want to make the scheme work are welcome at the group 's meetings ( PDF ) , which Sweazey sees as necessary " middle ground " in the DRM wars .
" I also understand that the Ars Technica readership leans heavily toward the ' all bits are free ' direction , " Sweazey noted in an e-mail , " but for us they provide a balance to the DRM defenders who think that ' the beatings should continue until morality improves . '
There is a middle ground , and someone needs to enable it .
We 're volunteering . "

Literary types recently celebrated Bloomsday , a " holiday " not generally recognized by those who have n't read James Joyce 's " Ulysses , " a novel whose principal character is named Leopold Bloom and that takes place in Dublin on June 16 , 1904 .
As always , the celebrations included a marathon bash at New York 's Symphony Space during which excerpts from " Ulysses " were read .
One participant was Stephen Colbert , who admitted to a reporter : " Performing ' Ulysses ' on Bloomsday at Symphony Space is the only way I 'll ever finish ...
Several studies have shown that people eat faster and leave sooner when loud music is playing  so restaurants have been turning up the volume to increase flow - through .
And this is n’t the only tactic restaurants use .
Diners seated at tables in the middle of the room tend to be less comfortable and eat faster .
The same holds true for uncomfortable chairs .
They also want you to eat more as well as faster .
Warm colors  like red , orange and yellow  stimulate the need to eat .
CNN reports that :
 On hectic nights , the reservationist at Salumeria Rosi Parmacotto in New York City will inform diners that they need the table back in 90 minutes for the next party .
If you lurk over your digestif too long , chef Cesare Casella will place your name on Salumeria ’s no salami list . 

Dr. Mercola ’s Comments :
If you re in the mood to linger over appetizers and savor each bite of your main course , all while enjoying conversation with your dining companions , your local , trendy restaurant may not be the best choice .
There are actually many reasons why dining out may not be your best option  not the least of which is food quality , or lack thereof  but theres also the issue of atmosphere .
Clearly there are many exceptions to this rule , but most restaurants primary mission is to generate a profit , and the more diners they can seat in any given night , the fatter their profits will be .
Knowing this , those in the industry have carefully crafted tricks of the trade designed to subtly get you in , stuffed and out in the shortest amount of time possible .
The Primal Blueprint : ... Sisson , Mark Best Price : $ 1.25 Buy New $ 4.70 ( as of 12:45 EST - Details )
As CNN reported , tactics include :
Playing loud music , which makes people eat faster and drink more ( in a shorter amount of time )
Seating patrons in the middle of restaurant , surrounded by chaos
Using uncomfortable chairs
Displaying elaborate dessert trays , cheese carts and other visual enticements
Decorating in warm colors like red , orange and yellow , which stimulates your desire to eat
These strategies strongly encourage you to rush through your meal , a practice that s not only unpleasant but bad for your digestion and waistline as well .
Why Eating Fast is Not Recommended
When you visit most restaurants , taking your time to eat and chew your food thoroughly will likely go right out the window .
There are certainly select upscale dining establishments that will march to a different drummer , and pride themselves on allowing patrons to linger and really taste each course of their meal but these are the exception rather than the norm .
For the most part , you can expect that eating out will encourage you to shovel in more food , faster , than you likely would at home .
Why is this not a good idea ?
It will make you eat more , for starters .
A study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism last year found that subjects given identical servings of ice cream on different occasions released more hunger - regulating hormones when they ate it in 30 minutes instead of five .
So although the serving size remained the same , they felt fuller after savoring the ice cream compared to when they wolfed it down .
Fast Food Nation : The ... Eric Schlosser Best Price : $ 3.80 Buy New $ 103.16 ( as of 09:20 EST - Details )
In another study from 2008 , subjects also reported feeling fuller when they ate slowly .
Interestingly , they also ended up consuming about 10 percent fewer calories when they ate at a slow pace as opposed to when they were rushing .
A third study , published in the British Medical Journal , found that eating quickly , and eating until feeling full , tripled subjects  risk of being overweight .
The authors concluded :
 Eating until full and eating quickly are associated with being overweight in Japanese men and women , and these eating behaviors combined may have a substantial impact on being overweight . 
Eating your food slowly , chewing up to twice as long as you normally would , will also instantly help you control your portion sizes , which naturally decreases calorie consumption .
Another benefit of chewing longer is that your food is digested better .
The majority of your digestive enzymes are actually in your mouth , not in your stomach .
Therefore , chewing your food longer allows it to be broken down better .
You re also likely to find that you actually enjoy the taste of the food more .
Most Restaurant Food is Far From Optimal
When it comes to top restaurant gripes , the pace of your meal may actually pale in comparison to food quality .

Ive often wondered how restaurants can offer so many different menu options and in about 15 minutes , sometimes less , have it sitting in front of you ready to eat .
This just is nt possible if you re cooking food from scratch .
In reality , many restaurants are simply buying processed frozen foods , popping them in the microwave , and passing them off as homemade cooking .
This is something youd expect from a cafeteria , fast - food joint or chain restaurant , but it even occurs at five - star eateries .
Further , daily specials are not always  the chef 's inspiration of the day . 
Instead , daily specials are often dishes prepared specifically to get rid of ingredients nearing the end of their shelf life .
To spot these iffy " specials , " look out for expensive items used in a way that minimizes their flavor , such as cut and braised lamb chops playing second fiddle in a dish .
Also , similar to the way grocery stores pack the most visible shelves with the most profitable foods , restaurant dishes that earn the most profit are always located in the most eye - catching spot on the menu .
This says nothing for quality , however .
It s common at restaurants for inexpensive fish such as pollack to get passed off as something more expensive , like cod .
Or , Maryland - style crab cakes may be made from crab that came from Vietnam .
Most fish in restaurants is also farm - raised , which you definitely want to avoid .
Even the healthiest restaurant meals are typically loaded with calories as well .
According to a registered dietician and representative for the American Dietetic Association , restaurant meals average between 1,000 to 1,500 calories , and because they re served in gigantic portions , you re likely to eat more than you would at home .
The No- Grain Diet : Con ... Joseph Mercola Best Price : $ 1.25 Buy New $ 7.24 ( as of 10:39 EST - Details )
The end result is that eating out often means you re typically eating low - quality food at a premium price , a lose - lose situation for both your health and your bank account .
Unfortunately , many Americans have made eating out a way of life .
In 2008 , the average U.S. household spent close to HALF of its food budget on meals eaten away from home , according to The Survey of Consumer Expenditures for 2008 , released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
A Better Choice for Your Meals
Most of you probably know that I am not a major fan of eating out , primarily because of the major unknowns at most restaurants in terms of food quality , preparation and addition of toxic substances like high - fructose corn syrup , preservatives and MSG .
Also , as I said earlier , much of the food is actually cooked in microwaves to speed up delivery , and I try to avoid any food that has been cooked in a microwave .
Instead , I have long stated that if you want to be optimally healthy , you , ideally a family member or someone you hire needs to put some serious time into preparing your meals .
This way , you can prepare your meals with unprocessed , high - quality food , you control the portion sizes , and you can enjoy your food in an atmosphere that is calming and not rushed .
I am fond of saying that if you fail to plan you are planning to fail so before you go to bed at night make certain that you know what you are going to eat the next day so you dont have to rely on purchasing unhealthy meals .
For help getting started , please do read my 14 tips to eat healthy on a tight budget along with the quick , home - cooking tips in the article How to Cook Whole Food From Scratch  and Keep Your Day Job !
It takes a bit of planning on your part , but please make an effort to eat the majority of your meals at home  and rely on dining out for only the rare occasion .

The Best of Joseph Mercola
( CNN ) --
Until this year , the golf world had been a fairly easy place to predict over the past decade , given Tiger Woods ' dominance .
But this week 's U.S. Open at Pebble Beach in California comes at a time when all bets are off -- dozens of players are in now in genuine contention to win the second of 2010 's golf majors .
With world No. 1 Woods -- a three - time winner of the event -- struggling in his comeback after half a year ruined by personal problems and injury , this could be one of the most exciting tournaments in years .
CNN takes a look into its crystal ball for signs of the U.S. Open 's seven unwritten headlines .
1. The Tiger Woods meltdown continues
What a difference a decade makes .
In 2000 a fresh - faced Tiger smashed the record to win the U.S. Open by 15 strokes before going on to dominate the sport .
And then ... well , we all know what happened next .
With Tiger 's indiscretions laid bare , and following a self - imposed hiatus to sort out his problems , he still seems some way off the pace .
Fans in Tiger 's firing line at Memorial
His fourth - place return to the Masters in April under intense pressure could have been seen as a victory given the circumstances .
But since then he has struggled , even missing the cut at one tournament before pulling out of the Players Championship last month citing a neck injury .
Nothing suggests the U.S. Open will be any different .
But then again Tiger does have the ability to create a narrative so astonishing that a Hollywood script writer would deem it too fanciful .
2 . Nice guys do come first
And yet , for all the criticisms and poor form , Woods still sits atop the world golf rankings , the same place he has been for more than five years .
But not for much longer , if Phil Mickelson gets his way .
Sports stars who make golf their second career
As a litany of ex-strippers and hostesses lined up to sell their Tiger stories to the tabloid press , Mickelson secured an emotional third Masters victory while both his wife and mother battled breast cancer .
" Lefty , " as he 's known , has finished second at the U.S.
Open on five occasions and there will be no more popular victor if Mickelson claims his first title and with it the number one spot .
Can Brits end 40 - year wait at Pebble Beach ?
3 . The British clean up
Given the current stand - off between President Obama and BP , there probably is n't a worse time for a horde of British golfers to descend on Pebble Beach .
Still , the British arrive at the U.S. Open with five players in the top 10 : Englishmen Luke Donald , Lee Westwood , Ian Poulter and Paul Casey plus Northern Ireland 's Rory McIlroy .
Westwood wins St. Jude Classic
Westwood in particular is worth watching .
He has recorded three top - 10 finishes at U.S. Opens , including fifth at Pebble Beach in 2000 and third in 2008 .
Maybe 2010 is the year that the Brits really do clean up .
4 . All the young dudes : an amateur in contention ?
Amateurs are n't what they used to be .
Gone are the slightly portly , middle - aged hackers of yore .
The new generation are lean , mean golfing machines barely out of their teens and hungry for success .
This year 's group includes 18 - year - old U.S. Amateur Champion Byeong - Hun An .
The Korean missed the cut at his first PGA tournament at this year 's Masters , but has been tipped for great things .
Not many amateurs have blazed a trail in recent years -- brilliant performances by Justin Rose and Chris Wood at the British Open being an exception -- but this year 's crop look particularly exciting .
And do n't forget , Bobby Jones famously won the grand slam of golf 's four major titles as an amateur and then retired at the grand old age of 28 .
5 . The Asian invasion
There was a time when Asian players were , if not derided , then certainly strangled by kind condescension while on tour .
Not any longer .
The growing strength of the Asian game means that 11 players will hail from the East , including South Korea 's Y.E. Yang , who became the first Asian golfer to win a major , and Thailand 's Thongchai Jaidee , Asia 's current number one .
" There is a big representation of Asian Tour members at the U.S.
Open this week , " Asian Tour executive chairman Kyi Hla Han told his organization 's Web site .
" We are confident they will compete well to show the golfing world that Asian golf has truly come of age . "
On current form , you would n't want to bet against him .
6 . It 's a lottery
Even if we think we have covered all the bases by mentioning Woods , Mickelson , half of the top 10 and all of Asia , the U.S.
Open still has a tendency to throw the form book out of the window .
Who can forget how in 2008 Rocco Mediate , then ranked 158th in the world , took the now 115 - year - old event to only its third ever play - off against Woods ?
Four of the past five winners started with odds of over 100/ 1 to win the title .
Plus Pebble Beach just is n't the same course that Woods smashed in 2000 either .
Expect the unexpected .
7. U.S. Open 1 - 0 World Cup
There seems to be little that can stand in the way of soccer 's World Cup juggernaut .
Even the NBA can't compete , with more people in the U.S. watching the United States versus England game than any of the first four basketball playoffs .
CNN 's World Cup coverage
But with few goals so far , not to mention the constant din of the vuvuzela blaring in the background , the drama of the U.S. Open should at last push South Africa off the front page .
World Cup ?
What World Cup ?
Two British soldiers were shot dead in southern Afghanistan as they tried to rescue a comrade , the Ministry of Defence has announced .
The troops , one from the Royal Dragoon Guards and the other from 1st Battalion Scots Guards , were killed yesterday in the Lashkar Gah district of Helmand province .
They are expected to be named today .
" They died helping their friends , " said Lieutenant Colonel James Carr - Smith , a spokesman for Taskforce Helmand .
" In the courageous and selfless act of attempting to evacuate an injured colleague , they themselves were shot and fatally wounded .
The soldiers were part of a cordon operation providing security for a routine rotation of troops when they were killed by small arms fire , " he said .
The British death toll in the Afghan campaign since 2001 now stands at 324 .
The latest death come as David Cameron has been forced to clarify the timetable for the withdrawal of British troops from the country .
Senior
Tory backbenchers yesterday criticised the government for confusion over whether there was fixed a timetable for withdrawing troops in 2015 or was this was just a policy aim .
Cameron said he expected British troops to start leaving Afghanistan next year and complete their pullout by 2015 , but only if conditions were right .
" To give people some certainty , we have said , to be clear , that in 2015 there are not going to be combat troops , or large numbers of British troops , in Afghanistan , " he said .
The bodies of four British servicemen killed in separate incidents in Afghanistan will be repatriated later today .
Staff Sergeant Brett Linley , 29 , of 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment , and Sergeant David Monkhouse , 35 , of the Royal Dragoon Guards , both died on Saturday .
Their deaths followed those of Senior Aircraftman Kinikki Griffiths , 20 , of 1 Squadron RAF Regiment , and Marine Jonathan Crookes , 26 , of 40 Commando Royal Marines , who died the previous day .
The bodies of all four men will be flown back to to RAF Lyneham , Wiltshire .

Can Rashida Jones revive the comics industry ?
Her debut series , Frenemy of the State , promises action , adventure , and Perez Hilton parodies - but will that be enough to hook female readers into the series ?

As Jones explained last year , Frenemy started with an intriguing premise :
Back when Paris was at her height of fame and people were just obsessed with her , I had this funny notion that she 's actually some crazy genius who knew exactly what she was doing , and she was just conducting this elaborate anthropological study on the world .
I imagined that she was going home every night and whispering into her mini-recorder : " Day three hundred and twenty seven .
I continue to have them all fooled . "
That was sort of where the idea for this comic started .
And also , I 'm obsessed with our country 's almost cannibalistic obsession with people who are famous for no other reason than that they 're famous .
I thought , " Would n't it be interesting to give somebody like Paris Hilton another layer ?
What if her fame is something more than just an overwhelming need to be an object of desire ? "
Ariana is a little bit reluctant to be in the spotlight , and there 's a sadness to that .

Before reading the comic , I found myself concerned about how the storyline would actually play out .
Was there enough fun in this one idea to spin a series out of ?
Luckily , the answer is an overwhelming yes .
Jones , alongside married creative team Christina Weir and Nunzio DeFilippis and comic artist Jeff Wamester , created a smart , reflective series about a woman in the spotlight .
The group also slid a lot of jokes about our current culture into the mix - does this look familiar ?

The narrative revolves around young heiress Arianna Von Holmberg , who feels trapped in her role as a young , affluent , socialite .
Exhausted with the role she plays , Arianna often finds herself playing games with the other women of her set who are invested in the wealthy party life .
Advertisement
However , quick wit aside , Arianna is refreshingly flawed .
An intelligent character in most respects , she still finds herself battling her own insecurities and making unwise decisions .
Advertisement
Advertisement
Advertisement
The ensuing mess with her ex is what led to her current situation with the CIA .
Clearly , her relationship with the agency is based more on coercion than Arianna 's ideas of civic duty .
Still , her new buds at the CIA ( who reveal the same types of social dynamics that Arianna left in celebutante circles ) have plans for the young Von Helmberg , and the issue ends on a promise of danger and scandal .
So what makes Frenemy so appealing ?
Comic artist Hope Larson may have the answer .
On May 19th , she posted the results of a survey of girls and women who read comics .
198 people responded to the survey , and Larson found that the demands of women comic readers ( many of whom had fallen out of the habit of reading comics ) and their ideas for improving the industry are elementary , but need to be stated again and again .
What can authors , publishers , retailers do to better serve teen / tween girls ?
1. More and better female characters , especially protagonists .
Girls want to see strong , in - control , kick - ass women calling the shots .
2 . A welcoming atmosphere in local comic stores is key .
Many respondents reported feeling uncomfortable in comic stores .
They were stared at , talked down to , and generally treated without respect .
3 . Pink , sparkly cutesy comics about boyfriends , ponies , cupcakes and shopping are widely reviled .
Condescend to female readers at your peril , writers and comic publishers .
4 . The hypersexualization / objectification of female superheroines makes female readers uncomfortable , and sexual violence as a plot point has got to stop .
5 . Girls need good stories in a variety of genres .
6 . Most girls do n't even know comics exist , or that they would enjoy them .
Publishers need to advertise in mainstream media and comic shops need to reach out to girls .
7 . Make comics for boys and girls .
Comics with dual male and female protagonists .
Comics with large casts that offer something for everyone .
8 . Use licensed properties to lure new readers into comics .
9 . Availability is a problem .
Get more comics into schools .
Get more comics into libraries - especially school libraries .
Get more comics into bookstores , especially large chains .
10 .
There need to be more women creating comics and working in the industry as editors and publishers .
Advertisement
Frenemy fits most of these parameters .
Arianna Von Holmsberg is a socialite , but is seldomly represented as sexualized , and she 's a kick - ass protagonist .
The series is written in a smart , approachable way that will appeal to teens and adults and the project has a gender balanced team - in sum , it 's almost the ideal comic for women .
( Unfortunately , Frenemy may hit an availability wall - I had to hunt down my copy and put future issues on request at my local shop . )
Kelly Thompson over at Comic Book Resources interviews Larson and spends some time deconstructing the availability block , and how that discourages girls and women from reading comics :
HOPE LARSON : Everyone has a pet theory about what needs to happen in bookstores , organizationally .
What I 'd like to see is comics racked in sections divided by age group : adult comics , young adult comics , middle grade comics , and so on .
For this sort of system to work , though , comics publishers would need to start thinking like book publishers in terms of who their books are for .
I 've been railing about this a lot lately , but to a bookseller , all - ages is not a thing .
If you tell a bookseller , " Oh , but this is a book anyone could enjoy ! " , she will laugh at you , and yes , that has happened to me .
Booksellers need to know who they 're selling your book to .
If they can't figure it out , they probably are n't going to bother stocking it .
I may already have mentioned this , but Barnes & Noble and Borders do n't carry my books at all–any of my books–and that 's partly because they are n't sure where to shelve YA comics that are n't Manga .

Frenemy suffers from the same problem - the biggest hindrance to the comic is n't the plot or characterization , but the fact that the audience who would enjoy it the most may never become aware that the story exists .

Every single person playing Team Fortress 2 knows the stakes — Valve issued the challenge , and despite the legendary Golden Wrenches being but a cosmetic gift , players worldwide are frothing at the mouth to land their own piece of gold .
What most players fail to see , however , are the inherent problems that such a situation creates .
When all the chips are on the table , the only one left smiling is Valve .
This little gilded tool will be the end of all of us .
The Golden Wrenches bring a curse .
It seems as if everyone is playing Team Fortress 2 right now .
The gamers that play on a regular basis are playing non-stop .
The gamers that play intermittently are re-familiarizing themselves with the game just to get their shot .
Even the gamers that stopped playing two years ago have updated their long - neglected installations just so they can roll the dice .
No matter how much these gamers play the Engineer class , or more so the actual game , everyone has been bitten by the fever .
Even Icrontic is in the mix — gamers that have n’t touched the game in months , such as Primesuspect , LethalBlu , and Gargoyle , have all returned to the battlefields .
They could n’t resist the temptation — they had to put in a quarter and pull the lever .
The Golden Wrench is an extremely rare item .
It grants its owner unlimited bragging rights .
In internet terms , that ’s as good as gold .
Amidst this gold rush is a hidden darkness .
Gamers are rapidly hitting the weekly item drop limit thanks to their continual attempts and longevity in play time .
Furthermore , understanding that crafting is a necessary component in the acquisition of Golden Wrenches , these players are crafting every last item they have in their backpack .
It is not uncommon to find gamers who have crafted it all away , leaving no functional weapon unlocks at their disposal .
Many players have found themselves locked away in a dark box of wrench madness — having hit the item drop cap and crafted away all of their belongings , they have effectively taken themselves out of the Golden Wrench running in the earliest stages .
They have become hobos of the Team Fortress 2 world .
Valve did announce that they are increasing the item drop cap for this week only .
They state with glee , “ If you thought you ’d hit your item cap , think again ! ”
Such a simple matter makes no difference .
These obsessed gamers will continue to play and craft until they reach this new limit and once more close themselves down .
However , these poor , pathetic crafters actually got the better part of the bargain .
The people in the worst shape just might be the actual Golden Wrench recipients themselves .
Take a look at the list of players who have acquired a Golden Wrench thus far .
Notice how many of them have turned their profiles to private ?
Look closely at the first three profiles .
All three have privatized their accounts , and one has gone so far as to completely strip the info from their Steam Community profile .
These players are on display for everyone to see , and are no doubt being assaulted from all angles .
Rabid , desperate players are flooding in .
They want to know the secret , they want to know how to get a Wrench .
Some might even bring business proposals .
It would n’t be surprising to find these “ winners ” being threatened by some pathetic , passive - aggressive gamer .
Those that have the Golden Wrenches are feeling the pressure .
One of the original three has even changed his profile name in a way that perfectly reflects the situation .
Their name reads , simply , “ The Wrench is a Curse . ”
These winners could not be reached for comment at the time of publication .
Our knocks on their doors only resulted in the locking of even more deadbolts and chains .
The winners just want to be left alone .
They never asked for the podium that Valve has placed them on .
Through their success , their lives have spiraled out of control .
Valve has created a monster , and despite succeeding in bringing back players who have forgotten about the game , they have inadvertently caused a riot that is enticing the community to eat itself from the inside out .
Perhaps Valve meant for this .
Perhaps total meltdown of their entire fan base was the plan all along .
No matter their intent , we can all be certain that as long as the final 50 Golden Wrenches exis — There ’s only 50 left ?
My God , I have to start playing !
I HAVE TO GET A GOLDEN WRENCH .
I WILL NOT STOP UNTIL I HAVE ONE .

Is a Federal Indictment In Store for Cardinal Roger Mahony ?
Image via Wikipedia
It was bound to happen , sooner or later , and although it may well be later , Cardinal Mahony , seen at right with Congresswoman Diane Watson of California , may soon have to pay the piper for his efforts to cover up pedophilia by Catholic priest .
Here is the story from The Daily Beast through Reuters :
No U.S. Catholic leader as been prosecuted for the church ’s child sex scandals .
But officials are weighing obstruction and perjury charges against Cardinal Roger Mahony — and studying emails showing Mahony discussing with his lawyers ways to avoid giving law enforcement the names of abusive priests .
Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles faces the prospect of an unwelcome retirement gift when he steps down in February : A federal indictment .
Law - enforcement officials tell
The Daily Beast that prosecutors are weighing charges of conspiracy , obstruction of justice and perjury against the 74 - year - old cardinal and his deputies over allegations that they covered up rampant child sexual abuse within the archdiocese of Los Angeles .
“ The church would like to pretend this investigation has gone away , ” said one official familiar with the grand jury ’s work .
“ It has n’t . ”
The cardinal denies wrongdoing and insists he has been assured he is not a target of the federal inquiry .
But officials with knowledge of the grand jury ’s work say that Mahony remains at the center of the Justice Department ’s two - year - old investigation .
Federal prosecutors are paying special attention to seemingly damning emails between the cardinal and his lawyers — in which Mahony outlined tactics to avoid providing prosecutors with the names of abusive priests , the officials said .
One official said the Justice Department has received important assistance from the Los Angeles District Attorney ’s Office ; a related investigation by the D.A. ’s office stalled because of the restrictive statute of limitations under California state law .
No charges are imminent , the official said .
But “ the church would like to pretend this investigation has gone away .
It has n’t . ”
The cardinal ’s lawyer , J. Michael Hennigan , said in an interview he was “ unaware of any indictable crime that might have been conducted by any church official ” in the hierarchy of the archdiocese , including Mahony .
The lawyer said Mahony was being unfairly singled out for criticism over policies of the Catholic Church that , while ill - advised , were once routine — specfically , its policy of seeking psychological counseling and treatment for abusive priests , rather than alerting the police .
“ This guy has taken it for everybody else , ” Hennigan said of the cardinal .
“ And he ’s done so in a noble way . ”
No national leader of the Catholic Church has been prosecuted as a result of scandals across the country involving pedophile priests .
But lawyers and other advocates for abuse victims in Southern California say they believe there may be an especially strong criminal case against Mahony , if only because of the flood of evidence released from church files as a result of hundreds of civil lawsuits filed against the archdiocese .
The victims groups are pressing the Justice Department to act against the cardinal before his scheduled retirement in February .
The groups say publicly they fear that Mahony , who has led the 4 - million - member southern California archdiocese since 1985 , will use his retirement as an opportunity to seek refuge in the Vatican .
They say they do not believe his assurances that he will remain in California .
“ The day that Mahony steps down next year is the day that he leaves for the Vatican and never comes back , ” predicted Joelle Casteix , southwestern regional director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests , or SNAP .
The victims groups draw comparisons to Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston , who resigned his post in Massachusetts in 2002 and left for a comfortable new assignment in Rome in the midst of allegations that he covered up for several abusive priests in New England .
As cardinals , Mahony and Law are entitled to diplomatic protections from the Vatican .
“ Mahony should be in jail for what he did , ” Casteix told The Daily Beast .
“ I personally know of dozens of people who were molested because of decisions made by Roger Mahony — decisions that he made personally .
If I were Mahony , I ’d flee the country . ”
His lawyers and spokesmen insist that Mahony , who was born in Los Angeles , has no intention of leaving California , let alone the United States , after his scheduled retirement .
They say he will not attempt to resettle in the Vatican or anywhere else outside the United States to avoid criminal charges .

Hell hath no fury like a Justin Bieber fan whose idol has been scorned .
Just ask Greg Leuch .
Since he created an application that blocks all mentions of the Stratford singing sensation from people ’s computers , the web designer has received death threats and even been compared to Hitler .
“ It ’s very shocking for me , ” Leuch said on the phone from New York City .
“ Who knew 12 - year - olds had this much hate in them ? ”
Well , Kim Kardashian did .
The reality star received death threats from Bieber fans in early May after Bieber joked that she was his girlfriend when the two were photographed at the White House correspondents ’ dinner .
Leuch ’s tangle with the Bieber faithful began after he created “ Shaved Bieber , ” an application that can be added to a browser or downloaded as a Firefox add - on to cover up the words Bieber or Justin Bieber , and any photos with Bieber in their file names .
Leuch , director of research and development at web entities Rocketboom , Magma and Know Your Meme , created the application in about six hours and launched it two Mondays ago after a friend who ’s an Internet researcher asked for an easy way to eradicate Bieber references from his online searches .
Leuch posted Shaved Bieber on the Free Art & Technology blog , for which he ’s one of the creators , expecting people “ to have a good laugh at it , ” as well as to gather a little Internet buzz .
“ I never expected this type of coverage . . .
I never expected the death threats , ” he said .
The first email he received was from a 15 - year - old in Switzerland who said , “ what you ’re doing is going back to World War II all over again .
Hitler wanting to erase Jews from society — you want to erase Justin Drew Bieber . ”
Another irate fan tweeted , “ I know many things about you and i know where you live .
Just be aware .
I might just appear behind you and shoot you with a gun . ”
Another threatened to run away if her mother installed the application on her computer .
Bieber and his management have n’t commented yet , but Leuch hopes they ’re getting a chuckle out of his creation .
Contrary to what the fans think , Leuch , 25 , said he has nothing against Bieber and thinks it ’s great he ’s achieved such success at 16 .
“ I ’m not one of the haters .
I ’m also not one of the Beliebers , ” he said , referring to the term Bieber fans use .
The hate mail is still trickling in , but Leuch is taking it with a sense of humour .
“ I get to say I died for my art . ”

Head of Office for Budget Responsibility will not stay beyond initial three - month term following controversy over forecasts for job losses
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Sir Alan Budd has quit the government 's new spending watchdog after only three months to return to the private sector .
The Treasury said Budd will step down as head of the Office for Budget Responsibility when his three - month contract expires at the end of this month .
Budd , who is a former Treasury economist and ex-Bank of England policymaker , was appointed interim head of the OBR on its creation in May , but many had expected him to stay in the role until the government spending review on 22 October .
The surprise decision is expected to fuel speculation that Budd had become disenchanted with the role , which proved more controversial than expected .
Last week Budd , 72 , provoked a storm of protest after he intervened in the debate over job prospects for the economy .
Hours before prime minister David Cameron was due to defend the government against attacks that it would sacrifice 1.3 m jobs as part of its austerity plan , he released figures to show cuts would amount to fewer than 1 m jobs and that 2 m private sector jobs would be created .
The Labour opposition was forced on to the back foot during the debate after Cameron quoted the OBR figures .
Senior MPs on the Treasury select committee said the incident provoked concerns that Budd was too closely allied to the government and had sacrificed the OBR 's independence .
He was expected to come under close questioning by the committee at its first meeting .
The Treasury said Budd 's contract ran for three months .
" It was always Sir Alan 's intention to leave in the summer , " a Treasury spokesman said .
" He was appointed to provide forecasts for the June budget and advice on the creation of the permanent OBR . "
The creation of the independent fiscal watchdog was one of the first acts of Britain 's coalition government to scrutinise policy and publish growth and state borrowing forecasts .
The Treasury declined to comment on who would replace Sir Alan at the OBR .
" The Treasury will seek to ensure continuity in recruiting his successor , " the spokesman said .
When he was appointed , Budd said that his role as chairman of the OBR was " the most exciting challenge of my professional life " .
He worked alongside former Royal Bank of Scotland chief economist Geoffrey Dicks and Graham Parker , a former career civil servant .
The OBR was supported by a Treasury secretariat of economics .
Budd studied economics at the London School of Economics and Cambridge , and held academic roles in Britain and the US before becoming senior economic adviser to the Treasury between 1970 and 1974 .
In the 1980s he was professor of economics at the London Business School , before becoming chief economic adviser to the Treasury between 1991 and 1997 .
Budd was at chancellor Norman Lamont 's side when the UK was bundled out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism .
When Gordon Brown moved into No 11 in 1997 Budd became a founder member of the Bank of England 's monetary policy committee , later heading the inquiry into the gambling industry which led to the liberalisation of gaming laws .
June 14 , 2010 --
The lives of between 70,000 and 100,000 trauma victims worldwide could be saved each year if they were given access to a cheap , widely available , and easily administered medication , a study shows .
Experts involved in the CRASH - 2 study say that tranexamic acid ( TXA ) , which reduces the rate of blood - clot breakdown , is so effective it should be included on the World Health Organization ( WHO ) list of essential medicines .
Injuries are a leading cause of death worldwide .
Etienne Krug , MD , director of violence and injury prevention and disability at the World Health Organization , said at a news conference that " 5.8 million die every year from injuries .
This is much more than HIV , TB , and malaria deaths combined . "
Of those deaths , more than 2 million die as a result of road traffic injuries , making it the ninth leading cause of death globally .
About 1.6 million die from violence , warfare , and suicide .
Furthermore , hemorrhage is responsible for about a third of in - hospital trauma deaths , as well as contributing to deaths from multi-organ failure .
" Each year about 600,000 injured patients bleed to death worldwide , " said chief investigator Ian Roberts , professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , in a statement .
Researchers carried out a trial involving more than 20,000 adult patients in 274 hospitals across 40 countries .
Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 1 gram of TXA by injection followed by another 1 gram in a drip over the following eight hours , or a matching placebo .
The researchers studied the numbers of deaths in hospitals within four weeks of injury .
They discovered that TXA reduced the risk of death by any cause by 10 % compared with those who received the placebo ; 14.5 % of patients in the TXA group died compared with 16 % in the placebo group .
Although the research team was concerned that TXA might increase the risk of complications , such as heart attacks , strokes , and clots in the lungs , they said that the results of CRASH - 2 showed that TXA reduces death from bleeding without any increase in these complications .
" The good news was we did n't see any evidence of increase [ in unwanted clotting ] at all , " Roberts told the press conference .
" In fact , we saw some decrease in the risk . "
DETROIT -- Prison can be tough on the gums .
A former Michigan inmate who claims he was denied toothpaste for nearly a year can sue prison officials , tooth his constitutional right against cruel and unusual punishment , a federal appeals court said .
Jerry Flanory , of Flint , says he developed gum disease and had a tooth removed in 2006 as a result of no toothpaste .
The appeals court reinstated his lawsuit Thursday against officials at the Newberry prison in Michigan 's Upper Peninsula .
" This court has found dental health to be of great importance , " a three - judge panel said , citing a past decision from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals .
Flanory , 58 , said the problem was related to a dispute over his education .
He refused to participate in classes toward a GED , or general equivalent degree , because he already had one .
In fact , he also had an associate degree from a community college .
Flanory was disciplined by losing his indigent status at Newberry prison , which meant he had to pay for his own toothpaste .
He said he could n't afford it .
Nearly a year later , in fall 2005 , Flanory 's associate degree was finally confirmed by the prison .
By then , he already had gum disease , and a tooth on the bottom left side was later removed .
The lack of " toothpaste for 337 days and resulting health problems amount to more than a mere inconvenience or a harmless deprivation of hygiene products , " the appeals court said .
Flanory , who is acting as his own lawyer and is seeking at least $ 350,000 in damages , has been on parole since December after serving five years in prison for assault .
His home phone was not answered Friday .
Michigan prisons spokesman John Cordell said he was not familiar with the case " but it sounds like an anomaly . "
The lawsuit now returns to a federal judge in Marquette , who dismissed it as frivolous in 2009 .
Ryanair is to pay a dividend to shareholders for the first time since it floated on the stock market in 1997 .
The company says it plans to distribute € 500 m to shareholders .
The airline also reported a more than 200 % increase in after tax profits for last year , to €319 m , for its financial year to the end of March , which was ahead of analyst expectations .
The airline made a pre-tax profit of € 341 m compared to a loss of € 180 m last year .
The massive jump in profits came on a revenue increase of just 2 % to just under € 3bn .
The airline also said it expected air fares to increase by between 5 % and 10 % this year , after a fall of 13 % last year .
During its financial year , Ryanair carried 66.5 m passengers , up 14 % on its previous year .
Explaining the figures , the airline said that while ticket prices had fallen 13 % , its costs fell by almost one fifth because of lower fuel and tighter cost control .
Ryanair said it was proud to have delivered such a huge growth in profits during a global recession and while many of its competitors were announcing losses or going bust .
The airline said traffic had fallen at many European airports because of the recession and it was being ' inundated with offers from large and small airports competing with lower costs and efficient facilities to win Ryanair 's growth ' .
With the exception of Dublin and Standsted , Ryanair said the costs of using airports had fallen giving an average airport and handling cost reduction of 9 % .
The volcanic ash cloud from Iceland led to the cancellation of 9,400 Ryanair flights and the loss of up to 1.5 m passengers up to 18 May .
Ryanair said in the 18 days from the middle of April there were ' repeated , unnecessary , closures of large swathes of European airspace ' .
It said the full cost of the cancellations would not be known for some time as it was expecting compensation claims under what the airline said were ' disproportionate and discriminatory ' EU regulations .
Ryanair said it did not believe that the airline should be exposed to such unlimited liability .
It pointed out that EU 261 legislation does not cap the quantum or the period air passengers can claim for .
The airline said it had ended discussions on an aircraft order with Boeing and arising from that would generate surplus cash up to the end of its 2013 financial year .
Ryanair said that facilitated a once off dividend in October , subject to shareholder approval , worth € 500m .
It said a further dividend may be paid before the end of its 2013 financial year .
Ryanair said it expected to grow traffic by 11 % this year , the volcano permitting , but fuel costs would increase by €300m .
It said airfares would rise by between 5 % and 10 % this year .
All going well , it said that profits this year would rise by between 10 % and 15 % to a range of between €350 m and € 375m .
There ’s a common misconception that the GM handles all the plotting and storytelling in a game .
While majority of the load does fall on his shoulders , there ’s also quite a lot of opportunities for players to actually take the reins and lend direction to where a game is going .
Proactive and enthusiastic players can contribute by pushing their own respective agendas , and taking time off to tell the GM before or after the session to remind him of what they intend to do .
Here are a few ways that Players can encourage the GM to pursue subplots revolving around your characters .
If you ’re interested in something pursue it – As long as it can be rationalized in - character , there ’s plenty of opportunities to make a passing comment grow into something more .
– As long as it can be rationalized in - character , there ’s plenty of opportunities to make a passing comment grow into something more .
Pay attention to your character ’s motivations – Everyone has something that interests them , or gets them to move .

Involve other players –
The more opportunities you have to bring other player characters along to get involved with your stories , the more incentive the GM has to work it into the game .
As with all things , communication is yet again key .
Tell your GM that you ’d like to get your character to do something , or go through a particular scenario .
Who knows , he might just pull it out and use it in the game .
We GMs are n’t exactly geniuses in everything , and sometimes , even if we love the character concepts , we occasionally draw blanks when it comes to plotting for a specific character .
Take note that this is n’t a technique to steal the spotlight , but one that will help the GM think of plots , further your character ’s interests , and make the game more enjoyable for you and , hopefully , everyone else .
The crisis in U.S. public education is beginning to read like something out of the theater of the absurd .
Now they are getting rid of summer school .
The Associated Press reported Sunday : “ Across the country , districts are cutting summer school because it ’s just too expensive to keep .
The cuts started when the recession began and have worsened , affecting more children and more essential programs that help struggling students . ”
A survey found that over one - third of the school districts in the country are looking at cutting out summer school starting this fall .
And who are the students who will be hit hardest by this move ?
“ Experts say studies show summer break tends to widen the achievement gap between poor students and their more affluent peers whose parents can more easily afford things like educational
vacations , camps and sports teams , ” said AP .
“ Most people generally think summer is a great time for kids to be kids , a time for something different , a time for all kinds of exploration and enrichment , ” Ron Fairchild , chief executive officer of the National Summer Learning Association , told the news agency .
“ Our mythology about summer learning really runs counter to the reality of what this really is like for kids in low - income communities and for their families when this faucet of public support shuts off . ”
The same day this news was broadcast , the New York Times magazine ran a lengthy front - page article about the ongoing efforts to confront the teachers unions and pictured classroom instructors as the impediment to improving the quality of education .
At the same time , ironically , the cartoonist Jeff Danziger drew a classroom where two heavies are dragging a teacher out the door while proclaiming : “ Good news , we figured out what was costing so much about public education . ”
In the background , someone is hooking up a video monitor .
It remains a mystery to me that an administration that can spend millions of dollars to bribe states into facilitating its quite controversial school “ reform ” programs can’t come up with the resources to stave off the pending mass layoffs of teachers .
It ca n’t be that the White House has adopted the reactionaries ’ tactic of starving public education until it falls to privatization .
Education Secretary Arne Duncan appears to be genuinely alarmed at the economic crisis in public education .
“ The cuts come even as President Barack Obama and Education Secretary Arne Duncan call for longer school days and shorter summer breaks , ” observed AP .
“ But in many states , districts cutting summer school outnumber those using stimulus money to expand their offerings . ”
“ At a time when we need to work harder to close achievement gaps and prepare every child for college and career , cutting summer school is the wrong way to go , ” Duncan told reporters .
“ These kids need more time , not less . ”
The question that arises in my mind is , why , at this point in time , go after the teachers unions and appear impotent in the face of the school budget slashers and the Neanderthals on Capitol Hill ?
There is legislation before Congress to provide some emergency funding to diminish the impact of the teacher layoffs – now projected to be as many as 300,000 – but it ’s not getting much media attention .
While in New York last week , Duncan issued a plea for Congress to act but that hardly rated any mention in the major media , overshadowed as it was by the ongoing controversy about charter schools .
The administration can hardly be said to be building public support for congressional action and it ’s clear at least some of the Republicans will oppose it .
Some politicians can become virtual “ chicken littles ” when it comes to the federal budget deficit and church mice when the subject is the future of education .
At the risk of repeating myself I have to ask : why is it that the richest , most powerful nation on the planet , one that produces more and more billionaires each year and can spend one million dollars each on the soldiers it sends off to war , ca n’t afford to educate its kids ?
Make no mistake about it , a campaign is under way to radically alter the country ’s educational system – from kindergarten to graduate school – as surely as there is a coordinated effort to diminish or eliminate Medicare and Social Security .
Starving schools is part of it .
Right now , we ’re being softened up for the kill .
“ Economists have been keeping close watch on the states ’ problems and now the chief economist of one of the country ’s largest banks is weighing in , ” said San Francisco television KGO reporter David Louie .
He interviewed John Silvia , chief economist at Wells Fargo , who he says warned that “ more pain is ahead . ”
It is time , Silva told Louie , for state and local government to live within its means .
He then went on to talk about the sacrifices needed , observing : “ You think about the cost of educating a student at university compared to the tuition they ’re paying .
There ’s a huge subsidy there . ”
Subsidy ?
Since when was paying for public education a subsidy ?
Well , it ’s easy to see where this is going .
Lower income and minority students are already being priced out of the system by escalating tuition and the opportunities provided by the alternative community college system are being sharply curtailed .
“ We ’re going to have to look at state benefits for pubic workers .
We ’re going to have to look at retiree benefits , ” said the banker .
“ How generous are these ?
Can these benefits be here in the 21st century ? ”
Two prominent California educators had something more worthy and relevant to say about the outlook for the next 100 years .
Writing in the San Francisco Chronicle , Henry T. Yang , chancellor of UC Santa Barbara , and chair of the Association of American Universities , and David Marshall , executive dean of the College of Letters and Science and dean of Humanities and Fine Arts at UC Santa Barbara , wrote , “ If public education has been an engine of class mobility , helping to create a middle class , then it benefits the public more than it benefits individuals .
Public education provides the educated workforce that is vital to the state ’s economy , and it produces graduates with the creativity to sustain and renew California ’s economic competitiveness .
A UC liberal arts education prepares students to be citizens in 21st - century global California . ”
“ California ’s elected leaders would do well to remember [ George ] Washington ’s words about ‘ a flourishing state of the arts and sciences . ’
In today ’s knowledge - based economy , the threat to the University of California and the state ’s Master Plan for Higher Education is a threat to California ’s prosperity and reputation .
At a time when California ’s economic future depends on producing more college graduates and better - educated citizens , the state must invest in public education .
As Washington knew , both democracy and prosperity depend on it . ”
We should be clear : education per se is not threatened .
What is being undermined is the democratic concept of equal education , the idea that all children should start off on equal footing .
Schools will continue to exist and quality instruction provided ; the danger is that it will increasingly be available to those who can afford to pay for it and restricted for those who cannot .
What the deficit hawks and some of the “ reformers ” are saying is : we can no longer afford to give quality education to all of y’all .

Barton ’s Greatest Hits : Wind Power Might Mess Up Global Wind Patterns and Make the Earth Warmer
Created : September 18 , 2009 14:55 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Speaking of Rep. Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) — who apparently is weighing a run for the Senate seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - Texas ) — Kate just passed along the all - time money - est Barton quote ever ( and that ’s saying something ) about how wind power might aggravate climate change .
From a March 10 House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing :
Wind is God ’s way of balancing heat .
Wind is the way you shift heat from areas where it ’s hotter to areas where it ’s cooler .
That ’s what wind is .
Would n’t it be ironic if in the interest of global warming we mandated massive switches to energy , which is a finite resource , which slows the winds down , which causes the temperature to go up ?
Now , I ’m not saying that ’s going to happen , Mr. Chairman , but that is definitely something on the massive scale .
I mean , it does make some sense .
You stop something , you ca n’t transfer that heat , and the heat goes up .
It ’s just something to think about .
This man was once the chairman of the committee , which this year passed the Waxman - Markey climate bill .
Palestinians hang their flag on a fence surrounding an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank .
( Luay Sababa / MaanImages )
One might expect that any support for a single state among Israeli Jews would come from the far left , and in fact this is where the most prominent Israeli Jewish champions of the idea are found , though in small numbers .
Recently , proposals to grant Israeli citizenship to Palestinians in the West Bank , including the right to vote for the Knesset , have emerged from a surprising direction : right - wing stalwarts such as Knesset speaker Reuven Rivlin , and former defense minister Moshe Arens , both from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s Likud party .
Even more surprising , the idea has been pushed by prominent activists among Israel ’s West Bank settler movement , who were the subject of a must - read profile by Noam Sheizaf in Haaretz ( “ Endgame , ” 15 July 2010 ) .
Their visions still fall far short of what any Palestinian advocate of a single state would consider to be just : the Israeli proposals insist on maintaining the state ’s character — at least symbolically — as a “ Jewish state , ” exclude the Gaza Strip , and do not address the rights of Palestinian refugees .
And , settlers on land often violently expropriated from Palestinians would hardly seem like obvious advocates for Palestinian human and political rights .
Although the details vary , and in some cases are anathema to Palestinians , what is more revealing is that this debate is occurring openly and in the least likely circles .
The Likudnik and settler advocates of a one - state solution with citizenship for Palestinians realize that Israel has lost the argument that Jewish sovereignty can be maintained forever at any price .
A status quo where millions of Palestinians live without rights , subject to control by escalating Israeli violence is untenable even for them .
At the same time repartition of historic Palestine — what they call Eretz Yisrael — into two states is unacceptable , and has proven unattainable — not least because of the settler movement itself .
Some on the Israeli right now recognize what Israeli geographer Meron Benvenisti has said for years : historic Palestine is already a “ de facto binational state , ” unpartionable except at a cost neither Israelis nor Palestinians are willing to pay .
The relationship between Palestinians and Israelis is not that of equals however , but that “ between horse and rider ” as one settler vividly put it in Haaretz .
From the settlers ’ perspective , repartition would mean an uprooting of at least tens of thousands of the 500,000 settlers now in the West Bank , and it would not even solve the national question .
Would the settlers remaining behind in the West Bank ( the vast majority under all current two - state proposals ) be under Palestinian sovereignty or would Israel continue to exercise control over a network of settlements criss - crossing the putative Palestinian state ?
How could a truly independent Palestinian state exist under such circumstances ?
The graver danger is that the West Bank would turn into a dozen Gaza Strips with large Israeli civilian populations wedged between miserable , overcrowded walled Palestinian ghettos .
The patchwork Palestinian state would be free only to administer its own poverty , visited by regular bouts of bloodshed .
Even a full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank — something that is not remotely on the peace process agenda — would leave Israel with 1.5 million Palestinian citizens inside its borders .
This population already faces escalating discrimination , incitement and loyalty tests .
In an angry , ultra - nationalist Israel shrunken by the upheaval of abandoning West Bank settlements , these non-Jewish citizens could suffer much worse , including outright ethnic cleansing .
With no progress toward a two - state solution despite decades of efforts , the only Zionist alternative on offer has been outright expulsion of the Palestinians — a program long - championed by Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman ’s Yisrael Beitenu party , which has seen its support increase steadily .
Israel is at the point where it has to look in the mirror and even some cold , hard Likudniks like Arens apparently do n’t like what they see .
Yisrael Beitenu ’s platform is “ nonsensical , ” Arens told Haaretz , and simply not “ doable . ”
If Israel feels it is a pariah now , what would happen after another mass expulsion of Palestinians ?
Given these realities , “ The worst solution … is apparently the right one : a binational state , full annexation , full citizenship ” in the words of settler activist and former Netanyahu aide Uri Elitzur .
This awakening can be likened to what happened among South African whites in the 1980s .
By that time it had become clear that the white minority government ’s effort to “ solve ” the problem of black disenfranchisement by creating nominally independent homelands — bantustans — had failed .
Pressure was mounting from internal resistance and the international campaign of boycott , divestment and sanctions .
By the mid-1980s , whites overwhelmingly understood that the apartheid status quo was untenable and they began to consider “ reform ” proposals that fell very far short of the African National Congress ’ demands for a universal franchise — one - person , one - vote in a nonracial South Africa .
The reforms began with the 1984 introduction of a tricameral parliament with separate chambers for whites , coloreds and Indians ( none for blacks ) , with whites retaining overall control .
Until almost the end of the apartheid system , polls showed the vast majority of whites rejected a universal franchise , but were prepared to concede some form of power - sharing with the black majority as long as whites retained a veto over key decisions .
The important point , as I have argued previously , is that one could not predict the final outcome of the negotiations that eventually brought about a fully democratic South Africa in 1994 , based on what the white public and elites said they were prepared to accept ( “ Israeli Jews and the one - state solution , ” The Electronic Intifada , 10 November 2009 ) .
Once Israeli Jews concede that Palestinians must have equal rights , they will not be able to unilaterally impose any system that maintains undue privilege .
A joint state should accommodate Israeli Jews ’ legitimate collective interests , but it would have to do so equally for everyone else .
The very appearance of the right - wing one - state solution suggests Israel is feeling the pressure and experiencing a relative loss of power .
If its proponents thought Israel could “ win ” in the long - term there would be no need to find ways to accommodate Palestinian rights .
But Israeli Jews see their moral currency and legitimacy drastically devalued worldwide , while demographically Palestinians are on the verge of becoming a majority once again in historic Palestine .
Of course Israeli Jews still retain an enormous power advantage over Palestinians which , while eroding , is likely to last for some time .
Israel ’s main advantage is a near monopoly on the means of violence , guaranteed by the United States .
But legitimacy and stability cannot be gained by reliance on brute force — this is the lesson that is starting to sink in among some Israelis as the country is increasingly isolated after its attacks on Gaza and the Gaza Freedom Flotilla .
Legitimacy can only come from a just and equitable political settlement .
Perhaps the right - wing proponents of a single state recognize that the best time to negotiate a transition which provides safeguards for Israeli Jews ’ legitimate collective interests is while they are still relatively strong .
That proposals for a single state are coming from the Israeli right should not be so surprising in light of experiences in comparable situations .
In South Africa , it was not the traditional white liberal critics of apartheid who oversaw the system ’s dismantling , but the National Party which had built apartheid in the first place .
In Northern Ireland , it was not “ moderate ” unionists and nationalists like David Trimble and John Hume who finally made power - sharing under the 1998 Belfast Agreement function , but the long - time rejectionists of Ian Paisley ’s Democratic Unionist Party , and the nationalist Sinn Fein , whose leaders had close ties the IRA .
The experiences in South Africa and Northern Ireland show that transforming the relationship between settler and native , master and slave , or “ horse and rider , ” to one between equal citizens is a very difficult , uncertain and lengthy process .
There are many setbacks and detours along the way and success is not guaranteed .
It requires much more than a new constitution ; economic redistribution , restitution and restorative justice are essential and meet significant resistance .
But such a transformation is not , as many of the critics of a one - state solution in Palestine / Israel insist , “ impossible . ”
Indeed , hope now resides in the space between what is “ very difficult ” and what is considered “ impossible . ”
The proposals from the Israeli right - wing , however inadequate and indeed offensive they seem in many respects , add a little bit to that hope .
They suggest that even those whom Palestinians understandably consider their most implacable foes can stare into the abyss and decide there has to be a radically different way forward .
We should watch how this debate develops and engage and encourage it carefully .
In the end it is not what the solution is called that matters , but whether it fulfills the fundamental and inalienable rights of all Palestinians .

A balk by Esmerling Vasquez allowed Casey Blake to score the winning run in the bottom of the ninth , giving the Dodgers a 5 - 4 victory Monday night .
The inning began with a walk to James Loney and a broken - bat single by Blake .
Loney made a break for third base with Augie Ojeda charging in for a possible bunt , but was tagged out in a rundown after Ojeda retreated back toward the bag .
" I do n't know what he was thinking , " Dodgers manager Joe Torre said .
" We had some good momentum going and that play just took the wind out of our sails . "
Russell Martin worked the count to 2 - 2 before second base umpire Tim Tschida signaled balk after some frantic gyrations by Blake and Dodgers third base coach Larry Bowa .
Blake removed his helmet and jogged home .
" I saw what he did , " Arizona manager A.J. Hinch said .
" He flinched , both of his legs buckled , and he balked .
It was pretty plain and simple to see , so I did n't talk to anybody . "
Jonathan Broxton ( 3 - 0 ) pitched the ninth to earn the victory .
Starter Chad Billingsley was watching the game in the video room when he saw Vasquez 's balk .
" That was quite a ninth inning and quite a way to win the game , " he said .
Vasquez ( 0 - 1 ) took the loss .
The last - place Diamondbacks dropped their season - high eighth in a row .
" This team sorely needs a win , and losing this way is just excruciating , " Hinch said .
The last time a game was won on a balk was Sept. 9 , 2008 , when Taylor Buccholz of Colorado balked in Kelly Johnson of Atlanta in the 10th inning , according to Stats LLC .
Johnson is now with the Diamondbacks .
Rodrigo Lopez took a four - hitter and a 4 - 2 lead into the eighth , when the Dodgers tied the game on a double error by Johnson .
He booted a grounder by Andre Ethier in the hole and then threw it past first base , allowing Rafael Furcal , who singled , and Matt Kemp , who doubled , to score .
" He made an error at a really bad time .
He 's been very sure - handed and he 's done a nice job for us , " Hinch said .
" It 's a killer . "
Ethier returned to the Dodgers after missing the previous 15 games because of a broken right pinkie finger .
He went 0 for 4 playing with a splint on the finger and a foam pad near the knob of the bat for cushioning .
" It 's timing , " Torre said .
" His rhythm is n't there right now .
I thought he was trying to pull the ball a little bit more . "
The Diamondbacks got the go - ahead run on second in the ninth with one out against Broxton , but he struck out Adam LaRoche and Chris Young to end the inning .
Justin Upton 's two - run homer off Billingsley gave Arizona a 2 - 0 lead in the first .
The ball hit the top of the right field wall and went over .
Arizona added two runs in the second on solo homers by Young and Chris Snyder , with both going into left field .
" I got some fastballs up and they got it in the air and they left the ballpark .
You can't do anything about it , " Billingsley said .
" Even after those two innings , I still knew I had good stuff , so I stayed with my game plan and just kept being aggressive . "
Manny Ramirez led off the fourth with his 550th career homer , leaving the Dodgers trailing 4 - 1 .
It was his second homer in as many nights and just his second since April 15 .
The Dodgers ' second run came on Kemp 's RBI single in the third .
Lopez allowed six hits and four runs in eight innings , while striking out four and walking one .
" We lucked out , " Torre said .
" Lopez pitched a hell of a ballgame . "
Billingsley gave up four runs and six hits in eight innings .
He struck out a season - high 11 and walked none .
The right - hander was erratic while facing his first 13 batters , a stretch in which he gave up a double and three homers and struck out seven .

Stage 3 of the Tour de France from Wanze to Arenberg Porte du Hainaut was full of mixed emotions for the Schleck brothers and their Saxo Bank team .
The Danish squad regained the yellow jersey through Fabian Cancellara , while Andy Schleck took vital time out of all but one of his GC rivals .
However , Andy Schleck 's older brother Fränk crashed out of the race with a broken collarbone .
Andy Schleck now sits 6th overall , with Cadel Evans ( BMC Racing Team ) 28 seconds ahead and Alberto Contador ( Astana ) , Lance Armstrong ( RadioShack ) both trailing the Luxembourg rider .
The loss of Fränk , who recently won the Tour de Suisse and who was touted as a possible Tour winner , will be a huge blow for the team when the race enters the mountains .
Last year the brothers were never far from each other 's side , often taking turns to attack eventual winner Alberto Contador .
Andy finished second overall in Paris and Fränk fifth .
While Fränk was taken to hospital it was up to Andy to talk to the press outside the team bus , clearly upset by the day 's events .
" It 's not nice to lose a teammate , especially my brother , but I just hope it 's the collarbone .
I do n't really care if he 's in the race or not .
I just want him to be okay , that 's most important , " he said .
" We knew it was going to split up and the goal for me was to stay on Fabian 's wheel .
The Tour is n't decided today and there 's still the Pyrenees and the Alps to come .
" Everyone said that Schleck was too light to go over the cobblestones and I showed them that I can do pretty good . "
With Fränk out of the Tour , the Saxo Bank arsenal is irreparably damaged ahead of the mountains .
However , Andy was quick to add that the team 's aggressive style of racing wo n't change .
Tour de France debutant Jakob Fuglsang will now step up and act as Andy 's closest ally in the mountains .
" The tactics wo n't change .
I 've said it before and I 'll say it again when this stage was over I was going to cross it off and tonight I 'll have a beer and take it easy tomorrow , " he said before escaping to the team bus .
Teammate Matti Breschel was one of the Saxo Bank riders who waited for Fränk when he crashed .
" We did a really good job and showed that we were the strongest team and if Fränk had n't crashed we could have been pretty satisfied , " said Fuglsang .
" That 's what we wanted .
To take the jersey , try and win a stage and not lose time with Fränk and Andy .
We almost pulled it off .
" I stopped and tried to help Fränk but he was pretty damaged .
He was in shock and it was total chaos . "
Another teammate , Stuart O'Grady , rolled over the line in a group containing Armstrong and Mark Cavendish .
" It 's devastating for the team , " said O'Grady .
" It 's bike racing and it 's been carnage every stage so far and today was the cherry on the cake .
There 's nothing to do , you have to continue racing .
We had a plan and that was to get everyone over the finish line in one piece and take the yellow back .
We did part of that and we 'll dedicate yellow to Fränk . "
TLAXIACO , Mexico  Gabino Cué is running for governor of Oaxaca State as the candidate for so many parties that his campaign is handing out a pamphlet explaining how to mark the ballot .
In simple cartoons , the drawings promise voters that Mr. Cué will kick out the party that has governed Oaxaca for 80 years and clean up the state .
A decade ago , Mexico ended more than 70 years of control by the Institutional Revolutionary Party and elected an opposition president .
But in Oaxaca , the PRI , as the party is known , has held fast through a vast party machine that dispenses patronage and often seems accountable to no one except the governor .
The other parties believe that the only way to dislodge the PRI here is to unite across ideological lines against it .
Mr. Cué is the candidate for a coalition of the conservative National Action Party and the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution , along with a couple of small parties .
Image caption Scientists believe robots might soon replace people in the search for landmines
UK scientists claim to have developed laser technology able to sense hidden explosives .
The technology could help to detect landmines and roadside bombs and to improve airport security .
The team from University of St Andrews produced a laser by " pumping " a type of plastic called polyfluorene with photons from another light source .
They found the laser reacted with vapours from explosives such as TNT .
The work was published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials .
Graham Turnbull , a physicist at the University of St Andrew 's in Fife , UK , is one of the authors of the study .
He explained that the researchers created a mechanism able to sense TNT - like molecules frequently used in explosives at extremely low concentrations - less than 10 parts per billion .
" Floating above a landmine in Iraq or Afghanistan , there 's a very weak , dilute cloud of vapours of explosive molecules that the bomb is made from , " said the Dr Turnbull .
Essentially it 's making an artificial nose for a robot dog Dr Graham Turnbull , University of St Andrews
" A small number of these TNT - like molecules comes into contact with a plastic film that the laser is ( produced ) from , interacts with the light - emitting molecules in the laser and switches off the light emission . "
The scientist explained that this interaction of TNT - like molecules with the polymer chain provides a totally new way to stop the laser from working .
Ifor Samuel , Dr Turnbull 's colleague and a co-athor of the study , said that once developed , such mechanisms could sense any kind of explosive device - including roadside bombs - a major issue in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" This technology is important because polymer lasers , since they 're made of plastic , could be made very easily and because it's a very new property for a laser to have , " he said .

The plastic laser approach could detect lower concentrations of explosive
This sort of technique has been looked at in the past .
But this is the first time researchers have used a polyfluorene plastic laser , said Dr Turnbull .
This allows the detection of much lower concentrations of explosive vapours , he added .
The scientist believes that one of the ways to use this type of laser would be to have it on a robotic , perhaps remotely controlled , vehicle that would be able to " sniff around " in a mine field , looking for vapour clouds .
" On a dusty road in Afghanistan there are relatively few things that might give you a false positive and it certainly could have potential in that area .
Essentially it 's making an artificial nose for a robot dog , " said Dr Turnbull .
He also suggested using the system as a means to improve airport security , to detect explosive vapours coming from people 's luggage .
One of the selling points of plastic lasers is that they 're expected to be relatively low cost , as polyfluorene is widely available , added the scientist .

The HB - SIA aeroplane will eventually give way to an even bigger vehicle
Pilot Andre Borschberg has announced he is postponing an attempt to make aviation history because of a technical problem .
He had planned to take off from a Swiss airfield in a solar - powered plane and fly through the night .
The plane would need to generate enough energy through the day to sustain its battery - driven engines at night .
One of the aeroplane 's inventors , Bertrand Piccard , said the pilot would have to wait for a part from the US .
' Solar future '
The HB - SIA aeroplane , which has 12,000 solar cells , is the latest step in the Solar Impulse project , which Mr Borschberg leads with his business partner and fellow adventurer , Dr Piccard .
It was to have taken off from Payerne in the west of Switzerland in an attempt to fly for 24 hours .
Robotic craft have achieved this feat before now , but never a manned one .
Image caption Borschberg ( L ) and Piccard have worked on the project for seven years
" We had to take the decision to postpone the take off to another day , " Dr Piccard said .
Dr Piccard famously made the first non-stop circumnavigation of the globe in a balloon in 1999 .
The pair want to prove that solar power has a practical future in aviation and , more generally , in powering society at large .
The HB - SIA has the look of a glider but is on the scale - in terms of its width - of a modern airliner .
The aeroplane incorporates composite materials to keep it extremely light , and uses super - efficient solar cells , batteries , motors and propellers to keep itself in the sky .
The vehicle was unveiled last year and has since been undergoing daylight trials .
The first full day flight was completed on 7 April .
The HB - SIA will be succeeded by HB - SIB .
It is likely to be bigger , and will incorporate a pressurised capsule and better avionics .
The group plans to use this vehicle in two years ' time to make the first manned transatlantic solar flight , followed in 2013 by an even more daring circumnavigation of the Earth .
Oasis recorded a version of The Beatles ' hit I Am The Walrus Liam Gallagher is set to make a film about the final years of The Beatles .
The former Oasis frontman is planning to adapt The Longest Cocktail Party , a memoir written by the Beatles ' " house hippy " in the 1960s , Richard DiLello .
The biopic is about the " wild rise and fall " of the band 's record company Apple between the heady days of 1968 and the break - up in 1970 .
The singer 's older brother Noel is also said to be a fan of the book , describing it as " brilliant " .
Liam Gallagher 's film company , In 1 Productions , will work with UK Independent Revolution Films .
A spokesman for In 1 Productions said : " This will be a film with humour and affection , providing an insider 's look at what it meant to be a young man caught up in the wild swirl of the music business , celebrities and the tail end of the swinging 60s in London . "
The Gallagher brothers have made no secret of their love for The Beatles .
For their album The Masterplan , the band covered the popular Beatles hit I Am The Walrus and to celebrate 40 years since the release of Sgt Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , they recorded a version of Within You Without You .
While promoting that album , Noel said : " The Beatles were of their time ... you can't compare a band from today with one from the 1960s .
Music does n't mean as much today as it did in the 1960s . "
Oasis broke up in 2009 after Noel quit the band , saying he could no longer work with Liam .

The Golden Age of the Mayas was between the 3rd and the 4th centuries .
Their script was
considered the most advanced in the Americas , and was used for writing medical , botanical and astronomy texts .
This script used a sign called a glyph to indicate each word or each syllable .
Ramzy Barrois , a French archaeologist , has brought a series of hyroglyphics back from South America to Paris in order to study them .
But Mayan cities were n’t always in contact with each other so scripts evolved differently .
Today , around 80 % of the glyphs used have been deciphered , but the rest remain a mystery .
He said “ If you take account of both distance and chronology , you get large variations in the glyphs .
Sometimes you look at two symbols which are really similar , but a beginner will think that they are n’t at all alike , that they have nothing in common .
But they have !
They are the same glyph – just with 500 years of evolution between them . ”
With new technologies like the internet , Mayan script specialists from all over the world have made a giant leap forward .
They now have software to help them decipher the glyphs .
Dr Daniel Gatica - Perez , ( from the IDIAP Research Institute , in Martigny , Switzerland ) : “ People who are exploring ancient Maya culture – in order to try to find glyphs , they usually use catalogues and this is a classic catalogue .
It ’s like a telephone book .
Instead of names what we have are essentially glyphs and this is a very large collection .
And , essentially , if you do n’t have computational means to find a glyph you do n’t know or a glyph you are learning about , you probably have to parse all of these manually .
And this can be time consuming . ”
These three engineers have built a search engine which can decipher Mayan script .
Edgar Francisco Roman Rangel , a research assistant at IDIAP said : “ You can manually select a part of this inscription , as you can see here .
Then the system – the “ glyphfinder ” – looks for the most similar glyphs that it can find .
So based on the glyphs that it already knows it tries to recognize the others . ”
Dr Daniel Gatica - Perez said : “ Well the content is very challenging ; the variation of shape that one finds in the glyphs is really really astonishing .
And even though the research recently has made a lot of progress , it is still quite challenging trying to teach a computer to identify or to discriminate between shapes that are very similar . ”
To build a search engine you have to assemble a data base .
So archaeologists in the field photograph each glyph in relief .
Then a designer reproduces them before they ’re sent to Switzerland .
It ’s a Titanic task , but archaeologists hope it will help them decipher the 100 or so symbols which are still unknown .
Carlos Pallan Gayol , an archaeologist at the National Institute of Anthropology and History said : “ We are very excited that the new technology can help us to tackle this problem .
One of the main conditions of decipherment is to isolate a set of occurrences of any given problematic sign within the script .
So we think that with this technology we can do that job more efficiently .
So we are very excited by that potential as well . ”
Thanks to this new technology , research is taking great leaps forward and archaeologists hope to illuminate the remaining mysteries of this great civilization .

As the financial climate tightens knowledge becomes power when it comes to securing the credit deals you want .
The best start is by understanding the impact your credit history and rating has on the type of offer you may receive and whether you will receive an offer for credit at all .
Your credit report contains your full credit history .
It details credit cards , loans , mortgages and other various credit accounts , your repayment track record and other information such as bad debts , Individual Voluntary Arrangements ( IVAs ) and bankruptcies .
Lenders use this information , along with details from the application you submit to decide whether there ’s a good chance that you ’ll repay what you plan to borrow and will owe , so it ’s vital to understand what items will and wo n’t influence them .
You can see the information lenders see when deciding whether or not to give you credit .
You can view a Free Experian Credit Report within a trial period
Here are the top 10 Credit Myths – and the reality behind them .
1. I maybe on a credit agencies ’ blacklist
No , you could n’t – they do n’t exist .
Your credit rating does n’t take account of the area where you live , your race , ethnic origin , religion or gender .
However , factors lenders do consider include your repayment history and how much you already owe .
Essentially , they want to be sure that you are n’t taking on more debt and credit that you can comfortably manage .
2. Previous occupants of my address can affect my credit rating
Nowadays it makes no difference to your credit rating if the previous occupant of your home was a multi-millionaire or made bankrupt as long as you never shared a financial connection .
Most lenders are only interested in your ability to repay them on time and in full .
They much prefer to see stability and if you ’ve recently moved they will almost certainly want to know your previous address ( es ) , so they can refer back .
3 . You can only have one credit score
Each individual lender uses its own method to formulate their credit scores and some choose to use a different formula for different credit products , such as mortgages , loans and credit cards .
So it is possible that you could get three different credit scores if you made three seperate applications in a single day .
Your credit history also changes over time as your personal circumstances change .
For e.g. missing a few repayments on a loan or credit card could lower how you are scored , whilst paying off an existing debt as planned could give your rating a boost .
4 . Past debts do n’t count within my credit rating
Unfortunately for many , they do .
Court judgments for non-payment of debts , Individual Voluntary Arrangements ( IVAs ) and bankruptcies stay on your credit report for at least six years .
Even one missed repayment is recorded for at least 36 months .
Lenders will see these and it may count against you because they could see it as an indicator that you will miss payments with them in the future too .
5. Credit reference agencies help make lending decisions
Credit reference agencies compile and hold your credit report securely ; they do n’t use the information to make lending decisions .
Lenders use the credit report data to help make decisions and perhaps score your application , each using a unique set of criteria to make a decision .
With CreditExpert you can see your Experian Credit Score , based on your current credit rating .
This will give you a good indication of how lenders will see you .
See the information lenders see .
6 . It makes no difference how many credit accounts you have
Lenders want to be sure that you can afford the credit they provide you .
They prefer it if you do not already owe large amounts on multiple accounts .
They may even take into account the amount you could borrow against your existing credit limits , so it ’s sometimes best to close down unused accounts and limit the number of new applications you make .
You are well advised not to fire off random credit applications as these will be registered on your credit report .
Ask for quotations before you formally apply and these will only be seen by you on your credit report .
If it looks as if you ’re trying to borrow a lot in a short period of time , lenders may consider you are desperate for money or even suspect fraud .
7 . If you have never borrowed and owe no money , you will get the best deals
You would think that someone with no history of debt or credit would be attractive to lenders though the reverse is often true .
Lenders want you to have and see a history of making repayments on time and in full .
If you have never borrowed or taken credit they have no way of knowing how you ’ll make payments in the future and could even reject you .
They would often rather see a credit report showing a few well managed loans or credit cards with regular , reliable repayments .
8 . Repaying your credit cards in full depresses your credit score
This urban myth is also complete nonsense .
Making repayments in full every month is likely to result in an improved credit score because it demonstrates you can afford your borrowings .
You ’re more likely to get a lower score if you make late payments and let interest and your total debt increase .
9 . Friends and family living at my home can affect my credit rating
Unless you share a joint financial connection with any of them for example a mortgage friends and family will have no effect on your credit rating .
If you do have a joint account or have made joint credit applications , their name will be listed in your credit report under Financial associations .
When you apply for new credit , lenders may look at your financial associate ’s credit report as well , as their circumstances may affect your ability to make repayments .
10 .
Items in your credit history stay on file forever
Your credit report is designed to give lenders a good picture of your recent and current position .
They are not interested in seeing that a 40 - year - old missed a few credit or store card repayments when they were 21 , as it has no currentrelevance to his likely behaviour today .
Most information about your credit history is therefore held for between three and six years .
By building a better understanding of your credit history it can succesfully help your access credit in the future . .
Over the coming weeks and months we will be further looking at means to lower your outgoings to ensure your financial stability in the current challenging financial climate .

Haiku is an open source re-implementation of BeOS , the might have been operating system of the 90s .
BeOS had everything going for it .
It was quite unlike anything else in its space , but it ultimately failed to pay its way .
BeOS was the work of Jean - Louis Gasse - formerly head of Apple 's advanced product development and worldwide marketing - and fellow exiles from Apple 's management and developer teams .
It was conceived in 1991 .
BeOS was known for its elegance and the cleanliness of its lines .
It was easy to work with and popular with the usual suspects .
It also featured a 64 - bit journalling file system , pervasive multi-threading and pre-emptive multitasking - all concepts which were foreign to the operating systems sold by Microsoft and Apple at the time .
BeOS had an organic , co-ordinated feel to it , and saw itself as the integrated multimedia desktop operating system .
It was lean and uncluttered and perfect for creative work , music making and graphical manipulation .
But it also proved popular among a significant subset of developers and coders , who were enticed to BeOS by the presence of the GNU tools , BeBits and other developer - friendly channels .
BeOS should have been a contender .
It really should have .
Alas , it fell by the wayside because its parent company Be Inc could n't realise a workable business model and because it was pushed aside by the rival attractions of Linux and free software .
Not to mention the business muscle of Microsoft .

The raid has sparked protests across the world
There is widespread agreement in Israel and around the world that , whatever the rights or wrongs about the Gaza flotilla , something went badly wrong with the operation to stop it .
One commentator in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz remarked that " my six - year - old son could do much better than our current government . "
So , what went wrong ?
The interception took place about 40 miles ( 60 km ) off the Gaza coast , some 25 miles beyond the formal limits of the maritime blockade Israel is maintaining on Gaza .
A maritime blockade is a legal device under international law .
It has to have a reason ( Israel 's is that Hamas would import arms ) , it has to be formally declared ( it was ) and it has to be enforced ( it is ) .
By intercepting beyond the blockade limits , Israel took a risk that the action would be challenged under international law , but the issue is at least debatable .
Israel argues that the flotilla clearly intended to try to run the blockade , and indeed the lead ship said its destination was Gaza when told to stop over a radio channel by the Israelis in the formalities at the start of the action .
Five of the six ships in the flotilla did stop , but the main one , the Mavi Marmara , did not .
( Update : several readers have pointed out that the protesters , as well as the UN high commissioner for human rights , consider the whole blockade illegal and that therefore , in their view , the Israeli argument becomes irrelevant . )
' Unexpected '
Warnings having predictably failed , Israel decided to use force .
It did so using members of its seaborne special forces , Flotilla 13 , with helicopters and speed boats .
There has been debate within Israel as to whether this was the right unit to use .
It is trained for combat , not crowd control .
The best account so far of what happened has come from Ron Ben Yishai , a reporter with the Israeli newspaper Yediot Achronot , who was an eyewitness .
( Update : Ben Yishai's was the first detailed account , and obviously he was placed with the Israeli forces .
Other accounts have since come out , from passengers , reported on the BBC website . )
He says the plan was to land a team on the top deck and rush the bridge and take control .
The assessment , he reports , was that the passengers would show " light resistance and possibly minor violence " .
The soldiers , he says , were told to confront protesters verbally , use crowd control tactics and use firearms only to save their own lives .
However , as the first troops rappelled down , one by one , " the unexpected occurred .
The passengers ... pulled out bats , clubs and slingshots with glass marbles , assaulting each soldier as he disembarked " .
You can see some of this on a video taken by the Israelis .
Individual soldiers landing on deck are outnumbered and set upon .
One protester using a club is wearing a gas mask .
Other videos released by the Israelis show the catapults , marbles , metal rods and a knife they recovered .
' Rioters fired '
Ron Ben Yishai mentions the bizarre use by the soldiers of paintball guns , probably filled with irritants .
You can see one of them in profile on the video .
These , he said , were not effective .
The unexpected occurred .
The passengers ... pulled out bats , cubs and slingshots with glass marbles , assaulting each soldier as he disembarked Ron Ben Yishai , Israeli reporter
The commandos were unable to rush the bridge as planned and a second troop was sent in from another helicopter .
By now about 30 activists were confronting about 30 troops on deck .
But something more serious was happening .
The reporter states that the protesters " attempted to wrest away [ the soldiers ' ] weapons " .
They got hold of one handgun , he says , when one soldier , seen on the video , was thrown from the upper deck on to the lower .
( Update : this soldier has now identifed himself as the second man onto the deck and the unit commander .
Speaking from a hospital bed , he said he had fired his gun at an activist who came at him with a knife but was subsequently stabbed in the stomach anyway .
After being thrown onto a lower deck he and another soldier jumped into the sea to escape .
He did not mention his pistol being taken from him .
He also said the troops expected only passive and verbal resistance . )
The soldiers , who had started to use stun grenades , then asked for permission to use their firearms .
They were given the go - ahead .
However , this is not seen on the video .
Indeed , it stops just as one soldier can be seen levelling his pistol at the protesters .
One wonders what happened next .
Why did the video stop there ?
The Israelis claim that the activists got hold of two pistols and must have fired them as their magazines were found to be empty when recovered .
Ben Yishai also quotes one commando as saying that the Israeli forces fired at someone holding a rifle , but no such rifle has been produced .
He says that two soldiers were wounded after " rioters apparently fired at them " .
Unclear events
What is not clear at this stage is why so many died and in what circumstances .
Did they all die on deck ?
In a group or one by one ?
Image caption
An emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council was called
We do not see any of this on the video and one must ask whether any such video exists and if it does , then why it has not been produced .
The reporter says the troops fired at " the rioters ' legs " .
That may have been so , but it must have gone beyond that as well .
Update : Israeli Arab member of the Knesset Hanin Zoabi , who was on the ship , has now spoken in Nazareth .
She said it was clear that the Israelis " intended to cause the largest possible number of casualties ...
We had no plans for a confrontation . "
She claimed that the Israelis started firing before they boarded : " The firing began from the Israeli ships . "
She demanded that all video be released .
She also stated that two activists died after being refused treatment even though she had written a note in Hebrew asking for help .
Ron Ben Yishai says the Israeli forces made two mistakes .
They underestimated the extent of the opposition and they failed to quell it from above , by using tear - gas and stun grenades before they landed .
The general assessment in Israel at this stage therefore is that the troops went in ill - prepared and not in sufficient numbers .
They were put into a position from which they felt they had no option but to open fire and that is not a good position for commanders to place their subordinates in .
Hence so much of the criticism within Israel .
It is also clear that the Israelis had little intelligence about what was being prepared on the ship .
It is reminiscent of the British assault in 1947 on the Exodus , a ship carrying Jewish refugees hoping to break the then British naval blockade on Palestine .
In that incident , too , the assault force underestimated the opposition , resorted to force , and three of the passengers died .
That event did much to undermine British rule in Palestine and to increase support for a Jewish state .

On Tuesday , The Times ran a front - page article on the chaotic efforts to clean up the oil washing around the Gulf of Mexico .
Campbell Robertson reported on an incident in which boats that were supposed to be laying boom were , in fact , anchored on the wrong side of a bay in Louisiana .
They were helpless as oil oozed in from the gulf , and BP had no way of contacting the workers to get the boats moving .
The article described a cleanup operation that is overwhelmed .
“ From the beginning , ” Robertson wrote , “ the effort has been bedeviled by a lack of preparation , organization , urgency and clear lines of authority among federal , state and local officials , as well as BP . ”
Some of the chaos was inevitable , once this much oil started gushing into the coastal waters .
What was not inevitable , however , was the sense of insult and rage local officials now feel .
If you talk to elected leaders from Louisiana to Florida , they fill your ears with tales of incompetence  of advice that was not heeded , of red tape stifling effective operations , of local knowledge that was cast aside and trampled .
I keep reading all kinds of conspiracy theories as to why the press is unable to cover the Gulf oil spill and its cleanup .
People say all kinds of crazy things when there 's an information vacuum .
But I 'm starting to wonder if there 's really some sensational explanation for why BP gets to keep the press from reporting on the cleanup sites , because I have n't heard a good reason yet .
Now that Helen Thomas is gone , there 's no one capable of asking a question until they get a real answer :
Mac McClelland , whose reporting from the Gulf for Mother Jones has been indispensable , brings us this latest bag of bull from BP , which insists that it ’s not trying to restrict press access to public spaces .
According to McClelland , this was filmed on non-BP property in Houma last week by Drew Wheelan of the American Birding Association , who was stopped from filming by a Louisiana state Terrebonne Parish Sheriff 's deputy :
Wheelan : “ Am I violating any laws or anything like that ? ”
Officer : “ Um …not particularly .
BP does n’t want people filming . ”
Wheelan : “ Well , I ’m not on their property so BP does n’t have anything to say about what I do right now . ”
Officer : “ Let me explain : BP does n’t want any filming .
So all I can really do is strongly suggest that you not film anything right now .
If that makes any sense . ”
It makes no sense , unless , of course , BP has some authority over police and sheriff ’s departments in Louisiana , a scenario that BP denies but which seems to crop up again and again .
WDSU - TV’s Scott Walker , whose own encounter with an official who attempted to deny him access to a public beach went viral , received an apology from a BP flack nine days later .
Wheelan ’s encounter did n’t stop there .
Read McClelland ’s entire report , and the next time someone asks you “ Well , what do you want President Obama to do ? ” , tell them he could start by looking into why a foreign corporation seems to be allowed to act with extralegal authority on U.S. soil .
It ’s the sort of thing you ’d think the Tea Party might care about , too .
" In our region ... the blind and savage terrorism is born out of the evil policies of the United States , Britain and their state and non-state mercenaries , " Khamenei said in a statement marking the seventh day of mourning for victims of the bombings of a Shiite mosque in southeastern Iran .

He was found dead on the boat June 23 , after apparently shooting himself in the head .
" He 'd been a charter boat captain for 25 years , and all of the sudden he had people barking orders at him who did n't know how to tie up a boat to a pier .
I think he thought , ' I 've got to get out of this .
I can't take it . ' " Enlarge By Brian Kelly , Pensacola News Journal At her Foley , Ala. , home Thursday , Tracy Kruse talks about the death of her husband Allen .
FOLEY , Ala .  Allen Kruse tenderly kissed his wife goodbye just after sunrise Wednesday and headed to the docks in Gulf Shores , Ala. , where his boat , The Rookie , was moored .
A charter boat captain for 25 years , Kruse had signed on as a BP contractor to spot oil , deploy boom and eventually learn how to skim oil .
His business had come to a screeching halt after the April 20 oil spill .
About an hour later , Kruse was dead .
He was 55 , the father of 11 - and 12 - year - old boys , Cory and Ryan , and daughter Kelli , 26 .
About 7 a.m. , after a BP training meeting , he climbed into the wheelhouse of his 46 - foot charter boat and ended his worry , his frustration and his anger with a single bullet to the head .
" Nothing was easy working with BP .
Everything was hard , and it consumed him .
He was n't crazy , " said his wife , Tracy , 41 , sitting outside the couple 's home in Foley on Thursday .

I think he thought , ' I 've got to get out of this .
I can't take it . ' "
The spill also left Kruse emotionally devastated .
It robbed him of his passion for taking customers out to the Gulf to fish for red snapper and grouper , his wife said .
" Our whole lives surround this , this oil , everything is oil , " he told her a few days ago .
Consumed by worry From the beginning , Kruse was unhappy with the glacially slow process of working for BP .
" He could n't believe they were sitting there at Zeke 's Marina doing nothing , " Tracy said .
" He wanted to get out there and work and help clean up the oil . "
But once the work finally began , Kruse was overwhelmed with the paperwork to get an assignment and get paid .
In particular , one invoice required 52 pages to fill out , and there were problems getting the paperwork to BP , Tracy said .
Several days ago , Kruse finally completed the invoice and sent it to BP , but he still was unsettled .
" Things changed in our marriage , " Tracy said .
" Usually , I was the worrier , but now Allen worried .
He worried that BP would n't get the invoices .
He worried about the whole situation . "
Tuesday morning , black skies loomed over The Rookie , but Kruse and his crew of three still went out to look for oil .
" They went out , but Allen called me and said , ' This is bad .
Someone 's going to get hurt , ' " Tracy said .
" So they came in at the request of the task force leader . "
With the ominous weather and rain , Kruse 's mood turned darker .
By Tuesday night , he again was focused on the 52 - page invoice .
" I said , ' Allen , honey , please let 's just give this a break , ' " Tracy said .
" He said to me , ' I just got this fog in my head I can't shake , and it 's driving me crazy . ' " Kruse took a bath .
He felt better .
He ate .
At 9 p.m. , he and his wife went to bed .
' Last time I saw him ' Wednesday morning , Kruse rose first and dressed .
Tracy got up for a few minutes , meeting her husband in the kitchen .
" He was just standing there , bent over the counter with his face in his hands , " she said .
" He was just leaning on the counter , and I could see the wheels of worry turning in his head . "
Tracy said little , then returned to bed to catch up on sleep .
Minutes later , her husband was at her bedside .
" He was just patting my head , and he said , ' I 'm about to leave , ' and then Allen said , ' It 's just all madness , Tracy . ' "
Those were the last words she 'd hear him say .
" I told him everything would be all right .
I said , ' Do n't worry , Allen .
It will all work out , honey . ' " Kruse kissed his wife , looked in on the boys , and climbed into his Ford F - 250 .
" That was the last time I saw him , " she said .
She had no thought that he would take his own life .
The shot A few minutes later , Kruse picked up Ronnie Doyle , a loyal deckhand , at the Burger King at Gulf Shores Parkway and Fort Morgan Road in Gulf Shores .
They drove to Gulf Shores Yacht and Marina and the BP staging area and went about their normal duties of fueling up The Rookie .
Then , the captains met with BP officials at a nearby building .
It was hot inside , and many of the captains were angry and frustrated .
Deckhand Joe Resmondo said something happened to Kruse at the meeting .
What , he did n't know , but Kruse had a look of horror on his face .
The co-owner of the marina , Billy Parks , passed Kruse and playfully punched him in the shoulder .
Using his nickname , Parks cajoled him , " Cheer up , Rookie .
It 'll be OK . "
But something was very wrong .
Then Kruse went missing .
" It was a normal morning , but at one point , we could n't find Rookie , " Resmondo said .
" I asked around if anyone had seen him . "
No one had .
Then , there was a clap , what Resmondo assumed was a backfire or firecracker .
" I did n't give it any thought , " he said .
" It was a muffled sort of crack .
Then , I climbed the ladder to the wheelhouse and saw Allen on the floor , sitting in the corner .
He had shot himself .
I turned , screamed for help and dialed 911 . "
' He wanted out '
Tracy got the call from Parks .
There had been an accident , Parks said .
" What kind of accident ? "
Tracy frantically asked .
" Is it Allen ?
Did he fall off the boat ? "
Her husband was notoriously clumsy .
" You need to come to the marina , " Parks said .
" Do n't speed .
Just come right now .
Right now . "
" And I was just screaming ' Tell me , tell me , tell me , ' " Tracy said .
Parks would n't .
So Tracy called Resmondo .
He would n't say either .
She hung up and called her sister , who'd found out about the shooting just minutes before and told her .
" You know , I do n't think he was even thinking about his family , " Tracy said .
" I think he wanted out of the chaos and what he called ' madness ' of the whole thing . "

Panthera atrox skull .
Image credit : Wikipedia .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
There has been some debate over the last century or so about whether the extinct American lion , Panthera atrox , which dates from the Pleistocene , is related to present day African lions ( Panthera leo ) or to the jaguar ( Panthera onca ) .
Most paleontologists consider P. atrox as a lion , and have in the past even classified the American lion as Panthera leo rather than a separate species .
Now a new study has challenged previous classifications and found the American lion was a distinct species and more similar to the jaguar than the lion .
The best preserved fossils of Panthera atrox have been found in the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles and are mostly housed in the University of California Museum of Paleontology .
Over the last 40,000 years the tar pits have trapped and preserved many animals in the thick asphalt deposits , because they were attracted to water that often covered and concealed the asphalt .
Around 90 percent of the large animals found in La Brea were carnivores , presumably attracted to the area by the animals trapped in the sticky asphalt , and then becoming trapped themselves .
The largest of the cat family found in the tar pits is the Panthera atrox .
The new study , by Per Christiansen of the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen , Denmark , and John Harris of the George C. Page Museum in Los Angeles in the U.S. used a range of statistical and shape analysis methods to compare large numbers of skulls of modern and extinct pantherine cats .
They analyzed 23 dimensions on the skulls and found P. atrox has some similarities to lions but also many differences .
The mandibular morphology is closer to jaguars and tigers than to lions .
The researchers concluded that P. atrox was evolved from a line of cats that immigrated into the Americas in the mid Pleistocene , and which gave rise in the late Pleistocene to P. atrox and the jaguar .
Panthera atrox was one of the largest cats ever , weighing in at over 350 kg and attacking prey animals as large as the wild horse and bison .
It is believed to have inhabited open habitats , like the largest individuals of the modern jaguar , and became extinct around 10 - 12,000 years ago .
At its height the American lion ranged from Alaska and the Yukon to Mexico .
The paper was published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology .

The Buck Never Stops
Halliburton Profiting on Gulf Spill Cleanup
Jason Mark
How ’s this for a business model ?
First , you make a bundle of cash by providing essential services to the oil majors as they undertake tricky ( and risky ) offshore oil and gas extraction .
Then , when one of the wells you ’re working on blows up , you sneak away from any possible liabilities .
And finally , to bring everything full circle , you then rack up additional profits with your oil spill cleanup division .
That pretty well describes Halliburton ’s masterful playing of the BP oil disaster .
The preliminary investigations into the causes of the Deepwater Horizon blowout show that Halliburton ’s job in the cementing work on the well may have led to the gas leakage that ignited the explosion and sinking of the drilling rig .
Yet when Halliburton executives appeared before a congressional committee in May , they sought to direct the blame at BP and Transocean .
Seeking to deflect attention from itself , Halliburton ’s Tim Probert told members of Congress : “ We understand that the drilling contractor . . . proceeded to displace the riser with seawater prior to the planned placement of the final cement plug . ”
Even as Halliburton has slipped out the spotlight , the company is working behind the scenes on the repair effort — and making a buck in the process .
( Hat tip to Daniel Tencer at The Raw Story for bringing this story to my attention . )
A week before the Deepwater Horizon accident , Halliburton purchased Boots & Coots , a $ 191 million company that specializes in “ prevention and risk - control services for oil - and gas - well fires and blowouts , ” according to an April 12 story in Daily Finance .
The company also “ helps enhance production for oil and gas operators , ” and will likely see an increase in operations as more activity is focused on unconventional , difficult to extract fossil fuel sources like shale oil and gas .
According to The Christian Science Monitor , Boots & Coots is now under contract with BP to help with the relief well that will , hopefully , put a final cap on the blowout .
Halliburton is essentially making money from causing the accident and then helping to repair it .
Halliburton ’s many - fingered tentacles is just the latest illustration of how powerful the company is .
The $ 18 billion - corporation is the second largest oil services business in the world , making it an indispensable part of the extraction industry .
Its long reach brings to mind Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi ’s evocative description of Goldman Sachs .
Like the powerful investment banking firm , Halliburton is also “ a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity . ”
Be sure to bookmark the " Scary Unemployment Dashboard " ... it 's live .
Nothing says recovery less than a steadily increasing pool of unemployed workers facing the specter of a quickly increasing average ( and median ) length stint on unemployment .
In fact , as has been widely reported , the median and average stay on unemployment has simply exploded far surpassing the highest levels seen since records have been regularly kept .
Looking at the charts below ( click for super interactive versions ) you can see that today ’s sorry situation far exceeds even the conditions seen during the double - dip recessionary period of the early 1980s , long considered by economists to be the worst period of unemployment since the Great Depression .
Currently , there are some 6.763 million civilian workers that have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more with the average stay on unemployment standing at a whopping 34.4 weeks and the median stay reaching 23.2 weeks .

According to early details from the magazine from a NeoGAF forum member , LittleBigPlanet 2 is much more than just a side - scrolling platforming game .
Media Molecule is creating new tools that will enable players to create racing games , puzzle games , " Space Invaders clones , " role - playing games and even real - time strategy games .
" A Media Molecule developer has created a fully - functioning Command & Conquer clone , " according to a recount of the mag 's report .

LittleBigPlanet 2 will also apparently let players create and edit short films , record their own sound effects and manipulate the game 's camera to make customized cut scenes using Sackboys .
The PS3 game also introduces the Sackbot , a fully customizable and programmable enemy unit .
With new " direct control seat " options that let players define control schemes , creating customized controls for enemies , vehicles and even Sackboy himself — no more standardized floaty control ?
—LittleBigPlanet 2's game creation tools sound like a massive leap .

Behance and 99 Percent founder Scott Belsky spent years researching how creative leaders at Google , Disney , Zappos , and other firms turned brainstorms into completed projects .
This excerpt from Making Ideas Happen suggests ways of tackling urgent matters without sacrificing long - term goals .

As leaders of creative projects , we feel an impulse to solve everything quickly .
I call this " Creator 's Immediacy " - an instinct to take care of every problem and operational task , no matter how large or small , as soon as it comes up , similar to a mother 's instinct for the care of a newborn baby .
However , it becomes nearly impossible to pursue long - term goals when you are guided solely by the most recent e-mail in your in - box or call from a client .
Fortunately , there are ways to manage the urgent stuff without compromising progress on long - term projects .
The capacity to do so starts with compartmentalization , shared values , and the power of clarity .
Advertisement
Here are some tips to consider :
Keep two lists
When it comes to organizing your Action Steps of the day - and how your energy will be allocated - create two lists : one for urgent items and another for important ones .
Long - term goals and priorities deserve a list of their own and should not compete against the urgent items that can easily consume your day .
Once you have two lists , you can preserve different periods of time to focus on each .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Choose five projects that matter most
Recognize that compromise is a necessity .
Some people narrow their list of important items to just five specific things .
Family is often one of the five , along with a few other specific projects or passions that require everyday attention .
The most important aspect of this list is what 's not on it .
When urgent matters come up , the " important " stuff you are working on that did n't make your list should be dropped .
You may be surprised to see how much energy you spend on off - list items !
Advertisement
Do n't hoard urgent items
Even when you delegate operational responsibilities to someone else , you may still find yourself hoarding urgent items as they arise .
When you care so deeply about a project , you likely prefer to resolve things yourself .
Say an e-mail arrives from a client with a routine problem .
Even though the responsibility may lie with someone else on your team , you might think , " Oh , this is really a quick fix ; I 'll just take care of it . "
And gradually your energy will start to shift away from long - term pursuits .
Hoarding urgent items is one of the most damaging tendencies I 've noticed in creative professionals that have encountered early success .
When you are in the position to do so , challenge yourself to delegate urgent items to others .
Advertisement
Create a Responsibility Grid
If you have a partner , you 'll want to divide and conquer various tasks for efficiency .
Some teams create a " Responsibility Grid " to help them compartmentalize .
This is also a tool that I used with co-heads of teams while working at Goldman Sachs .
Across the top of the chart ( the horizontal x - axis ) you write the names of the people on the team .
Then , down the left side of the page ( the vertical y - axis ) , you write all of the common issues that come up in a typical week .
Place a check in the grid for which team member ( listed along the top ) is responsible for which type of issue ( along the side ) .
Advertisement
For example , if you 're a small application development team , your list of issues might include " inquiry for a sale or team discount , " " bug report from a user , " " report of lost data , " and " suggestion for a new feature . "
As a team , you go through each person 's column and check the issues he or she is responsible for .
Once completed and agreed upon , this chart sends an important message about who is ( and , more important , who is not ) allowed to respond to certain issues .
The exercise in itself will help quench everyone 's impulse to do everything themselves and will streamline your team 's operations .

Create windows of non-stimulation
To achieve long - term goals in the age of always - on technology and free - flowing communication , create windows of time dedicated to uninterrupted project focus .
Merlin Mann , founder of the productivity Web site 43 Folders , has called for the need to " make time to make . "
It is no surprise that Mann is also known for begging people not to e-mail him ( in fact , he refuses to answer any suggestions or requests via e-mail ) .
After years of writing about productivity and life hacks , Mann realized that the level of interruption increases in direct proportion to one 's level of availability .
Advertisement
Many people I have interviewed preserve blocks of time during their day - often late nights and early mornings - as precious opportunities to make progress on important items with little risk of urgent matters popping up .
Of course , this practice requires great discipline and the ability to extract yourself from " reactionary workflow " — the state of always responding to what comes in to us .
However , through windows of nonstimulation , you will reclaim the power to focus on what you believe is most important .
We 've previously grabbed some knowledge from Belsky 's Behance before , including decorating a wall with done items and re-energizing projects with a good fight .
His new book , Making Ideas Happen : Overcoming the Obstacles Between Vision & Reality , is now out in hardcover .
World Naked Bike Ride , Victoria
Looking for the 2011 version ?
A carnival atmosphere accompanied Victoria ’s 7th annual World Naked Bike Ride on Saturday .
It ’s been some time since I roamed British Columbia ’s backwoods buck - naked or baked my buns at Wreck Beach , so I thought I ’d wander down to the start at the BC Legislature and see where things went from there .
Less Gas , more ass !
The first hot day of the year tempted hundreds to shed their clothes for … what ?
The WNBR wiki page advertises the event as a way to “ celebrate cycling and the human body … [ demonstrate ] the vulnerability of cyclists on the road and … protest against oil dependency . ”
The chant “ Less gas , more ass ! ” points to concern for the environmental and social costs of our addiction to fossil fuels , illustrated more urgently by recent images of oil - soaked pelicans , victims of the ongoing catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico .
Micah , a first time naked bike rider , acknowledged bike lanes developed in the city but feels there is a long way to go before Victoria is a truly bicycle friendly community .
“ It ’s terrible how aggressive drivers are towards cyclists and how they feel that we ’re more of a nuisance than having an actual right to be on the road . ”
He hopes that events like this will turn some heads and change some minds .
Aaron Mercer , a five - time veteran , enjoys the solidarity felt among large groups of cyclists sharing the same appreciation for green transportation .
“ One day I ’d like to see Government Street as a car - free zone — just trees down the centre and no road anymore . ”
Exposed skin also symbolizes the cyclists ’ lack of steel exoskeleton .
“ To ride naked is just to be vulnerable .
It really highlights the way it is on the road [ for cyclists ] . ”
Mercer also opposes the introduction of the harmonized sales tax on bicycles ( due July 1 ) “ They ’re going to be taxing bikes and subsidizing gas and that ’s just ass - backwards . ”
Arunima had a more unadorned reason for being there .
“ I appreciate the political statements as well , but I just want to be naked on my bike , ” she said .
Another woman combined activism and nudism .
While her skin graffiti suggested “ BP lick my spoke nips , ” her primary inspiration remained : “ I just love being naked ! ”
Like critical mass rides , this event clogged downtown streets .
Unofficial marshals directed traffic while riders cleared intersections .
Unlike critical mass rides , I personally did not witness a single hostile motorist response along the route .
Perhaps it ’s hard to become angry with a crowd having so much fun and — except for one prudish bystander , who thought the spectacle “ disgusting ” — most onlookers were swept up by the jollity of the occasion .
As one might expect , sailors in town for the international fleet review reviewed this parade enthusiastically .
While shipmates were hip - hip - hooraying the Governor General out on the strait , a large crowd of seamen on Government Street hooted their approval loudly .
So did hundreds of other spectators — residents and tourists alike — as the colourful ride zig - zagged through the streets of Victoria .
I ’m guessing readers are wondering : did this correspondent do the full Monty ?
I ’m ashamed , ashamed to admit I did not .
I noticed others who started the ride adhering to some minimal code of modesty , who by the end were as naked as jaybirds .
Unfortunately , I was too busy plying the tools of my trade to cast off sartorial encumbrances .
That ’s my story , and I ’m sticking to it .
See you there next year !

The rough and tumble beat of David London .
If you ever come across police officer David London we kindly ask you to get out of his way and quickly get the hell away .
Why you ask .
The NY Post explains .
NY Post :
A city housing cop is on trial for the caught - on - video baton beating of a cuffed and cowering Army vet in a W. 93rd St. housing project hallway back in 2008 .
Prosecutors plan to show jurors a chilling tape in which Harvin ( the victim - an army veteran ) first gives the cop a shove while trying to get into a project elevator .
London allegedly reaches into the elevator , grabs Harvin , and begins beating and macing him .
He delivers some 20 baton blows and kicks to Harvin , a beating that continues even after Harvin is cuffed , prone and cowering .
At one point , London appears to stop to take a cell phone call , then resumes the beating .
An unpleasant way to spend your Monday afternoon you imagine , having your head clobbered , with a moment ’s respite so our pal London can take a phone call from his Chinese delivery order before resuming the delectable beating he was just getting into before dim sum .
An unpleasant way to spend your Monday afternoon you imagine , having your head clobbered , with a moment ’s respite so our pal London can take a phone call from his Chinese delivery order before resuming the delectable beating he was just getting into before dim sum .
But now there ’s a catch and it may well be that London may not be served justice because the victim , Walter Harvin can not suddenly be found and asked to turn up to his own prosecution trial .
Something that has all our interns over at the office wondering .
The prosecutor said his office has tried to contact Harvin directly and through his family by emailing , phoning , and door knocking .

If you 're not sold on the iPad and are tired of waiting for tablets from other PC makers to show up , try getting your hands dirty with a tablet you can build on your own .
Liquidware , an open source hardware company , is selling a $ 400 tablet starter kit .
The DIY tablet targets developers who want to create a tablet of their dreams or write specialized software applications .
" The Beagle tablet is a portable modular open source handheld computer , " says Justin Huynh , director of product development at Liquidware .
" It 's all about customizability and embedded development . "
The tablet kit contains a 4.3 - inch OLED touchscreen that mounts directly on a BeagleBoard .
The BeagleBoard is a single board computer from Texas Instruments that comes with a 1 - GHz processor .
There 's also a battery module and a 4 - GB pre-formatted SD card to boot Angstrom Linux .
But users can also run the Android operating system on it , says Huynh .
" Everything is modular and snaps on or mounts directly on a board so you have a very compact tablet - like device , " he says .
Since Apple iPad 's debut in April , tablets ' popularity has surged .
Apple sold 2 million iPads in just 60 days of the product 's launch .
That has left other companies scrambling to introduce tablets of their own .
Both Samsung and Research In Motion have tablets in development .
In the U.K. , Dell has already introduced its first tablet called Streak , a 5 - inch PSP - sized device that can also make phone calls .
But those gadgets have little appeal for tinkerers , says Huynh .
" With the iPad , you would have a hard time hacking it to read from a specialized sensor such as a temperature sensor or add your own custom hardware , " he says .
" The Beagle tablet is all about innovation . "
Since the Beagle tablet does n't have any storage beyond the SD card , it is extremely lightweight , weighing just about 8 ounces .
Users can increase the size of the SD card or plug in an external hard drive or a solid - state disk through the on - board USB port .
The battery life of the Beagle tablet can vary from three hours to six hours depending on the application , says Hyunh .
The Beagle tablet is a lot of work since you would have to load everything from an OS to different applications .
But once you get it going , it could be a better conversation starter than the iPad .

I thought I said to him that I was surprised you should buy such bad roasted corn .
I did not believe you had coffee in the place : I am certain that I never tasted any .
I have long ceased to make complaints at Swindon .
I avoid taking anything there when I can help it .
Brunel also gave as a principal reason for his pursuance of the broad - gauge rail the smoothness of the ride enabling him to drink his coffee .
I ’m guessing caffine had a part to play in his only sleeping four hours a night .
I ’m trying to figure out how he had a hand free to draw , seeing as he was BOTH continually smoking cigars and continually drinking coffee .
— The Coffee House was a fixture of both high and low Victorian London , ever as much as it is today .
Finding decent coffee was notoriously difficult ; if you find yourself wandering around Victorian London looking for a cup , you may consult this excellent guide .
— Every once in a while , a piece of evidence is found which utterly overturns the foundations of an understanding we once thought unshakably sound ; evidence which forces a humble confession of the inability of our puny constructions to hold up before the awesome weight and complexity of Truth .
Such epoch - birthing evidence is found in this painting , from which I drew the coffee shop interior– before you click I warn you– it contains a SHOCKING IMAGE .
They are all wearing hats .
INSIDE .
My inside / outside no -hat / hat paradigm is utterly shattered .
Is it because there are no ladies ?
As usual with everything cool in Victorian England , women were not admitted to Respectable Coffeshops … in any case I need to go and lie down for a while before I recover from this shock .
— I honestly have no idea at all what impact an actually Analytical Engine would have had on the course of Victorian Science .
They did pretty good without it !
— Here is a period Organ Grinder and monkey :
— Although we pride ourselves on our meticulous research here at 2dgoggles , there is no evidence that Charles Babbage was ever kidnapped by an army of capuchin monkeys .
He did have troubles with mobs , sadly , as can be found in the following anecdote ( warning : in this anecdote , the human race kind of sucks ) :
A German band was in the habit of annexing a position before his house , and treating him to its music .
..
Babbage got tired of this sort of thing , and ordered them go and play somewhere else .
They refused , and he , worn out by their music , left his study to seek a policeman and have them moved on .
Like Carlyle , he dressed quaintly , and moreover , at the moment , he was bareheaded …
Babbage ’s dispute with the band soon collected a small crowd , eager to witness the fun .
Hatless !
In the streets !
At least some things I KNOW are wrong .
We can't say there 's a ton of surprises here , but , if you 're curious to know exactly where Google stands on the whole HTML5 / Flash debate , the company has now laid out its position in a post on its official YouTube API Blog .
The short of it is that while Google says it has been " excited " about HTML5 for some time now and that the tag is a " big step forward for open standards , " it says that Flash will continue to play a " critical role in video distribution , " and that it remains the " best platform " for YouTube 's requirements today .
Of course , Google also did n't let slip the opportunity to once again talk up the recently - announced WebM video standard , which it says is the open video format the web has been waiting for .
It is n't saying , however , that it will replace Flash for video , and notes that Adobe itself has committed to supporting VP8 , the video codec for WebM .
Hit up the link below to read the company 's complete argument for yourself .
This track was probably never meant to be heard by the general public , which is exactly the reason why it is so exciting to be posting this up .
This is the original version of Nothin ’ On You before it was handed over to B.o. B so he could replace it with his verses .
I ’m sure this kind of business happens all the time , but it ’s quite funny to actually get the chance to compare both of the produced versions .
It has the feel that this was Bruno Mars ’s song and they just needed someone to rap over it , and it seems like that was the case :
â€ œSo , Me , Phil & Ari ( of Bruno ’s production crew , The Smeezingtons ) did the track and we submitted it to Atlantic Records and they asked us , â€ ˜What do you think about B.o.B on this ?â€™ I was like , â€ ˜Perfect , letâ€™s see what happens . ”
Obviously he failed to disclose that Lupe got his hands on it first , but you get the picture .

I 'm so happy to read this .
There is at least one judge in America upholding citizens rights .
Perhaps this will result in setting matters straight throughout the United States .

To defend Bush now would defeat the purpose of becomming a Teabagger .
Republicans became Teabaggers because they were proven wrong about everything .
Republicans became Teabaggers because they were afraid to fess up to what they did to our country .
Republicans became Teabagges because thousands of American troops died for no reason .
Republicans became Teabaggers because they are cowards of the lowest order .

I wonder if Teabaggers see the irony in how the US preaches morality to the world , but does n't abide by it .
In this case , Bush violated the Constitution and Obama refuses to bring the law breakers to account ( and he continues the illegal practice ) .
I 'm a strong believer that it 's important to look forward and not backwards , and to remind ourselves that we do have very real security threats out there .
- Obama But when Obama commented on the violations of another government ( Indonesia , in this case ) he said :
We have to acknowledge that those past human rights abuses existed .
We can't go forward without looking backwards ...
Obama can't have it both ways , and neither can the Teabaggers and militia terrorists .

This is as explosive as Sibel 's exposure of Marc Grossman .
Why is Sibel out of town for this one ?
Can Mark Klein 's attorneys reopen his case now with precedent ?
Is this Obama 's way of supporting the case by allowing Judge Vaughn to see classified reasons for supporting warrantless wiretapping ?
It ca n't be let to die .
All Americans are being wiretapped , and anyone speaking out is placed under surveillance .
This goes to the very basis of freedom of speech !

So glad you could cover this as I did n't have the time .
Of course , if we had real accountability , those who ordered the violations of FISA and statutes banning torture would have long ago been brought before the bar of justice .

Why are you are quoting the " hated " / " dishonest " NY Times who got the " ACORN PIMP HOAX " wrong ?
For you Tea Baggers : Looks like the NYTimes mis-characterized the decision .
The Obama Administration was n’t arguing that the surveillance program was lawful .
As a result , the decision does n’t rule that the program was unlawful .
Rather , the Obama Administration was just arguing that Judge Walker could n’t reach the merits of the case because of the state secrets privilege .
After Judge Walker rejected the state secrets privilege claim , the case was over : DOJ not having argued that warrantless monitoring was lawful , Walker had no choice but to grant relief to the plaintiffs on their claim .

Paul L. asked :
Why are you are quoting the " hated " / " dishonest " NY Times who got the " ACORN PIMP HOAX " wrong ?
Because this time they got the story right , courtesy of one of their few smart hiring decision recently by bringing on Charlie Savage .
As to your other reach , courtesy of The Volokh Conspiracy , the technical issue you 've quoted unskeptically from Orin Kerr is largely dispatched by the bulk of the commenters over there .
Here is just one of them that smartly sums up the general theme : Orin , I think you ’re being a little hyper - technical here .
First , I think that the arguments the Bush admininstration originally put forth to justify its warrantless surveillance program ( that the president has the “ inherent authority ” to disregard FISA or that the AUMF trumps FISA ) are implicit rejected in several parts of this opinion .
Second , as I suspect you concur , the reason the government did n’t even try to defend the legal merits of the program itself is because those arguments are frivilous .
Indeed , they were largely rejected ( belatedly ) by even Bush ’s DOJ , which is why FISA had to be amended .
The contention that Bush ’s program was legal under the then - existing version of FISA is just not defensible .
Finally , since you appear to be one of Andrew Breitbart 's Tea Bag Boyz , I 'll ask you to speak for those Tea Baggers I queried in the original post .
It is your opinion that Barack Obama may spy on any American he feels like , at any time --- via phone taps or reading their emails , etc. --- for any reason whatsoever , without receiving approval from anyone , any court , to carry out his search and seizure at any time , as the Bush Administration had argued ?
Do I understand you Baggers correctly that you are in favor of such unchecked powers for President Obama ?

It seem that you like to use the " technicality " excuse when you do not agree with a court decision .
Like you did with the dismissal of the ACORN lawsuit in Baltimore .
So I and the " teabaggers " are considered to be a suspected terrorists / Foreign agents by the Obama Administration ?
From Wiki The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act which prescribes procedures for the physical and electronic surveillance and collection of " foreign intelligence information " between
" foreign powers " and " agents of foreign powers " ( which may include American citizens and permanent residents suspected of being engaged in espionage and violating U.S. law on territory under United States control ) .

Are you having trouble keeping your stories straight ?
The Bush / Obama Administration 's did not lose wiretapping case on a " technicality " .
That 's an absurd , and full unsupportable argument .
Second , as to the dismissal of the case against O'Keefe and Giles , there was no finding at all .
The case was simply dismissed because plaintiffs did n't timely serve the defendants .
An argument that O'Keefe and Giles did n't break the law there would be absurd .
But , of course , I suspect you know that and do n't care , because it supports your partisan agenda to argue otherwise .
So I and the " teabaggers " are considered to be a suspected terrorists / Foreign agents by the Obama Administration ?
Do n't know .
It 's up the Obama Administration .
So I 'll presume you do n't mind them deciding if you are or not .
The question was , do you support Barack Obama deciding whether you are , on his own , with no oversight , so that he can then tap any citizens phone or email that he likes , for any reason whatsoever ?
You and the Tea Baggers are in favor of that , correct ?

The Obama Administration has to prove that the teabaggers fall under FISA .
I would guess that progressives and the would say the Tea party is a Zionist conspiracy and the Obama Administration could use Israel as the " foreign power " to use FISA .
Progressives in the past have use similar crazy legal logic to apply RICO to abortion protesters .
Your statement that " Domestic NSA Wiretapping Program Illegal " is not supported by the decision since the DOJ did not argue about the legality of the program instead used ' State Secrets Privilege ' .
Pointing this was the " technicality " .

Paul L. :
Why wo n't you answer the question ?
Do you support Barack Obama being able to spy on any American citizen he likes without oversight of any sort ?
As to your continued obfuscations : Your statement that " Domestic NSA Wiretapping Program Illegal " is not supported by the decision since the DOJ did not argue about the legality of the program instead used ' State Secrets Privilege ' .
Pointing this was the " technicality " .
That is nonsense .
Setting aside that this is the second court to have determined that Bush 's spying was illegal ( the first decision was overturned on appeal , based on lack of standing , but the substantive decision about the illegalities of Bush spying was not spoken to by the appelate court , so was left to stand , essentially ) , the fact is , by your argument , if I 'm charged with murder , use an insanity defense without speaking to whether I murdered or not , and the court finds me guilty , then the court never found I was guilty of murder .
The litigants in Al - Haramain who charged that Bush illegally spied on them were found , by summary judgment , to have been guilty of exactly that .
Simply because the Obama DoJ could find to legitimate defense for having illegally spied , and thus chose to use " SSP " as their defense instead , is no " technicality " .
But even guilty parties are n't guilty in your corner of the world , so out of touch have you become with reality , it would seem .
So do you believe Obama should be able to spy on any American citizen he wants , at any time , without court order or oversight , as Bush argued , or not ?

Paul L-- Glenn Greenwald rebutts Orin Kerr 's claim that this ruling did not find the illegal wiretapping illegal .
http://www.commondreams.org/view/2010/04/01-4
" Kerr is wrong when he says that this ruling does not constitute a decision that the Bush NSA program was illegal --- it does exactly that , because the plaintiffs offered evidence and arguments to prove it was illegal and the Obama DOJ ( like the Bush DOJ before it ) failed to offer anything to the contrary "

A finding / judgement of illegality that does n't result in any indictments is hard to get excited about .

Robert O'Hara at # 16 has a point .
The TeaBaggers and Paul L are right on one score : Since nobody is being punished or pursued , clearly this behavior is LEGAL .
If it were illegal , then the Department of Justice would stop it and indict those who did it in the past .
Since that will never happen , we can assume that it is legal .
Based on the actions of the Obama DoJ , torture is legal .
Outing a CIA spy is legal .
Lying America into illegal wars of aggression is legal .
Killing innocent civilians in wartime is legal .
Stealing from the US Treasury for personal or corporate gain is legal .
Railroading a political candidate into prison is legal .
Stealing an election is legal .
Denying people their right to vote is legal .
Refusing to count legally cast votes is legal .
Just about ANYTHING is legal .

Simple , but true .
Wireless wiretapping is practiced on many U.S. citizens , including Quakers because they support non-violence .
That translates into being put on a terrorist watch list .
When caught the Feds cannot apologize because that is admission of liability , the only thing presently that holds up in court .
Police State anyone ?

In the 2008 election , 78 percent of Jewish voters supported Mr. Obama , and surveys have suggested that most continue to back his policies .
In a survey taken after the diplomatic skirmish of March , the American Jewish Committee — the heart of the traditional mainstream — found little change in the level of Jewish support for Mr. Obama ’s handling of relations with Israel .
The survey found that 55 percent approved of his handling of Israeli relations , compared with 54 percent last year .
( His disapproval rating rose five points , to 37 percent . )
Jeremy Ben -Ami , the founder of a Washington lobby known as J Street , the latest of several organizations representing the voice of liberal Jews who support Israel but not all its policies , said many people have long felt ignored or silenced by the pro-Israel establishment in the United States .
“ People are tired of being told that you are either with us or against us , ” he said .
“ The majority of American Jews support the president , support the two - state solution and do not feel that they have been well represented by organizations that demand obedience to every wish of the Israeli government .
If you had taken their word for it , Obama should have gotten 12 percent of the Jewish vote .
But he got 80 .
That should say something . ”
Within the vast spectrum of opinion , though , American Jews continue to have strong attachments to Israel , and the recent tensions have produced intense , often angry , debate .
The rancor led delegates at the annual convention of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs , an umbrella community relations group that includes almost all major American Jewish organizations , to adopt a resolution in February calling for a halt to “ a level of uncivility , particularly over issues pertaining to Israel , that has not been witnessed in recent memory . ”
Abraham Foxman , the national director of the Anti-Defamation League , predicted that Mr. Obama ’s approval ratings among Jews would soon reflect what he called “ a deep distress ” over his approach .

“ People are angry , ” he said .
“ Americans do not want peace shoved down the throats of the Israelis . ”
But Professor Steven M. Cohen , a sociologist at Hebrew Union College in Manhattan who co-wrote a study last year charting a steep decline in attachment to Israel among younger Jews , said the younger and liberal - leaning are frustrated at being labeled “ anti- Israel ” or even anti-Semitic for expressing opposition to Israel ’s treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories .
June 22 , 2010  --
Investors , take notice .
The BP oil spill has taught us once again that no stock is immune from potential disaster .
No matter how rock - solid a particular stock has been , risk always looms on the horizon .
That 's why staking your financial future on just one or two stocks is plain foolish .
History tells us many investors will ignore this latest lesson .
Why should things be any different this time than when Enron emerged as a fraud , General Motors filed for bankruptcy or Bank of America slashed its juicy dividend ?
In each case , average investors took the hit for corporate failures .
They were left with worthless shares or disappearing income .
I 'll hope this time that retirees , 401 ( k ) participants and other individual investors will heed the lessons of the BP disaster and avoid holding more than 10 percent of their overall portfolio in a single company 's stock .
For that reason , let 's review what 's happened to BP shareholders since the oil rig explosion on the evening of April 20 that has devastated the Gulf of Mexico region .
That afternoon , BP 's share price on the New York Stock Exchange had closed at $ 60.48 , up 55 percent over the previous 12 months .
( Since BP PLC is a foreign company , American investors actually buy BP's ADRs , or American Depository Receipts , which represent shares in a foreign company owned on their behalf by a large American bank . )
At the time , BP stock paid an annual dividend of $ 3.36 per share , a yield of 5.6 percent .
Things could n't be better for BP shareholders , it seemed .
But without warning to investors as well as Gulf Coast residents , disaster struck .
As a result , BP shares have lost nearly half their value , and the company 's above - average dividend has been cut to zero as the company sets up a $ 20 billion reserve to cover damages resulting from the oil spill .
If you owned 1,000 shares of BP , on April 20th they were worth more than $ 60,000 and paid annual dividends of nearly $ 3,400 .
Today , your 1,000 shares are worth less than $ 31,000 , and there are no dividend payments in sight .
A retired New Jersey school teacher described for Bloomberg News how she would lose $ 10,000 a year in income as a result of BP 's dividend suspension .
Similar stories have been told by British retirees who count BP as one of their favorite holdings thanks to the once - reliable income stream .
Some observers have portrayed President Obama 's pressure on BP to suspend its dividend as a move that puts Gulf fishermen ahead of retirees .
In some respects , that 's true .
But owners of common stock must remember where they stand when it comes to company profits .
They are last in line behind bondholders who lend money to companies , and then the owners of preferred stock .
Dividends to common stock owners get paid last if there 's anything left , and there is no legal requirement to pay the dividend as there is with bond interest payments .
Disappointed BP shareholders need to keep that in mind .
That 's one of the risks you take when investing in stocks .
The biggest losers ( outside of Gulf Coast residents and business owners ) may be BP 's own rank and file .
At the start of 2009 , BP stock accounted for nearly one third of the assets owned by the 39,000 participants in the 401 ( K ) plan offered to employees of BP 's North American subsidiary , according to BrightScope LLC .
The average BP 401( k ) plan held $ 180,000 at the time , meaning about $ 60,000 was held in BP stock .
The next closest investment , an S&P 500 Index fund , accounted for just 6 percent of employees ' assets , according to BrightScope , which rates company 401 ( k ) plans .
Someday , after the leaking well is plugged and the Gulf region hopefully recovers , BP workers and other investors may see their portfolios recover .
But that could be years away , and it may never happen .
So , everyone else , take notice and diversify your holdings before a corporate disaster strikes your portfolio .

Rätselhafte Rechtsansprüche Peter Mühlbauer
Gab Sony Music für gesperrte YouTube - Videos falsche Eidesstattliche Versicherungen ab ?
Bei YouTube gibt es eine ganze Reihe von Videos , die nicht angezeigt werden , wenn der Betrachter mit einer deutschen IP - Nummer auf das Portal kommt .
Bei manchen ist relativ eindeutig , warum sie nicht angezeigt werden - bei anderen dagegen weniger .
Eines dieser Videos enthält das von Bert Brecht und Kurt Weill geschriebene Stück Mackie Messer in einer Interpretation der Sängerin Lotte Lenya .
Ruft man es in Deutschland auf , dann erscheint statt des Stücks der Hinweis , dass es " Content von Sony Music Entertainment " enthalte und in Deutschland " nicht mehr verfügbar " ist .
Google gibt auf die Frage nach den Details dazu die Auskunft , dass man sich an den Sony - Konzern wenden müsse , der angeblich " an Eides statt versichert , dass seine Rechte in einem Video verletzt werden . "
Im allgemeinen handelt es sich bei Rechten von Konzernen an Musikstücken um Leistungsschutzrechte an der Aufnahme .
Die jedoch halten lediglich 50 Jahre nach der Erstveröffentlichung - welche beim fraglichen Stück mit deutlich hörbarer Wahrscheinlichkeit länger zurückliegt .
Auf die Anfrage von Telepolis , welche Rechte der Konzern denn genau geltend macht , antwortet das Münchener Büro von Sony Music Entertainment erst ausweichend , und erklärt , dass man das Stück nicht mehr hören und deshalb nicht entscheiden könne , wann genau es veröffentlicht wurde .
Auf den Hinweis , dass das Stück mit einer ausländischen IP - Nummer durchaus noch abrufbar und Sony ja ein internationaler Konzern ist , geht man ebenso wenig ein , wie auf die Frage , ob denn bei solcher Kenntnislage eine eidesstattliche Erklärung abgegeben wurde , ohne das Stück zu kennen .
Stattdessen verlegt sich der deutsche Sony - Music - Sprecher nach mehrmaligem Auskunftsersuchen darauf , dass durch digitale Nachbearbeitung neue Leistungsschutzrechte an der Aufnahme entstanden seien .
Allerdings kann er nicht sagen , wann und von wem die Aufnahme digital nachbearbeitet wurde und welche kreativen Entscheidungsspielräume sich dabei konkret ergaben .
Selbst wenn die Aufnahme also nicht direkt über eine alte Schallplatte , sondern über eine CD den Weg in YouTube fand , scheint deshalb höchst fraglich , ob Sony tatsächlich Leistungsschutzrechte daran hat .
In Deutschland ist man nämlich in der Rechtswissenschaft in Übereinstimmung mit dem Bibelreproduktions - Urteil des BGH mehrheitlich der Auffassung , dass digitalen Varianten gemeinfreier Werke nur in Ausnahmefällen neuer Immaterialgüterrechtsschutz zukommen kann .
Nämlich dann , wenn sich durch eine Kolorierung oder andere Formen der Bearbeitung " kreative Entscheidungsspielräume " öffnen und diese auch " in kreativer Weise genutzt werden " - was bei Musikaufnahmen , die möglichst originalgetreu klingen sollen , gerade nicht gewünscht wird .
Stattdessen weist Sony darauf hin , dass die Aufnahme " auch " deshalb nicht bei YouTube eingestellt werden dürfe , weil noch ein urheberrechtlicher Schutz für Werke des Komponisten Kurt Weill und des Dichters Bertolt Brecht bestünde .
In der Tat verstarb Kurt Weill am 3 .
April 1950 und Bert Brecht am 14 .
August 1956 , weshalb diese Schutzfristen noch bis 2021 beziehungsweise 2027 laufen .
Allerdings behauptete Sony Music Google zufolge in der Eidesstattlichen Versicherung nicht , Rechte für die Erben Bert Brechts oder Kurt Weills auszuüben , sondern eigene Rechte an der Aufnahme zu haben .
Eine Eidesstattliche Versicherung ist nach deutschem Recht keine einfache Behauptung , sondern eine besondere Bekräftigung ihrer Richtigkeit .
Unwahre oder auch bloß unvollständige Eidesstattliche Versicherungen können nach § 156 des Strafgesetzbuchs ( StGB ) mit bis zu drei Jahren Freiheitsstrafe geahndet werden .
Ihre fahrlässige Abgabe wird mit bis zu einem Jahr Gefängnis bedroht .
Und selbst die bloße Berufung auf eine unwahre Eidesstattliche Versicherung ist strafbar .
Allerdings ist Voraussetzung für diese Strafbarkeit , dass eine Eidesstattliche Versicherung gegenüber einer Behörde abgegeben wurde , nicht lediglich gegenüber einer Firma wie der YouTube LLC .
Dass Sony - Verantwortliche mit eine Freiheitsstrafe rechnen müssen , ist deshalb auch dann unwahrscheinlich , wenn der Konzern keine Leistungsschutzrechte an dem Stück hält .
Der Vorfall zeigt jedoch , dass man bei YouTube Medienkonzernen weitgehend auf bloßen Behauptungszuruf hin angebliche Rechte anerkennt , und der gut klingende Begriff der Eidesstattliche Versicherung dazu eingesetzt wird , der Öffentlichkeit eine sorgfältige Prüfung zu suggerieren , die in Wirklichkeit möglicherweise gar nicht stattfindet .
Dass das Video nur in Deutschland , nicht aber in anderen Ländern blockiert wird , erklärt Sony damit , dass YouTube sich hierzulande mit der mächtigen Musikverwertungsgewerkschaft GEMA streitet und wegen deren Forderungen Videos sperrt , an denen einer der großen Musikkonzerne Rechte geltend macht .
Sony ist nach eigenen Angaben mit dieser Situation " alles andere als zufrieden " .
Eine durchaus glaubhafte Erklärung , die jedoch auch impliziert , dass das Unternehmen für das Ausland - Streaming möglicherweise Werbeeinnahmeanteile von YouTube kassiert , die ihm mangels Rechten vielleicht gar nicht zustehen .

Taken in isolation , the winner in the 1950 Final Pool decider is n't anything to write home about : Ghiggia waltzes past the isolated , clueless and slow Bigode , then fires home a low shot that should really have been dealt with at the near post by Moacir Barbosa .
In context , though , it 's immense , football 's ultimate contribution to chaos theory , the beat of a butterfly 's wings that ended in a nuclear explosion .
No single act has changed the course of its sport , or a nation , like this one .
Brazil , plunged into mourning , their self - image irreparably tarnished - they even got rid of their virginal white shirts for good - subsequently developed an unhealthy obsession with winning the World Cup to prove their worth , an obsession yet to be fully sated five wins later .
Even despite that win in 1970 .
The world of football has n't done badly as a result of their intensity .
Bobby Charlton 's monster against Mexico ; David Narey 's bomb against Brazil ; Joe Cole 's slash past Sweden ; Peter Lorimer 's zinger against Zaire : the Home Nations have contributed their fair share of outrageous netbusting strikes to the finals .
But nothing holds a candle to this Welsh welt , proof positive that you could actually get that boulder moving in mid-air .
Allchurch 's arrow momentarily punctured a sombre atmosphere , too : the Hungarian fans spent the match protesting about the tragic events of the previous day , the execution of socialist hero Imre Nagy , fallen leader of the 1956 uprising .
The greatest collection of goals by a single team in a World Cup finals ?
People usually cite Brazil 82's preposterous portfolio - Socrates ' scorcher and Eder 's flick - and - flay against Russia , Zico 's free - kick past poor Alan Rough , Zico and Junior 's raking 40 - yard one - two against Argentina - but while that 's none too shabby , the under - rated West German team of 1966 pasted together an equally sumptuous scrapbook .
Franz Beckenbauer 's insouciant double and Helmut Haller 's imperious meander against Switzerland surely represent the greatest triple - whammy in any single World Cup match , while the young Beckenbauer 's pelt past the great Lev Yashin in the semi against USSR is pure cheek .
But Lothar Emmerich 's equaliser against Spain in the first round - the Germans were going out at the time - is the pick of the bunch , a blistering finish into the top - right corner from the tightest of angles .
England 's 1966 winners are hardly under-rated , but rarely do they get recognition for besting such a gifted side over the last haul to the summit .
Hungary 's Golden Team of 1954 put most great sides from the World Cup 's rich history in the shade , so statistically it 's no surprise they 've done for one of their own .
Their 1966 team , starring Florian Albert and Ferenc Bene , would surely be more fondly remembered if they were from somewhere else along the Danube , say Yugoslavia or Romania , and not the slightly less impressive successors of Puskas , Hidegkuti , Koscis , et al .
Tight at the back , exciting going forward , they could easily have notched up their country 's third appearance in a World Cup final had the USSR not bullied them out at the quarter - final stage .
They still made their mark , though , in a match which precipitated the quick decline of a footballing dynasty .
In their second group game , facing elimination , they beat Brazil , inflicting the reigning champions ' first World Cup defeat since 1954 ( when of course that Golden Team did for them in the quarters ) .
The goal that effectively decided the match was a belter , Farkas volleying a Bene right - wing cross into the bottom - right corner on the run at full pelt , despite the ball dropping just behind him .
What was more remarkable was that the two Hungarians had played out an almost carbon - copy effort minutes earlier , Farkas volleying the dry run inches wide right .
It was Garrincha 's first - ever defeat as a member of A Seleção - in his last international .
Brazil lost their next game , too , Pele hoofed out of the tournament by Portugal .
Hungary made it through , though their Soviet nemesis awaited .
Holland 's near misses in the World Cup finals of the 1970s are sure to always rankle – Rob Rensenbrink hitting the post in 78 beating the distracted no - show of 74 for sheer poignancy - but their failure to reach the summit in 1998 is n't recalled so frequently .
The best team in France , they should have won , but did at least triumph in the tournament 's signature match , against the second - best side , Argentina .
Dennis Bergkamp 's supernatural winner grabbed most of the attention – and understandably so – but Holland 's opening goal was as smooth , and was created by three bursts of genius rather than just one : Ronald de Boer 's shimmy and shake in the centre , Bergkamp 's cushioned header that took the entire Argentinian defence out of the game , Kluivert 's gentle dink into the net .
Holland could n't put away their penalties in the semi and went out – and look at the farcical mess the Brazilians made of the final .
The World Cup 's reputation has taken a right royal battering in the new millennium - 32 teams is just too many - but at least there have been a constant stream of wonder goals to soften the blow : Salif Diao 's fast - breaking , reputation - making strike for Senegal against Denmark ; Jared Borghetti's eyebrow stroker , the best goalkeeper in the world , Gianluigi Buffon , rooted to his spot ; Esteban Cambiasso's 24 - pass work of art against Serbia & Montenegro , Argentina 's second - best goal at the 2006 finals ; Maxi Rodríguez 's knockout volley against Mexico ; Fabio Grosso curling home Andrea Pirlo 's flick in the semi .
But none of them beat this futsal fantasia , Alvaro Recoba 's left - sided corner headed clear , juggled by Pablo Garcia , then slashed into the top left by Dario Rodríguez .
A contender for the best World Cup goal of all time - and that includes the ones in the canon , Maradona , Carlos Alberto , Pele , Gemmill and all .
Presentation Nice is a new programming language .
It extends the ideas behind object - orientation in order to better support modular programming and static type safety .
It also incorporates features from functional programming , and puts into practice state - of - the - art results from academic research .
This results in more expressivity , modularity and safety .
Safety
Nice detects more errors during compilation than existing object - oriented languages ( null pointer accesses , casts exceptions ) .
This means that programs written in Nice never throw the infamous NullPointerException nor ClassCastException .
This aspect is developed in more details in this article .
Modularity
In object - oriented languages , it is possible to add a new class to an existing class hierarchy .
In Nice , it is also possible to add methods to existing classes without modifying their source file .
This is a special case of multi-methods .
Expressivity
Many repetitive programming tasks can be avoided by using Nice 's advanced features .
Ever got bored of writing tons of loops , casts , overloaded methods with default values , anonymous classes , ... ?
Advanced features
In addition to traditional object - oriented features , Nice offers : Parametric types
This is especially useful for containers ( lists , hash - tables ) and allows for shorter and safer code .
Values of primitive type ( int , float , ... ) can be used in polymorphic code , in which case the wrapping and unwrapping is done automatically by the compiler .
Anonymous functions Functions can be created and manipulated as first - class expressions , just like in Lisp and ML .
This is much lighter than Java 's anonymous classes in many situations , for instance with listeners in a GUI .
Multi-methods
They allow methods to be defined outside classes .
This means that new methods can be defined on classes that belong to a different package ( even in java . * ) .
This allows for a more modular style : you do n't need to pack classes with all possibly useful methods , but you can split them into several packages dealing with different aspects .
Development can then happen independently in each package .
Multi-methods also extend usual methods with the possibility to dispatch on every argument , instead of only the receiver class .
This article shows why using multi-methods is preferable to applying the Visitor pattern .
Tuples
This allows in particular methods to return several values .
Optional parameters to methods Optional parameters have a default value that is used when the parameter is not present in the call .
This is much simpler than in Java , where one has to write several versions of the method for each combination of parameters .
The names of the arguments can also be specified at the call site , improving readability and making argument order irrelevant .
Contracts and assertions Contracts can be attached to methods , to better describe their specification and detect illegal uses automatically at runtime , in debug mode .
Contracts and assertions can be disabled , in which case they cause no slow down of the running program .
Furthermore , they can be used on any version of the JVM , even prior to 1.4 .
Integration with Java
The current implementation is tightly integrated with the Java environment , which offers several advantages .
The huge amount of Java libraries can be used directly in Nice programs .
Libraries can also be written in Nice and called from a Java program .
The Nice compiler produces java bytecode , which means Nice programs can be executed on virtually any platform , with any Java Virtual Machine .
Or they can be compiled to native programs with a native Java compiler .
The compiler is itself written in Java and in Nice .
The compiler needs a JVM version 1.2 or higher to run .
Availability Nice is freely available under the GPL .
The runtime classes are licensed under the " GPL + linking exception " license , which means that libraries and programs written in Nice can be licensed under any terms .
„ Hatten wir eigentlich schon mal eine Frau als Bundespräsident ?
Ne , oder ? “ , fragte der Verkäufer der Obdachlosenzeitung einen Passanten .
Münster , eine mittelgroße , deutsche Stadt im Juni 2010 .
Und ein
Herr ohne festen Wohnsitz debattiert freundlich und interessiert über Politik mit jemand , der ihm eine Zeitung abkaufen will .
Da hat sich etwas verändert in den vergangenen Tagen .
Das sonst stark unterschwellig wahrgenommene Amt , das Horst Köhler bislang bekleidete , steht in der Öffentlichkeit .
Es ist interessant geworden .
Das könnte nur der Anfang sein von etwas Großem , etwas das die Kluft zwischen Volk und Regierung noch weiter öffnet – dann , wenn Ursula von der Leyen tatsächlich Köhlers Nachfolgerin würde .
Sicher : Es kann sein , dass wir hier eine gewollte Spiegelfechterei führen .
Es kann sein , dass Die Arbeitsministerin nicht ernsthaft in Betracht gezogen wird , sondern das Lancieren ihres Namens allein einem Ziel dient – ihre politische Karriere auf absehbare Zeit zu ruinieren .
Denn so funktioniert das ja manchmal auf diesem merkwürdigen Planeten Berlin : Würde von der Leyen es nicht zur Bundespräsidentin schaffen , würden ihr erstmal für ein paar Jahre die Fähigkeiten abgesprochen , ein höheres
Amt zu übernehmen .
( Nachtrag vom 4.6 . : Nachdem von der Leyen es nicht wird , mutmaßt Michael Spreng , dass es genau darum ging : von der Leyen nachhaltig schädigen . )
Es kann also sein , dass auch das folgende vergebene Liebesmüh ist .
Wenn dem aber nicht so ist , so zeugt dies zum einen davon , dass die Politik nichts von den Geschehnissen rund um Internet - Sperren gelernt hat .
Zum anderen können wir uns darauf einrichten , dass von der Leyens Sieg eine die Kluft zwischen dem digital aktiven Teil der Bevölkerung und der Regierung so weit öffnen wird , das auf Jahre hinweg das Klima vergiftet sein dürfte .
Erinnern wir uns zurück an die turbulenten Tage von Zensursula .
Die Debatte , die von der Leyen unter Zuhilfenahme nachweisbarer Lügen lostrat , veränderte die politische Landschaft – und das deutschsprachige Web .
Mit einmal Mal meldeten sich die angeblich apolitischen deutschen Blogger zu Wort , Netzpolitik nahm in Sachen Verlinkung einen steilen Aufstieg und wurde zum Ansprechpartner für Medien .
Deren Haltung veränderte sich im Laufe der Woche : Kritisierten sie zunächst den Protest gegen die Internet - Sperren , schwenkten sie Stück für Stück um .
Die Online - Petition wurde zu einem kleinen Moment bundesdeutscher Geschichte , die Piratenpartei wurde vom Vereinchen zur substanziellen Gruppierung .
All das scheint in Berlin vergessen .
Oder besser : Angela Merkel und die CDU scheinen immer noch nicht begriffen zu haben , dass sich etwas geändert hat .
Früher konnte die Politik ein
Thema ruhen lassen und irgendwann wieder hoch holen – zweimal regt sich niemand über etwas auf , dafür ist das eigene Nervenkostüm zu schade .
Heute aber ist Aufregen einfacher geworden .
Die Mühen sich für oder gegen etwas einzusetzen sind überschaubar .
Man muss sich nicht mehr in Fußgängerzonen stellen und Flugblätter verteilen , man muss keine großen Demos mehr organisieren .
Es reicht ein Computer , ein Internet - Anschluss und ein wenig Zeit .
So werden sich die Menschen ein zweites Mal aufregen .
Dann , wenn Ursula von der Leyen tatsächlich als Bundespräsidentin nominiert würde .
Schon jetzt läuft sich der Widerstand warm .
Auf Facebook zählt die Gruppe „ NEIN zu von der Leyen – Zensursula darf nicht Bundespräsidentin werden ! “ in diesem Moment 1300 Mitglieder , „ Zensursula – Not My President ! “ kommt schon auf 3500 .
Das wird erst der Anfang sein .
Es wird ein Sturm folgen , würde sie das Amt erhalten .
Ein rein digitaler Sturm , zunächst .
Denn natürlich reden wir hier über den Kreis der im Netz sehr Aktiven .
Doch was die schreiben und filmen und twittern und facebooken landet dann flott im Hallraum der klassischen Medien .
„ Internet - Nutzer laufen Sturm gegen von der Leyen “ , werden die Artikel überschrieben werden .
Das wird dann die Diskussion in der Hauptstadt befeuern und erzeugen , was die Polit - Szene als „ öffentlichen Druck “ bezeichnet .
Dieser ist komplett subjektiv gefühlt , noch immer ist es mir ein Rätsel , wie solch ein öffentlicher Druck jemand stören soll – aber er entscheidet vieles auf dem Planeten Berlin .
Wird von der Leyen trotzdem Präsidentin , dürfen wir mit einem Kreativitätsschub in Sachen Geek - Humor und - Aktivismus rechnen .
Von Flashmobs bis zu Youtube - Videos – das ganze digitale Spektrum wird ausgenutzt werden .
Engagiert sich keine andere der großen ( na ja , was heute noch groß ist ) Partei authentisch in diesem Bereich ( aktuell sehe ich keine ) , wird die Piratenpartei den nächsten Wachstumsschub erleben .
Sicher , jener digital stark unterwegs seiende Teil der Bevölkerung ist nicht Deutschland als Ganzes .
Aber er besteht eben aus Menschen , die technischen Fortschritt früh adaptieren .
Sie dürften besser gebildet sein als die Durchschnittsbevölkerung , sie sind mobiler und weltoffener .
Sprich : Sie sind die Traumzielgruppe .
Und wenn die sich abwendet , dann gibt es ein Problem .
Und bevor jemand fragt : Ich halte Ursula von der Leyen als Bundespräsidentin für nicht tragbar .
Nachtrag : Das „ Handelsblatt “ schreibt von 1,6 Millionen Euro , die Ursula von der Leyen für PR - Maßnahmen ausgeben möchte .
Wie so etwas in ihren Häusern aussieht , hat sie schon einmal vorgeführt – in Form von versteckter PR , einer Unart , die in mir Ekel hervorruft , kommt sie von einer gewählten Amtsträgerin .

I live near the Pacific , along highway 1 , which winds along the length of California ( mostly ) .
Two days ago I was riding my bicycle along a coastal path around noon , when coming around a curve in the opposite direction was this apparition .
Hey , it was a yellow tandem bike .
No there ’s more than two .
Wait , there are kids .
Little kids .
Whoa !
There are five people riding .
Add luggage !
They were obviously on long trip but they went by pretty fast , and I did not have a camera .
So I googled them .
Found their blog .
Their story is even more amazing .
With gear their bike weights 600 pounds .
They ’ve ridden 4,000 miles so far and are headed up the coast to Alaska .
They left their home in Kentucky with $ 300 in their pockets .
I rode my bicycle across the country once so I know what is involved and man , those kids must be amazing .
According to their facebook account , they are scheduled to cross the Golden Gate Bridge today at 10 am .
That would be a photo opp .
Studies have shown time spent in nature does us all good .
Specifically a recent study done with 1,200 people , published in the journal Environmental Health and Technology found that even just five minutes in a leafy park can significantly boost our mood .
Well it might be because we inhaled some bacteria among the leaves and grass .
It ’s called mycobacterium vaccae and research presented today at the 110th General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology found that it might also increase an ability to learn .
Injecting this bacteria into mice has already been shown to increase serotonin levels and decrease anxiety .
But the researchers wondered if it might have a subsequent effect on learning .
They fed the bacteria to mice and then tested them in a maze .
And lo and behold these mice navigated the maze twice as fast as mice who received no bacteria .
But here ’s a caveat :
When they tested bacteria - fed mice three weeks after removing the single - cell organisms from their diet they found that these mice were still faster than the mice who never received the bacteria .
The difference , however , was not significant .
So the results are temporary .
Of course this is all in mice .
Still , it might give a clue to why we get a boost in mood and clear thinking , when we just take a simple stroll through the woods .

The horrifying week I spent spying on my 11 - year - old daughter 's Facebook page
A couple of weeks ago my 11 - year - old daughter , Clare , fell out with her best friend after they failed to agree how they should spend an afternoon .
In the space of a week , this minor spat escalated into a small war involving a couple of dozen other children .
Running parallel to this drama , Clare was verbally abused by a 16 - year - old girl who was n't happy about the way my daughter had spoken to her younger sister .
Unedited : Anne Graham spent a week spying on her daughter 's Facebook activities and was horrified by what she discovered
Clare was also threatened with a slap from another girl who did n't know her but decided to get involved anyway .
On top of all of this Clare - just 11 , remember - was approached by an 18 - year - old boy she did n't know who asked her to be his friend .
Most days , she was also bombarded with chain letters that threatened all manner of doom and heartache if she did n't forward them on immediately to her friends .
All of the above happened via her Facebook account .
I know every insalubrious detail only because one afternoon she accessed Facebook via my mobile phone and then forgot to log off - inadvertently allowing me to remain logged on as her and giving me admittance to her online life .
For a week , I was able to eavesdrop on her and observe her conduct .
Did I feel guilty for spying on her ?
To begin with , I admit I had a few misgivings and felt I had let Clare down by not trusting her .
But the terrifying things I learned meant that horror and dismay very quickly replaced those feelings .
Who knew ?
One in three British children has been the victim of internet bullying , with girls four times more likely to be bullied than boys
My time online gave me an unedited insight into what it 's really like to be a modern , middle - class youngster , living , as so many do , with one foot in the real world and the other in cyberspace .
Because it 's not as if my daughter and her friends are ' tough ' kids .
We live in an affluent village in the Home Counties .
My daughter is in her first year at a high - achieving comprehensive school with an outstanding Ofsted rating .
She rides horses , loves dancing and is in the top set in her school year .
Clare has had a Facebook account for only a couple of months , having spent the past year haranguing her father and me to let her set one up .
Children are supposed to be 13 to sign up , but the age restriction is n't policed and it 's easy to give a false date of birth .
For weeks ,
Clare reeled off the ever growing list of children she knew who had been allowed to have a Facebook page .
She cried , stamped her feet and told us we were ruining her life .
' You 're turning me into a geek , ' she ranted .
' I 'm going to be the only secondary school kid left in the world who 's not on it . '
Her father and I have heard enough stories of children being bullied on the website , or being approached by dodgy characters pretending to be someone they 're not , to keep her off it for as long as possible .
Indeed , this Tuesday a 15 - year - old boy was locked up for at least 14 years after he stabbed an 18 - year - old art student to death after the older teenager insulted him on F
But , a couple of months ago , we grudgingly conceded that , whatever our concerns , we did n't have the power to turn back the clock .
Online threats :
She was shocked to discover that her daughter was being verbally abused on the social - networking site
Like it or not , modern youngsters regard face - to - face communication as old fashioned and it no longer seemed fair to keep our child - a sensible girl we felt sure we could trust - out of the loop .
We insisted on a few ground rules .
Clare agreed that she would never accept requests from strangers to become her Facebook friend ( which would give them wider access to her personal details ) .
She also promised that if anyone attempted to bully her she would come straight to us .
As an additional safeguard , I made sure her privacy settings for the website did n't leave her vulnerable .
At first , it seemed a sensible compromise .
Once in a while I 'd peer over her shoulder as she uploaded photographs on to her page or erupted into giggles over a daft joke being shared among her friends .
everything seemed in order .
I began to wonder what all the fuss had been about and left her to it .
In fact , had curiosity not got the better of me when I first realised I had an opportunity to sneak a look at Clare 's account , I might still be thinking the same .
Even then , had the first message I saw not set my heart racing with worry and indignation , I very much doubt I would have gone on to snoop on my daughter as fervently as I did .
' You think you 're great , ' the message read , ' but you 're just a silly little slut who wears her skirt up her a **e .
Stay away from my sister or you 'll have me to deal with . '
I could n't believe what I was reading - not least because the author was a 16 - year - old girl I knew , who should have known better than to use such threats .
I did n't doubt that Clare probably had been less than pleasant towards this girl 's sister - they 've been vile to one another time and again over the years , as children often are .
But for a girl of 16 to be so aggressive seemed entirely inappropriate .
Every instinct urged me to reply , making it clear that it was an adult who was responding , rather than the child this little madam was trying to intimidate .
But first , I clicked on to Clare 's homepage .
Almost immediately , some of my indignation was replaced with dismay as I read what my own child had posted in response to the threatening girl and her sister .
' Bitches , ' she 'd replied after reading the menacing message .
It was clear that she was not an innocent victim in this spat .
What 's worse was that beneath it were a dozen responses from other kids , all of whom could witness this online spat via their own Facebook accounts - and all hungry for more .
Thankfully , Clare had n't risen to the bait , but that probably had more to do with the fact that her allotted time of an hour a day on the computer would have run out rather than her self - restraint .
But this had n't stopped kids with loyalties to the two sisters sticking their oars in , with one recommending another give Clare ' a slap ' .
Part of me wanted to confront my daughter about her behaviour there and then - and , of course , check how she was coping with being embroiled in such a nasty row .
Instead , I thought of the bigger picture and played dumb , vowing instead to eavesdrop quietly some more on Clare 's Facebook dealings , in case there were other horrors that I did n't know about .
I quickly learned that Clare not only accepts friendship requests from kids much older than herself whom she does n't even know - she also approaches strangers so that she can be seen to have as many Facebook friends as possible .
' When I was a girl , the rows stopped at the end of the school day - the problem with Facebook is that it follows children home '
If her mates are anything to go by , an 11 - year - old with 500 Facebook friends is nothing unusual - in the space of two months Clare had collected almost 400 .
How can these children possibly know so many people well enough to trust them with their personal thoughts ?
' You do n't know me , but I think you 're friends with my friend 's brother , ' she said to one 14 - year - old boy by way of introduction one night .
He could have been a fat , middle - aged bloke pretending to be a good - looking teenager for all she knew , and now he could chat to my little girl any time he liked .
How could she be so stupid ?
Meanwhile , the language she and her friends used on the site was colourful , to say the least .
I 'm not naive , but to see these expletives in black and white next to the pictures of the nice boys and girls I 've watched grow up really made me squirm .
Especially the moment I read my daughter describe me as a ' f *** ing cow ' to one of her friends after I grounded her for an unrelated misdemeanour .
' I hate her , ' she wrote of me , which passed like a knife through my heart - a heart which sank every time I saw another chain letter arrive in her inbox , threatening imminent death and doom if she did n't pass it on .
' Do you think bad things do happen if you do n't forward them ? ' one of her friends asked one evening , after they received another chain letter .
' I do n't think we should risk it , ' was Clare 's hurried response .
All this came on top of the row she'd had with her best friend a few days earlier , which had seen each of them go off with other friends for some breathing space but had now spilled on to Facebook with startling consequences .
Both girls had posted cryptic messages hinting at the trouble between them , which had succeeded in provoking an online stampede of 20 - odd children declaring their allegiance to one girl or the other .
Words of support quickly became revolting insults , calling Clare a ' slut ' and her friend a ' slapper ' , from one camp to the other .
If there had been any hope of these girls resolving things quickly , that had now gone as their petty spat had become entertainment for the masses .
Meanwhile , from reading the online posts made by her friends , it was clear Clare was far from the only child at her school embroiled in conflict .
Aggressive messages popped up on a rolling ' news feed ' - ' some sh***y people need to start telling the truth ' was one ; ' that bitch is gonna get a slap ' read another .
It was like watching some stomach - churning episode of a TV reality show .
Other kids joined in , having a go at children who were n't named but whom they all they seemed to know - ' the slut 's not worth it ' and ' I 'd like to stamp on her head ' .
Reading all of this , I thought back to my own childhood .
Yes , there were plenty of bust - ups and bullying in the playground in my day .
But back then it was confined to smaller groups , while these online spats quickly mushroomed as they fed into the children 's pack mentality .
More importantly , when I was a girl , the rows also stopped at the end of the school day - the problem with Facebook is that it follows children home .
It intrudes into ' free time ' and continues to preoccupy them even at weekends .
Meanwhile , Clare continued to get insults via the site 's chat facility .
She gave back as good as she got - again making me wince with the language she used .
But for all her bravado , I 'd noticed that she was becoming withdrawn .
If all this was upsetting Clare half as much as it was me , then it had to end .
So I sought Clare out and handed her my phone so she could see what I 'd been privy to for the past few days .
This was n't the time for recriminations I told her , as she blanched before me .
But , clearly , something had to give .
My first instinct , of course , was to take her off the site altogether - however much Clare insisted my surreptitious observations were unfortunate , but not typical of her life online .
I also knew that eventually she would find her way back on to Facebook .
So I made Clare a deal .
Between us , we would go through every so - called friend on her account and delete anyone she did n't know in person .
Anyone who had posted abuse would be blocked .
Even as we did just that , up popped two messages from children asking Clare to be their friend - I say ' children ' , but one was an 18 - year - old boy who had left her school two years ago .
She 's never met him in her life .
Clare quickly assured me she would never have accepted his request , but it made me deeply uneasy to think she spends time in a world where she has to make that kind of decision at all .
Despite everything , I do n't believe that Facebook is all doom .
Clare used her account to share her worries about end - of - term exams with one friend and got valuable help with her homework from another .
In the end , it also provided the medium for Clare and her best friend to make up , via the private messaging facility .
But there 's no escaping that it also has a nasty and insidious side that most parents are blissfully unaware of .
And that sometimes our own children 's behaviour leaves much to be desired .
What I did was underhand but in the end it highlights the fact that the only way to know for sure how our youngsters are conducting themselves online is to sit down next to them once in a while and insist they let us take a look .
With this in mind , I 've come up with a compromise that has allowed Clare to keep hold of her Facebook account - I now know the password and she can't change it .
And I am now one of her online friends .
This means that she can't sneak on to the site without me knowing , and that every time she posts a comment , accepts a new friend or talks to friends or enemies alike , she knows her mother might be hovering in cyberspace , too .
I 'm not naive - I know I can keep this up only for so long before Clare becomes too old for me to intrude on her privacy in this way .
Eventually I will also have to let her walk alone through cyberspace .
But , at the moment , she 's not ready - and if my sojourn into Clare 's online community is anything to go by , then I 'd say most children her age are n't either .
Many people realize that they need to lose weight a couple of weeks before an important event .
They are looking for an effective diet for quick weight loss .
This is a very dangerous path , because rapid weight loss is harmful to health and can be very disruptive to the appearance .
As a result , you will not only get the desired slimness , but sagging skin as well , and in addition to this – headaches , nausea , dizziness and sallow complexion .
So why is losing weight too fast bad ?
Let ’s face it .
The process of weight loss in the body
The body converts excess carbohydrates and derived calories to fat molecules and sets them firmly in the fat cells .
As a result , the fat cells grow in size and get packed tightly close to each other .
A sharp restriction of calories and carbohydrate from food is not enough to replenish energy reserves , so the body gets it out of fat cells .
But overstretched cells fill themselves with water which gives swelling .
If you get rid of water , tissues lose elasticity and the skin sags , the metabolism breaks down and you get problems with health .
When you stop dieting , the cells hoard fat again , and if you have not switched on the principles of healthy eating , you will surely receive more pounds than you ’ve lost before .
Metamorphosis of fats during weight loss
While you are losing weight fats disintegrate into component parts – glycerol and fatty acids .
This is the result of signals from the brain when the blood plasma gets the reduced amount of these fatty acids .
It happens when you are fasting and reducing fats consume .
Fatty acids are insoluble substances , and their transport in blood is only possible in connection with proteins .
Therefore during protein starvation the weight loss happens due to the destruction of muscle tissue .
Due to the fact that proteins connected to fats form pretty large constructions , blood becomes thicker .
That is why all diets require drinking a lot of water which makes your blood thinner but leads to complications as well .
Protein will distribute the fat to the muscles , if you do exercise in parallel with sticking to a diet , or to the liver , if you do n’t .
When the fat has reached the liver or muscles , it burns , forming carbon dioxide and water .
Problems with blood pressure and cardiovascular system
Fat burning increases the amount of liquid .
This fluid is collected from tissues and enters the bloodstream , and , if you lose weight dramatically , the volume of the blood circulating in the blood vessels will also rise sharply .
This increases the pressure and is harmful for the vessels of the brain .
Your head would ache and you may feel dizziness .
Some of the fluid goes back into the tissue to reduce blood pressure .
This causes swelling .
To avoid this it is not recommended to lose more than 2 - 3 pounds a week .
In addition , if your diet has too little potassium ( it is possible , if you eat only apples and yogurt ) , your heart will suffer .
Problems with liver and digestion
If weight loss does not involve muscles all fats are burnt only by the liver , but its strength is not infinite .
Some parts of fats get stored in it , creating a fatty liver , but also in the walls of blood vessels , giving cholesterol plaques .
If you are losing weight fast a risk of heart attack increases up to five times .
The loaded liver will no longer cope with its responsibilities .
A couple of such rapid cases of weight loss and digestive disorders will be expressed .
You can get even cholecystitis , inflammation of the biliary tract with disorders of biliary excretion .
Problems with appearance and beauty
Due to the shortage of fats the exchange of fat - soluble vitamins A and E gets stopped , and they are responsible for your beauty .
Therefore , rapid weight loss will bring you brittle and dull hair and nails , the skin turns gray , becomes dry and flabby .
If you eat very little food , this means not only low calories but poor nutrients too .
The lack of fats is fraught with problems for the skin – vitamins that provide its nutrition can be dissolved and absorbed in the body only through the mediation of fats .
Problems with reproductive function of the body
Whether you reduce weight by means of sports or diet the body will sound the alarm if it happens too quickly .
The fact is that the human body has to maintain homeostasis , a stable weight , metabolism , body temperature , etc .
If the weight decreases , the body will throw all the forces to keep this figure stable .
The mode “ bad times ” gets turned on , and the first one to suffer is reproductive function of the body .
If you lose weight dramatically the body begins to reduce your menstrual cycle .
Because of this , many girls get it off or eliminated .
It entails a temporary ( and sometimes permanent ) infertility .
The “ plateau ” effect – a lack of weight loss and problems with metabolism
While losing weight your metabolism slows down : you need to save resources , so the body does n’t allow them to “ burn ” easily .
Every calorie is being used or saved , and the activity of different processes in the body decreases .
That is why after some time of a strict diet , there is a “ plateau ” – the point when the weight does not want to decline , although you go on reducing food .
And deficiency of carbohydrates will cause drowsiness , poor attention and constant feeling cold .
Your body remembers such kind of stress as losing weight fast for a long time .
Physiological memory gets an image of sudden hunger that can occur at any time .
Cells begin to store fat at the first opportunity .
The person turns from a strict diet to normal food and gains weight back extremely fast .
So is it worth risking your health , appearance and well - being for the doubtful quick results ?
The process of losing weight should be reasonable , slow , combining a balanced diet and physical exercise and , wherever it is possible , it should take place under the guidance of an experienced dietitian .
In this case losing weight will bring you lasting results you can be proud of !

Most of Gaza ’s factories have closed and its water is polluted as a result of Israel ’s policy of closing land crossings to all but humanitarian aid , according to a new report being released Monday by the human rights group B’tselem .
The closure policy has “ led to economic collapse in Gaza , ” B’tselem charged in a 44 - page report that looked at Gaza , the West Bank and east Jerusalem during the period from January 2009 to the end of April 2010 .
According to the report , the prohibition on bringing in raw materials and exports into Gaza , which has been in place since Hamas ’s takeover of the Strip in June 2007 , forced 95 percent of the factories and workshops in the area to close .
Before 2007 , 4,000 types of goods were let into Gaza , compared with 150 that come in now .
Among the restricted items are building materials such as iron and cement , which , according to the report , are needed to rebuild the 3,500 homes destroyed during Operation Cast Lead .
The quantity of goods that comes through the crossings is less than onequarter of what entered prior to the restrictions , the report says .
Before 2007 , 70 trucks laden with export goods such as furniture , clothing and produce left Gaza daily for Israel .
Now , only the export of strawberries and flowers to Europe is allowed in certain instances , according to the report , which notes that goods are coming into Gaza through a system of illegal tunnels set up under the border with Egypt , although the system is not enough to revive Gaza ’s economy .
Electricity is a problem in Gaza , according to the report , which states that 98 % of the residents suffer from blackouts ranging from eight to 10 hours a day , while the remaining 2 % do not receive any electricity at all .
The power outages and the lack of spare parts have prevented the proper operation of wells and desalination plants , said B’tselem .
At the end of 2009 , studies showed that 93 % percent of the Gaza Strip ’s water was polluted , with high quantities of chloride and nitrates , said B’tselem .
“ The water supply is defective and thousands of residents are not even connected to the water grid .
Waste treatment has also been affected .
Every day , some 100,000 cubic meters of untreated or partially untreated waste - water flow into the sea , ” the organization wrote in the report .
A lack of pesticides and spare parts for irrigation systems makes it hard for farmers , according to the report .
Those with land near the border with Israel can no longer farm because access is forbidden or restricted , and those who violate these orders risk being shot .
Fisherman cannot go out farther than three nautical miles , which limits the Strip ’s fish supply , according to the report .
Regarding the West Bank , the report noted that there had been some improvements for Palestinians , including an 81 % drop in the number of people killed by the IDF since Operation Cast Lead ended in January 2009 .
According to the report , the number of Palestinian fatalities at the hands of the IDF dropped from 456 in 2008 to 83 from January 21 , 2009 , through the end of April 2010 .
These numbers do not include Palestinian deaths that occurred during Operation Cast Lead .
The report added that restrictions on Palestinian movement and access had been reduced in the West Bank in the period covered .
In early February 2010 , there were 44 staffed checkpoints inside the West Bank , compared with 64 in 2008 , according to the report .
The report also noted that only four additional kilometers of the security barrier had been constructed in 2010 .
It added that changes to the route could connect some of the Palestinian communities that had been separated for six years .
It noted that no Palestinian homes had been demolished in east Jerusalem in 2010 , but that demolitions had continued in Area C of the West Bank , where from January 2009 to the end of April 2010 , the Civil Administration had destroyed 44 residential structures built without a permit .
The demolitions left 317 Palestinians homeless .
More than half of the demolitions took place in Beduin communities in the Jordan Valley , according to the report .
In 2009 , the Jerusalem Municipality demolished 48 buildings in east Jerusalem , in which 247 Palestinians lived , compared with 89 buildings in 2008 .
The report notes that in spite of the 10 - month moratorium on new settlement construction , the IDF had not done enough to stop building in Judea and Samaria .
It noted that no outposts had been removed .
It added that the civil administration had handed out 423 notices of moratorium violations .
The civil administration said that in many of those instances , people had stopped working after receiving the notices , although it did not provide numbers .
The B’tselem report also noted that the Gush Etzion Regional Council had filed plans to construct thousands of apartments for an area known as Gevaot , where it hopes to build a major city .
The report did note that these plans had not yet been approved .
According to the report , very few IDF or police investigations into allegations of wrongdoing against Palestinians had actually lead to convictions .
From the start of the second intifada in September 2000 to the end of April 2010 , B’tselem reported 255 cases of violence to the military advocate - general ’s office .
Only 11 indictments were filed , and one of those was canceled .
During that same period , B’tselem turned to the Justice Ministry ’s Police Investigation Department concerning 180 cases of violence , but only 12 indictments were filed .
Since September 2000 , B’tselem has submitted 220 complaints to the Israel Police , demanding investigations of cases where Israelis harmed Palestinians or damaged their property .
Only nine of these complaints resulted in indictments .
B’tselem executive director Jessica Montell said that the report was being released to mark “ the 43rd anniversary ” of the end of the Six Day War , which marked “ the beginning ” of Israel ’s occupation .
“ The ongoing occupation both violates ” Palestinian rights and “ poses clear dangers for Israel ’s democracy , ” Montell said .
" For this reason we as Israelis must demand accountability for actions taken in our name in the occupied territories and work to change in policies that infringe human rights . ”
As countless police procedurals have taught us , one of the main rights Americans have if they are ever arrested is the right to remain silent .
However , the Associated Press is reporting that a Supreme Court decision this morning has changed it so that one needs to vocally tell officers that you are invoking that right before it goes into effect .
Yes , you now need to tell them that you do n’t want to tell them anything .
God , we wish Law and Order was still around to do a headline ripping episode about this .
The decision came in the case of Van Chester Thompkins , a Cincinnati man who was arrested for murder in 2000 .
Thompkins implicated himself in the crime after remaining mostly silent for three hours .
He appealed his later conviction saying that , because he had purposefully remained silent for those first hours , he had invoked his Miranda rights and , therefore , anything he said after could not have been used .
Police said that , because he did n’t say he was invoking his right to remain silent , they could n’t have known .
If you think about the specifics of that case , the ruling makes sense .
However , just reading the overview of the new rules makes one think that they were thought up by a sketch comedy writer .
And , as any comedy writer knows , all good sketches need a straight man .
In this instance , that role fell to dissenting judge Sonia Sotomayor :
” Criminal suspects must now unambiguously invoke their right to remain silent — which counterintuitively , requires them to speak , ” she said .
” At the same time , suspects will be legally presumed to have waived their rights even if they have given no clear expression of their intent to do so .
Those results , in my view , find no basis in Miranda or our subsequent cases and are inconsistent with the fair - trial principles on which those precedents are grounded . ”
It ’s not exactly as snappy as John Cleese complaining about his dead parrot , but she gets her point across .
She was one of four dissenting justices in the 5 - 4 decision .
It ’s an interesting case and one that , of course , reminds us of the Supreme Court ’s landmark ruling on the MLB ’s player naming practices .

Man 's best friend may cement his position if early results from French researchers can be replicated .
A team of researchers from Tenon Hospital in Paris reported Tuesday at a San Francisco meeting of the American Urological Association that dogs can be trained to detect the characteristic odor of unique chemicals released into urine by prostate tumors , setting the stage for a new way to identify men who are most at risk from the cancer .
If developed , the test might be more effective than the PSA test now used because it would have fewer false positives .
As surprising as the idea might sound , other researchers have already been studying the use of dogs to detect cancers of the breast , lung and bladder .
Many tumors release characteristic chemicals that can be identified by the exquisitely sensitive canine nose .
Lung cancer cells , for example , can release such chemicals into the air of the lungs , and they can then be detected on the victim 's breath .
Dr. Jean -Nicolas Cornu of Tenon and his colleagues trained a Belgian Malinois -- a shepherd breed that has already been used for detecting bombs and in other cancer tests -- to identify urine from patients with confirmed prostate cancer , then to differentiate those samples from urine from healthy subjects .
Finally , they used one urine sample from a prostate cancer victim and four samples from healthy people , asking the dog to choose the correct one .
In 66 tests , the dog was correct 63 times .
There were three false positives and no false negatives .
That is , the dog correctly identified all the specimens from prostate cancer patients , but misidentified three from healthy men .
The whole training process took about a year , Cornu said , and the team is already training other dogs .
The researchers are now attempting to identify what specific chemicals the dog is reacting to in hopes of developing an " electronic nose " that would n't require treats and potty breaks .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- The U.S. Coast Guard said the slick from the BP Plc BP , - 1.18 % oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is nearing the Loop Current , a stream of ocean water that moves around the south side of Florida and into the Atlantic Ocean .
" Satellite imagery indicates that the main bulk of the oil is dozens of miles away from the Loop Current , but that a tendril of light oil has been transported within close proximity , " the Coast Guard said in its update late Tuesday .
" NOAA is conducting ongoing aerial observations to determine with certainty whether or not the oil has actually entered the Loop Current , and continues engage experts within and outside government to develop long - term oil movement forecasts . "
The area now close to fishing represents 45,728 square miles , which is slightly less than 19 % of Gulf of Mexico federal waters .
The development of the Olympic site in east London after the Games have finished could be in jeopardy because of radioactive waste buried beneath the site , experts have warned .
According to a Guardian investigation , any development of the site risks unearthing a hundred tonnes of radioactive waste dumped at the former landfill site decades ago .
Documents obtained under Freedom of Information ( FOI ) rules reveal that , contrary to government guidelines , waste from thorium and radium has been mixed with very low - level waste and buried in a so - called disposal cell close to the Olympic stadium - about 250 m to the north .
After the Games , the demolition of the Olympic stadium in Stratford to make way for housing is a possibility because government and sporting authorities so far have been unable to agree on its future use .
Despite a possible bidding war between AEG , which runs the O2 , and Live Nation to possibly turn the stadium into a music venue , bookmaker William Hill recently made demolition of the Olympic stadium 5/1 third favourite behind its continued use for athletics or conversion into a home ground for West Ham United .
" There seems to be no obvious usage for the stadium after the games , " a William Hill spokesman said .
But while officials insist there is no risk from the waste to athletes or spectators during the event , further development of the site could expose the waste , which some experts claim should have been moved to a safe site .
John Large , an independent nuclear analyst , said : " The Olympic site 's hurried and unplanned development may have resulted in a great deal of public harm to the local communities remaining around the site .
Overall , there is some doubt about the applicability and validity of the radiological risk analysis undertaken for the future legacy use . "
His sentiment is shared by Andrew Boff , a member of the London Assembly and Conservative spokesman on the Olympics .
" I thought the £ 9.3 bn cost would provide a remediation level sufficient for future development .
But what we are left with is remediation which is just enough for us to hold the Games .
The ODA is very proud that it came in under budget on remediation .
I wish it had spent the whole amount and made the site fit for the future . "
Assessment
Boff is tabling questions for London mayor Boris Johnson on the Olympics site .
He wants to know if the mayor will commission an independent review of the way in which radioactive material has been disposed of and he also wants the mayor to ask the Olympic Park Legacy Company , responsible for transforming the site into a lasting metropolitan area once the Games are over , to investigate the additional costs of remediation that may be required for redevelopment .
Developers are concerned that a complete reassessment of the site would have to be carried out for any future work to go ahead .
Steve Wielebski , divisional development director at Miller Homes and a leading authority on contaminated land , said any housebuilder will want to examine any contaminated land carefully before constructing new homes .
" There are many safeguards put in place by the planning and regulatory regime , which ensure that a finished development is fit for purpose .
However , if a subsequent development represented a change of use to a more sensitive end -use , for instance the construction of houses with gardens , then the developers would need to go through the whole process again of assessing the potential risk to end users , " Wielebski said .
" No house builder will compromise on safety . "
The Olympic Park Legacy Company said : " Our assurance from the Olympic Delivery Authority ( ODA ) is that the land has been remediated to the highest possible standard . "
The site where the world 's greatest athletes will compete in two years ' time was once home to several dirty industries working with thorium and radium and also home to a number of landfill sites , where illegal dumping of toxic waste was commonplace in the 1950s and early 1960s .
Although the Radioactive Substances
Act of 1960 tightened the law , dumping was allowed to continue for another three years .
In July 2008 , the ODA told the Environment Agency that it had found 40 cubic metres , about 50 tonnes , of waste that showed radioactive readings up to three times higher than the levels at which waste is treated as exempt .
But it argued that when put together with 1,500 cubic metres of material that was " definitely exempt " this would bring the whole waste into the exempt category .
The Agency accepted this argument in July 2008 .
By the time the waste was buried on the site three months later the total waste had doubled to about a hundred tonnes and the total exempt waste had risen to 7,500 tonnes .
" Overall contamination levels in the waste at the Olympic site is within exempt levels .
The waste has been correctly disposed of and no rules , or laws , have been broken , " the Environment Agency said .
Much of this information is contained in a dossier of hundreds of documents obtained under the Freedom of Information
Act by campaigner Mike Wells and intelligence analyst Paul Charman , who have spent more than three years trying to establish what has been going on at the Olympic site where 28,000 documents have been submitted for planning approval .
Disposal
The dossier has been reviewed by John Large , who has been engaged to analyse the data .
He said : " As part of the on - site assaying , the ODA contractors were clearly separating out exempt waste from non-exempt batches of low - level waste with the intention , then , of sending this higher [ radio ] activity non-exempt waste to a radioactive waste disposal site , such as Drigg [ in Cumbria ] . "
He continued : " At the best , this might be interpreted as a misplaced interpretation of the radioactive waste regulations or , at the worse , some might view it as blatantly cooking the books to save on the high cost of off - site radioactive waste disposal . "
The ODA denied that it had misinterpreted or manipulated data and Allan Ashworth , the principal consultant who oversaw the remediation work on the Olympic Park , said it was the Environment Agency that had encouraged the elevated radioactive waste to be kept on site in a disposal cell .
" EA guidance says the waste should stay on site and Drigg should only be used where strictly necessary , " Ashworth said .
Asked about Ashworth 's claim , the EA said : " The waste did not go to Drigg because it is so low risk . "
The discovery of so much waste has prompted John Large to call for an independent review to remove any doubts about risks that workers and former site residents may have been exposed to .
But the ODA director of infrastructure and utilities , Simon Wright , said : " The Olympic Park and all venue sites are completely safe with no radiation measurements above the normal background levels that people would experience in their everyday lives .
" We have been open and transparent about the contamination found on the Olympic Park site , a former industrial landfill site .
As previously announced , a small amount of soil containing traces of very low - level radioactive material , classed as ' exempt ' under current environmental law , has been safely buried in a cell on site … using a proven , safe and approved method of disposing of such material . "
• This article was amended on 21 June and 12 October 2010 .
The original said that the waste in question had been buried " under , or close , to the Olympic stadium " , and a sub- heading said that this could render the Olympic site useless after the 2012 Games .
This was initially corrected to give a distance of 500 m from the stadium .
The ODA subsequently confirmed that the distance was 250m .
The text above has again been corrected .

Mark Webber will remain with Red Bull Racing in 2011 after agreeing terms for another one - year extension of his deal .
The team confirmed the Australian 's new contract on Monday morning , just one week after his controversial collision with team - mate Sebastian Vettel at the Turkish Grand Prix .
AUTOSPORT revealed after the Monaco Grand Prix last month that Webber had been set for a fresh deal on the back of his back - to - back successes in Spain and Monte Carlo .
And although the clash with Vettel in Turkey was far from ideal as Red Bull Racing finalised the terms of the new deal , the team and the driver were able to get matters sorted swiftly .
Speaking about the contract extension , which will see him partnered with Vettel once again , Webber said : " It was an easy decision to remain with Red Bull Racing .
We began talking very early this year and were in a position to sign by the Barcelona Grand Prix .
" The decision to extend for a further year was a mutual one ; it 's widely known that I 'm not interested in hanging around in Formula 1 just for the sake of it and at this stage of my career , I 'm happy to take one year at a time .
" I continue to feel very comfortable here - I have a fantastic relationship with the whole team and the factory at Milton Keynes feels like home .
It 's been incredible to be part of the team as it's moved forward from a mid-field competitor to one that is challenging for the Championship .
" I hope we experience more success together in the future and achieve our ultimate goal of winning the world championship . "
Team principal Christian Horner added : " The decision to retain Mark was very straightforward .
He is an important member of our team and is currently in the best form of his career , as the current leader of the drivers ' championship .
The team is extremely happy that the driver pairing of Mark and Sebastian will remain unchanged for a third season in 2011 . "
The confirmation of Webber 's deal makes it likely that all the leading F1 drivers will stay put for next year , with Felipe Massa set to remain at Ferrari and Robert Kubica likely to remain at Renault .
Nico Rosberg and Michael Schumacher are already contracted at Mercedes GP .

Here ’s something you might already have guessed — as a parent you have very little influence over whether your child tries alcohol .
That ’s one finding from a survey of 5,000 children between the ages of 12 and 19 , by researchers at Brigham Young University ’s College of Family , Home and Social Sciences .
Whatever the approach of the parent — strict versus laid back , warm versus distant — the kids who responded were equally likely to take a drink .
What parents do seem to affect , the study says , is whether that drinking becomes a problem .
The researchers found a direct and intriguing relationship between parenting and the likelihood of “ heavy drinking , ” which they defined as having five or more drinks in a row .
Using measures of “ accountability ” ( at the high end on the scale were parents who knew where their children were and who they were with ) and “ warmth , ” the study found that children who scored their parents highest on both were the least likely to drink heavily and also least likely to have friends who drank .
Those whose parents were highest on accountability but lowest on warmth ( dubbed “ strict parents ” ) had double the risk , and children of “ indulgent ” parents , ( low on accountability and high on warmth ) had triple the risk .
( Teenagers who described themselves as most religious , by the way , were the least likely to drink at all .
This was , after all , a study out of B.Y.U. )
So the message here seems to be “ love and verify . ”
Which also is n’t surprising .
But good to remember .
And reassuring to have confirmed .

The 1950s – a time well before the sexual revolution of the 60s and 70s , when sexism was not only tolerated , it was expected and actively encouraged , partly through chauvinistic print ads like the ones we explore below .
With lashings of hindsight , we ’re now able to see the funny side of the ridiculously overt sexism on display throughout the ads of the 1950s , mainly because they now seem so incredibly dated .
These ads stand as relics to a bygone era , one in which sexism as well as racism , and other forms of intolerance were commonplace .
Studying these print ads helps us reflect on today ’s society and shows just how far we ’ve come .
Printing ads like the ones below , complete with their preposterous female stereotypes , would be unspeakable these days , and I , for one , am very thankful for that .

Microwave radiation is the same kind of " radiation " as visible light and radio waves , the ionizing radiation that can cause cancer or radioactivity .
The only known risk of a leaking microwave is the high levels of heat it produces .
This is most dangerous to the eye ( where it can lead to cataracts ) and the testes ( where it can cause temporary sterility ) .
Extreme levels of microwave radiation can cause skin burns .
If you do not notice any symptoms and you stop using the leaking microwave , lasting damage is very unlikely .

June 17 , 2010  --
With the support of Sen. Chris Dodd , D.- Conn. , the federal government has awarded $ 54 million to Connecticut 's politically well - connected Mohegan Indian tribe , which operates one of the highest grossing casinos in the U.S .
The tribe runs the sprawling Mohegan Sun casino , halfway between New York City and Boston , which earned more than $ 1.3 billion in gross revenues in 2009 .
Each tribe member receives a cut of the profits , a number a tribal official said was " less than $ 30,000 " per capita per year .
The stimulus money is a loan from a U.S. Department of Agriculture rural development program that is meant to help communities of less than 20,000 people that have been " unable to obtain other credit at reasonable rates and terms and are unable to finance the proposed project from their own resources . "
Lynn Malerba , chairwoman of the Mohegan Tribal Council , defended the award of the stimulus loan to the tribe , and said that every member of Connecticut 's seven - member Congressional delegation except one had provided assistance in securing the funds .
" The whole Connecticut delegation , I think aside from [ Rep. ]
Jim Himes , who was traveling , sent a letter in support . "
Bryan DeAngelis , communications director for Sen. Dodd , confirmed Dodd 's support for the loan .
" Senator Dodd supported this project in the same manner and for the same reasons he supports federal assistance for other Connecticut projects – creating and preserving local jobs , " said DeAngelis .
" The only factor that mattered in Dodd 's support of these loans was job creation and economic recovery in Connecticut . "
A former aide to Dodd , Charles Bunnell , is Chief of Staff for External and Governmental Affairs for the tribe .
An aide to Sen. Joseph Lieberman said the senator " is supportive of any constituent that applies for federal funding that will create jobs . "
Mohegans Obtained Support from Connecticut Delegation
Staffers for House members Joe Courtney , Chris Murphy , Rosa DeLauro and John Larson confirmed that they had signed a letter to the USDA about a loan to the tribe .
A spokesperson for Rep DeLauro said the congresswoman " did indeed sign on to a letter to the USDA asking for consideration of the eligibility of the Mohegan tribe for a loan . "
A spokesperson for Rep. Jim Himes said the congressman " did not weigh in on this specific project since it is not in his district . "
The $ 54 million loan represents more than one - third of the $ 167.8 million allocated by the USDA in the latest wave of stimulus funding for its rural development program .
The loan is just part of $ 74 million in loans directed to the Mohegans by the USDA for the construction of a community center and tribal government building .
USDA officials said that part of their consideration in moving forward with the project was the tribe 's continued challenge in obtaining credit because of the ongoing economic crisis .
The tribe 's Lynn Malerba issued a press release when the money was awarded , saying that the construction of a community center and government building would provide important jobs to unemployed workers and help the tribe finish a project that was both shovel - ready and integral to the tribe 's identity .
" Nearly 20 years ago , before the tribe gained federal recognition , creating a community and government center was our goal , " said Malerba .
" The community center is central to who we are as a people . "
The construction , which began in April 2007 and was halted in early 2009 in the economic downturn , has been scaled back by about $ 15 million from original plans .
In a statement to ABC News , USDA spokesperson Justin DeJong also said the loan would provide employment .
" The loan that USDA provided will help create an estimated 1,200 jobs for this shovel - ready project in Southeastern Connecticut .
Construction for the project was underway before the economic downtown , was suspended because of the credit crunch , and the USDA loan is helping the Tribe to restart construction . "
" As with all beneficiaries of funding through this program , " said DeJong , " the loan will be repaid to USDA with interest .
The loan will provide jobs for contractors in the area , and allow construction of a building that will house health , education , community programs , a library , and Tribal court -- critical infrastructure needed to keep rural communities strong throughout the country . "
$ 53.6 Million in Casino Profits
The Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority currently employs 9,600 people at the Mohegan Sun and other properties .
CLICK HERE to follow the ABC News Investigative Team 's coverage on Twitter .
In fiscal 2009 , $ 53.6 million in casino profits went into the coffers of the Mohegan tribe , which uses the money to fund college scholarships , housing and health care .
Each of the tribe 's 1,700 members receives personal payments from gaming proceeds , and though the amount varies , Bunnell told Newsday in 2009 that the annual per capita payment was " less than $ 30,000 . "
American Indian tribes have received about $ 2 billion in stimulus loans and grants since the passage of the Recovery Act .
The money received , by law , cannot be used for casinos or gambling projects , and is intended to revitalize Native American communities .
There are currently 564 federally recognized tribes , and about 300 Indian casinos .

2. Siegel : " With the exception of a few ambitious -- and obsessively competitive -- fiction writers and their agents and editors , no one goes to a current novel or story for the ineffable private and public clarity fiction once provided . "
So on the one hand we have obsessive , competitive authors and agents .
On the other , " ineffable private and public clarity . "
This does n't make sense -- the ambitious literary establishment may go to books for many reasons , but how does clarity connect to their obsessiveness ?
And while there are no doubt legions of readers who turn to fiction for " private clarity , " they certainly are n't limited to agents and writers .
And what exactly is the connection between " private and public " clarity -- are these two the same thing ?
Are they even related ?
1. Siegel : " Fiction has become culturally irrelevant . "
People buy books , read books , are right now camping on sidewalks to see " Twilight : Eclipse , " a movie based on a book , and they camp out in bookstores too , when a novel they 're eager for is sold at midnight .
Maybe these people are not part of our culture ?
So for fun , let 's see if I can resuscitate poor old fiction by addressing Siegel 's points , one at a time , as he lays them out .
Every few years someone finds a platform to declare fiction dead , despite all evidence to the contrary .
This time around , it 's Lee Siegel , writing in The Observer .
Siegel 's piece flogs a tired horse , that fiction is less central to our culture than it was in the 1950s and 1960s , and not as good .
It 's hard to figure out which is more problematic : how poorly Siegel 's argument is made , or how many things he gets wrong in the process .
Put down that dragon tattoo girl .
Stop catching up with Bree Tanner .
You do n't need any help from Kathryn Stockett , or to chew your fingernails through a hunger game .
Forget about the latest from Scott Turow or David Mitchell or Charlaine Harris or Paul Auster or Rick Riordan or Stephen King .
Novels are over .
Fiction is dead .
4. Siegel : " The practice of fiction is no longer a vocation .
It has become a profession . "
These are synonyms .
From the Random House Unabridged Dictionary ( my 1967 edition was my parents ' ) : " vocation : a particular occupation , business or profession ; calling " and " profession : a vocation requiring knowledge of some department of learning or science . "
Do writers want to find the vocation - profession sweet spot and both follow their calling and make a living ?
Probably .
Has this prevented them from responding to the New Yorker 's list , as Siegel claims ?
No .
5. Siegel : " It is only when an artistic genre becomes small and static enough to scrutinize that a compensating abundance of commentary on that genre springs into existence . "
If writing critically about an art form indicates that it is in its decline , that means there has n't been a rock song worth listening to since critic Lester Bangs died in 1982 , and that filmmaking ended with the 1965 publication of Pauline Kael 's " I Lost It At the Movies . "
6. Siegel does n't like critic James B. Woods ' book " How Fiction Works . "
I do n't much , either , but one critic 's poorly conceived manifesto is hardly enough to prove that fiction is dead .
7. Siegel : " The most interesting , perceptive and provocative writers of our moment write narrative nonfiction . "
This may be true .
I think we agree .
8. Siegel goes on to say that today 's nonfiction generates " existential urgency and intensity [ with ] the feelings with which people used to respond to novels ... "
Just because nonfiction may generate intense feelings does n't mean that those feelings have been taken away from fiction .
It 's like a parent saying , " Sorry , son , now that your little sister is born , all our love is going to her " -- love for reading is love for reading , and if Siegel and I are both feeling fondly toward nonfiction , there is still plenty of fiction love ( at least from me ) .
9 . That quote about fiction continues " ... feelings with which people used to respond to novels by Bellow , Updike , Mailer , Roth , Cheever , Malamud ... "
Fiction and nonfiction are both so lovable that Siegel has confused Mailer with a novelist on a par with John Updike and Saul Bellow .
But Norman Mailer 's best work was always his nonfiction , not his fiction ; " Harlot 's Ghost " and " Ancient Evenings " are a far cry from " Armies of the Night " and " The Executioner 's Song . "
10 .
In the postwar decades , Siegel writes , " So - called commercial fiction was just as relevant to people 's lives as so - called literary fiction . "
He lists some marvelous books of the period that he says were categorized as commercial fiction , which were " as primal as the bard singing around the pre-Homeric fire " ( I think that 's good ) .
But now " everything literary is also furtively commercial " ( I think that 's bad ) and " nothing is popular " ( also bad ) , " except for the explicitly commercial fiction that the literary crowd refuses ( or is unable ) to write . "
From what I can tell , he started out saying postwar commercial fiction was good because it was relevant to people 's lives , and he ends by saying contemporary literary writers both are " furtively commercial " yet not writing commercial fiction .
Issues of popularity , commercialism and literariness are all jumbled up .
And he conflates the idea of relevance to an individual 's life -- the intensity of response to a piece of writing -- to relevance with the culture as a whole .
11 . Siegel writes that the work of the magazine 's own nonfiction staff is the " best argument against The New Yorker 's self - promoting , vulgar list " of 20 novelists under 40 .
That makes sense only if you believe good nonfiction equals bad fiction .
Um , no .
12 . Fiction is , Siegel writes , " a museum - piece genre most of whose practitioners are more like cripplingly self - conscious curators or theoreticians than writers . "
While this might be argued , Siegel has n't argued it .
He touched on relevance , on popularity , on an obsessive literary establishment , on the quality nonfiction of decades past -- but he did n't address the content of today 's novels at all .
At this point , he 's just tossing insults .
13 . Siegel concludes that fiction is dead because nonfiction is alive .
I would argue that readers energized by one form will not abandon another ; it would take a small heart not to love them both .
Fiction lives !
It lives !

Keir Starmer QC , the Director of Public Prosecutions , announced today that no charges will be brought in relation to the death of Ian Tomlinson at the ' G20 protests ' in London on 1 April 2009 .
Introduction
This case concerns the tragic death of Mr Ian Tomlinson on 1 April 2009 .
Shortly before his death , Mr Tomlinson was struck with a baton and pushed very strongly in the back by a police officer , who will be referred to in this explanatory note as PC ' A ' , causing him to fall to the ground .
The matter was investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) and then passed to the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) to determine whether any charges should be brought against PC ' A ' , applying the Code for Crown Prosecutors .
After a thorough and careful consideration of all the available evidence , the CPS has decided that there is no realistic prospect of a conviction against PC ' A ' for any offence arising from the matter investigated and that no charges should be brought against him .
In the interests of transparency and accountability , the Director of Public Prosecutions , Keir Starmer QC , has decided that this detailed explanation of the circumstances surrounding Mr Tomlinson 's death and the reasons for the decision not to bring a prosecution should be published .
It is important to appreciate and keep in mind the questions that the CPS has addressed in this case , namely whether there is enough evidence resulting from the investigation to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and , if so , whether a prosecution is required in the public interest .
These are the questions set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors promulgated by the Director of Public Prosecutions under section 10 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 .
It is not the function of the CPS to make findings of fact and no such findings have been made .
PC 'A ' is entitled to be presumed innocent and that is the basis upon which the CPS has approached this case .
The incident in Royal Exchange
On 1 April 2009 a summit of financiers , bankers and leaders of industrial countries took place in central London .
The event was known as ' G20 ' because of the number of countries represented .
It was one in a series of summits across the world and earlier summits had attracted large scale demonstrations , some of which had become violent .
In the weeks leading up to the event in London there was a great deal of media coverage about possible disruption .
On the day , there was a significant turnout of demonstrators .
As is very often the case , many were peaceful but a sizeable minority were not , and criminal damage and some violence ensued .
There were reports that over 30 police officers suffered injury during the events of the day and the CCTV and other video footage shows a degree of violence from time to time , which appears to have become more serious as the day progressed .
In various locations , the police took action to deal with the disorder , including action to move people away from the Bank of England in Threadneedle Street .
Royal Exchange runs between Threadneedle Street and Cornhill and , in order to ensure that demonstrators did not get back behind police lines in Cornhill by using Royal Exchange , police officers were instructed to clear pedestrians from that area .
The police plan was to move pedestrians down Royal Exchange from the direction of Cornhill until they exited onto Threadneedle Street .
Mr Tomlinson had no connection with the demonstration on 1 April 2009 .
He had been in the general area for much of the day and appears to have been trying to get back to his residence but , because of the police cordons , was finding it difficult to do so .
He can be seen on CCTV pictures at various points in the area approaching police officers , and at one stage being moved by police officers because he was standing in the way of a police vehicle .
At just after 7 pm he was in Royal Exchange when the police started to move pedestrians out onto Threadneedle Street .
At about 7.15 pm , a senior police office gave an order for officers to form a cordon and move people from the junction with Cornhill out onto Threadneedle Street .
There were approximately 20 police officers in the cordon and they included six City of London police dog handlers .
PC 'A ' was part of this cordon as it made its way down Royal Exchange to Threadneedle Street .
One witness described Mr Tomlinson as looking ' disoriented ' as he was in Royal Exchange .
As the police line approached him , he had his hands in his pockets and walked slowly in front of the officers .
A police dog handler put his hand out to move Mr Tomlinson away and a police dog bit him on the side of his leg .
Mr Tomlinson did not appear to react to this dog bite , but continued slowly moving at an angle across the police line .
PC ' A ' , who was behind the dog handler , moved forward and using his baton struck Mr Tomlinson on the left thigh .
Almost immediately he pushed Mr Tomlinson very strongly in the back .
This push caused Mr Tomlinson to fall heavily to the floor and , because he had his hands in his pockets , he was unable to break his fall .
Bystanders helped Mr Tomlinson to his feet .
He then left Royal Exchange and walked a short distance into Threadneedle Street .
He was seen by members of the public to walk up the street and then appeared to bump into a building and slowly collapsed to the floor .
Members of the public came to his assistance , but Mr Tomlinson 's condition deteriorated rapidly .
Police and paramedics gave him first aid and sought to resuscitate him in the street and on the way to hospital but , regrettably , they were unsuccessful and Mr Tomlinson died .
The medical evidence
The Coroner for the District appointed a pathologist , Dr Patel , to carry out a post mortem .
He did so on 3 April 2009 .
No other medical expert was present .
Because Mr Tomlinson had walked some distance from the incident in Royal Exchange before collapsing in Threadneedle Street , the two events were not immediately linked and , when he carried out his post mortem , Dr Patel was not aware of the incident involving PC ' A ' .
He concluded that Mr Tomlinson 's death was " consistent with natural causes " and he gave the cause of death as " coronary artery disease " .
The family and the IPCC sought a second post mortem and this was undertaken by a second pathologist , Dr Cary , on 9 April 2009 .
He concluded that whilst Mr Tomlinson had a partial blockage of the artery , his death was the result of abdominal haemorrhage from blunt force trauma to the abdomen , in association with alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver .
It was Dr Cary 's view that when Mr Tomlinson fell , his elbow had impacted in the area of his liver causing an internal bleed which had led to his death a few minutes later .
On 22 April 2009 the Metropolitan Police Directorate of Professional Standards instructed another pathologist , Dr Shorrock , to perform a third post mortem .
Dr Shorrock agreed with Dr Cary 's conclusion .
Other expert evidence was obtained from Dr Wilson , Professor Williamson , Dr Alexander and Dr Sheppard .
Their evidence related to accident and emergency procedures , issues relating to the liver and microscopic changes to tissue .
The disagreement between the medical experts
In the face of this fundamental disagreement between the experts about the cause of Mr Tomlinson 's death , the prosecution team ( the CPS and the IPCC ) embarked on a detailed and careful examination of all the notes and findings recorded , and then held a series of meetings with the experts .
This inevitably took some considerable time .
In his first report , Dr Patel reported that he had found " intraabdominal fluid blood about 3l with small blood clot . "
This had been interpreted by the other medical experts to mean that he had found 3 litres of blood in the abdomen .
If Dr Patel had found 3 litres of blood , this would have been approximately 60 % of Mr Tomlinson 's blood volume and would have been a highly significant indicator of the cause of death .
However , when Dr Patel provided a further report on 6 April 2010 , he recorded that he had found " intraabdominal fluid with blood about 3l with small blood clot " .
Since Dr Cary and Dr Shorrock inevitably depended on Dr Patel 's notes of this finding to inform their own opinions , the significance of this more recent description of Dr Patel 's findings had to be clarified with Dr Patel and discussed with the other experts .
Dr Patel was seen twice in conference by the prosecution team .
Dr Patel maintained that the total fluid was somewhat in excess of three litres but that it was mainly ascites ( a substance which forms in a damaged liver ) , which had been stained with blood .
He had not retained the fluid nor had he sampled it in order to ascertain the proportion of blood because , he said , he had handled blood all his professional life and he knew that this was not blood but blood - stained ascites .
Dr Patel also confirmed that he had found no internal rupture which would have led to such a level of blood loss .
Dr Patel 's more recent description of his findings brought into even sharper focus the difference of opinion between him and the other experts as to the cause of death .
The prosecution team therefore met a number of the experts to explore where there was common ground and where , if possible , any differences could be reconciled .
As a result of that extensive exercise , the following became clear :
( a) Since Dr Patel had not retained the 3 litres of fluid he found and since he had not sampled it in order to ascertain the proportion of blood , firm conclusions about the nature of the fluid cannot now be drawn .
( b) For Mr Tomlinson 's death to have occurred from blood loss so quickly , there would have to have been an internal rupture of some significance .
( c) Dr Patel found no internal rupture which would have led to such a level of blood loss .
(d) At the later post mortems there was no visible sign of a rupture .
(e) Since Dr Patel was the only person to examine Mr Tomlinson 's intact body , he was in the best position to have considered the nature of the fluid he had observed and removed , and he was in the best position to have identified any rupture .
It is clear from this that even after the extensive exercise of examining all the notes and findings recorded carefully , and meeting with the experts on several occasions , there remained an irreconcilable conflict between Dr Patel on the one hand and the other experts on the other as to the cause of death .
Possible charges
The first issue that the CPS considered was whether the actions of PC ' A ' were lawful .
Having analysed the available evidence very carefully , the CPS concluded that there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of proving that the actions of PC ' A ' in striking Mr Tomlinson with his baton and then pushing him over constituted an assault .
At the time of those acts , Mr Tomlinson did not pose a threat to PC ' A ' or any other police officer .
Whilst the officer was entitled to require Mr Tomlinson to move out of Royal Exchange , there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of proving that his actions were disproportionate and unjustified .
Having concluded that the officer 's actions could constitute an assault , the CPS then considered the possible criminal charges .
Unlawful act manslaughter
Unlawful act manslaughter was the most serious charge considered .
This is where a killing is the result of the defendant 's unlawful and dangerous act where the unlawful act is one which all sober and reasonable people would realise would subject the victim to the risk of some physical harm , even though it might not cause serious harm .
In order to proceed with this charge , the CPS would have to prove a causal link between the alleged assault on Mr Tomlinson and his death .
On that issue , the medical experts were and remain fundamentally divided .
Dr Patel 's opinion is that Mr Tomlinson 's death was " consistent with natural causes " and that the cause of death was " coronary artery disease " .
The opinion of Dr Cary and Dr Shorrock is that Mr Tomlinson 's death was the result of abdominal haemorrhage ( internal bleeding ) caused by blunt force trauma to the abdomen .
A conflict between medical experts inevitably makes a prosecution very difficult , but the CPS proceeded on the basis that such a conflict need not automatically mean that a prosecution must fail .
For that reason , we explored at some length the possibility of proceeding without relying on the evidence of Dr Patel .
However , we were ultimately driven to conclude that , as the sole medical expert who conducted the first post mortem , Dr Patel would have to be called at trial as a prosecution witness as to the primary facts .
His evidence would be that there was no internal rupture and that the fluid consisted of blood stained ascites and not blood alone .
Even leaving out of account the stark disagreement between him and the other experts as to the cause of death , the CPS concluded that the evidence of those primary facts undermined the basis upon which the other experts reached their conclusions about the cause of death .
As a result , the CPS would simply not be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was a causal link between Mr Tomlinson 's death and the alleged assault upon him .
That being the case , there is no realistic prospect of a conviction for unlawful act manslaughter .
Assault
Two types of assault charge were considered : assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault .
Assault occasioning actual bodily harm would require the prosecution to prove that the alleged assault on Mr Tomlinson caused him actual bodily harm .
So far as the push on Mr Tomlinson is concerned , the conflict in the medical evidence prevents this .
If the push caused Mr Tomlinson 's death , the appropriate charge would be manslaughter , not assault occasioning actual bodily harm .
If , as we have concluded , the prosecution cannot prove a causal link between the push and Mr Tomlinson 's death because of the conflict in the medical evidence , it follows that actual bodily harm cannot be proved either .
The separate strike with the baton was also considered .
It had left patterned bruising .
But where injuries are relatively minor , as these were , the appropriate charge is common assault in accordance with the CPS Charging Standard , which is applied nationally .
This Charging Standard was applied in another incident arising from the G20 where a police officer had struck the complainant twice with his baton .
Common assault does not require proof of injury , but it is subject to a strict six month time limit .
That placed the CPS in a very difficult position because enquiries were continuing at the six month point and it would not have been possible to have brought any charge at that stage .
Misconduct in public office
The CPS also considered the offence of misconduct in public office .
The offence is committed when a public officer acting as such wilfully neglects to perform his duty and / or wilfully misconducts himself to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the public 's trust in the office holder without reasonable excuse or justification .
The offence is , in essence , one of abuse of the power or responsibilities of the office held .
The offence of misconduct in public office cannot simply be used as a substitute for other offences and simply being a police officer who commits a criminal offence , even one of assault , does not , without some other aggravating factor , automatically amount to the offence of misconduct in public office .
Mr Tomlinson 's death would be an aggravating feature , but for the reasons already stated , the prosecution cannot prove a causal link between the alleged assault and the death to the criminal standard .
The Court of Appeal has held that : " The threshold is a high one requiring conduct so far below acceptable standards as to amount to an abuse of the public 's trust in the office holder . "
In addition : " It will normally be necessary to consider the likely consequences of the breach in deciding whether the conduct falls so far below the standard of conduct to be expected of the officer as to constitute the offence . "
The ' likely ' consequences of pushing a person to the floor is that they may sustain some bruising .
But , in this case , on the analysis of the medical evidence set out above , the CPS would not be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tomlinson 's fall had caused him any injury .
As a result , we have concluded that the conduct of PC ' A ' did not meet the high threshold required to constitute the offence of misconduct in public office .
In reaching a decision about misconduct in public office , the CPS also took into account the fact that the Court of Appeal has indicated that it would be wrong to charge misconduct in public office as an alternative to a charge of manslaughter in circumstances where the prosecution cannot prove the cause of death .
As far as the dog bite is concerned , there is no evidence that the dog handler instructed or encouraged the dog to bite Mr Tomlinson .
The decision in this case was taken by Stephen O'Doherty , a Deputy Director of the CPS Special Crime Division and a highly experienced reviewing lawyer .
Advice was taken from Tim Owen QC , who is recognised as one of the leading lawyers in the country specialising in police law and criminal law .
The Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) reviewed all of the important material and also attended a number of the meetings with the medical experts .
Against that background , he is satisfied that the CPS carefully considered all the evidence in this case .
The CPS is aware that comment has been made about the time taken to reach a decision .
We understand the anxiety that this has caused to the family of Mr Tomlinson and the DPP discussed it with them .
He is satisfied that the CPS acted as quickly as was consistent with the thorough and careful review of the evidence that was necessary .
The review entailed not only the painstaking exercise of mapping the movements of all concerned , over many hours , but also the extensive exercise of seeking to resolve the complex and difficult areas of disagreement between the medical experts .
Conclusion
In this case there has always been and , despite the efforts of the prosecution team to resolve issues , there remains an irreconcilable conflict between Dr Patel on the one hand and the other experts on the other as to the cause of death .
As the sole medical expert who conducted the first post mortem , Dr Patel would have to be called at trial as a prosecution witness as to the primary facts .
As a result , the CPS would simply not be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Tomlinson 's death was caused by PC ' A ' pushing him to the ground .
That being the case , there is no realistic prospect of a conviction for unlawful act manslaughter .
It also follows that there is also no realistic prospect of a conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm or misconduct in public office .
The Coroner will now be informed of this decision so that he may move to an inquest .
At the conclusion of the inquest the matter will be reconsidered by the CPS in the light of any evidence which may be presented .
Steven Van Zandt ( guitarist in Springsteen 's E Street Band , actor in the hit show The Sopranos , and composer of the anti-apartheid song Sun City ) looks back at the role music and musicians played in the anti-apartheid movement .
With the Football World Cup , the biggest sporting event on the planet , taking place in South Africa this summer , it 's hard to imagine that the country was once an international pariah .
With the implementation of the apartheid system and the subsequent incarceration of Nelson Mandela , South Africa became a country which was abhorrent to many .
Amongst those who took up the fight to end apartheid were musicians .
Steven takes the story from the protest songs of the 1960s , led by Harry Belafonte , Hugh Masekela and Miriam Makeba ; through to Wembley in 1990 , when the newly freed Nelson Mandela spoke to the world at a concert hastily organised in his honour .
On the way he hears the stories behind several iconic anti-apartheid songs including Peter Gabriel 's Biko and Free Nelson Mandela , which was composed by Jerry Dammers of The Specials .
During the programme , Steven reveals that he took two trips to South Africa to find out more about apartheid in 1984 .
He wanted to meet with all the anti-apartheid groups and this meant going into Soweto , which was under constant police surveillance .
Thanks to the help of his record company , he was smuggled into Soweto under a blanket in the back of a car to meet with various groups .
One meeting was with AZAPO - the Azanian Peoples Organization .
He wanted to meet them to persuade them that the anti-apartheid war would be won via the media - not guns .
" I was white , an American and I had a Dutch name - people were n't too keen to talk to me !
Ultimately my freaky rock ' n ' roll appearance convinced them I was n't a government spy .
I entered a basement room , still under the blanket , there me and my two friends were greeted by about 15 or so of the Directorate of AZAPO ...
We then engaged in a conversation , which was quite adversarial from their point of view .
They did not like the fact I was there at all .
In their eyes I was a boycott breaker and they mentioned a few others on the list , a hit list which included Paul Simon .
I was in a strange state of mind in those days and for some reason I had absolutely no fear and I very calmly explained to them that their struggle , with all due respect , was misguided and the authorities loved the fact that they had picked up guns ... I had another way , I explained with my arrogant innocence , and in fact the only way this war was going to be won was through the media .
At a certain point in the discussion they went into a huddle to discuss whether to endorse my ideas .
Obviously I got lucky and on my way out I said to them : ' Listen , do us all a favour take Paul Simon and the others off that hit list , this is going to do you no good whatsoever .
And give me a shot , let 's see what we can do !'
It did n't occur to me til later just how lucky I had been to convince someone their war could be won on a TV , when they were living in a place with no electricity . "

Scott Mellanby
St. Louis Blues - Assistant Coach Back to Coaches Index ]
Scott Mellanby rejoined the Blues organization on June 1 , 2010 , taking the position of Assistant Coach on July 15 , after having served as a pro scout with the Vancouver Canucks .
The 6 - 1 , 210 - pound right wing led his team to the Stanley Cup playoffs in 11 out of 20 seasons , notching 53 points ( 24 goals , 29 assists ) and 216 penalty minutes in 132 career playoff contests .
Mellanby made trips to the Stanley Cup Finals with Philadelphia in 1987 and Florida in 1996 .
He also helped St. Louis advance to the 2001 Western Conference Finals against Colorado .
He helped Edmonton reach the 1992 Campbell Conference Finals against Chicago , and led the Flyers to the 1989 Wales Conference Finals against Montreal .
The native of Montreal , Quebec registered 840 points ( 364 goals , 476 assists ) and 2,479 penalty minutes in 1,431 NHL regular - season games with Philadelphia , Edmonton , Florida , St. Louis and Atlanta .
Of Mellanby 's 352 career goals , 135 have come on the power play and 51 have been game - winners .
He has recorded at least 40 points in a season on 11 occasions , including 50 points or more seven times .
He also tallied 20 or more goals in a season eight times , and reached at least 20 assists on 13 occasions .
He finished his career tied for 21st with Luc Robitaille on the NHL's all - time games - played list and has played in 70 or more regular - season games 13 times , including 80 or more on four occasions .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Continental and United Airlines parent UAL Corp. are expected to announce a merger deal early next week , creating a global airline with little route overlap and new opportunities to attract more premium - paying travelers .
" I see nothing but positives , " said Roger King , a bond analyst with CreditSights .
" These guys will have the best global network of any airline . "
UAL UAUA brings to the union a strong transpacific presence that Continental lacks .
While Continental CAL , +1.48 % has more routes to Latin America and its hub at Newark International Airport , a key domestic gateway between Europe and the U.S .
Bloomberg
" I think United 's lucrative Pacific routes were the tipping point for Continental to merge , " said Robert Herbst , an analyst with AirlineFinancials.com .
" It will help increase premium traffic from Asia and push yields higher , but mostly from the business side . "
Ticket prices could climb for some overseas routes due to less competition , but Terry Trippler from travel advisory firm Rules to Know said that will be short term .
" In the long run this will be good for travelers , " he said .
" Many more international flights , more international gateways ... more flights to Asia . "
United and Continental boards are reportedly meeting Friday to discuss the final details of the agreement and could have a deal inked by Monday .
Final negotiations hinge on whether the all - stock deal should include a share - price ratio .
Currently Continental shares trade slightly higher than UAL , closing Friday at $ 22.35 versus $ 21.60 .
UAL and Continental declined to comment .
Analysts expect U.S. antitrust regulators will give the new airline its approval , and none of the analysts MarketWatch spoke to could think of any gates or landing slots the new airline might be forced to sell .
Continental 's major hubs are in Cleveland , Houston and Newark , while United 's hubs are in Denver , Los Angeles , Chicago , San Francisco , and Washington , D.C .
There may be some capacity reductions for major markets as result of the merger , but budget carriers are likely to step in to fill any gaps .
New York , for example , could see more of United 's J.F.K operations move to Newark .
Combining operations between United and Continental is expected to go fairly smoothly .
They have a close relationship on international routes through the Star Alliance , and they share some ticketing , frequent - flier benefits , and certain ground and marketing operations .
Labor could create some headwinds , but pilot , flight attendant and mechanic groups from both airlines are currently in contract negotiations , increasing the opportunities for management to offer better pay and benefits to get personnel on board .
United has reportedly offered to lift its flight attendant pay to match that of Continental .
Pilots -- a key group that Delta Airlines DAL , - 0.09 % and Northwest went to great lengths to satisfy before fully committing to a merger deal in 2008 -- belong to the same umbrella labor organization , the Air Line Pilots Association .
That group has in place a policy for integrating pilot seniority lists in case of a merger .
Because of the minimal overlap between , layoffs and furloughs will likely be few .
" It 's more positive for them to have labor agreements first , but I do n't think they have to have them , " said Herbst .
United 's pilot union declined to comment , while no one at Continental 's pilot union was immediately available to respond .
Regardless of how smoothly the carriers join forces , the ultimate winner is still the industry as a whole , according to Hunter Keay , an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus .
" The big strength is a long - term one because it means one less legacy carrier to buy planes ; one less carrier to add capacity when the economy is getting better , " Keay said .
When did it stop being OK for first - person shooters to be silly ?
Once upon a time you just rocked up , ran down some corridors with increasingly powerful weapons and shot guys .
Most of those guys chose to defend themselves by dancing left and right , and they came from places like Stroggos .
Not these days .
These days you have to wrestle with mentalist ideologues and make choices with profound repercussions .
BioShock gave us Randian objectivism and attacked our notions of free will in video games .
Modern Warfare 2 was about ...
Well , nobody knows what Modern Warfare 2 was about , but you shot some civilians in an airport , which was a bit weird .
Meanwhile , Raven Software has been making Singularity - the first new IP to come out of the studio in a decade .
It 's about a guy who is sent to a secret Russian island , Katorga 12 , where mad scientists experimented with a rare element called E99 in the 1950s and it all went wrong .
Now it 's full of mutants , zombies and , predictably , angry Russian soldiers .
Guess what you use to subdue them ?
Increasingly powerful weapons !
There 's a machine gun , and a shotgun , and a sniper rifle , and a minigun , and a grenade launcher , and they 're all really fun to use .
Some have excellent alternative fire modes .
The grenade launcher alt - fire spits out a grenade ball that you can roll around with the left stick until you find someone to blow up .
There 's even a special gun that fires bullets you can pilot with the right stick , a bit like the Redeemer in Unreal Tournament .
We may have to refer back to a game from 1999 for context , but after a while playing Singularity you realise that it 's quite contemporary too .
There 's an upgrade system , there are exotic set - piece boss fights on trains falling off bridges and walkabout bits where a friendly mad scientist briefs you on what 's happening next , and there are lots of audio logs and reels of spoof USSR propaganda to watch .
Singularity looks lovely throughout , never afraid to be colourful and cartoon - like .
Sometimes it 's a lot like BioShock .
It even looks like BioShock .
Unreal Engine 3 has a ( slightly unfair ) reputation for turning out games that are similar in appearance , but Singularity only calls one game to mind with its cracked tiles , water effects , rust and rot .
All the pickups have that effervescent halo effect on them , and even the HUD 's the same .
The level of polish is also similar , to Raven 's credit .
You also have a special arm attachment called a Time Manipulation Device , which you get periodic upgrades for and which you need to inject energy into when its little meter is empty , plasmid - style .
You can use the TMD to make things older or younger , and this is handy in combat , where you can turn a Russian soldier into a skeleton or a shambling zombie .
It 's also the solution to many of the game 's basic puzzles , most of which involve ageing a crate between two states - rusty and compact , and strong and shiny - in order to jack open doors .
( And trust Raven , veteran magpies of the FPS genre , to make time - travelling crates a key component of their first new game for a generation . )
If you would n’t buy a used car from Silvio Berlusconi , the AC Milan president who doubles as Italy ’s prime minister , why would you buy a used soccer player from the man ?
Sure , the New York Red Bulls have been suckered into splashing out a bundle of money for French forward Thierry Henry and soon will do the same for Mexico defender Rafael Marquez , but New Yorkers have been taken to the cleaners by a whole succession of past - their - prime soccer players — Roberto Donadoni , Lothar Matthaeus , Claudio Reyna , the list is endless .
“ He is not over the hill , ” Red Bulls Coach Hans Backe said defensively , preempting the obvious question about Henry .
“ Everybody knows that I love this city , ” said Henry , presumably not referring to the team ’s Harrison , N.J. , digs .
And sure , the Chicago Fire has been fooled into believing that Mexican never - has - been Nery Castillo could be the second coming of Cuauhtemoc Blanco , which he is not , but at least the Fire has a get - out - of - jail card .
It obtained Castillo , 26 , on loan from Ukraine ’s Shakhtar Donetsk and can send him back where he came from if need be .
The Galaxy , meanwhile , is said to be dangling $ 24 million in front of AC Milan and Brazilian star Ronaldinho , in its latest move to achieve , well , no one is really clear just what Galaxy owner AEG has in mind .
Although a Ronaldinho - for - Landon - Donovan swap could be the game plan .
The Galaxy already has a competitive team , with the best record in Major League Soccer .
It already has solid attendance .
It already has “ name ” players in Donovan and David Beckham .
It plays in MLS , so even signing 11 Ronaldinhos would not lift it to European Champions League level .
MLS is where it is at and where it will stay .
So what exactly is AEG after ?
A few thousand more seats filled with warm bodies at the Home Depot Center in Carson and around the league ?
Possibly .
A trip to the MLS Cup final ?
Been there , done that .
Higher ticket prices and a bunch more shirts sold all across the land ?
Plausible and profitable , but can AEG manage the trick ?
Berlusconi has stated flatly that no matter what offer comes his way from the Galaxy , or from another would - be suitor , the Flamengo club in Brazil , Ronaldinho is staying put .
“ Ronaldinho is not transferable and we ’re all in agreement that he will remain at Milan as long as he continues to play , ” Berlusconi said Tuesday .
“ I have not spoken to him recently , but it is certain that he will be renewing his contract .
. . .
I consider him the best player of all time . ”
All of which is a flowery and convoluted way of saying : “ If the offer is more generous and if new AC Milan Coach Massimiliano Allegri opts not to give Ronaldinho much playing time , we can talk . ”
The Brazilian is gifted , of that there is no doubt .
He is an entertainer , capable of lighting up a stadium .
He is only 30 , unlike Henry , who turns 33 next month , so there are still quite a few miles left on the tires , even if Brazil did not take him to the World Cup this year .
But Ronaldinho is also high maintenance .
As much as he enjoys entertaining on the field , he enjoys even more being entertained off the field .
Suffice to say the word “ party ’ figures prominently in his vocabulary .
It got him into trouble when he played at FC Barcelona and it could give Galaxy Coach Bruce Arena fits .
Ronaldinho ’s brother and agent , Roberto de Assis , is playing it coy .
Ronaldinho is under contract with AC Milan through 2011 and there is a new offer on the table through 2013 , so De Assis has time to play one side against another .
The agent told Italy ’s Gazzetta dello Sport on Sunday that Beckham wants Ronaldinho in Los Angeles .
“ Should an agreement not be reached for a renewal at Milan , this could be an option for next summer , ” De Assis said .
Then , almost in the same breath , De Assis admitted that Ronaldinho would like to end his career with Flamengo .
“ This is his dream , ” he said .
The Galaxy has been staying silent on all this , but several scenarios are possible .
The most likely one is that Donovan returns to Europe after this MLS season , despite Commissioner Don Garber ’s insistence that “ it is my hope and my expectation that we have him for the rest of his career . ”
That ’s Garber playing the Berlusconi role .
Donovan , 28 , could rejoin English Premier League team Everton , whose captain , Phil Neville , said last week : “ I know for a fact that he wants to come back here . ”
Or Donovan could be snapped up by cash - rich Manchester City , whose coach , Roberto Mancini , said Wednesday that a pricey move for Donovan “ could be possible . ”
Would Galaxy fans trade Donovan for Ronaldinho , straight up ?
It seems to be the move AEG is trying to pull off .
Do n’t bet against it happening , no matter what Berlusconi and Garber say .

Thierry Henry has pleaded for understanding from fans over Cesc Fabregas ' potential return to Barcelona .
Arsenal legend believes skipper has tough decision to make
Arsenal legend Thierry Henry has pleaded for understanding from fans over Cesc Fabregas ' potential return to Barcelona .
The Catalan giants have made a formal bid to bring the 23 - year - old back to Camp Nou but the Gunners insist their skipper is going nowhere .
While record Arsenal goalscorer Henry , who moved on to Barcelona after eight years with the Gunners , hopes Fabregas will stay at the Emirates , he also understands the pull of a player wanting to return home .
He believes Fabregas now has a tough decision to make and has pleaded for understanding from fans as to whatever the Spaniard decides .
The veteran French striker , now with the New York Red Bulls , told : " Everybody knows I love Arsenal so for me as an Arsenal fan , you always want to see Cesc staying at Arsenal .
" But also how can you blame someone that wants to go back home because that is his home at the end of the day and you knew somehow that was always going to happen .
" You just do n't want it to happen now but as I said , I would n't like to be him right now because it is going to be a very tricky decision for him .
" But I will repeat it - as an Arsenal fan you want him to stay but you can't blame someone who wants to go back home .
" So I 'm actually not saying anything , I 'm just trying to play it like normal , you know .
" But , hey , I would n't like to be him right now and I just hope he 's going to make the right decision for him at the end of the day and I hope - whether he goes or he stays - that people will understand his decision , that 's the most important thing . "
EXCLUSIVE : Gary Coleman's Ex Manager Slams Ex Wife For Cashing In On His Death , Calls New Will Invalid
EXCLUSIVE : Gary Coleman's Ex Manager Slams Ex Wife For Cashing In On His Death , Calls New Will Invalid
EXCLUSIVE : Gary Coleman's Ex Manager Slams Ex Wife For Cashing In On His Death , Calls New Will Invalid
Gary Coleman ’s ex manager Dion Mial is blasting the D’ffrent Strokes star ’s ex-wife for cashing in on the actor ’s death .
In a statement released to RadarOnline.com Mial calls Shannon Price “ desperate , ” terms Gary ’s death “ mysterious , ” and asks everyone not to respond to any solicitations from Shannon .
Mial also claims that a new will by Gary Coleman is “ null and void , ” meaning that the will naming him as executor would still stand as valid .
The new developments come as Coleman ’s death on May 28 at age 42 has turned into a battleground of people with competing interests .
His parents battled his ex wife over the funeral , the ex wife has been shopping tales of his life and death and now multiple battles are breaking out over the actor ’s will .
RadarOnline.com was first to report that Shannon , who was secretly divorced from Coleman , was profiting from his death , asking for up to $ 50,000 an interview .
She shot an interview within 24 hours of the star ’s death and had that sold ; she then shopped another interview .
Mial slammed Price and gave RadarOnline.com this statement on Monday :
“ In light of Shannon Price ’s ongoing desparate attempts to profit from the mysterious death of her “ beloved husband , ” by way of the sale and / or distribution of pre or post mortem “ death photos , ” moment - to - moment televison interviews for pay , video tours of her former home , Gary Coleman ’s personal effects , photographs , or any items that have been removed from the home , without the written consent of a special administrator for or the executor of the Coleman estate , I emphatically request that all soliticiations from Shannon , or from any individual holding themselves out as her representative , be categorically denied and refused .
“ Knowing Gary , as well as anyone could have , I assure his closest family , friends and fans that his disdain for this behavior would be unquestionable and paramount to any foregoing profession of “ love ” for Shannon that might have ever poured from his lips . ”

Mial also told RadarOnline.com that he believes the 1999 Coleman will , naming Mial executor is still valid even though RadarOnline.com has uncovered a 2007 willl .
We ’ve also learned that the 1999 will benefits Mialm financially through a trust that is set up .
But the new will was created in 2007 and will be filed in court later this week .
Clearly that will be a new battleground .
Mial told RadarOnline.com exclusively : “ If there is an updated will then the person who is aware of it should probably come forward .
“ I am aware of a will for Gary Coleman that was filed in 2007 but that will was declared null and void .
“ Certain criteria needs to be valid under Utah State statutory Law and that will did not meet it so it is null and void .
“ Three different attorney ’s have told me that the will from 2007 is invalid . ”
Coleman Death Should Be Investigated , Says Ex Agent
Mial did not name the attorneys but expressed great confident that the 1999 will would stand up as valid .
Imagine hearing that Coca - Cola ( NYSE : KO ) was pushing its employees to stop using the word " Coke " to refer to its flagship product .
Or that McDonald 's officially disowned the " Mickey D's " nickname .
Sounds nuts , does n't it ?
I mean , what kind of company would waste the time and energy to try to kill an affectionate brand nickname that had been part of the American lexicon for decades ?
I 'll tell you what kind of company : General Motors .
According to a report in this morning 's New York Times , executives in GM's Chevrolet division have issued a memo ordering employees to stop using the word " Chevy " -- an iconic , immediately recognized term that has been used in GM advertising for over half a century -- in place of " Chevrolet " .
That 's the stupidest thing I 've heard all week -- and it's been a pretty stupid week .
What are you people thinking ?
Why on Earth would they do such a thing ?
According to the memo , signed by Chevrolet vice presidents Alan Batey and Jim Campbell , the problem is consistency of branding .
As they say in the memo : " When you look at the most recognized brands throughout the world , such as Coke or Apple ( Nasdaq : AAPL ) for instance , one of the things they all focus on is the consistency of their branding ... The more consistent a brand becomes , the more prominent and recognizable it is with the consumer . "
The Times was entertained by Batey and Campbell 's mention of " Coke " as an example of a consistent brand , and so am I .
The Times also notes , " Apple is not commonly used in reference to its products , which are known simply as iPads , iPhones and MacBooks . "
But that misses the real point , which is this :
Are you guys serious ?
These clowns are seriously worried about whether the Chevrolet brand is recognized by the American consumer ?
Listen up , Batey and Campbell :
If you 've got hard data showing that Chevy has some sort of brand recognition problem , I 'd love to see it .
Because I 'm thinking that Chevrolet is , if anything , a little too recognized .
Recognized for decades of building cars and trucks with paint that flakes and fades , cheap plastic interiors that squeak and rattle , bizarrely huge wheel - well gaps that scream " loser rental car " , moaning power steering pumps , all kinds of leaks ...
I could go on and on , as could millions of former Chevrolet owners .
Emphasis on former .
The real problem with Chevy
Guys , the problem is n't that the American consumer does n't recognize your brand .
I do n't need a million - dollar marketing study to know that .
The problem is that the associations the American consumer has with your brand are n't what you 'd like them to be .
It 's true that you 've gone a long way toward transcending the chronic problems I listed above , but you have n't transcended the perception of those problems .
( And you have n't transcended the perception that GM is run by a bunch of idiots , which this is n't helping .
But I digress . )
Think about where we are right now , historically speaking .
Thanks to its government bailout , post - bankruptcy GM has a second lease on life -- a window of time in which to restore some of its luster and market position and become -- once again -- a sustainable global industrial giant .
But it 's just a window , because the competition is fierce : Toyota ( NYSE : TM ) has struggled recently , but it remains a mighty global competitor .
And Ford ( NYSE : F ) -- which should be GM CEO Ed Whitacre 's model , and probably is -- is executing brilliantly on its daring turnaround plan , thanks to its relentless focus on the things that matter .
GM can't afford to waste time on semantics .
It 's long past time for the General to follow Ford 's footsteps and focus -- relentlessly -- on the things that matter in the brutal global auto marketplace .
" Chevy " versus " Chevrolet " is n't one of them .

Renowned financial commentator denounces “ fiscal fascism ”
Steve Watson
Prisonplanet.com
Friday , May 14th , 2010
Several more autocratic international voices have added their weight behind proposals to vastly empower the EU with greater authority to govern over nation states in Europe , in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis .
Meanwhile , one leading commentator has described the move as “ fiscal fascism ” .
Proposals tabled yesterday by the European Commission , the legislative arm of the EU , would greatly diminish the ability of nation states to set their own fiscal policies , in favour of a move toward a centralized european treasury .
“ There is still a long way to go .
We have opened the gate .
Now we have yet to go through it , ” said Ulrike Guerot , an analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations think - tank .
“ The crisis has shown us we need to animate moves toward closer political union as well as monetary union and we need a quantitative jump . ”
Guerot added in comments to Reuters .
“ The EU has used crises in the past to make that kind of jump and this is what is needed now . ” the German researcher concluded .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ This could be the fuel injection needed to put Europe on course toward closer political and economic union , the goal that drove its founding fathers and leaders a generation ago such as Germany ’s Helmut Kohl , France ’s Francois Mitterrand and former European Commission President Jacques Delors . ” notes Reuters writer Timothy Heritage .
The European CFR is a vehemently pro-EU outfit made up of hundreds of influential corporate and political figures , perhaps most notably including George Soros .
It was initiated three years ago primarily to push for an expanded role for the EU as a global superpower .
Inevitably , the group is consistently vocal when it comes to the question of greater political integration in Europe .
The European CFR is not related to the U.S. CFR , however support for mass centralization in Europe is shared .
On the prospect of a central European treasury , CFR Senior Fellow Marc Levinson notes :
“ Countries can not have it both ways .
Either they ’re in the eurozone or they ’re out .
If they ’re in , they have no control over their monetary policies , period .
If they want to leave , fine , but then they will probably have to leave the EU as well , and to remain out of the EU and the eurozone for a very long time .
And leaving the eurozone , by itself , will solve none of their economic problems . ”
Other voices echoing support for sweeping integration measures include Hans Martens , chief executive of the European Policy Center think - tank in Brussels , who notes “ This is the last chance to still be relevant in the world …
It ’s clear to everyone that Europe is becoming marginalized . ”
“ Europe faces a critical choice between greater integration and disintegration , ” Simon Tilford , chief economist at the Center for European Reform think - tank , also wrote this week .
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Former U.S. Treasury Secretary John
Snow have also advocated the move toward a fiscal union .
“ Will economic and financial distress finally be resolved by looking toward more integration in a closely integrated Europe , politically as well as economically ? ” said Volcker .
“ I do have my hopes , as a believer in the euro . ”
“ For the euro to be able to survive long term , fiscal consolidation of some kind — tax policy consolidation , fiscal policy consolidation — is probably necessary , ” Snow said .
As we outlined in our report yesterday , in addition to opening up supervision of countries ’ national budgets to the EU , the proposals also call for the creation of a European Monetary Fund or EMF – a permanent bailout mechanism .
The new rules will apply to Britain and Denmark , even though those countries are not part of the existing European Monetary Union and have retained their own national currencies .
London Telegraph international business editor , Ambrose Evans - Pritchard has penned an empassioned piece in today ’s newspaper in which he describes the move toward a federalized union in Europe as “ fiscal fascism ” , comparing it to “ the Gold Bloc fallacy of Continental Europe from 1931 to 1936 , the policy that led to Bruning ’s destruction of Weimar . ”
“ Just when you thought the EU could not go any further down the road towards authoritarian excess , it gets worse . ”
Evans - Pritchard writes .
“ Fonctionnaires and EU finance ministers will pass judgement on the British ( or Dutch , or Danish , or French ) budgets before the elected bodies of these ancient and sovereign nations have seen the proposals .
Did we not we not fight the English Civil War and kill a king over such a prerogative ? ” he continues .
“ Yet again we are discovering the trick played on our democracies by Europe ’s insiders when they charged ahead with EMU , brushing aside warnings by their own staff economists that monetary union was unworkable without fiscal union . ”
Evans - Pritchard notes , adding that the European elites behind the EU single currency knew that it would eventually lead to a crisis they could use to “ force sovereign parliaments to submit to demands that they would never otherwise accept . ”
“ The enterprise has become illegitimate – it is starting to exhibit the reflexes of tyranny . ” Evans - Pritchard concludes .

The country ’s largest defense - industry interests are on track in 2010 to make record - level campaign contributions as lawmakers enter the home stretch of an intense midterm election season .
The increase in donations from political action committees ( PACs ) associated with defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co. comes at a time of growing anxiety in the industry over the future of defense spending .
The Pentagon is tightening its belt , and some congressional leaders have called for cuts in defense spending to reduce the deficit .
Industry insiders say defense companies and their affiliated interests will fight to preserve their contracts and bottom lines .
That , in many cases , means seeking support for current spending levels from members of Congress , who hold the power of the purse .

So far this year , Lockheed Martin ’s PAC has already surpassed the contributions it made in election cycles over the past decade .
Lockheed ’s PAC has contributed $ 2,352,950 for the 2010 election cycle — an increase of more than $ 128,000 over 2008 .
By comparison , the PAC doled out $ 1,424,961 in 2004 and $ 1,048,223 in 2000 .
Jeff Adams , Lockheed ’s director of news and information , said the increase in PAC contributions could be attributed to an increase in membership and individual giving .
Adams noted that people join and donate to the PAC of their own volition .
The PAC of the Boeing Co. , which has both significant commercial aerospace and Pentagon business , has so far contributed $ 2,197,000 to lawmakers and party committees — close to $ 300,000 more than it spent in the 2008 election , according to data compiled from the Center for Responsive Politics and CQ MoneyLine .
In 2004 , the Boeing PAC doled out $ 1,220,330 , compared to $ 725,426 in the 2000 election cycle .
Both the Lockheed and Boeing PACs have maxed out contributions to several lawmakers , as well as to party committees .
Lockheed ’s PAC has maxed out its contributions to Reps .
Ike Skelton ( D - Mo. ) , the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , who is facing a tougher reelection fight than usual ; Buck McKeon ( R - Calif . ) , Armed Service ’s ranking member ; Patrick Murphy ( D - Pa. ) , a new member of the House Appropriations Committee ; Bill Young ( Fla. ) , the top Republican defense appropriator ; and Kendrick Meek ( D - Fla. ) , who is running for the Senate .

Lockheed Martin and Boeing have some of the highest - profile defense contracts with the Pentagon .
Lockheed is the maker of the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter — a program that has been restructured because of cost increases and delays .
But Lockheed has also looked to Congress to bolster contracts for the C - 130J cargo aircraft and C - 5 Galaxy cargo planes .
Meanwhile , Boeing has been engaged in a high - profile lobbying and public relations battle with EADS North America , the subsidiary of the European conglomerate behind Airbus .
Boeing is trying to convince both the Pentagon and Congress subsidies from European governments to Airbus should be weighed in the Air Force ’s refueling - aircraft competition .
Boeing has also tapped Congress to back a long - term contract for its F - 18 Super Hornet fighter jet .
The company is working to receive more money for its C - 17 cargo planes , an aircraft the Pentagon says it does not want .
EADS North America started a PAC in 2006 .
The PAC is on track to make record - level contributions this year .
So far this year , it has contributed $ 219,500 , compared to $ 189,100 in 2008 .
Watchdog organizations predict that in coming years competition for limited defense dollars will result in companies trying to preserve the business they already have .
“ They are going to be fighting to preserve the piece of the pie , ” said Steve Ellis , vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense , a nonpartisan organization .
“ Lawmakers are still the ones who are writing the checks .
The fewer dollars that are going around , the more vicious the competition , ” he added .
Sheila Krumholz , the executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics , said that there is an expectation from lawmakers that companies and their affiliated interests “ pony up ” the campaign contributions .
She added that history has already proven that the Washington strategy based on campaign contributions and lobbying “ offers a fantastic return on investment for those who play the game . ”

With four more months to go until the election , General Dynamics ’s PAC has contributed $ 1,342,400 to candidates and party committees during this election cycle — about $ 144,000 below what it spent in 2008 .
But federal records show that political contributions tend to increase in the last leg of an election .
For example , between August and November of 2008 , General Dynamics ’s PAC spent about $ 200,000 .
Northrop Grumman ’s PAC shows a similar pattern .
The PAC had already spent $ 1,493,050 by mid-July .
Overall , the PAC spent $ 1,623,250 in the 2008 election cycle , with about $ 242,000 spent in the last four months before the election .
Large defense companies and their PACs often find themselves in competition with each other when it comes to congressional contributions , said one defense lobbyist , who asked not to be quoted by name .
The companies are wary of falling too far behind their competitors .
The more money the PACs have in their coffers , the lobbyist said , the more lawmakers they can contribute to outside the traditional defense committees , potentially making new allies .

Less than 2 years ago , Kim Kardashians ass looked like this in a bikini ( and this and this ) .
Today in Miami she filmed a commercial for a diet pill called The Greatest Fucking Pill Ever , and now it looks like this .
Although there may be some side effects , like it might turn you into a paddle footed sea monster ( which way are her feet facing in this picture ?
Full size pic here .
Is it me or are her feet on backwards ?
It ’s me , right ?
I think the voices in my head are getting louder too , just for the record ) .
I wo n’t pretend this blog did n’t happen , but I do n’t want to have to look at it anymore .
It is , quite frankly , an embarrassment .
In an effort to make network neutrality impossible for the FCC temperament , Congressman Cliff Stearns ( R- FL ) yesterday introduced a new bill ( PDF ) that would require " neutral network neutrality . "
And no , that 's not a typo .
The bill would make it difficult for the FCC to proceed with its preferred approach to network neutrality , " reclassifying " Internet access as a telecommunications service over which the FCC has " common carrier " authority .
Before this can happen , the bill demands that the FCC send a lengthy report to Congress showing that " there is a market failure in the provision of such information service or Internet access service " and that " there is substantial evidence that the market failure is causing specific , identified harm to consumers by preventing a substantial number of consumers nationwide from accessing a substantial amount of lawful Internet content , applications , and services of their choice on a continuing basis . "
The FCC would have to conduct a detailed cost - benefit analysis of its new rules , could only propose rules that are " the least restrictive necessary to address the market failure and specific harm to consumers , " and could not prohibit managed services ( in which ISPs offer their own voice or video services that directly compete with other over - the - top Internet offerings , but can prioritize these own services on the grounds that they are " separate " from the Internet ) .
The FCC also could not prohibit network management , and it could not interfere with " measures designed to prevent or deter unauthorized or illegal activity , including copyright infringement . "
Taken together , the bill 's measures would gut most network neutrality rules , since they prohibit the FCC from regulating congestion management and quality of service decisions by ISPs .
Completely neutral
Stearns ' bill also requires the novel concept of " neutral network neutrality . "
This requires any new FCC regulations that meet the above criteria to be enforced " on a nondiscriminatory basis between and among broadband network providers , service providers , application providers , and content providers . "
In other words , whatever rules the FCC develops would need to be applied equally to Verizon , YouTube , Google , etc .
It 's not at all clear from the bill what this means ; the target does not appear to be actual content ( i.e. , YouTube somehow displaying a " neutral " set of videos ) but the connections between and among providers that take place outside the public - facing ISP networks .
ISPs have long complained that they are being unfairly targeted by network neutrality , even as backbone operators or content delivery networks would be exempt from the rules .
In a statement announcing the bill , Stearns called the FCC 's network neutrality plan a " partisan maneuver to regulate the Internet ....
It 's important to note that broadband is an information service outside the reach of Title II .
This point was affirmed by the US Supreme Court in its Brand X decision in 2005 . "
Perhaps Stearns would like to revisit the Brand X decision before opining on it .
That case , about the FCC 's decision not to open up cable networks to competitors , did not conclude that broadband was " outside the reach of Title II . "
The Supreme Court concluded that the FCC had the right to decide which title covered broadband services — a very different thing indeed .
In fact , the Court 's decision makes clear that " the Commission is free within the limits of reasoned interpretation to change course if it adequately justifies the change . "
As for the Court 's own view on the matter : " we express no view on those matters . "
When Brand X complained that the Commission was treating cable networks and DSL lines in different ways , the Court had " no view on how the Commission should , or lawfully may , classify DSL service . "
Broadband is only " outside the reach of Title II " because the FCC decided to make it so ; now it wants to make a different decision .
Stearns ' new bill aims to make that decision very difficult indeed — and top Republicans are joining him in pressuring the FCC to stand down .
Let ’s play detective !
As part of the How … To Find a Job in Canada series , I already talked about job scams .
Today , I will show you how to not be tricked by scammers based on a recent example .
A little while ago , I received a comment on the post 3 Qualities Job-Seekers Must Have .
The author of the comment was wondering if the job she had applied for was a scam .
She pasted a quote of the email she had received .
When I read the following , I knew it smelled bad : “ You will have to make a funds deposit with the company prior to issuing you the documents you will need to secure your work permit and upon your arrival to Canada , your money will be reimbursed back to you in full . ”
I contacted the commenter and urged her to not do anything before I investigate a bit .
At this point , I was 90 % sure this was an immigration job scam but I wanted to get to the bottom of things .
So , here goes the story .
The commenter , based in the Philippines , had applied for this job offered in Toronto , Canada .
The company , MET International , is an American company based in Carrolton , Texas , but it allegedly has an office in Toronto .
After she applied , MET International sent her a “ fund deposit agreement form ” .
She was supposed to send the company $ 500 for it to process her work permit application and to show her commitment to come work for the company in Canada .
There were quite a few red flags in just the email body :
The spelling was pretty erratic : random caps , weird punctuations such as in “ what we do , You can Visit our website ” .
It did n’t look professional at all .
The overseas applicant was required to “ make a Minimum deposit of $ 500 ” , which is “ just a mandatory policy that you made a deposit with the company prior to issuing out the documents ” .
“ The funds have to be transferred via western union or money gram ” .
I do n’t know for you , but for me , a Western Union deposit means “ you will never see your money again ” .
Additionally , the payment was supposed to be sent to a “ Regional Accountant ” , Mrs Laura Boynton , based in Florida , USA .
The address , “ 4616 W. Meadown Ave Suit 402 ” is n’t spelled properly and does n’t match a business .
As for the MET International Agreement itself …( click on the link to see the PDF ) :
The letterhead did n’t look professional , MET International logo looked scanned and was barely legible .
The address of the company office in Toronto ( 287 Macpherson Avenue Suite 301 ) did n’t match a business .
The agreement states : “ In a successful processing of the work permit , the above named applicant as automatically become an employee of the company , with the company responsible for financing the whole trip and responsible for providing a six month accommodation for the applicant with his / her family until he / she settles down .
The fund deposit of $ 500 which the applicant has initially deposited will also be refunded . ”
Really , this is too good to be true .
Some company when hiring overseas may provide moving expenses but no company will commit for so much ( and note that the phrasing is very vague ) .
Note that the job offer advertised for an administrative assistant / customer service position .
With all the respect I have for people working in similar positions , this is n’t the kind of job for which you must resort to hiring overseas .
Plenty of Canadians have the necessary skills to fill the position .
Finally , I visited the website of the company , MET International .
It appeared to be a legit business , although the address of the company was slightly different than the one in the email ( 1900 Surveyor Road instead of 1900 Surveyor Blvd ) .
However , a small line at the bottom of the page caught my eye : “ We are located in Carrollton , Texas , and DO NOT have any locations outside of this main location .
Please beware of anyone else trying to represent themselves as our company . ”
Ah AH !
So I guess there are no offices in Toronto , are they !
The way the sentence was phrased made me think that people were scammed before .
I wrote to the company :
“ I ’m Canadian and have a blog about immigration .
One of my readers recently send me an email about a supposedly job offer he got from your company .
It seems bogus to me .
I noticed your website states that you are located in Texas and do not have location outside the US .
Can you confirm that ?
Thank you for your cooperation ”
I received the following reply :
“ Yes , we are a small company with an office in Carrollton , Texas only .
These guys are scamsters .
We have reported to our local police , the FBI , but no results yet .
Hope someone catches them .
We have taken the pains to write a letter to anyone who emails us to ask if we have offices outside Texas .
A lot of people have thanked us for taking the time .
There are however a few naïve , desperate folks that have sent the $ 500 to these scamsters unfortunately .
Hope this comes to an end and these guys are brought to justice . ”
He added later :
“ They had a website metintl.com that was a CARBON copy of our website .
Our attorneys had to send legal paperwork to the hosting company to have that website shut down .
We are now trying to shut down their email address that uses the metintl.com .
Other companies have reported to us that they are also victims .
CWI in NJ is facing similar problems with these same scamsters . ”
I later found out that people were reporting this scam on Ripoff report on several instances .
The name of the company seems to be used in a variety of scams , including a phoney cheque scam and overpayment fraud scheme .
Morale of the story ?
Be very careful when applying for jobs abroad .
A lot of people want to come and work in Canada , in the U.K. , in the U.S.A etc. and scammers know how to use people ’s weaknesses .
Use your judgment to not be fooled and if something looks fishy , do some research before you commit to anything .
And remember : if it ’s too good to be true … it probably is n’t legit nor true !
GAZA ( Reuters ) - Israeli forces intercepted and were following an Irish - owned ship bound for Gaza on Saturday , a spokeswoman for the campaign group supporting the ship said .
“ They are being followed , ” Greta Berlin of the Free Gaza group said by telephone .
She said earlier that the Rachel Corrie was some 55 km ( 35 miles ) west of Gaza in the Mediterranean .
Al Jazeera television quoted a journalist aboard the vessel saying : “ We can see some Israeli ships a little away from us .
“ They are following us .
There has been no contact . ”
An Israeli military spokeswoman said she had no information .
Israel had said it would not let the ship through , five days after a convoy of six was halted , including a Turkish ship on which 9 men were killed by Israeli commandos who stormed aboard .
Israel has said it would accept the goods aboard the Rachel Corrie at its port of Ashdod , for onward land delivery to Gaza , but the activists have insisted they will dock in Gaza .
“ They are not going into Ashdod , ” Berlin said , adding that only if the Israeli navy seized the ship would that happen .
The vessel is named after an American pro-Palestinian activist killed by an Israeli army bulldozer in the Gaza Strip in 2003 .
Among those aboard the Rachel Corrie , campaigners said , were Nobel Peace Prize winner Mairead Maguire from Northern Ireland and Denis Halliday , an Irish former senior official at the United Nations .
If he were around today , Martin Luther might very well thump his 95 Theses angrily into a blog post .
Or perhaps he ’d stick them on a bus .
That seems to be the preferred vessel for religious provocations these days .
Over in the UK , they have a bit of a row taking place on the side of public transportation .
Last year , the British Humanist Association , a group supported by the renowned atheist Richard Dawkins , took out a cheeky ad out declaring : “ There ’s probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . ”
The ad rubbed some the wrong way , particularly a political party with God at their core .
So the party took out an antithetical bus ad : “ There definitely is a God , so join the Christian Party and enjoy your life . ”
Now a political entrepreneur across the Atlantic is getting on the bus ad wagon .
Pamela Geller , a conservative blogger ( and , thus , anomaly ) in Manhattan , has a particular gripe against Islam .
Together with Stop the Islamization of America , a New York - based organization , Geller made an ad buy voicing her concern :
Not surprisingly , the ad has ticked off a few Muslims who do n’t feel threatened by their faith .
“ I think it ’s stupid , sorry , ” one Queens resident told the Daily News .
“ You are free to believe whatever you want .
If you are in it by force , you are not a real Muslim . ”
Geller ’s ad arrives with the recent decision to construct a Muslim Center near Ground Zero in lower Manhattan .
The plan , which was endorsed last night by a community board , does not please Geller .
Certainly , she is entitled to her opinion .
And , if she can dole out the cash , entitled to stick it as many places as she can .
The MTA sees no problem with Geller ’s provocative ad buy .
But the agency and Geller should be warned : over in the UK , the Christian Party signs brought over 1,200 complaints in the past year — more than any other ad .

PROVO --
Law enforcement officers sworn to protect the law , not break it .
Now Spanish
Fork 's chief of police being investigated for shoplifting at a Provo department store .
Provo police have confirmed the chief was caught allegedly shoplifting in a Provo department store .
But it 's a case they 're staying very tight - lipped about .
Spanish Fork Police Chief Dee Rosenbaum
The incident happened June 5 at the Provo Towne Centre Dillard's .
Dillard 's security called Provo police for assistance just before 1 p.m .
When officers arrived , they recognized the person in security custody .
It was Dee Rosenbaum , the longtime chief of police in nearby Spanish Fork .
" It makes this case somewhat unique because it 's not cut and dry ; and that is one of the reasons why this case will be sent to the city attorney after the investigation , " says Provo police Capt .
Cliff Argyle .
When officers arrived , they did not cite him , nor did they arrest him .
According to a loss - prevention officer at a separate department store , shoplifters are dealt with in a few different ways :
If the merchandise stolen is between $ 0 and $ 300 , it usually results in a citation .
If the total is between $ 301 and $ 999 , the case will likely be reviewed by a prosecutor .
If the amount is $ 1,000 and above , it 's a felony and the person would likely be arrested .
Provo police wo n't release any details about the case .
They say the case is still under investigation , so they can't comment .
" There 's still something out there .
We want to make this case clearer , and so we 're going to check into it further , " Argyle says .
KSL News tried to contact Chief Rosenbaum , but the Spanish Fork Police Department referred us to the assistant city manager , Seth Perrins , who said city administrators are aware of the situation .
( Read a statement from Perrins here . )
" We are awaiting further information from Provo City before we conduct an investigation on our end , " Perrins said .
Provo police say the incident was captured on surveillance video .
It is still possible charges could be filed against Chief Rosenbaum .
Provo police say they will release the details of the case once the investigation is complete .

Un cambriolage virtuel pourrait avoir des conséquences bien réelles en Finlande , où la police a annoncé mardi qu'elle enquêtait sur le vol de meubles dans Habbo Hotel , un jeu en ligne multijoueurs très apprécié des adolescents .
« Un nombre important de biens virtuels » ont été dérobés à environ 400 utilisateurs du site , selon la police .
Les internautes peuvent en effet se créer un personnage et passer du temps avec des amis , s'occuper d'animaux virtuels ou , parfois en versant une somme d'argent bien réel au site , meubler leur chambre .
Les cyber - cambrioleurs ont réussi à insérer dans le jeu de fausses pages web pour obtenir noms et mots de passe , qu'ils ont ensuite utilisés pour entrer dans les profils des joueurs de Habbo et détourner leurs biens , a expliqué la police dans un communiqué .
Une méthode finalement très proche des très habituelles techniques de phishing qui tentent de tromper les internautes imprudents pour récupérer leurs coordonnées bancaires .
Le but des cyber - cambrioleurs n'a pas été précisé , mais il semble que ce soit plus une volonté de sabotage que de gain financier , car le jeu ne prévoit pas de possibilité de ventes entre joueurs .
Les enquêteurs ont déjà perquisitionné des logements dans cinq villes de Finlande , saisi des ordinateurs et interrogé plusieurs personnes , selon la même source .
Ce n'est pas la première fois que la police intervient dans ce genre d'affaire .
En novembre 2007 , un adolescent de 17 ans d'origine hollandaise a été arrêté pour le vol virtuel de 4000 dollars de meubles sur le même site , et cinq cyber - délinquants âgés de quinze ans également soupçonnés .
« Les accusés ont obtenu par la ruse les mots de passe de leurs victimes en créant de faux sites sur l'univers Habbo » , avait alors déclaré la police .
Si ces « cambriolages » existent depuis longtemps sur la toile , 2007 marque la première intervention policière réelle .
Environ six millions de personnes dans 30 pays , dont la France , sont inscrites sur Habbo Hotel , selon le porte - parole de Sulake , l'entreprise qui administre le site .
( Avec AFP , mais pas que ... )

Yoo publicly debated last month the radical notion of the " unitary executive " - that the president , as commander - in - chief , is sole judge of the law , unbound by hindrances such as the Geneva conventions , and has inherent authority to subordinate independent government agencies to his fiat .
This is the cornerstone of the Bush legal doctrine .
Yoo 's interlocutor , Douglass Cassel , a professor at the Notre Dame law school , pointed out that the theory of the unitary executive posits the president above other branches of government : " Also no law by Congress .
That is what you wrote in the August 2002 memo . "
" I think it depends on why the president thinks he needs to do that , " said Yoo .
The " unitary executive " is nothing less than " gospel " , declared the federal judge Samuel Alito in 2000 - it is a theory that " best captures the meaning of the constitution 's text and structure " .
Alito 's belief was perhaps the paramount credential for his nomination by Bush to the supreme court .
Alito 's manner before the Senate judiciary committee 's hearings has been prosaic and dutiful .
He seems like an understudy for the part of Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman .
But behind the facade of the supplicant who wants to be liked seethes a man out to settle a score .
Few public figures since Nixon have worn their resentment so obviously as Alito .
The son of a civil servant , he attended Princeton and Yale law school .
" Both opened up new worlds of ideas , " he testified .
" But this was in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
It was a time of turmoil at colleges and universities .
And I saw some very smart and privileged people behaving irresponsibly . "
In his application to the Reagan justice department , Alito wrote that his interest in constitutional law was " motivated in large part by disagreement with Warren court decisions ... particularly in the area ... of reapportionment " - which established the principle of one person , one vote .
Alito 's law career has been a long effort to reverse the liberalism of the Warren supreme court .
In the Reagan justice department , he argued that the federal government had no responsibility for the " health , safety and welfare " of Americans ( a view rejected by Reagan ) ; that " the constitution does not protect the right to an abortion " ; that the executive should be immune from liability for illegal domestic wiretapping ; that illegal immigrants have no " fundamental rights " ; that police had a right to kill an unarmed 15 - year - old accused of stealing $ 10 ( a view rejected by the supreme court and every police group that filed in the case ) ; and that it should be legal to fire , and exclude from funded federal programmes , people with Aids , because of " fear of contagion ... reasonable or not " .
Against the majority of his court and six other federal courts , he argued that federal regulation of machine guns was unconstitutional .
He approved the strip search of a mother and her daughter although they were not named in a warrant , a decision denounced by fellow judge Michael Chertoff , now secretary of homeland security .
And Alito backed a law requiring women to tell husbands if they want an abortion , which was overturned by the supreme court on the vote of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor ,
On the supreme court , as O'Connor 's replacement , he will codify the authoritarianism of the Bush presidency , even after it is gone .
