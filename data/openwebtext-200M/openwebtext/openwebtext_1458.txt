In the first major fracture between television show owners and the wildly popular Hulu.com , Viacom will remove “ The Daily Show With Jon Stewart , ” “ The Colbert Report ” and other Comedy Central programs from the video site next week .
The companies said Tuesday evening that they were parting amicably , but Viacom ’s decision is a serious loss for Hulu .
This week “ The Daily Show ” is listed as the third - most - watched show on the site , behind “ Lost ” and “ Family Guy . ”
The decision also highlights the large gulf between the expectations of consumers — who demand a wealth of free and easily accessible content on the Internet — and the media companies , who are seeking a more profitable business model online .
“ We tried to reach a deal .
We got close .
We continued to talk even over the weekend .
But we could not agree on a price , ” said a person involved in the Viacom negotiations who requested anonymity because the process was conducted in private .
The three - year - old Hulu dominates the mushrooming market for online full - episode TV viewing , with more than 44 million monthly visitors , according to comScore , the online measurement firm .
The site ’s monthly video view totals have surged in recent months , from 580 million last September to 1.01 billion last December .
But Hulu is unprofitable , according to analysts .
The site ’s advertising sales staff has struggled at times to keep pace with the torrid growth , and a partial pay model has been discussed by its owners , which include three of the broadcast networks , ABC , NBC and Fox .

The prospect of free travel is so alluring that an entire industry has sprung up around collecting frequent flyer miles .
Hotels , rental car agencies , and of course credit cards all offer enticing programs .
While many people enjoy exploiting these programs to their fullest potential , plenty of people become disaffected with mileage programs due to their complexity and constant devaluation .
If you ’re one of these disillusioned people , get ready to turn your perspective around .
You can learn to earn free travel both with and without using points and miles .
Flying for Free without Frequent Flyer Miles
First , here are four individual techniques that I have found effective for earning free travel without resorting to frequent flyer miles .
1. Get Bumped
Airlines have been flying their planes more full than they ever have .
The only way that they can achieve this efficiency is by overselling their flights and counting on some passengers not showing up .
When they end up with more passengers than seats , carriers are required to solicit volunteers to give up their reservation in exchange for compensation .
Airlines used to offer free flight vouchers that had restrictive blackout dates , but now you can receive airline credit in the form of vouchers that can be worth hundreds of dollars and used on any ticket .
How to do it : First , when you book your next trip , try to identify flights that are likely to be overbooked .
These are flights to and from major business destinations at the beginning and ends of the work week .
Flights around the holidays are also good candidates for a bump .
On the day of your trip , pack light and do n’t check any bags ; airlines look for passengers who can change plans at a moment ’s notice without any complications .
Lastly , get to the gate at least an hour early and speak with the agents the moment they arrive .
Just smile and ask if they are “ looking for volunteers . ”
Airline staff will know exactly what you are talking about and you will be the first on the list if there is any chance they need you .
If no staff people are available , or if you find out that they ’re not currently looking for volunteers , make sure you grab a seat near the counter so you can quickly get to the agent if they make a change and an announcement .
If you ’re on the list , you will be instructed not to board until the last minute once they know if they can accommodate all confirmed passengers .
If you do receive the bump , have an alternate flight in mind so that you can request it .
2. Take Advantage of Promotions
I recently visited a bicycle race that was sponsored in part by an airline .
They set up booth where they were giving away gift cards , worth $ 10 to $ 50 off of any flight .
They were happy to give me a dozen cards .
The next day , the same company had a promotion offering fares starting at $ 9 , and we were able to use the gift cards for the entire cost of a trip including taxes .
How to do it :
We were lucky to get a dozen cards right before the $ 9 promotion , but that good fortune came because we are constantly on the lookout for discounts and promotions .
You need to be on high alert if you want to get the best timing and the best deals .
In addition to gift card giveaways , airlines frequently hold other contests and promotions to gain publicity .
To help you find these promotions , sign up for newsletter lists from airlines , and keep an eye out for airline sponsorship at sporting events and festivals .
If you land a gift card or coupon but can only use one per reservation , maximize them by booking separate one - way flights , instead of a round trip .
That way you ’ll be able to use both discounts , one for each leg .
3. Find Companion Vouchers
Many companies offer free or discounted companion vouchers .
For example , the Delta SkyMiles Platinum Card from American Express ( a Money Crashers partner ) offers customers a free companion voucher each year .
You can apply the voucher to any regular online bookings .
The US Airways Premier World MasterCard also offers a similar benefit .
How to do it :
When you ’re choosing a credit card , look for airline benefits but pay extra attention to the restrictions in the fine print .
Some of the companion passes offered in promotions through third parties require you to book the tickets through an obscure travel agency .
With these plans , you can easily end up being forced to pay at least double the normal price before you can earn your “ free ” ticket .
Other restrictions on these third - party vouchers include blackout dates and capacity restrictions .
The most valuable companion vouchers will always be the ones offered directly by airlines that contain few , if any , restrictions .
4. Complain
Airline service is less than perfect , to say the least .
The companies ca n’t do anything about the weather or air traffic control , but they ’re still responsible for their customer service .
You can take advantage of how willing they are to resolve issues by providing discounts or free flights .
When you have suffered a service failure , or if you ’re disappointed in your gate experience or staff on the flight , report your problems to the airline .
If you ’re professional , specific , and reasonable in your complaint , they ’re likely to reward you with valuable vouchers good for future travel .
How to do it :
Write a brief , polite email to the airline ’s customer service department .
Remember that the person reading your complaint will likely be viewing hundreds that day , so keep it to the point and leave out personal details .
The goal is not to elicit sympathy with a sad story , but to focus on the actions of the airline .
Do not threaten to never fly with the airline again ; just indicate your loyalty to the company and the amount of business you intend to give it in the future .
How to Use Miles to Travel for Free
After you ’ve exhausted all of the non-mileage methods of scoring free flights , you ’ll discover that there are many easy way to earn and use miles to travel the world for free using customer loyalty programs .
Even if the flight is not completely free , using miles can allow you to travel in business class or first class for less than the price of an economy ticket .
5. Earn Miles from Credit Card Spending
Using credit card rewards wisely is step one to earning your way to a free flight .
Once you have one of the best travel rewards credit cards with mileage rewards , use it as your primary method of payment for your day - to - day expenses .
The key is to always pay your balance in full and on time ; otherwise your miles earned will be a worth fraction of the interest you will owe .
Savvy mileage collectors eventually find themselves charging utility bills , parking fees , or any other purchase they can use their credit card for .
6. Get a Credit Card Sign - up Bonus
Big spenders can earn a great deal of miles on their credit cards , one for each dollar charged .
The rest of us , however , have learned that it can take years of spending to earn enough miles for a free flight .
Fortunately , there ’s a shortcut : sign - up bonuses .
With the best credit card sign - up bonuses out there , you can instantly earn multiple free flights just for getting approved for a card .
As with rewards card spending , always pay your bill on time , never carry a balance , and do n’t ever spend more just for the miles .
7. Buy Miles
Ever since frequent flyer programs got popular , airlines have made miles available for almost every type of spending activity .
They sell miles to corporate partners , and the partners give the miles away .
Finally , the airlines cut out the middlemen and starting selling them directly to their customers .
Normally , the purchase of miles is not a good deal , but you can find regular promotions that make sense .
For example , US Airways and Delta have run prior promotions in which you can buy miles for half the normal price .
Depending on your destination and the time of year you are traveling , a promotion like this can allow you to fly in business class for less than the price of coach .
8. Maximize the Value of Awards
Earning miles and points is only half of the game .
The other half is finding the deals when you use your miles and points .
The problem is that the airlines feel like they have no incentive to maximize the value of your miles , and they devote scant resources to assisting your search .
In most cases , airline partner awards to international destinations represent the best value for your miles , but it can be extremely difficult to search for these flights on partner airlines using your miles .
US Airways , for example , has no way to search for partner awards online , but there are some tricks and techniques you can try to redeem US Airways Dividends miles .
Delta , on the other hand , has an award search engine on its website .
The problem is that it does n’t work most of the time , forcing you to use some creative strategies to redeem Delta SkyMiles rewards .
9. Earn Miles by Flying
While racking up travel used to be the easiest way to work your way to a free trip , lately it ’s been the toughest method .
Still , it does n’t hurt to add to your mileage balance by traveling , especially if you can get your business to pay for it .
Never book a flight without using your frequent flyer number .
When you complete your trip , confirm that your mileage has posted to your account .
If you ever forget to provide your number when you book , follow up with your carrier to get your miles added .
10 . Maximize Miles by Choosing the Longest Route
Some people who are trying to pile up the travel miles will go so far as to book a flight with a connection in a distant city to earn more miles .
If you have the time to spare , and you do n’t mind the extra travel time , you can route yourself through one or more distant airline hubs rather than simply take the shortest connection .
11 . Earn Free Miles with Partners or Retailers
Every airline has a list of partners that try to advertise products by giving away some miles .
You can get extra miles by answering a survey or watching a promotional video .
Bose , for example , recently ran a promotion in which they gave away 150 Delta SkyMiles to anyone who watched a one - minute video about one of Bose ’s new headphones .
Other times , you may need to make small purchase , open an account , or get an insurance quote .
You ’ll rarely get a lot of miles , but these are easy to get and each one helps .
Spend a few minutes looking through the mileage section of an airline ’s website and you will be amazed at how many ways you can get miles without much effort .
Also , monitor retailers ’ websites and emails that will often mention these deals .
12 . Earn Miles with Online Malls
Not only do airlines have individual partners that offer mileage , they also partner with online shopping retail sites .
Nearly every airline has an online shopping mall where customers can earn extra miles from purchases at many retailers .
You sign in , and then click through from the mall ’s website to one of their retail partners ’ sites .
The site places a cookie on your computer , and then your purchases will be tied to the frequent flyer mall so you ’ll start compiling miles .
Note :
This is not the same as the “ SkyMall , ” which is filled with overpriced novelties ; these are links to popular department stores , home improvement stores , and other major online retailers .
13 . Transfer Miles to Airline Programs
There are some great mileage transfer offers from hotel chains and their affiliated credit cards .
For example , the Starwood hotel chain lets you earn points that can be transferred to miles with over 20 different carriers .
In fact , some travelers use the Starwood Preferred Guest American Express Card ( a Money Crashers partner ) to earn these points , even without staying at their hotels .
Hilton , Hyatt , and other chains also offer the option to trade hotel points for airline miles , with various exchange rates .
14 . Concentrate Your Miles on Just a Few Programs
While you ’re usually better off flying the airline with the best price and schedule , many travelers choose to only fly with one or two carriers .
This way , instead of having a few miles with a lot of airlines , they concentrate all of their miles and make their way to free flights faster .
Fortunately , you can credit your miles to any airline with an alliance .
For example , perhaps you normally fly US Airways , but are flying United to Chicago and Lufthansa to Europe .
You could open up accounts with each airline and earn a few miles in several programs , or you can credit all of your miles to a single account , since all three airlines are part of the Star Alliance .
By earning all of your miles in just one program , you will reach awards faster and may even attain elite status , enabling you to earn even more miles .
15 . Earn Miles with Airline Promotions
Typically , when an airline introduces a new route , or they are trying to drum up business to fight off a competitor , they will offer extra miles to their customers who fly certain routes during a particular time frame .
The key is that you have to register for the promotion in advance .
Since registration is free , always register for all promotions on the airlines you fly on the off chance that one of your flights will qualify .
Stay on the airline ’s email list to be aware of these promotions well in advance so that you can plan accordingly .
Final Word
Getting something for free is never easy , but in the case of air travel , it ’s not necessarily impossible .
By picking a few of these strategies , you can earn your way to a free flight without spending an unnecessary extra dollar .
It ’s the goal of every frugal traveler by taking advantage of frequent flyer programs and other clever methods .
You do n’t even have to travel very often to find that a free ticket is within reach .
Study at all the ways to earn free travel , with and without miles , and you can determine the ones that fit your spending habits .
You ’ll end up saving far more money than even the most extreme couponing artist .
On a Korean War battlefield in 1950 , the young , patriotic Kim Chin- kyung , then just 15 , lay limp on the ground , wounded by shrapnel .
In the months leading up to that moment , nearly all of the 800 troops in his South Korean Army unit had been wiped out .
He was n't sure if he would make it , either .
So he struck a deal with his creator .
" I told God that if I survived , I would return the love to my enemies , " he says – his enemies at the time being North Korean and Chinese soldiers .
Nearly 60 years later , Dr. Kim has kept his promise – but in a way that has dropped the jaws of even the most hard - headed naysayers .
He 's the founder of the first privately funded university in communist North Korea , the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology ( PUST ) , a $ 35 million graduate school in the capital , Pyongyang , expected to start classes in April .
With an international faculty , courses taught in English , and eventually 2,600 students picked by the North Korean government , his work is a monumental step in opening relations between the two Koreas , which have been divided for more than half a century , his supporters say .
Kim first conceived of PUST about 15 years ago , when he decided educating youngsters in science and technology would be the best way to open diplomatic bridges between the North and the South .
" Educating people is a way to share what they love , and share their values , " muses Kim who , ironically , was imprisoned in Pyongyang in 1998 on suspicion of being an American spy .
Around the 248 - acre campus will be a " Pyongyang Techno Park " in which foreign firms are invited to invest .
Ben Rosen , an early investor in Compaq Computer , who toured the construction site in 2008 , has given the project his thumbs up .
The university will start out modestly , with only 150 students enrolled in the first class .
At first , PUST will consist of three schools : industry and management ; information and communication technology ; and agriculture , food , and life sciences .
Within a few years the university plans to add an engineering school and a public health school , Kim says .
Even after four years of delays , the project 's humble beginnings have n't deterred Kim ( who now goes by the Western first name of James ) .
After all , this is the second time he 's built a college in an isolated communist country , an earlier success that in part led the North Korean government to approve PUST in the first place .
In 1992 , at a time when China was much more closed to foreigners , Kim , a philosopher and theologian by training , founded the first foreign - owned university in northeastern China , called the Yanbian University of Science and Technology ( YUST ) .
Ask Kim about where he finds his inspiration , and he 'll always say " love . "
The cheerful professor sees love as a force that stretches across borders , with education as a toolbox to apply it .
That point of view arose from his near - death experience 60 years ago , when he realized his life could be put to use helping his enemies .
" Their political system does n't matter , " he says , referring to his first project in China .
" If you approach them with love , they will move their hearts . "
When dealing with students , the jovial and charismatic Kim gives out all the love he can muster .
At YUST , Kim and his wife lived in the same dorm building as his students , and he often roamed the hallways talking with them .
Along with their formal studies , students were expected to help out at nursing homes and orphanages as part of their education – part of Kim 's philosophy of service to humanity .
The commitment to service Kim imparted to his students in China brings employers from all over South Korea and China to recruit at YUST .
The university is widely considered one of the best in that country .
For that reason PUST will take a similar approach .
But because PUST is being built under a closed and staunchly anti-Western regime , Kim sometimes hears skepticism about his project .
" We do n't expect PUST to be successful , " says Myung Il - kwak , a manager at the North Korean Intellectuals '
Solidarity , a group of North Korean academics who have defected to Seoul , in South Korea .
" The regime is [ putting ] a lot of restrictions on what foreign professors can do and can't do .
It will be hard to get a normal and good education under these conditions . "
Yet critics expressed the same reservations when Kim founded YUST , now a success .
The regime could use the university to educate military scientists , who could then speed up North Korea 's development of nuclear and chemical weapons , Mr. Myung adds – though he also concedes that possibility is unlikely .
Kim has heard that criticism , and says science education can be put to use for good purposes , too .
" It 's a matter of how humans value it [ science ] , " he says .
" If people use it the wrong way , they can make bombs and kill each other .
Or with nuclear technology they can create electricity . "
Others have said PUST will help prepare the country for an inevitable change of regime by training a generation of internationally minded technocrats who will one day be in power .
PUST is funded mostly by aid groups and through Kim's own savings , which he earned from running three small businesses in South Korea and Florida between the 1960s and 1980s and by selling his house and belongings .
" I started the businesses to fund the universities , " he says .
" Peace has a price , and it should be paid by those who have money . "
Money , however , was not the deciding factor in Kim 's success .
Rather , it was his passion for education .
" When I went to China and North Korea , I told them I was not a capitalist or a communist , " he says .
" I was simply a ' love - ist . ' "
Like the first appearance of ramps at the farmers ' markets , there 's no surer sign of spring than the arrival of new Ben & Jerry 's flavors .
March has typically been the month when the first new Ben & Jerry 's flavors of the year make their debut , but it can take some legwork to actually locate them out in the wild .
For me , the fun has always been in the thrill of the hunt that leads up to that first sighting .
The excitement soon melts away , though , as these new pints blend in next to their contemporaries until they become fan favorites or are entombed forever in the Flavor Graveyard ( R.I.P. Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough , Concession Obsession , Wavy Gravy ) .
For the past few weeks I 've been patrolling the grocery stores in my neighborhood and even widening my search to stores I typically do n't frequent , and this past Thursday I found ice cream nirvana at the local Safeway where I uncovered a complete cache of the new flavors — and at an introductory price of $ 2.79 per pint .
Allow me to introduce the new flavors :
Boston Cream Pie
Boston Cream Pie ice cream with Yellow Cake Pieces , Fudge Flakes and Swirls of Pastry Cream
This Parker House Hotel classic is technically a cake , and chunks of cake in the ice cream did n't sound promising , but this turned out to be the real sleeper of the bunch , mainly due to the pudding - like swirls of pastry cream .
It would 've been even better with the addition of a fudge swirl .
Dulce Delish
Rich Caramel Ice Cream with Dark Caramel Swirls
I love caramel as a topping or as part of a swirl , but perhaps I do n't crave caramel ice cream enough to fully appreciate this .
The spirit of the flavor is pure , but it 's a little underwhelming compared to some of the other new flavors ( and I think the Dulce de Leche from Häagen - Dazs is much better ) .
Hannah Teter 's Maple Blondie
Maple Ice Cream with Blonde Brownie Chunks & a Maple Caramel Swirl
This limited edition batch , named after Vermont native and Olympic snowboarder Hannah Teter , is technically a new flavor but has been available since last December .
This came very close to knocking Milk & Cookies off the dais as my personal pick for best in show .
Maple might not be a flavor I want to return to on a regular basis but it's a perfect foil to the chewy chunks of blondie pieces scattered throughout .
Milk & Cookies
Vanilla Ice Cream with Chocolate Cookie Swirl , Chocolate Chip and Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies
This was my favorite of the bunch — think of it as cookies and cream taken to the extreme .
I 'm still not sure what a " chocolate cookie swirl " exactly entails but one spoonful reminded me of a classic black and white milkshake .
I can see this pint making return engagements in my freezer .
Mud Pie
Chocolate & Coffee Liqueur Ice Creams Swirled Together with a Chocolate Cookie Swirl
The only chocolate ice cream in the lineup and the least inspiring of the lot .
I found this too close to their Dublin Mudslide to really stand out .
And the liqueur ice cream came on too strong for my taste .
Peanut Brittle
Peanut Brittle Ice Cream with Peanut Brittle Pieces and a Caramel Swirl
I was probably too caught up in the novelty aspect of some of the new flavors to truly appreciate this straightforward offering , but it packs a great crunch and should prove to be one of the longstanding flavors of the bunch .
I 'm curious to know if you 're starting to see these where you live — what 's your favorite new flavor ?
Tomorrow just might be the perfect day to sample some of these new flavors as Tuesday , March 23 , marks Ben & Jerry 's annual Free Cone Day ( from 12 to 8 p.m. at participating scoop shops in the U.S. ) .
And keep an eye out for a new scoop shop exclusive flavor : Chocowlate Chip ( Fair Trade vanilla ice cream with cow - shaped fudge pieces ) .

Bad music will fade in and out with static but when someone answers the phone it 's clear as a bell , so it can't be a bad connection .
It 's happened when I 've called different companies over the years , so it can't be the case of one company with an AM radio stuck in the phone closet .
It seems odd to me that companies would spend money on a nice on - hold queue , and then never notice that their music has annoying static .
Why do I frequently hear static on hold ?
It does n't happen every time , but enough that I think there 's a reason behind this phenomenon .
Utah Governor Signs Miscarriage Bill into Law
In February , Utah sought to criminalize a woman ’s “ reckless act ” that led to a miscarriage , which did not go over well with many people in the U.S.
This week , the governor signed a reworked bill that designates the “ intentional or knowing ” miscarriage as criminal homicide .
Governor Gary Herbert signed Utah HB 462 on Monday .
The bill stipulates that a woman can be charged with homicide for “ the death of her unborn child ” , unless the death qualifies as legal abortion , which is defined as “ a medical procedure carried out by a physician or through a substance used under the direction of a physician . ”
The original bill could have got women sent away for lifelong prison terms for falling down stairs or staying in an abusive relationship , but criticisms got this part changed .
Legislators added provisions that a woman ca n’t be prosecutred if the death of her fetus “ is caused by a criminally negligent or reckless act of the woman ” or “ is not caused by an intentional or knowing act of the woman . ”
What ’s this mean ?
Well , now a woman has to intentionally induce her miscarriage in order to be prosecuted .
Utah is not the only state that criminalizes self - induced abortion .
Delaware and New York do as well .
Many are concerned , however , that this high - profile law may encourage other states to consider similar legislation of their own .
Jim Knight , employment minister , said : " The large increase in unemployment we saw a year ago is now translating into higher numbers who are long - term unemployed .
We responded to the recession by investing £ 5 bn to get people into jobs , which the Tories opposed .
Long - term unemployment today is nowhere near as high as when Labour came into office . "
( CNN ) --
More air travelers may soon be scanning their smartphones instead of paper slips at airport gates .
United has become the latest airline to offer mobile boarding passes for customers equipped with Web - enabled mobile phones or devices , such as iPhones or BlackBerrys .
United passengers traveling within the United States , Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands can now log on to mobile.united.com to check in for their flights via their smartphones .
Those departing from eight U.S. airports , including Chicago 's O'Hare International and Dallas - Fort Worth International in Texas , can also receive an e-mail with an encrypted two - dimensional barcode that stores their flight , seat assignment and gate information .
Once at the airport , passengers can scan the barcode , which is displayed on the screen of the mobile device , at security and during boarding .
( The Transportation Security Administration still requires them to show photo identification so officers can match the name on the boarding pass to the ID . )
Mobile boarding passes can also be refreshed to display new information if there is a seat or gate change .
The TSA likes them because of their improved security .
" The paperless boarding pass will ... prevent fraudulent paper boarding passes that could be created and printed from home , " the agency wrote on its blog .
Meanwhile , American Airlines has announced that it is expanding its mobile boarding pass program to 19 more airports , bringing the total up to 27 .
The additions include Washington Dulles International , New York La Guardia and San Francisco International .
The carrier began offering mobile boarding passes in 2008 , calling them a way to make travel as easy and convenient as possible .
" This is a great alternative for our customers on the go , " said Andrew Watson , American 's vice president for customer technology , in a statement .
The program will be extended to even more U.S. airports in the coming months , American said .
Continental , Delta and Alaska Airlines also offer mobile boarding passes to their customers .

" What … did you take the fuckin ' scenic route ?
I called your place an hour ago ! "
Detective Donelly stepped carefully from the cab of his pickup truck and slammed the door , sending the rusty clunker rocking and squealing in tired protest .
" Ah , go fuck yourself , Kimble , " he grumbled .
" You wanna tell me what 's so fuckin ' important that I had to cancel a meeting with my fuckin ' divorce lawyer ? "
" It 's the Italian , " said Detective Kimble .
" We got a suspect in custody . "
Donelly stopped and shook his head .
" See , this is the shit I 'm talkin ' about .
Why did n't you fuckin ' tell me on the phone that we had the Italian ?
Jesus ! "
Donelly did n't care much for his partner .
Detective Kimble was young , athletic , good - looking and , worst of all , knew it .
But the asshole could n't handle a case like the Italian on his own .
Donelly , who had just celebrated his retirement a week before the murders began , was sorely regretting ever answering the phone that night exactly one month ago .
But he needed the money .
" Gimme the …gimme the report , I 'll read it on the way … down , " he huffed .
His ex-wife had been right .
He was out of shape .
A simple jog across the small front parking lot should n't have winded him like this .
He was barely fifty .
" You are not gonna believe the shit you 're about to hear , " Kimble laughed as the two men headed down the grungy , dimly - lit corridor to the interrogation rooms .
" I mean , man . "
" No shit , " said Donelly .
" We 're talkin ' mutilations , here .
This guy ai n't no fuckin ' princess . "
Kimble smirked in that arrogant way all cocky sons - of - bitches do .
" That 's not how she tells it , " he said as held open the door to room 22 .
" She ? " Donelly murmured , scratching his doubled chin .
She , the report read , was a petite young woman in her early twenties , busted for prostitution in a cheap motel .
No ID was found , but she had rented the room under the name Brier Rose Dornröschen .
Donelly lingered outside the room , scanning the report for any further details that caught his eye , but none of it matched up to their profile of the Italian – so named because victims were always found with their veins and strings of muscle tissue twirled up in neat piles on a Corelle china dinner plate .
Like spaghetti fresh off a fork .
" Let me know when you 're ready , " said Kimble .
" I 've gotten all I can out of her , which is a lot of seriously weird shit , but nothing directly related to the murders .
Maybe you can work that famous Bruno Donelly magic , eh ? "
Donelly flipped through the pages of the report until a pair of Polaroids tumbled out .
" Gimme a minute , " he said .
He stooped to pick up the fallen photographs .
One , fuzzy from underexposure , showed what looked like an antique wooden spinning wheel , splattered with red .
There was a note scrawled in black ink on the Polaroid 's white base .
" Sent sample to lab , " it read .
In the other picture was a long wooden spindle , bare except for similar crimson stains .
It was lying on a china dinner plate , and the pattern was a familiar one .
" Holy shit , lookit that , " Donelly murmured , fumbling in his shirt pocket for his glasses .
" You wanna hear the best part ? " asked Kimble .
" Hmm , " Donelly mumbled .
" Says she was born in seventy - six . "
Donelly snorted .
" That would make her about three years old . "
" No , not nineteen - seventy - six , " said Kimble .
" Fifteen - seventy - six . "
Donelly ignored his partner 's attempt to be clever and peeked inside the interrogation room .
" You seriously think that toothpick in there did all this ?
You gotta be kidding me . "
" Huh -uh .
Also says she 's a Germanic princess . "
" Ah boy , " Donelly groaned .
" Gonna be a long night . "
" You think maybe we should get Barry in here ? " asked Kimble
" Nah , he 's on vacation .
Repainting the house or some shit , " said Donelly .
" I never liked being in the same room with that guy , anyway .
Something about 'im … I do n't know .
Gives me fuckin ' creeps . "

She was beautiful - flawless porcelain skin , enormous blue eyes , and golden hair that must have been the pride and joy of every stylist who had ever put a brush to it .
Sure , she was rough around the edges like all streetwalkers but definitely worth a second look .
And it was a pity .
Her beauty was natural but such a sharp contrast to the ugly , shameless uniform of her trade .
What puts a pretty girl like this on the streets ?
Donelly wondered .
Were n't all the pretty ones supposed to marry nice guys , break their hearts , and then take all their money in divorce settlements ?
" Ms. uh … Dornröschen , " he began .
" You know why you 're here , do n't you ? "
The girl said nothing but fixed her cold eyes on his .
An ash from her cigarette , still hot , made a faint singeing sound as it landed in the lap of her black , vinyl minidress .
" Have you heard of the serial killer we call ' the Italian ' ? " he asked .
The girl took a drag and blew out the smoke slowly , deliberately .
" Yes . "
Donelly glanced at his partner , who was staring at the ceiling .
These were questions Kimble had likely already asked .
He cleared his throat and continued .
" Yeah , " he said .
" Well , we have reason to believe you know quite a bit about those murders , Ms. Dornröschen .
Maybe even more than we do . "
The girl 's eyes narrowed .
" Is that what you think ? " she said softly with a distinctly German accent .
Kimble grew impatient .
" Why do n't we start with the spinning wheel , Brier Rose ?
The one we found in your motel room , covered in blood ? " he asked .
The girl kept her eyes locked on Donelly .
Kimble leaned back in his chair and cursed under his breath .
" Ms. Dornröschen , " said Donelly .
" Would you tell me where you got that spinning wheel ? "
The girl grinned .
" From Hell , " she hissed , eyes wide .
" Oh , so now she 's the princess of Hell ! " Kimble laughed .
" This shit gets more entertaining every minute . "
" Detective Kimble , " said Donelly , turning to his partner .
" What ? "
" Get the fuck outside . "
His partner glared for several awkward seconds before throwing up his hands and standing .
" Fine , " Kimble spat as he stormed from the room , slamming the door behind him .
Donelly turned back to the girl , whose eyes , it seemed , had never wavered from his face .
He felt a chill travel down his spine .
" Ms. ah… I 'm just gonna call you Brier Rose , if that 's all right , " he said .
" Brier Rose … "
Sigh of reluctance .
Step one of " that old Bruno Donelly magic . "
" Look , I do n't think you 're guilty .
I do n't know how that spinning wheel and the china plate factor into all this , but I know in my gut that you 're innocent , " he said .
Step two .
Warm , understanding smile .
" But my partner , well .
He 's young .
He 's what we call a ' rookie . '
Thinks every suspect he digs up is ' the one . ' "
Step three .
Camaraderie .
" But in order to help you , " said Donelly .
" I need you to be perfectly straight with me .
Do n't lie to me , I do n't care how bad it looks .
We got a deal ? "
The girl was unfazed .
" You think you can fool me with your trickery , " she laughed .
" You think I 'm some lost , unfortunate soul who yearns for kindness and understanding from anyone who will only take the time .
Mr. Donelly , you have no idea who you are dealing with .
No idea at all . "
Donelly coughed .
" Why do n't you tell me who I 'm dealing with , then ? " he asked .
He could have sworn he saw a fire spark in the girl 's eyes .
" I have lived through more than you can imagine in your wildest nightmares , " she seethed .
" You can not even begin to fathom the horrors to which I have been subjected by man and time itself .
My age and experience alone are enough to demand your respect .
So , Mr. Donelly , do n't you dare try your poison on me . "
Donelly swallowed audibly .
The girl continued .
" You would have been a servant in my day , do you know that ? " she said .
" To speak of me by my Christian name within my hearing would have cost you the flesh upon your back . "
She drew again from the waning cigarette .
Donelly blinked .
" Yeah…um , " he faltered .
" Excuse me . "
Blotting beads of sweat from his forehead , Donelly stepped outside to where his partner waited .
" Nuts , is n't she ? " said Kimble .
" Call Barry Leeds , " said Donelly .
" Tell him his vacation 's over . "
* * *
Dr. Barry Leeds had been a forensic psychiatrist for twenty - five years and had interviewed every manner of scum and victim alike .
He had beady little eyes behind double - thick glasses , slicked - down brown hair that formed a wreath around his bald head , and an enormous nose which left little doubt he had once been the misfit of his class .
Watching him from behind the one - way glass , Donelly noted that he looked a little like a mortician .
Leeds never seemed affected by anything .
Not the most heinous murder , not even an utterly devastated mother of a victim … nothing .
Donelly never liked the man .
" Good afternoon , Brier Rose , " Leeds greeted in a dull voice .
" How did you sleep last night ? "
The pretty blonde seated across the table toyed with a button on her new , state - issued blue jumper .
" Doktor Leeds , " she said with a teasing grin .
" Do n't pretend to be friendly with me…unless you 're going to be friendly with me .
And if you 're going to be friendly , well … I 'm afraid I 'll have to charge you my usual fee . "
" Sounds like Her Highness got her beauty rest last night , " said Kimble .
" Shut up and get me some coffee , " Donelly snapped .
" Fuck you , man .
Get your own . "
On the other side of the glass , Leeds smiled politely .
" Can I get you some water ? " he offered , pouring himself a glass .
The girl twirled a golden strand of hair around her finger .
" You can get me anything you like , " she breathed .
Leeds paused a moment before jotting a quick note on his memo pad .
As usual , he was unaffected .
Even the way he poured a glass of water seemed astoundingly by - the - book .
Meanwhile , the girl was watching him , studying him like a hungry cat .
" Let 's start from the beginning , " Leeds continued .
" The beginning of what ? " asked the girl as she slumped back in her chair .
" Your case ?
My life ?
My virgin years ? "
She 's testing him , Donelly noted .
Fuckin ' women .
" Brier Rose , do you understand the charges against you ? " asked Leeds with a hint of irritation .
The girl cocked her head to one side .
" Ms. Dornröschen , " Leeds persisted .
" Do you understand — "
" I bet you like them young , do n't you Doktor ? " the girl interrupted .
Her eyes brightened with mischievous delight .
Leeds dropped his pen .
" Excuse me ? " he stammered .
" Old Barry 's off his game today , " Kimble snorted .
" Yeah , " said Donelly with a chuckle .
" I think that 's the most reaction I ever seen anybody get out of that motherfucker . "
Unless , he thought , this gal is just one of those sick minds who always knows what buttons to push .
" Never mind , " the girl said with a quiet giggle .
" And yes .
I understand the charges .
How much longer do you men intend to keep me here before my trial ? "
Leeds cleared his throat and scribbled more notes .
" We 'll get to that .
Why do n't you tell me about the uh … the spinning wheel found where you were staying ?
What do you know about that ? " he asked .
" It 's simple , really .
I hate men , " said the girl with a bored sigh .
" And I hate sewing . "
Behind the glass , Donelly and Kimble laughed .
" If you hate men , why are you selling yourself on the streets ? " said Leeds .
" And if you hate sewing , why the antique spinning wheel ?
Explain this .
If you could . "
The girl 's smile faded and her eyes fell to her lap .
" Do you know the story of ' Sleeping Beauty ' ? " she asked without looking up .
" Yes , " answered Leeds with hesitation .
" It 's my niece 's favorite . "
" How do you tell it to your niece ? "
" I tell her the story we all know , of course . "
The girl glared at her interviewer , her face twisting into a parade of emotions .
" No ! " she cried , and she began to tremble .
" Tell me the story you tell her . "
Here we go , Donelly thought .
" Shit , this is gettin ' good , " said Kimble , mesmerized .
" I 'm gonna get some coffee , you want some coffee ? "
Leeds froze .
" I 'll tell it , " said the girl with a twitching smile .
" But it 's not the fairy tale you remember . "
" Once upon a time , " she began in a low voice .
" There was a king and a queen who could n't have a child .
The queen prayed .
She prayed to God and received no answer .
She prayed to The Holy Virgin … no answer .
So she prayed to the Devil .
Not long after , she found she was pregnant .
She never told anyone what she had done … only the witch who helped her with her evil prayers knew , but the queen feared her sins would be discovered regardless .
So she ordered the witch killed .
Finally a daughter was born .
Invitations for the christening were sent to every nobleman and woman in the country .
It was a ridiculous event .
But …after all the blessings and gifts were given , who should suddenly made an appearance before everyone in the court ?
The witch .
Either the queen 's henchmen had failed or the witch just could n't die …
Whatever the case , she was furious , and she cursed the baby .
The witch prophesied that on the princess 's 17th birthday , she would prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die . "
" You 're talking about yourself , " Leeds suggested .
" Is this in ... "
He flipped through his notes .
" … 1567 ? "
She ignored him and continued .
" But there was another witch , one who only practiced good magic , and she was able to weaken the curse .
She could n't undo the evil completely .
She was n't powerful enough , but she changed it so that the princess would not die but fall into a deep sleep .
Now , the king tried his best to destroy all the spinning wheels , but fate can't be fooled .
The princess succumbed to the curse … pricked her finger on a spindle and collapsed immediately . "
There was a long pause before she spoke again .
Donelly felt cold and wondered if it was only his imagination .
The girl went on .
" The story you tell your niece , Mr. Leeds , says that the entire kingdom was put to sleep emwith / em the princess so that she would n't wake alone .
The story you tell your niece says she only slept for a hundred years , but no , no … " she said .
" That is where the truth becomes a tale … a tale they told so that no one would ever know what cowards they truly were .
They locked the princess … . "
" Take your time , " said Leeds as the girl began to cry .
" They locked the princess in a tower , " she said with a trembling voice .
" With the cursed spinning wheel beside her bed , and they forgot her while the rest of them went on with their lives .
The princess lay at the mercy of the world around her .
Spiders built webs across her face .
Servants – thieves , all of them – crept in and stole the jewels she wore .
And the guards …
The guards would use her body again and again and again !
In more perverse ways that even you , Doktor , can imagine .
No one cared because no one thought she was aware .
They did n't know that only the princess 's body was asleep .
They did n't know that her mind was very much alive ! "
" Jesus .
Someone fucked this girl over bad , " Donelly murmured .
Kimble was speechless for once .
" Go on , " said Leeds , who remembered to take notes again .
The girl dried her eyes .
" For three hundred and eighty - one years , the princess 's body lay frozen in time … immune to age and disease and all but man himself , " she said .
" Nearly four centuries !
The curse would have been far more merciful had it been left at death .
Do n't you understand ?
She could hear , feel , smell , think … but she could n't open her eyes to see what was coming .
Could n't raise her arms to defend herself !
She survived wars and disasters and was passed like an artifact from land to land until at last she ended up in the collection of an eccentric underground art collector .
There among his other prized and stolen possessions , he used her body just like everyone else .
And then one day … "
She gazed into an imaginary distance , a smile playing upon her lips .
" I woke up . "
" And what happened when you woke up ? " asked Leeds .
The girl locked eyes with him and smiled widely .
" Four hundred years is a long time to be angry , " she whispered .
" A very long time . "
She took a sip of water .
" I went to sleep with everything in the world and woke up with barely even my own self underneath the fat , sweating body of a thief with my skirt pulled up to my chin , " she said .
" And when I woke , I drove my knees into the bastard 's teeth .
And then I reached up , grabbed his drooling tongue , and used the broken fragments in his mouth to cut it from his head .
This way , I could n't hear him begging for mercy when I used my spindle - which the curse had kept bound to me all those years – and tore out his bowels . "
" Holy shhhhhit , " Kimble gasped .
Donelly covered his stomach with his hands .
" What happened to the art collector ? " asked Leeds .
" What did you do with the body ? "
" I left him there .
It would n't surprise me if he 's still there , rotting , to this day , " said the girl with a sickly - sweet smile .
Leeds cleared his throat .
" Where did you go from there ? " he asked .
" I was homeless for a time , living off the charity of strangers , " the girl answered , running her fingers through her hair .
" Because I was pretty , there were people who took me in from time to time .
Fed me … educated me .
It was a wealthy couple who helped me with my fragmented English .
They never asked about my past , and I reduced myself to voluntary servitude as thanks .
But the wife threw me out when she found her husband with me .
That was four years ago . "
" Is this when you turned to prostitution ? " asked Leeds .
" Of course .
No one else wants you without those three little words , " the girl said with a cynical chuckle .
" Social Security Number .
Besides , I 'd had enough experience with perversion to keep a certain type of customer base very loyal . "
" What do you mean by that ? "
She twirled another strand of hair around her finger and gazed at him lazily .
" There are some services even a whore wo n't perform , " she said softly .
" But I will . "
She leaned forward .
" Shall I demonstrate ? "
" N - no , I 'd rather you did n't , " Leeds blurted .
" I 'd like to ask you about the spinning wheel again . "
" Anything you like , Doktor . "
" What do you do with it ? "
" ' I make sweaters out of people , doctor ! ' "
Kimble joked , affecting a girlish voice .
" Shut up , Kimble , " Donelly snapped .
" I wanna fuckin ' hear this . "
The girl sat still for a long time , staring at Leeds … or through him .
She smiled pleasantly .
" I want to hurt people , " she said softly after a long while .
" People left me in the dust and forgot me like a broken broom .
People soiled and violated me for centuries .
I was n't even permitted the mercy of death .
You sit there and make your educated notes while your men watch from behind that mirror , but none of you can possibly understand the evil I have suffered . "
She rose slowly , tears trickling down her cheeks .
Behind the mirror , the detectives tensed .
" What I have done is a service , not a crime , " she declared .
" Yes , I did it .
Yes , I murdered all those men .
Yes , oh yes , Doktor , I twisted their insides onto my wheel of wrath like the useless cloth I was taken for all those years .
I did it slowly and watched them suffer for hours , and I laughed .
Laughed as I left their insides on a plate to be fed upon just as my body was left to the insects .
I despise mankind , Doktor , and their disgusting spawn .
With the devil as my maker and my witness , I will destroy you all ! "
Before anyone so much as blinked , the girl had toppled her water glass and shattered it .
With one broken shard in her bleeding hand she lunged at the doctor and buried the glass in his stomach .
" Holy fuckin ' shit ! " Kimble shouted .
Donelly drew his gun and rushed with his partner to the melee .
" Brier Rose , get back ! " he ordered .
" Get back NOW ! "
The girl was oblivious to the detectives and to the cops who joined them , weapons poised and ready .
" I 'm paying for my mother 's sins , Doktor ! " she cackled to the struggling , bleeding man .
" And you 're paying for the sins of your sex ! "
" I 'm gonna shoot ! " Donelly shouted .
" Go on , Detective , kill me ! " the girl screamed with a maniacal laugh .
" End my curse ! "
" Your curse ended already , Brier Rose .
I understand your hatred - God knows I 'm bitter , too , but damn it !
You 're going to murder an innocent man ! " Donelly yelled .
" This is your last warning !
Do n't fuckin ' do this ! "
The girl screamed with laughter and twisted the glass .
From Leed 's stomach , a fountain of blood welled like scarlet oil .
Kimble shot first .
Donelly and the backup officers followed .
It took seventeen bullets to fell the girl , and when it finally ended , it was as if she had simply fallen asleep .
She slid to the floor with a gasp and was dead , her golden hair matted with dark clots of her own blood .
" Get the paramedics ! NOW ! "
Donelly barked over the bloodied bodies of the forensic psychiatrist and the girl .
Amid the shouts of orders and the scuffle of emergency workers , no one noticed until she lay in the morgue that the girl had died smiling .
****
Two days later .
Need to get a key ring , Donelly reminded himself as he felt blindly in his coat pocket for the familiar jigs and jags of his apartment door key .
Ever since he had given his old house key to his ex-wife , he had never gotten around to putting the rest of his keys back together .
" Heya , Buddy , " he said to the Jack Russell who waited , shirt tail fwapping vigorously from side to side , for his master to come in .
" Bet you thought I was never coming home , huh ? "
The dog whined in agreement .
" Mean old Mommy wanted to take you with her , but I saved you , did n't I ?
Yes I did !
Yeeeees , " Donelly cooed , scratching the dog 's ears .
In the living room , the answering machine was blinking .
" Let 's go see who called , ah ? " said Donelly .
Buddy chuffed .
" Bruno , it 's Carrie .
I talked to the lawyer today , and he says … "
Donelly grumbled and fast - forwarded through the machine tape .
" Bruno , it 's Carrie again .
I forgot to mention the lawn mower .. "
Fast - forward .
" Hallo , Detective Donelly , " began the next message .
The caller sounded like an older woman .
A European woman .
A creepy , old European woman .
" I 'm sorry to have missed you .
I wanted to call and congratulate you on catching the ' Italian ' , though I believe she was more of a seamstress , was she not ?
All the same , I feel the world is a much better place without the princess .
You 're doing God 's work , you know .
I shall call again soon .
Perhaps .
There 's a story I would like to tell you .
Until then ...
Good night .
" emClick/em .
Donelly felt a sudden chill before the questions began to flood his mind .
Who was this woman and how did she get his home number ?
The details of the case had n't been released yet .
How did this woman know the suspect had claimed to be a ...?
Either this woman was related to one of the victims or someone had been talking to the press , Donelly decided .
He picked up the phone and began to dial .
" Maybe she 's just a scary old witch , eh , Bud ? " he said as he dialed .
Buddy wagged his tail approvingly .
Scary old witch .
Donelly shivered and put down the phone .
Either the queen 's henchmen had failed or the witch just could n't die …
Just could n't die …
The phone began to ring .
Donelly did n't answer .
It ’s hard to believe it has been 50 years since the four African American students from North Carolina A&T College decided to go to the downtown Greensboro F. W. Woolworth ’s store and stage a sit in against the segregated lunch counter .
It was done almost on a whim .
Four 17 - year - old black college freshmen , Joseph A. McNeil , Franklin E. McCain , David L. Richmond and Ezell A. Blair Jr. – all students at all - black A&T College in Greensboro – were sitting around having a “ bull session ” when they decided to go to the South Elm Street five and dime store and challenge 82 years of entrenched Jim Crow segregation .
It was January 1960 and I was just one year out of high school in Philadelphia , working a low - paid factory job , when the sit - in started .
In my circle of friends none of us were particularly political , but we were very moved by what our young contemporaries had done down in North Carolina .
Most of our parents had been raised in the South and like a lot of the children in our neighborhood my brother , sister and I had spend part of our summers with relatives in the South .
Growing up in the Mill Creek Ghetto of West Philly we knew what racism was but we had also experienced the more oppressive intimidation and indignities of life in the Jim Crow South .
We were old enough to have seen the pictures of the horrible murder of 14 - year - old Emmett Till in 1955 .
He was our age – in fact he was born the same year and month as I was
My five close friends had all gone to predominantly black schools and lived in predominantly black neighborhoods .
When we reached West Philadelphia High School we were in the minority .
The school was rapidly becoming majority black .
But in 1956 my class was majority white .
Our everyday life in high school was full of the stresses and strains of adolescence made worse because we had to adjust to this new interracial environment .
Most of us were basically trying to live and let live while we got our education .
There were the occasional racist remarks by a teacher and clearly some of the white teachers openly favored the white students .
This was the way it was .
A black student usually had to fight his or her way into the inner circles to gain access to advantages some of the white students received routinely .
And there was a serious incident when a large group of black students from our school went to Hershey , Pa. , for a picnic and were attacked by a white racist mob .
The students had to run for their lives .
Our school was not formally segregated and as a freshman most of my classes were integrated .
There existed an unofficial system of racial tracking that meant only a small percentage of black students were encouraged to become a part of the college - bound groups .
Some had to fight their way in .
That was a form of de facto discrimination .
That ‘s the way we saw it , anyway .
But as the school became more integrated , black and white friendships tended to grow .
We all ate in the same lunchroom but usually at different tables .
We all went to the same prom and other social and sports events but there was a certain division along racial lines there too , and certainly the after - parties were not mixed .
Nevertheless some real friendships did develop across racial lines .
I had some good friendships with a few white schoolmates and in my senior year I attended one or two interracial house parties .
Considering what we were going though every day , when the struggle to integrate Little Rock High School took place ( 1957 ) it hit close to home .
All my friends followed it closely and I imagined many of the white school mates did too .
It was a frightening thing to see the racist mobs and the violent attacks .
At Little Rock
High there was a racist boycott of the school and it was overwhelming : few or perhaps no white kids came to school .
After one violent incident in Little Rock , I remember one of my best friends asked what I assume was a rhetorical question .
“ Why , ” he asked , “ do they hate us so much ? ”
None of us had an answer .
The one thing we did know was , despite all the shortcomings and problems , we did not want our high school to become a tragedy like Little Rock High .
That same year the movie “ Island in the Sun , ” staring Harry Belafonte , Joan Fontaine and Dorothy Dandridge , premiered .
From the ads everybody thought there would be a steamy romance between Belafonte ( black ) and Fontaine ( white ) .
Eager to witness this anti-racist breakthrough for U.S. movies .
a lot of the black students played hooky and went to see the film .
When we got to the theater we were surprised to see that a fairly good number of our white classmates had also skipped school to see this movie .
As it tuned out the “ love ” scenes between Belafonte and Fontaine were sanitized and only hinted at a physical attraction between the two .
Yet it was encouraging to see that the white students were also curious to see what would happen .
But while Emmett Till and Little Rock were not the whole picture , it seemed to us that black people were mainly being victimized by the racists .
Those experiences suggested that standing up to racism meant your life was in danger .
Greensboro was different .
When we saw the bold resistance of the young people in Greensboro who had the courage to stand up and do something about racism , and had found the winning tactics , we were inspired and wanted to find a way of supporting them .
There had been other sit-ins at lunch counters around the South before Greensboro , but none had gained the momentum and mass support that Greensboro did .
Reportedly there was a black women serving behind the counter who told the students , “ Fellows like you make our race look bad . ”
She then refused to serve them .
She was wrong .
Those four freshmen were uplifting our race and really the entire nation by their bold actions .
The four young men returned the next day .
By the third day the word had spread and 80 people showed up to sit in .
Within a week over 1,000 pro and anti demonstrators filled the store .
The movement was spreading all over the state , and into neighboring states .
By the end of February sit-ins were happening in 31 southern cities across eight states .
By the end of March sit-ins had spread to 55 cities in 13 states .
A real mass movement was being born .
In a matter of a days veteran civil rights leaders had come to Greensboro to help the effort .
According to Taylor Branch ’s seminal history of the civil rights movement , “ Parting the Waters , ” Floyd McKissick then the head of the NAACP Youth Councils , and the Rev. Douglas Moore from Durham , rushed to Greensboro when they heard about the sit-in .
The vice president of the National Students Association who heard about the sit-in was in Greensboro the next day .
After the third day the Rev. Moore called James Lawson in Nashville for help .
The word was spread to civil rights circles all over the South .
Many responded including Wyatt T. Walker , Fred Shuttlesworth , Ella Baker and the Rev. Martin L. King .
Rev. Shuttlesworth told Ella Baker to be sure to tell Dr. King that “ . we must get with this . ”
Shuttlesworth predicted that the sit-ins would “ shake up the world . ”
Speaking at a rally in support of the sit-ins , Dr. King declared , “ Men are tired of being trampled over by the iron feet of oppression . ”
He added , “ The underlying philosophies of segregation are diametrically opposed to democracy and Christianity , and all the dialectics of all the logicians in the world cannot make them lie down together . ”
In his strong endorsement of the sit - in movement he said , “ What is fresh , what is new in your fight is the fact that it was initiated , led and sustained by students .
What is new is that American students have come of age .
You now take your honored place in the world - wide struggle for freedom . ”
( “ Parting the Waters , ” pp. 275-276 ) .
That ’s how important the Greensboro sit-ins on Feb. 1 , 1960 , were .
That struggle gave birth to the massive student protest movement of the ’60s .
The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee was born out of that struggle .
The Freedom Rides to protest segregated public accommodations in interstate travel were kicked off in 1961 .
In May 1960 students at Berkeley demonstrated at the House Un- American Activities Committee hearings in San Francisco and were shoved , beaten and fire - hosed because they refused to be kept out of the hearings .
Over 1,000 predominantly white students took part in that protest .
Longshore leader Archie Brown and African American activist Juanita
Wheeler were called before the committee and refused to cooperate .
They both were physically thrown out of the hearings by the police .
That struggle was a turning point in the movement against the against the anti-communist repression that dominated the 1950s , and the beginning of the Free Speech Movement .
I started out the 1960s with a low paid factory job but soon became a union member .
At the same time I found the civil rights and youth movement in my West Philadelphia community .
The movement became a life ong commitment for me .
Those four young students who , as Dr. King put it , grew tired of being trampled on , went out and sparked a movement that was part of a great democratic revolution that transformed our nation into something better .
While racism remains , as well as deep - going class oppression , that great movement of the ’60s decade helped make this a far more democratic humane society .
In that movement I also found the Communist Party USA , but that is a subject of another article .

Why the browsers must change their old SSL security (? ) model
In a paper Certified Lies : Detecting and Defeating Government Interception Attacks Against SSL_ , by Christopher Soghoian and Sid Stammby , there is a reasonably good layout of the problem that browsers face in delivering their " one-model - suits - all " security model .
It is more or less what we 've understood all these years , in that by accepting an entire root list of 100s of CAs , there is no barrier to any one of them going a little rogue .
Of course , it is easy to raise the hypothetical of the rogue CA , and even to show compelling evidence of business models ( they cover much the same claims with a CA that also works in the lawful intercept business that was covered here in FC many years ago ) .
Beyond theoretical or probable evidence , it seems the authors have stumbled on some evidence that it is happening :
The companys CEO , Victor Oppelman confirmed , in a conversation with the author at the companys booth , the claims made in their marketing materials :
That government customers have compelled CAs into issuing certificates for use in surveillance operations .
While Mr Oppelman would not reveal which governments have purchased the 5 - series device , he did confirm that it has been sold both domestically and to foreign customers .
( my emphasis . )
This has been a lurking problem underlying all CAs since the beginning .
The flip side of the trusted - third - party concept ( " TTP " ) is the centralised - vulnerability - party or " CVP " .
That is , you may have been told you " trust " your TTP , but in reality , you are totally vulnerable to it .
E.g. , from the famous Blackberry " official spyware " case :
Nevertheless , hundreds of millions of people around the world , most of whom have never heard of Etisalat , unknowingly depend upon a company that has intentionally delivered spyware to its own paying customers , to protect their own communications security .
Which becomes worse when the browsers insist , not without good reason , that the root list is hidden from the consumer .
The problem that occurs here is that the compelled CA problem multiplies to the square of the number of roots : if a CA in ( say ) Ecuador is compelled to deliver a rogue cert , then that can be used against a CA in Korea , and indeed all the other CAs .
A brief examination of the ways in which CAs work , and browsers interact with CAs , leads one to the unfortunate conclusion that nobody in the CAs , and nobody in the browsers , can do a darn thing about it .
So it then falls to a question of statistics : at what point do we believe that there are so many CAs in there , that the chance of getting away with a little interception is too enticing ?
Square law says that the chances are say 100 CAs squared , or 10,000 times the chance of any one intercept .
As we 've reached that number , this indicates that the temptation to resist intercept is good for all except 0.01 % of circumstances .
OK , pretty scratchy maths , but it does indicate that the temptation is a small but not infinitesimal number .
A risk exists , in words , and in numbers .
One CA can hide amongst the crowd , but there is a little bit of a fix to open up that crowd .
This fix is to simply show the user the CA brand , to put faces on the crowd .
Think of the above , and while it does n't solve the underlying weakness of the CVP , it does mean that the mathematics of squared vulnerability collapses .
Once a user sees their CA has changed , or has a chance of seeing it , hiding amongst the crowd of CAs is no longer as easy .
Why then do browsers resist this fix ?
There is one good reason , which is that consumers really do n't care and do n't want to care .
In more particular terms , they do not want to be bothered by security models , and the security displays in the past have never worked out .
Gerv puts it this way in comments :
Security UI comes at a cost - a cost in complexity of UI and of message , and in potential user confusion .
We should only present users with UI which enables them to make meaningful decisions based on information they have .
They love Skype , which gives them everything they need without asking them anything .
Which therefore should be reasonable enough motive to follow those lessons , but the context is different .
Skype is in the chat & voice market , and the security model it has chosen is well - excessive to needs there .
Browsing on the other hand is in the credit - card shopping and Internet online banking market , and the security model imposed by the mid 1990s evolution of uncontrollable forces has now broken before the onslaught of phishing & friends .
In other words , for browsing , the writing is on the wall .
Why then do n't they move ?
In a perceptive footnote , the authors also ponder this conundrum :
3 . The browser vendors wield considerable theoretical power over each CA .
Any CA no longer trusted by the major browsers will have an impossible time attracting or retaining clients , as visitors to those clients  websites will be greeted by a scary browser warning each time they attempt to establish a secure connection .
Nevertheless , the browser vendors appear loathe to actually drop CAs that engage in inappropriate be - havior  a rather lengthy list of bad CA practices that have not resulted in the CAs being dropped by one browser vendor can be seen in [ 6 ] .
I have observed this for a long time now , predicting phishing until it became the flood of fraud .
The answer is , to my mind , a complicated one which I can only paraphrase .
For Mozilla , the reason is simple lack of security capability at the * architectural * and * governance * levels .
Indeed , it should be noticed that this lack of capability is their policy , as they deliberately and explicitly outsource big security questions to others ( known as the " standards groups " such as IETF's RFC committees ) .
As they have little of the capability , they are n't in a good position to use the power , no matter whether they would want to or not .
So , it only needs a mildly argumentative approach on the behalf of the others , and Mozilla is restrained from its apparent power .
What then of Microsoft ?
Well , they certainly have the capability , but they have other fish to fry .
They are n't fussed about the power because it does n't bring them anything of use to them .
As a corporation , they are strictly interested in shareholders ' profits ( by law and by custom ) , and as nobody can show them a bottom line improvement from CA & cert business , no interest is generated .
And without that interest , it is practically impossible to get the various many groups within Microsoft to move .
Unlike Mozilla , my view of Microsoft is much more " external " , based on many observations that have never been confirmed internally .
However it seems to fit ; all of their security work has been directed to market interests .
Hence for example their work in identity & authentication ( . net , infocard , etc ) was all directed at creating the platform for capturing the future market .
What is odd is that all CAs agree that they want their logo on their browser real estate .
Big and small .
So one would think that there was a unified approach to this , and it would eventually win the day ; the browser wins for advancing security , the CAs win because their brand investments now make sense .
The consumer wins for both reasons .
Indeed , early recommendations from the CABForum , a closed group of CAs and browsers , had these fixes in there .
But these ideas keep running up against resistance , and none of the resistance makes any sense .
And that is probably the best way to think of it : the browsers do n't have a logical model for where to go for security , so anything leaps the bar when the level is set to zero .
Which all leads to a new group of people trying to solve the problem .
The authors present their model as this :
The Firefox browser already retains history data for all visited websites .
We have simply modified the browser to cause it to retain slightly more information .
Thus , for each new SSL protected website that the user visits , a Certlock enabled browser also caches the following additional certificate information : A hash of the certificate .
The country of the issuing CA .
The name of the CA .
The country of the website .
The name of the website .
The entire chain of trust up to the root CA .
When a user re-visits a SSL protected website , Certlock first calculates the hash of the sites certificate and compares it to the stored hash from previous visits .
If it hasnt changed , the page is loaded without warning .
If the certificate has changed , the CAs that issued the old and new certificates are compared .
If the CAs are the same , or from the same country , the page is loaded without any warning .
If , on the other hand , the CAs countries differ , then the user will see a warning ( See Figure 3 ) .
This is n't new .
The authors credit recent work , but no further back than a year or two .
Which I find sad because the important work done by TrustBar and Petnames is pretty much forgotten .
But it is encouraging that the security models are battling it out , because it gets people thinking , and challenging their assumptions .
Only actual produced code , and garnered market share is likely to change the security benefits of the users .
So while we can criticise the country approach ( it assumes a sort of magical touch of law within the countries concerned that is already assumed not to exist , by dint of us being here in the first place ) , the country " proxy " is much better than nothing , and it gets us closer to the real information : the CA .
From a market for security pov , it is an interesting period .
The first attempts around 2004 - 2006 in this area failed .
This time , the resurgence seems to have a little more steam , and possibly now is a better time .
In 2004 - 2006 the threat was seen as more or less theoretical by the hoi polloi .
Now however we 've got governments interested , consumers sick of it , and the entire military - industrial complex obsessed with it ( both in participating and fighting ) .
So perhaps the newcomers can ride this wave of FUD in , where previous attempts drowned far from the shore .
Was watching the progression towards a vote later this evening when , during a point where the mic's were turned off , the chair stood and the mics came on for just a moment .
The chair said something very close to - I direct the sergeant at arms to escort these people that have forced their way into the chamber ... then the mic went silent again and the camera went to a wide shot , which showed several representatives looking up and off to the left , as tho watching something going on in that part of the chamber off - camera .
I placed a call to someone I went to college with who happens to work on the hill , and that person said that they were having issue 's with protesters trying to get into the chamber to disrupt the legislation .
These wing nuts are losing their minds , I would not be surprised if we saw armed protest before the vote is taken later today .
Upon my arrival at the courthouse though , I was greeted with disappointing news that sent a shiver through my drenched body -- the Supreme Court of the United States issued a temporary restraining order restricting both the live stream in court houses and the YouTube broadcast .
I was asked by bloggers around the country if they could feature my tweets so that more people could follow today 's exciting developments .
Seattle was supposed to be one of a few select cities around the country that would broadcast a live feed from California .
The rest of the country would have to wait for media reports , or the delayed YouTube broadcast scheduled for the following day .
Yesterday I made my way with to the Federal Court House in Seattle as a typically nasty Seattle winter rain storm managed to drench me to my soul , despite my over - sized umbrella and hearty rain jacket .
No matter , I was looking forward to live tweeting the stream from California as my rights , and the rights of millions of Americans were debated in court .
The Defendants filed a last minute appeal to the Supreme Court on Friday to block the broadcast , and the court agreed at least to delay the feed until Wednesday when the entire court can rule .
I left the court feeling a sense of loss that I would not be able to witness the day 's proceedings .
I can not think of another court case that could have such an enormous impact on my life , and the lives of my community .
I was simply devastated .
When I returned home , I was happy to see that as usual , in the face of temporary defeat , my community rallied .
Rick Jacobs Executive Director of the Courage Campaign became a live blogger as he fed the world information from the overflow room in California .
He is not typically a blogger , but yesterday he shined .
Well , we 're done for today , which is kind of sad .
I remember the first time I really heard anyone use the phrase " teachable moment . "
Arianna Huffington said it as only she can .
And it stuck with me .
But then , as with so many other popular culture phrases , it became hackneyed .
If someone punched a kid in the eye , it was a " teachable moment . "
Today has truly provided teaching of the first order .
When do we get to see four people -- two couples -- relate very personal stories about marriage and love and being gay ?
When do we get to hear those people talk about how the Prop.
8 ads hurt them personally ?
When do we see the affect that stigmatizing homosexuals for millennia has had on Jeff or Sandy ?
And when do we get to learn from a Yale and Harvard professor that our current understanding of the form of marriage is relatively new , not biblically based and the building block of the American polity ?
Jacobs and the Courage Campaign delivered a petition to Judge Walker with over 138,542 signatures supporting the internet broadcast of the trial .
The judge mentioned the " overwhelming " response in court today and noted only 32 opposed .
I learned this information live as people tweeted from the courtroom and the overflow room .
Twitter saved the day for those eager for real time updates .
Today certainly was a teachable moment .
Our community has been waiting for the opportunity to provide an honest portrayal of our love , our lives , and how the government 's role in segregating our community has been harmful to our lives and a violation of our 14th Amendment for decades .
I 'm not a lawyer , so I wo n't attempt to dissect today 's legal arguments , but I can tell you from a very personal perspective that it feels so good to know justice is in motion .
Our community has perhaps the best legal team alive to represent us , and our opponent 's leadership is finally having to answer for their behavior over the last several years .
I hope the Supreme Court allows the broadcast to go through on YouTube and via remote viewing at the court houses .
This case is a once in a lifetime opportunity to witness history .
The issues being discussed need to be discussed in public .
Judge Walker has instituted adequate safeguards to protect witnesses who feel shy .
We have nothing to lose , but a teachable moment if the broadcast is completely cut off .
No matter what happens , I 'm confident those that can will get information out as quickly and efficiently as they did today .
I look forward to following their tweets , blogs , facebook posts , and e-mails as history unfolds .
Their work , though patched together quickly , protected our open government today .
For that , they will always be my hero .
We were n't able to watch the opening statement by Ted Olson , so he made a point to outline his case on NBC 's nightly news .
Watch below , and read the full opening statement here .

On August 6 , 1945 , the B - 29 bomber Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima .
Twelve men were on that flight .
Some chose to keep a low profile and others spoke out about their place in history .
Almost all had something to say after the war .
The 509th Composite Group was formed by the U.S. Army Air Force to deliver and deploy the first atomic bombs during World War II .
The group was segregated from the rest of the military and trained in secret .
Even those in the group only knew as much as they needed to know in order to perform their duties .
The group deployed to Tinian in 1945 with 15 B - 29 bombers , flight crews , ground crews , and other personnel , a total of about 1770 men .
The mission to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima , Japan ( special mission 13 ) involved seven planes , but the one we remember was the Enola Gay .
Captain Theodore Van Kirk , Navigator
Air Force captain Theodore " Dutch " Van Kirk did not know the destructive force of the nuclear bomb before Hiroshima .
He was 24 years old at that time , a veteran of 58 missions in North Africa .
Paul Tibbets told him this mission would shorten or end the war , but Van Kirk had heard that line before .
Hiroshima made him a believer .
Van Kirk felt the bombing of Hiroshima was worth the price in that it ended the war before the invasion of Japan , which promised to be devastating to both sides .
I honestly believe the use of the atomic bomb saved lives in the long run .
There were a lot of lives saved .
Most of the lives saved were Japanese .
In 2005 , Van Kirk came as close as he ever got to regret .
I pray no man will have to witness that sight again .
Such a terrible waste , such a loss of life .
We unleashed the first atomic bomb , and I hope there will never be another .
I pray that we have learned a lesson for all time .
But I 'm not sure that we have .
After the war , Van Kirk got a masters degree in chemical engineering and worked for DuPont until his retirement .
Van Kirk passed away in 2014 .
Major Thomas Ferebee , Bombardier
Thomas Ferebee pushed the button that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima .
He slept in the plane both before and after he did his part .
After the war , Ferebee stayed with the Air Force , serving in the Strategic Air Command and in Vietnam .
He retired as a full Colonel .
Colonel Ferebee , who retired from the Air Force in 1970 , always argued that the Hiroshima bomb was necessary .
" I 'm convinced that the bombing saved many lives by ending the war , " he told Newsweek magazine in 1970 .
That does n't mean he had no opinion on the further use of such weapons .
" Now we should look back and remember what just one bomb did , or two bombs , " he told The Charlotte Observer in 1995 , the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima .
" Then I think we should realize that this can't happen again . "
Colonel Ferebee died in Florida in 2000 , at the age of 81 .
Lieutenant Jacob Beser , Electronic Countermeasures
Army Air Force radar specialist Jacob Beser was the only man who served on both the Enola Gay in the Hiroshima bombing mission and the Bock 's Car three days later when its crew bombed Nagasaki .
He could n't look at the detonation of the bombs because he was charged with monitoring for outside signals that could have detonated the bomb early and monitoring for signals of the proper detonation .
This is addition for keeping an eye on radar for any enemy planes .
In this 1985 interview for the Washington Post , Beser was asked if he would do it again .
Given the same circumstances in the same kind of context , the answer is yes .
However , you have to admit that the circumstances do n't exist now .
They probably never will again .
I have no regrets , no remorse about it .
As far as our country was concerned , we were three years downstream in a war , going on four .
The world had been at war , really , from the '30s in China , continuously , and millions and millions of people had been killed .
Add to that the deliberate killing that went on in Europe , [ and ] it 's kind of ludicrous to say well , geez , look at all those people that were instantly murdered .
In November of 1945 there was an invasion of Japan planned .
Three million men were gonna be thrown against Japan .
There were about three million Japanese digging in for the defense of their homeland , and there was a casualty potential of over a million people .
That 's what was avoided .
If you take the highest figures of casualties of both cities , say , 300,000 combined casualties in Hiroshima [ and ]
Nagasaki , versus a million , I 'm sorry to say , it 's a good tradeoff .
It 's a very cold way to look at it , but it 's the only way to look at it .
Now looking into tomorrow , that 's something else again .
I do n't have any pat answers for that .
After the war , Beser was an engineer at Sandia Laboratories where nuclear research continued and at Westinghouse where he worked on classified projects for the military .
He retired in 1985 .
In 1988 , Beser wrote a book called Hiroshima and Nagasaki Revisited .
He died of cancer in 1992 at age 71 .
Sergeant Joseph Stiborik , Radar Operator
There is n't a lot of biographical information available on radar operator Joe Stiborik , except for some of his reminiscences of the mission .
Joe Stiborik remembered the crew sitting in stunned silence on the return flight .
The only words he recollected hearing were Lewis 's " My God , what have we done . " 
He explained , " I was dumbfounded .
Remember , nobody had ever seen what an A - bomb could do before .
Here was a whole damn town nearly as big as Dallas , one minute all in good shape and the next minute disappeared and covered with fires and smoke ... There was almost no talk I can remember on our trip back to the base .
It was just too much to express in words , I guess .
We were all in a kind of state of shock .
I think the foremost thing in all our minds was that this thing was going to bring an end to the war and we tried to look at it that way . " 
Stiborik died of a heart attack in 1984 at age 69 .
2nd Lieutenant Morris Jeppson , Ordnance Expert
Morris Jeppson was only 23 years old when he was assigned to accompany the atomic bomb on the Enola Gay .
It was his duty to arm the bomb and make sure it would work .
Jeppson had the power to abort the mission if it did n't .
It was his first and last mission of the war .
Jeppson had worked in developing the mechanics of the bomb , and after the war he continued on the nuclear path .
He studied physics at Berkeley and worked in the radiation laboratory there .
Then he worked on developing hydrogen thermonuclear weapons at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory .
Jeppson went on to invent and market hi-tech machinery for medical and industrial uses .
In 1995 , Jeppson looked back at the Hiroshima mission .
Until the 509th reunion that year Jeppson had n't given the mission much thought .
" Those bomb plugs were just kicking around in a drawer " for years , he says .
Still , he maintains that dropping the bomb on Hiroshima was a necessary means to help end the war .
He points to wartime concerns that Germany was developing nuclear bomb technology .
" If that had happened , the world would be an entirely different place ( today ) , " he says .
Jeppson passed away in 2010 .
Private Richard Nelson , Radar Operator
Richard Nelson was the youngest of the Enola Gay crew .
He was 20 years old in August of 1945 .
He relayed the news of the atomic bomb to his superiors in code , who forwarded it to President Truman : " Results excellent . "
After the war , Nelson got a degree in business administration and made a career as a salesman .
Fifty years later , he had no regrets about his part in the mission .
" War is a terrible thing , " he told The Riverside Press - Enterprise on the 50th anniversary of the bombing .
" It takes and it destroys .
Anyone feels sorry for people who are killed .
We are all human beings .
But I do n't feel sorry I participated in it .
If I had known the results of the mission beforehand , I would have flown it anyway . "
Nelson died from emphysema in 2003 at age 77 .
Staff Sergeant Robert Caron , Tail Gunner
Enola Gay tail gunner Bob Caron wrote a book about the mission called Fire of a Thousand Suns .
Despite his description of the bomb 's effects , he never regretted being part of the mission .
In an interview with the Rocky Mountain News published two weeks before he died , Mr. Caron said he had no regrets about his role in the World War II bombing .
" No remorse , no bad dreams , " he said .
" We accomplished our mission . "
Caron died of pneumonia in 1995 .
He was 75 years old .
Staff Sergeant Wyatt Duzenbury , Flight Engineer
Wyatt Duzenbury kept tabs on the Enola Gay 's engines and other systems while others tended the bomb and the mission itself .
He considered it an honor to be chosen for the secret bombing mission that was to shorten the war .
After 1945 , he stayed with the Air Force .
In his retirement , he looked back at the mission .
...he told the Lansing State Journal in 1985 , " We were told to go , cranked up , dropped it , and came home . "
He told the newspaper that he did n't feel guilty about his mission , but did " not feel good about the 100,000 people who died . "
In an earlier interview , he said , " Personally , I feel that if we had n't dropped that bomb , and the other crew had n't dropped its bomb on Nagasaki , it would have cost thousand of US soldiers ' lives establishing a beach head for the invasion of Japan . "
Duzenbury died in 1992 at age 71 .
Sergeant Robert H. Shumard , Assistant Flight Engineer
Robert Shumard assisted flight engineer Wyatt Duzenbury in keeping the Enola Gay running .
In a 1960 interview , Shumard said he did n't feel honored to do what they did , but he felt honored to be selected for the mission .
And given the circumstances , he would do it again .
" Nobody actually wants to cause the destruction we caused , " he said .
" But it was through a necessity rather than a wanton type of destruction .
It was something that had to be done .
As much as a man has gangrene in his leg , and they have to cut it off .
It 's something that has to be done .
It was a cancer in the world situation that had to be removed , that 's all . "
Captain Deke Parsons , Weaponeer
Naval gunnery officer William " Deke " Parsons was pulled from sea duty to work on the Manhattan Project in 1943 .
He helped turn the nuclear bomb into a weapon of war , from development to assembly to delivery .
He armed the first atomic bomb while the Enola Gay was airborne .
After the war , Parsons continued in nuclear weapons development , rising to the rank of Rear Admiral .
He oversaw the Operation Crossroads nuclear testing project and also served on the Atomic Energy Commission .
Parsons witnessed seven of the first eight nuclear explosions .
There are no quotes available from Parsons as he was still serving in the Navy when he died of a sudden heart attack in 1953 .
He was 52 years old .
Captain Robert Lewis , Co-Pilot
Air Force flier Robert Lewis was a pilot first and foremost .
He was upset that commander Paul Tibbets had named his plane the Enola Gay .
But he was also dedicated to the mission , and earned Tibbets ' respect despite the animosity between the two .
Lewis wrote a diary of the mission in a notebook during the flight to Hiroshima , against orders .
He later sold it for $ 37,000 .
It was resold in 2002 for almost ten times that much .
He is often quoted :
" As the bomb fell over Hiroshima and exploded , we saw an entire city disappear .
I wrote in my log the words : ' My God , what have we done ? ' " 
Some sources say that quote was a revision after the fact .
Later in life , Lewis defended the mission .
Over the past half century , some of the crew have returned to the city to take part in the annual commemoration celebrations .
Lewis never did .
For him " it was just a job of work .
I helped make the world a safer place .
Nobody has dared launch an atomic bomb since then .
That is how I want to be remembered .
The man who helped to do that . "
Lewis died of a heart attack at age 65 in 1983 .
Colonel Paul Tibbets , Commander and Pilot
Lieutenant Colonel Paul Tibbets was chosen to head the bomb delivery mission in September of 1944 , and he selected the rest of the crew .
At that time , the Manhattan Project was preparing to drop a bomb on Europe as well as Asia .
After the mission , Tibbets remained in the Air Force until 1966 , achieving the rank of Brigadier General .
He worked as an aviation executive until his retirement in 1970 .
In a 2002 interview with Studs Terkel , Tibbets said he never had second thoughts about the mission :
Number one , I got into the air corps to defend the United States to the best of my ability .
That 's what I believe in and that 's what I work for .
Number two , I 'd had so much experience with airplanes ...
I 'd had jobs where there was no particular direction about how you do it and then of course I put this thing together with my own thoughts on how it should be because when I got the directive I was to be self - supporting at all times .
On the way to the target I was thinking : I can't think of any mistakes I 've made .
Maybe I did make a mistake : maybe I was too damned assured .
At 29 years of age I was so shot in the ass with confidence I did n't think there was anything I could n't do .
Of course , that applied to airplanes and people .
So , no , I had no problem with it .
I knew we did the right thing because when I knew we'd be doing that I thought , yes , we 're going to kill a lot of people , but by God we 're going to save a lot of lives .
We wo n't have to invade [ Japan ] .
Tibbets died in 2007 at age 92 .
He had requested cremation and no physical memorial , because it would become a pilgrimage site for nuclear protesters .

Combine strength training with stretching and you 'll get stronger Doing static stretching before your strength training will decrease the quality of your workout .
But that does n't mean that static stretching exercises are worthless for strength athletes .
Quite the reverse , says sports scientist Joke Kokkonen from the Brigham Young University Hawaii .
Kokkonen discovered that strength athletes make more progress by doing stretch exercises on the days that they do n't do strength training .
Stretching
Let 's just refresh our memories .
There are two ways to stretch your muscles : dynamic and static .
Dynamic stretching means ' pumping ' your muscles : you adopt a stretch pose , then keep on gently pushing the stretch to the point where you feel it in your muscle , and then release so that the muscle returns quickly to its original length .
This type of stretching improves performance if you use it before or during a sprint training session .
With static stretching you also adopt a stretch pose .
You stretch until you feel the stretch in the muscle , and then you maintain that position for a longer amount of time .
This type of stretching is safer than dynamic stretching , but if you use it just before a weights or running session then your performance will suffer .
Nevertheless there are animal studies in which rats gained 13 percent more calf muscle mass when the researchers stretched their soleus muscle 3 times a week for a period of 4 weeks .
[ J Appl Physiol .
1994 Jul ; 77( 1 ) : 58-62 . ]
What 's more , fundamental research has shown that stretching has much the same effect on muscles as weight training does .
Both stretching and training cause minute tears in the muscle tissue – Z - line ruptures – which stimulate the muscle cells to produce growth factors .
And these growth factors in turn prompt the manufacture of new muscle fibres .
Study
That 's why Kokkonen decided to do a trial with 16 male and 16 female students , none of whom had ever done weight training .
Kokkonen divided the students into 2 groups .
One group trained their leg muscles for 8 weeks . [ WT ]
On Mondays , Wednesdays and Fridays the students went to a gym where they did leg curls , leg extensions and leg presses using a weight at which they could just manage 8 reps .
They did 3 sets of each exercise , and rested for 2 - 3 minutes between sets .
The other group followed exactly the same programme , but on Tuesdays and Thursdays they did leg stretching exercises .
[ WT+ST ]
The stretch exercises took 30 minutes to do , and consisted of 15 exercises that covered all the leg muscles .
Results
After 8 weeks there was no difference in bodyweight between the groups .
Kokkonen says nothing about body composition .
But when it came to body strength , there were clear differences between the groups .
The WT +ST group had built up more strength than the WT group .
The tables below show the results for the weight at which the test subjects were able to just do 1 repetition [ 1 RM ] .
This had increased in the WT group , but it had increased more in the WT +ST group .
In the WT group the increase in the 1RM was 86 Newton for the leg extension exercise , 46 for the leg curl and 80 for the leg press .
[ Divide by ten for the number of kilograms . ]
In the WT +ST group the figures were 160 , 81 and 273 Newton .
So the progression in the WT +ST was clearly greater ..
Nagging thought ..
We would make one critical remark here about this study : the progression of the WT group is very low .
If you have a group of healthy young people who have never done strength training before , and then get them to do leg presses for 8 weeks , how likely is it that their 1 RM only increases by 8 kg ?
This is an improbably low amount .
Even if you train like a wet dishrag , it 's still ludicrously low .
The progression that the test subjects in the WT +ST group made on the other hand is pretty normal .
If you 're thinking of experimenting with stretch days , just do n't have too high expectations .

Microwaves speed up muscle recovery after strength training
Strength athletes who use microwaves for their muscles a day before training recover more quickly from their workout .
The treatment has an anticatabolic effect .
Strength training results in more muscle growth when combined with heat treatment
Strength training may result in more muscle mass if athletes also expose their muscle three times a week to a heat source that raises the temperature of their muscles by 4 degrees Celsius .
The joint effect of strength training and ginger supplementation
This study suggests that ginger supplementation boosts the number of kgs muscle mass you build with strength training , and the number of kgs fat you lose as a result .
The Chinese government has threatened sanctions against Google Google has stopped censoring its search results in China , ignoring warnings by the country 's authorities .
The US company said its Chinese users would be redirected to the uncensored pages of its Hong Kong website .
In January , Google had complained about a " sophisticated cyber attack originating from China " .
China accused Google of violating a " written promise " it made when entering the market to abide by laws requiring it to filter its search service .
A Chinese official was quoted by the state - run Xinhua news agency as saying Google 's decision to ignore the promise regarding its Chinese - language search portal Google.cn was " totally wrong " .
The White House said it was dismayed that Google and China had not been able to resolve their differences .
We very much hope that the Chinese government respects our decision , though we are well aware that it could at any time block access to our services
David Drummond , chief legal officer , Google US National Security spokesman Mike Hammer said : " We are disappointed that Google and the Chinese government were unable to reach an agreement that would allow Google to continue operating its search services in China on its Google.cn website . "
Chinese government officials had warned Google repeatedly that it would face consequences if it did not comply with the country 's censorship rules .
In a blog post , the company said the Chinese government had been " crystal clear throughout our discussions that self - censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement " .
Slowdowns Google 's chief legal officer , David Drummond , said that providing " uncensored search " from Google.com.hk was " a sensible solution to the challenges we 've faced - it 's entirely legal and will meaningfully increase access to information for people in China " .
It said there might be some service slowdowns and delays in getting search results while it beefs up resources to handle the re-directed queries .

" We very much hope that the Chinese government respects our decision , though we are well aware that it could at any time block access to our services , " Mr Drummond wrote in the blog post .
He added that Google would carefully monitor access and provide regular updates via a dedicated page to show what was available via its services in mainland China .
One cause of the row was Google 's revelation on 12 January that it - and more than 20 other companies - had been the victim of a cyber attack that originated inside China .
During the attack Google lost some intellectual property and discovered that the attack was aimed at the GMail accounts of human rights activists .
This attack led Google to " review the feasibility " of its Chinese operations .
In the blog entry posted on 22 March , Google said it would maintain an R&D and sales presence in China .
It said the size of its sales team would depend on how many Chinese people can get at the Hong Kong - based site .
Currently about 700 of Google 's 20,000 strong workforce are based in China .
Opportunity cost On Sunday , state media in China had attacked Google for what they described as the company 's " intricate ties " with the US government .
Baidu is the market leader for online search in China Google provided US intelligence agencies with a record of its search engine results , Xinhua said .
While Google is the world 's most popular search engine , it is a distant number two in the Chinese market , which is dominated by Baidu .
However , because of the size and growth rate of China 's internet population , any loss of business there is likely to harm Google 's future growth prospects .
Analysts said that initially Google 's prospects would not be dented by shutting down Google.cn as it is responsible , at most , for 2 % of its annual $ 24bn ( £ 15.9 bn ) revenue .
" Near - term , not that big a deal , " said Tim Ghriskey , chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management .
" Long - term , if this stays in place , it 's a negative .
China is certainly a great growth opportunity . "
China operates one of the most sophisticated and wide - reaching censorship systems in the world .
Thousands of police officers are employed to monitor web activity and many automated systems watch blogs , chat rooms and other sites to ensure that banned subjects , such as Tiananmen Square , are not discussed .

The Memphis Grizzlies are sending No. 2 overall pick Hasheem Thabeet to the D - League , the team announced on Thursday .
Thabeet is the highest draft pick ever sent to the D - League by an NBA team .
A team can assign players to D - League duty only during their first two seasons as a pro .
Thabeet 's assignment to the Dakota Wizards -- Memphis ' North Dakota - based affiliate -- was first reported by the Web site RidiculousUpside.com , which covers the D - League extensively .
Before the team 's announcement , two sources close to the situation confirmed Thabeet 's impending D - League stint to ESPN.com .
Although the Grizzlies acknowledged that Thabeet was a long - term project when they selected him with the No. 2 pick in June over the likes of local collegiate star Tyreke Evans , Memphis was hoping that the 7 - foot - 3 center could survive as a backup in his first NBA season .
But Grizzlies coach Lionel Hollins announced earlier this week that second - year center Hamed Haddadi of Iran would begin receiving Thabeet 's minutes behind starting center Marc Gasol .
The Grizzlies , according to NBA front - office sources , offered Thabeet and second - year guard O.J. Mayo to the Golden State Warriors for Warriors guard Monta Ellis before the Feb. 18 trade deadline but were turned down .
Thabeet , 23 , is averaging just 2.5 points and 2.9 rebounds in 10.3 minutes per game for the Grizzlies and supplants Portland 's Martell Webster -- who played eight games for the now - defunct Fort Worth Flyers in the D - League in 2005 - 06 as the No. 6 overall pick in the draft -- as the highest draftee ever to play in the NBA 's official minor league .

Please listen to this clip again - I 'm hearing something that to me is a possible confirmation that he was going on a suicide mission .
At 1:26.5 into the clip , I heard : " I 'm definitely checking out - have a great day .
" Am I the only one who hears this ?
Also , KXAN reported that nothing unusual was said in his last communication , and they aired a clip where he said " Thanks for your help , have a great day .
" So where did they get that clip - it certainly was n't from the above clip , because the phrase is clearly different when put side by side .
Just curious ...
This news nugget will have you smacking your forehead and crying " Why did n't I think of that ! ? "
Sagem and Telefónica have taken a regular old cellphone SIM card , and stuffed a Wi -Fi radio inside .
Even the name is obvious : SIMFi .
It works like this :
You pop the card into a cellphone , and " SIM toolkit applets " , essentially control software on the card itself , take care of settings and broadcast .
The radio inside creates a hotspot to share your 3G HSPA connection via Wi -Fi .
It is ingenious .
With the huge Telefónica as part of the partnership , you can expect a big push .
And because this will work on almost any phone , and replaces something you have to have anyway - a SIM - there 's no reason that this should n't be in every cellphone in the next couple of years .
The SIMFi will be launched at next week 's MWC trade - show in Barcelona , Spain , where we should find out dates and pricing .

A major trade group for the insurance industry is warning that it is " exceedingly risky " for companies to blindly accept scientific conclusions around climate change , given the " serious questions " around the extent to which humans cause atmospheric warming .
The assertion was made in a letter ( pdf ) to insurance regulators , who will administer the nation 's first mandatory climate requirements on corporations in May .
Large insurers will have to answer about a dozen questions related to the preparations they are taking to safeguard themselves from climatic hazards .
The National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies believes that the new regulation leaves little room for companies to cast doubt on widely accepted assumptions about global warming .
Insurers are hamstrung to provide answers that dovetail with the perception of key regulators who believe climate change threatens the industry 's financial strength , said Robert Detlefsen , the group 's vice president of policy .
" It 's fairly obvious that certain regulators have made up their minds about what the answers to those questions are , and are just proceeding on the assumption that their answers , or the ones that they subscribe to , are correct and unimpeachable , " Detlefsen said in an interview .
" There really is no room , as I see it , for any sort of legitimate , in their minds at least , for legitimate dissent . "
The group consists of 1,400 insurance companies that underwrite about 40 percent of the nation 's property and casualty premiums , according to its Web site .
Only a fraction of its membership , however , would be required to answer the climate survey when the new regulation goes into effect this spring .
The rule covers large companies that collect at least $ 500 million in annual premiums .
State insurance regulators adopted a white paper in 2008 that states " global warming is occurring . "
That preceded the new regulated survey , which flustered many insurance officials during its drafting .
But most of the opposition was rooted in concerns around revealing secrets to competitors and making companies vulnerable to lawsuits , not around doubts about climate science .
Now , four months before insurers have to submit their climate answers , Detlefsen is raising perhaps his strongest concerns around the state of scientific integrity , regulators ' belief in those findings , and the way that the companies ' answers could be exploited by environmentalists .
" We fear ... that the wording of the survey questions , together with the public pronouncements of some regulators , will inhibit the expression of what might be viewed as unwelcome ' contrarian ' responses , " Detlefsen wrote in the letter earlier this week .
E -mails said to show some climate scientists ' at war ' with others
His concern was based primarily on the release of stolen e-mails late last year from scientists working at the premier Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom .
Supportive scientists and politicians have largely dismissed the controversy , saying it does not undercut years of research on rising temperatures , expanding seas and precipitation changes .
But Detlefsen 's letter says the " e- mails show that a close - knit group of the world 's most influential climate scientists actively colluded to subvert the peer - review process ... manufactured pre-determined conclusions through the use of contrived analytic techniques ; and discussed destroying data to avoid government freedom - of - information requests . "
" Viewed collectively , the CRU e-mails reveal a scientific community in which a group of scientists promoting what has become , through their efforts , the dominant climate - change paradigm are at war with other scientists derisively labeled as ' skeptics , ' ' deniers , ' and ' contrarians , ' " he added .
The upcoming survey regulation has also caused jitters among some regulators .
Indiana Insurance Commissioner Carol Cutter , who was appointed by Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels , an opponent of cap - and - trade legislation , is still considering whether to administer the survey at the state level .
Overall , the insurance industry is addressing climate change , which might increase damage claims , affect insurers ' investments , and provide opportunities to offer " green " policies , Joel Ario , Pennsylvania 's insurance commissioner and chairman of the national climate change task force that adopted the new survey , said in an interview last week .
" The insurers are perhaps the one group that is more concerned about climate change than the environmentalists , " Ario said .
" If climate change does pose the risk that environmentalists say it does , then guess who 's going to bear that risk on their business ?
It will be the insurers . "

Bravo Peter Lindbergh for producing another spread of unretouched images , this time for Harper ’s Bazaar .
Lindbergh shot supermodels including Cindy Crawford , Amber Valletta , and Shalom Harlow with no makeup and minimal retouching for the September issue .
Sure , it ’s the group of people in the world who need the least retouching to begin with .
But it ’s the most natural thing we ’ve seen in a fashion magazine since Lindbergh ’s shots of Monica Bellucci , Sophie Marceau , and Eva Herzigova for the covers of French Elle earlier this year , who were also unretouched and wearing no makeup .
Lindbergh told the Times in May , “ Heartless retouching should not be the chosen tool to represent women in the beginning of this century . ”
Bravo Harper ’s Bazaar for running the story .
We hope to see more magazines give their retouchers a few days off .
But will any be bold enough to produce a spread of models or actresses or — perish the thought — normal people wearing something other than tank tops or oversize white shirts ?
Like swimwear ?
See Lindbergh ’s new Bazaar shoot in the slideshow .

Trump is sticking with his plan to energize voters with events that show he does n’t care about their health
President Trump has scheduled large campaign rallies this weekend in Wisconsin despite recommendations from the White House Coronavirus Task Force that call for increasing social distancing in the state “ to the maximal degree possible . ”
The task force has further flagged La Crosse and Green Bay , the metropolitan areas where Trump plans to gather thousands of supporters Saturday , as coronavirus “ red zones , ” the highest level of concern for community spread of the virus , according to a report from the group released Sunday and obtained by The Washington Post .
Wisconsin is listed in the document as the state with the third - highest rate of new cases in the country , with 243 new cases per 100,000 people over the previous week , about 2.6 times greater than the national average .
Ahead of Trump ’s scheduled rally in Green Bay , the Bellin Health System said Tuesday that its hospital in that city is at 94 percent capacity as covid - 19 continues to spike in the community .
“ During the intense period of viral surge , large numbers of acutely infected individuals caused exponential growth in infections , ” the task force report reads in a section about Wisconsin .
“ Although young adults are the most affected group currently , spread to other age groups is inevitable . ”
WASHINGTON  When Republicans take President Obama up on his invitation to hash out their differences over health care this month , they will carry with them a fairly well - developed set of ideas intended to make health insurance more widely available and affordable , by emphasizing tax incentives and state innovations , with no new federal mandates and only a modest expansion of the federal safety net .
It is not clear that Republicans and the White House are willing to negotiate seriously with each other , and Mr. Obama has rejected Republican demands that he start from scratch in developing health care legislation .
But Congressional Republicans have laid out principles and alternatives that provide a road map to what a Republican health care bill would look like if they had the power to decide the outcome .
The different approaches will be on display Feb. 25 , when lawmakers from both parties are scheduled to go to Blair House , across the street from the White House , for a televised clash of health policy ideas .
Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kotov ( in red striped spacesuit ) works on the International Space Station 's new Poisk module to activate its docking port systems in a spacewalk on Jan. 14 , 2010 .
Thisstory was updated at 4:44 p.m. ET .
Two Russiancosmonauts took a spacewalk outside the International Space Station Thursday tostart up a new docking port on the roof of the orbiting lab .
CosmonautsOleg Kotov and Maxim Suraev floated outside the station at 5:05 a.m. EST ( 1005GMT ) and spent almost six hours hooking up cables , antennas and other gear toactivate the station ?s new Poiskdocking port .
RussianMission Control asked the cosmonauts how the weather was in space as they begantheir work .
? As long asit doesn?t rain , we ?ll be fine because we didn ?t take any umbrellas with us , ?
Suraevjoked in Russian .
?
I was hoping to get a suntan .?
The 5 - hour , 44 - minute spacewalk was the third for Kotov , a veteran cosmonaut , and the firstfor Suraev , who marveled at space after leaving the station while flying 210 miles ( 337 km ) above the southern Pacific Ocean .
? It looksgreat , although it ? s still pretty dark , ?
he said .
?
Wow , am I really out ??
Also knownas the Mini-Research Module 2 , the Poisk module is a small science room thatarrived at the space station in November 2009 to serve as research space .
Itdoubles as an airlock and docking port , adding an extra parking spot forRussian - built Soyuz and Progress spacecraft .
That extraparking is vital for the spacestation to support full , six - person crews , which require at least two Soyuzferry ships docked at all times to serve as lifeboats in emergencies .
Unmanned Progress cargo ships typically take up a third spot , and a fourth docking portat the front of the station is built to host visiting NASA space shuttles .
WithPoisk , the station has five docking ports in all .
Spacestation astronauts plan to dock a spacecraft at Poisk , which means ?
Explore ?
inRussian , for the first time on Jan. 21 , when they move their Soyuz vehicle froma different port , mission managers said .
The Poiskmodule is about 13 feet ( 4 meters ) long , 8 feet ( 2.5 meters ) wide and weighsabout 8,000 pounds ( 3,628 kg ) .
It has about 380 cubic feet ( 10.7 cubic meters ) of usable living space inside .
Thursday ? sspacewalk was the 24th Russian spacewalk outside the space station and the 137th excursion overall dedicated to the orbiting laboratory ?s construction andmaintenance .
Kotov and Suraev tossed two big wads of space trash ?
unneeded insulation covers ? overboard during the spacewalk .
The trash is expected to burn up in the Earth ? satmosphere in about two weeks .
They also retrieved a Russian biology experimentfrom the outer hull of the space station .
The $ 100 billion space station has been underconstruction for more than a decade and is due to be completed later thisyear .
The space station is home to five spaceflyers ?
two Russians , twoAmericans and one Japanese astronaut .
With threespacewalks now under his belt , Kotov ended the day with 16 hours and 46 minutesof orbital work .
Suraev , meanwhile , has five hours and 44 minutes ofspacewalking time after one excursion .
At times , the cosmonauts were well ahead of schedule and paused to take photos .
? You are asuperstar , ?
Suraev said as he took the snapshots of his crewmate .
Thespacewalk came at a busy time for the space station crew .
Earlier this week , the astronauts used the outpost ?s robotic arm to move a huge spare parts shelffrom one end of the space station to the other to prepare for more deliverieslater this year .
Next week , the astronauts will move one of their Soyuz spacecraft to the new Poisk dockingport , then gear up for the arrival of the spaceshuttle Endeavour in early February .
Endeavouris due to launch six astronauts to the space station on Feb. 7 to deliver a newmodule and observation port for the orbiting laboratory .
Apple ’s lawsuit against HTC is not the first example of patents having a huge influence on how we are allowed to design user interfaces .
If you ’ve ever played a videogame and wondered why the game did n’t give you anything to do while a new level was loading , Namco ’s patent is the answer .
If you ’ve ever bought something from an online store and wondered why you could n’t just click on « Buy » and receive the item a few days later , Amazon ’s patent is the answer ( and yes , Apple has licensed that patent for the iTunes store ) .
There are more examples on Wikipedia .
Marco Arment has an insightful take on the situation , and John Gruber has a pretty good lineup of the current patent situation , but I wanted to add two points that I think deserve more attention .
Small Companies
Gruber mentions large corporations and patent trolls in his essay .
But small firms ( with one to nineteen employees ) make up the majority of all corporations .
While large corporations can afford to get defensive patent portfolios , small corporations often can’t .
It ’s not that they could n’t come up with ideas to patent .
Most small companies could easily come up with dozens or hundreds of patentable ideas within days .
But actually getting patents is expensive .
Not just in terms of money ( including paying lawyers ) , but also in terms of time .
If employees are writing patents , they ’re not improving the company ’s products .
So most small to medium companies can’t afford to build up defensive patent portfolios .
That means they ca n’t enter into cross-licensing agreements with larger companies .
And since it is virtually impossible to not violate any of the patents held by large companies like IBM , Apple , or Microsoft , this makes small companies - and open source projects - vulnerable to patent litigation .
As Marco Arment writes :
As a working software developer , the thought of accidentally and unknowingly stumbling into someone ’s patent is terrifying .
And yet it is impossible to avoid doing exactly that .
Instead of protecting small companies and projects , the patent system is giving large companies a tool they can use to go after them .
This is the reality of running a small software company :
There is nothing you can do to defend yourself .
Patents Are Supposed to Be a Trade - Off
An inventor comes up with a new invention .
The state then offers to protect this invention for a limited period of time .
However , in exchange for this protection , the inventor writes up a detailed description explaining how the invention works , and agrees to publish this explanation .
The goal is to get new inventions published , instead of kept secret .
In other words , the inventor « pays » for the protection by giving society ( and his competition ) access to the invention .
This trade - off does not apply to many software patents .
I only need to spend five minutes on Amazon ’s site to figure out how one - click shopping works .
There is nothing useful I can learn from reading the patent .
Likewise , I only need to turn on an iPhone once to figure out how to unlock it .
This means that Amazon or Apple do n’t give up anything when they patent these ideas .
There is no trade - off involved ; the state grants these patents « for free » , because nobody gains anything from the publication of these ideas .
They are already public .
Hence , most software patents are a rather one - sided affair .
The companies get protection for their ideas , but they do n’t have to give up anything in return .

If the Elven kings have 3 rings , the Dwarf Lords have 7 Rings , mortal men have 9 rings , and Sauron has one ring , how many rings does it take to rule them all ?
This is why Balrogs need solid math fundamentals .
While not mythological , Tolkien ’s Lord of the Rings is pretty legendary amongst fantasy enthusiasts and authors .
Nearly everything about it has been ripped off , altered , or outright copied by later authors due to its success and widespread appeal .
I ’m not sure if I ’ve mentioned this before , but as far as books go , I ’ve always preferred the Hobbit to the Lord of the Rings .
There ’s something about a good solid story with a strong character and plot arc that I find vastly superior to a sort of rambling epic designed as an exploration of a created world .
That ’s not to say that Lord of the Rings is bad , just that its predecessor is a better work of narrative fiction .
I am both hopeful and terrified at the prospects of the Hobbit movie .
Anyway , Balrogs are pretty neat .
William helped come up with this idea and I had to do it .
It took me a while to figure out how to do it well and I still feel like this would make a better animation than it does a comic , but I ’m happy with it .
I have n’t got time to animate happle tea anyway .
Oh yeah , the Happle Tea iPhone game is hitting the iTunes store on Saturday I believe .
It ’s a very simple little pixel - art game that I made for school last semester , coded by Lajos Kamocsay and with music by William .
I think its working pretty well now and if it is n’t , well , it ’s free .
It is also on par with that bike race in Battle Toads in terms of difficulty .
Savor it .
Leave it to science to take all the fun out of something as cosmically pure as love .
Theories about love ’s purpose range from the biologically practical to the biologically complicated .
Anthropologists have said it helps ensure reproduction of the species ; attachment theorists maintain it ’s a byproduct of our relationship with our childhood caregivers .
And now researchers are exploring what happens physiologically as a romantic relationship progresses .
The more we understand it , they say , the better our chances of making love last and of harnessing its potential to improve our emotional and physical well - being .
Whatever its reason , there can be little doubt -- even from a scientific standpoint -- about the potent feelings that being in love elicits .
Arthur Aron , a social psychologist at Stony Brook University in New York , has done brain scans on people newly in love and found that after that first magical meeting or perfect first date , a complex system in the brain is activated that is essentially “ the same thing that happens when a person takes cocaine . ”
In one such study , published in 2005 , Aron recruited 10 women and seven men who had fallen in love within the last one to 17 months .
After taking a brief survey about the relationship ( items included statements such as “ I melt when looking deeply into ____ ’s eyes ” ) , participants were put in MRI machines and shown pictures of their beloved , interspersed with pictures of neutral acquaintances .
When participants viewed images of their partners , their brains ’ ventral tegmental area , which houses the reward and motivation systems , was flooded with the chemical dopamine .
“ Dopamine is released when you ’re doing something [ highly ] pleasurable , ” like having sex , doing drugs or eating chocolate , says Larry J. Young , a psychiatry professor at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Atlanta ’s Emory University .
Activation of this part of the brain is primarily responsible for causing the sometimes bizarre behavior of new couples , which is linked to motivation and achieving goals : excessive energy , losing sleep , euphoric feelings and , occasionally , anxiety and obsession when they ’re separated from their objet d’amour .
According to Helen Fisher , a biological anthropologist and author of “ Why Him ?
Why Her? , ” the smitten party is acting out of a motivation to “ win life ’s greatest prize -- a mating partner for life . ”
Bonding
After the dopamine surge , research suggests that two key hormones -- oxytocin and vasopressin -- enter the picture , encouraging couples to form emotional bonds .
Oxytocin is released in humans during intimate moments such as prolonged eye contact , hugging and sex .
It ’s also the hormone that causes mothers to bond with their infants .
And having been proved to be involved in long - term bonding in prairie voles and , most recently , marmosets , researchers speculate that it plays the same role in humans .
Vasopressin -- also linked to bonding in prairie voles -- has similarly been linked to bonding in men .
A 2008 study showed that a certain genetic variation of a vasopressin receptor was correlated with marital infidelity and fear of commitment .
All the chemicals and hormones released in new love help ensure that we mate and stay together long enough to reproduce or form partnerships for the long term .
But once they ’ve subsided , what happens ?
Until recently , researchers assumed that most couples eventually settle into what ’s called companionate love : relationships that are more intimate , more committed -- and much less thrilling .
A recent study , however , proved this theory ( and years of marriage sitcoms ) wrong .
Bianca Acevedo , postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Barbara , looked at brain scans of couples claiming to be madly in love after 20 years of marriage .
She and her colleagues found that these fortunate folks had the same neural activity observed in newly in love couples , only without the anxiety or obsession .
Acevedo also discovered something that surprised even her : Based on preliminary surveys , this kind of lasting love appears to be present in approximately 30 % of married couples in the U.S .
That does n’t mean , though , that those of us who do n’t fall squarely into that group should throw in the towel .
Researchers believe that we have a lot to learn from these happy couples , if only we ’re willing to do so .
To begin with , a great deal of research shows that doing novel , exciting things together boosts marital happiness .
“ Take a class together that you know nothing about , ” suggests Aron , who has co-written several studies in this area .
“ See a play , go to a new location , go to a horse race . ”
The release of dopamine during these activities might remind couples of how it felt to fall in love or even be happily misattributed to the experience of being together .
The love upper
Also , says Acevedo , be thoughtful with your partner .
“ We know that things like celebrating the positive is important for a relationship ’s well - being , as well as being supportive when [ our partners ] need us , ” she says .
Couples that took part in Acevedo ’s study also resolved conflict smoothly and quickly , were affectionate and communicated openly with their partners , and spent time bettering themselves as well as the relationship .
“ And sex ! ” she adds .
“ Sex is always good . ”
These types of intimate , loving interactions between couples are all linked , Acevedo says , to bonding hormones .
“ There ’s a connection between being engaged in the relationship -- especially affection , disclosure and intimacy -- and oxytocin . ”
In fact , in one study , couples that had been administered the hormone were better able to calmly mediate conflict and to empathize with a partner .
Thomas Bradbury , a psychology professor at UCLA and co-director of the university ’s Relationship Institute , says that making beneficial relationship changes is n’t as difficult as they may seem .
People -- often men , he says -- “ think it ’s harder than it really is . ”
But the basic idea is simple : to listen and respond in a way that is supportive .
“ When your partner says , ‘ I had a funny dream last night , ’ you say , ‘ Tell me about it , ’ ” he says .
Or , instead of suggesting that your partner quit his or her job because of a difficult boss , he adds , empathize with their struggle .
Saying something as straightforward as , “ That must be hard when your boss criticizes you , ” can make all the difference .
As cozy and warm as coupledom feels , its benefits extend even further .
Healthy , happy marriages have long been linked to lower mortality rates and better immune functioning and , most recently , lower stress .
In satisfied couples , says Acevedo , oxytocin and vasopressin have been shown to activate parts of the brain that are associated with calm , and even pain suppression .
“ The way that we interpret those findings , ” she says , “ is that the quality of our relationship bonds has implications for our health . ”
Most research in the field of love has been done with married , heterosexual couples .
Acevedo suggests , however , that couples that have been living together for a long time but are not married may have comparable experiences .
“ If they ’re living together and almost like marriages , I would predict that they ’re highly similar to the married individuals . ”
Brain chemistry may not be foremost on most people ’s minds when they meet someone new or schedule a date night with their long - term partner .
But keeping the spark alive is more than just fun -- it may be vital .
And even for those of us who are n’t in love right now , the knowledge may prove useful in the future .
After all , says Aron , " [ just about ] everyone falls in love . ”

[ Updates below : Maybe ergot , maybe not .
The CIA ’s obsession with acid . ]
After ‘ Duke of Edinburgh asks female sea cadet if she works at a strip club ’ , the most popular story on the Telegraph website at the moment accuses the CIA of having secretly fed LSD to the villagers of Pont - Saint - Esprit in France in 1951 .
It ’s a serious accusation .
Not only would this be chemical warfare against an ally ( or quasi- ally at least ) , the Telegraph tells us that five people died and ‘ dozens were interned in asylums ’ after the ‘ quiet , picturesque village in southern France was suddenly and mysteriously struck down with mass insanity and hallucinations . ’
The timing of the story is very odd .
It is based on an obscure book by HP Albarelli , which was published in 2008 and is now out of print in the UK .
[ Albarelli has been in touch to say that the book is newly published , despite showing as 2008 on Amazon UK .
According to his publisher , TrineDay , the book was out November 2009 . ]
Albarelli ’s theories are dismissed out of hand by Steven Kaplan , the Goldwin Smith Professor of History at Cornell University and a noted bread expert ( yes , really ) .
Kaplan has also written a book about Pont - Saint - Esprit , in French , entitled Le Pain Maudit .
He was not interviewed by the Telegraph , however , but he made the following comment to France 24 :
I have numerous objections to this paltry evidence against the CIA .
First of all , it ’s clinically incoherent : LSD takes effects in just a few hours , whereas the inhabitants showed symptoms only after 36 hours or more .
Furthermore , LSD does not cause the digestive ailments or the vegetative effects described by the townspeople …
It is absurd , this idea of transmitting a very toxic drug by putting it in bread .
As for pulverising it [ for ingestion through the air ] , that technology was not even possible at that time .
Most compellingly , why would they choose the town of Pont - Saint - Esprit to conduct these tests ?
It was half - destroyed by the US Army during fighting with the Germans in the Second World War .
It makes no sense .
Now maybe Albarelli is right and Kaplan is wrong , but you ’d think the Telegraph would make some effort to talk to Kaplan before publishing a story that has gone around the Internet like wildfire .
It ’s not as if Henry Samuel , the Telegraph France correspondent , was n’t aware of Kaplan ’s work .
After all , parts of his article bear an extremely suspicious resemblance to a review of Kaplan ’s book , published by the New York Times in 2008 .
Here ’s the NYT :
What became a national disaster began on Aug. 16 , 1951 , when the inhabitants … were suddenly stricken by frightful hallucinations of being consumed by fire or giant plants or horrid beasts .
A worker tried to drown himself because his belly was being eaten by snakes …
A man saw his heart escaping through his feet and beseeched a doctor to put it back in place .
Many were taken to the local asylum in strait jackets .
And here ’s the Telegraph :
On August 16 , 1951 , the inhabitants were suddenly racked with frightful hallucinations of terrifying beasts and fire .
One man tried to drown himself , screaming that his belly was being eaten by snakes …
Another saw his heart escaping through his feet and begged a doctor to put it back .
Many were taken to the local asylum in strait jackets .
The details that are not from the Times ( “ An 11 - year - old tried to strangle his grandmother .
Another man shouted : “ I am a plane ” , before jumping out of a second - floor window , breaking his legs . ” ) come from this French blog post from Monday this week .
It presumably prompted the paper suddenly to jump on Albarelli ’s conspiracy theory ( and yes – it ’s a fairly close translation ) :
Un gamin de 11 ans , Charles Granjhon , tente d’étrangler sa mère …
Un homme saute du deuxième étage de l’hôpital en hurlant : “ Je suis un avion . ”
Les jambes fracturées , il se relève et court cinquante mètres sur le boulevard avant qu’on puisse le rattraper .
Questions for the Telegraph ’s editor :
1. Did Samuel read Albarelli ’s book or speak to him ?
[ Albarelli says he was n’t called by the Telegraph . ]
2 . Did he speak to Kaplan or any other sources ?
3 . Does he accept that the Telegraph plagiarized the Times ?
4 . And should n’t he set the bar a little higher before publishing stories of this type ?
As an added bonus , enjoy LSD a Go G0 , a short film from 2004 that Albarelli says he contributed to .

Update : Edited for clarity .
Update II : The Atlantic rounds up some more sceptical reaction .
James Redford points to a contemporaneous account from the British Medical Journal which blames what is still thought to be the most likely cause – ergot poisoning .
Symptoms lasted for a fortnight or more in some people , despite what was believed to have been just a single day when infected bread was ingested .
The worst symptoms appeared after six days and included ‘ severe delerium ’ in 25 cases :
Towards evening visual hallucinations appeared , recalling those of alcoholism .
The particular themes were visions of animals and of flames …
The delirium seemed to be systematized , with animal hallucinations and self - accusation , and it was sometimes mystical or macabre .
In some cases terrifying visions were followed by fugues , and two patients even threw themselves out of the window .
After fifteen days , four people had died – three were elderly , but one was only twenty - five years of age .
According to this review , however , Kaplan report that ergot was finally dismissed as a cause , but that other potential contaminants in the flour ( mercury or bleach , for instance ) were suspected .
The book sounds like a fascinating study of France in the long , hard years after the war :
Rationing had ended just two years earlier , but bread was still under tight controls to keep the prices low .
The cost of living was very high and the quality of a great many foodstuffs , principally that of bread , remained nearly as bad as during the Occupation …
The dirigiste nature of [ the distribution ] system meant that the bakers were assigned to specific millers , something they detested …
As the daily baguette tended to be lousy long after the Liberation , disgusting flour and grey or bad - smelling bread did not necessarily set off the alarms that it would have in better times .
In the same year as the collective poisoning in Pont - Saint - Esprit , there were quite a few instances of food - borne illness around the country : 110 people in Eure - et - Loir got sick from eating horsemeat ; three people died from tainted pâté du foie in the Ruhr ; contaminated powdered milk sickened many children in Metz .
Update III : In Wired , David Hambling writes about the CIA ’s ‘ obsession with LSD ’ , citing an account by Dr David Ketchum , who led the military ’s experiments with the drug .
In 1953 , the Agency attempted to purchase ten kilograms of LSD , supposedly for testing purposes .
This was enough for over a hundred million doses .
They were informed that the total amount manufactured was only ten grams .
However , on a Monday morning , a rather curious incident occurred .
Ketchum found that his office had acquired a new piece of furniture , a steel barrel like an oil drum in one corner of the room .
At first he ignored it , but eventually curiosity got the better of him , and one evening when he was along Ketchum undid the fastenings .
The barrel was packed with jars : Neatly labeled , tightly sealed glass canisters , looking like cookie jars , filled the entire drum .
I cautiously took one out and examined it .
According to the label , it contained approximately three pounds of pure EA 1729 ( LSD ) .
Ketchum estimated that the barrel contained at thirty to forty pounds of the drug , a few hundred million doses and with a street value of something like a billion dollars .
The sort of amount the CIA had been after .
Ketchum was not given any explanation for the giant stash , and on the Friday morning it had disappeared as mysteriously as it arrived .
Allegedly , the CIA ran brothels (! ) in New York and San Francisco to experiment on unwitting punters .
This from a 1977 Time exposé of Operation Midnight Climax ( really ) , which Time sources to Senate testimony :
At night , women lured men to the hideaways and fed them LSD or marijuana , while other men watched the action through two - way mirrors and tape - recorded the sounds .
Scenes from seamy bordellos ?
Havens for desperate voyeurs ?
No , these were taxpayer - financed operations of the CIA , which was experimenting with drugs during the 1950s and ’60s in a project with the sophomoric code name Midnight Climax .
The women , apparently moonlighting prostitutes , were paid $ 100 for each assignment by the CIA .
The operation , conducted by CIA alchemists from 1954 until 1963 , was part of a quarter - century hunt for a psychogenic philosophers ’ stone .
The purpose was to discover the secret of brainwashing , to protect U.S. agents and gain control over enemy spies .
Update IV : I think it ’s safe to say that I do n’t impress Albarelli that much .
We had a fairly cordial exchange of emails and a somewhat bewildering phone conversation , but he also asked for this to be added to the story [ my comments in square brackets ] :
I ’d simply like you to insert somewhere in an strongly observable spot a notice that you have never read or seen the book in question [ obvious from my post – nor had the Telegraph ] ; that you declined the offer of a free copy from its author [ false ] ; that you declined a discussion with the book ’s author [ false – and we subsequently talked ] ; that you were flat out wrong about its publication info [ true – and already corrected ] ; that you ’ve been offered exclusive info and declined to accept it [??? ] ; and that you really have no clue about what you ’re writing about on the subject [ insert joke here ] .
And that yet you still maintain this mission to reveal the sloppiness of the media when in all actuality the only real ‘ mistake ’ of sorts is that the press worldwide did what they ’ve done for the past 100 years .
In a nutshell , I think you ’ve lost your sense and purpose of mission and offered your self up as a major player and example in the entire story .
But that said , I ’d be happy to guide you out of it .
And there , for the while at least , we ’ll leave it .

The screenwriter Jane Goldman freely admits that her new film Kick - Ass " is not , obviously , for everyone " .
Perhaps she is thinking of the scene in which Hit - Girl , an 11 - year - old female assassin in a luminescent purple wig , enters a roomful of evil baddies and utters the immortal line : " OK you c**ts , let 's see what you can do now . "
Or maybe she is referring to the bit where Hit - Girl , in a conversation with her father about what she wants for her birthday , pretends to ask for a puppy before admitting with a coquettish giggle that " I 'm just fucking with you Daddy .
I 'll have a Benchmade model 42 butterfly knife . "
Or she could be recalling the moments where Hit - Girl shoots a man through his cheek or slices off a drug dealer 's leg with a machete .
Whatever the reason , Goldman is aware that Kick - Ass could cause something of a stir .
" I would n't take it personally if someone did n't enjoy the film , " she says when we meet .
" Certainly my 86 - year - old friend of the family , I 'd strongly recommend she does n't go and see it . "
She laughs , a tad uneasily .
Goldman , 39 , a talented writer who penned the widely - acclaimed 2007 film fantasy Stardust , is clearly nervous about how Kick - Ass will be received .
" You 've no idea how the audience is going to react , you just hold your breath , " she says , anxiously pressing her hands together , her face partially obscured by a curtain of dyed carmine red hair .
Later she will admit that she hates interviews .
Partly , one imagines , this is because she happens to be married to the television presenter Jonathan Ross , he of the floppy hair and the inflated salary and the lewd answerphone messages , and she is wary of saying anything that could add to the public circus that surrounds him .
But in this case the nerves are misplaced .
Kick - Ass is a brilliant and inventive piece of film - making and looks set to become one of the box - office hits of the year .
It tells the story of Dave Lizewski , a nerdy high school student and comic book fan who decides to become a superhero despite the fact that he has no special powers .
Dave ( played by Aaron Johnson , who recently starred as the young John Lennon in Nowhere Boy ) proves to be a fairly unsuccessful vigilante until fate brings him into contact with Hit - Girl , who has been trained by her father in the art of self - protection and who is the master of an astonishing array of weaponry , including butterfly knives and taser guns .
Directed by Matthew Vaughn , who also co-wrote the script and with whom Goldman worked before on Stardust , Kick - Ass is based on the eponymous superhero adventure penned by the Scottish comic book writer Mark Millar .
The film is shot through with Tarantino - esque action sequences but also manages to be extremely funny , despite the fact that the subject - matter – a pre-teen girl who swears like a sailor and shoots baddies dead with big guns – is somewhat problematic .
Seven American film studios turned down the script before Vaughn released it through his own production company .
" We just really wanted Hit - Girl to be a character who , in a sense , simply happens to be an 11 - year - old girl , in the same way that Ripley in Alien could have been a guy but the part happened to be played by Sigourney Weaver , " explains Goldman .
" She [ Hit - Girl ] is genuinely dangerous , she 's genuinely mad .
It 's not her fault : she 's been raised in this environment where she does n't know anything different .
She 's unwittingly part of a folie a deux . "
Does she think of Hit - Girl , who is played by the 13 - year - old actress Chloe Moretz , as a sort of hardcore mini-feminist , a challenge to the usual assumption that most movie violence is carried out by adult men ?
" Yeah ... she 's a feminist hero by token of the fact that she pays no attention to gender stereotypes .
I think she also does n't want special treatment because she 's a girl . "
The film caused controversy in the United States because of a violent online trailer that could have been viewed by children ( even though it was clearly marked as " red band " , denoting adult content ) .
In the UK , Kick - Ass will be released with a 15 - certificate but there is an argument that because the film 's protagonists are youngsters , it will prove more appealing to those in the same age group .
" You could say the same of Fish Tank , which has swearing and extreme emotional portrayals of violence , " counters Goldman .
" Kick - Ass is a film for adults .
It was never , ever aimed at children . "
Will Goldman be allowing her own children – Betty Kitten , 18 , Harvey Kirby , 16 , or Honey Kinny , 13 – to see it ?
" The two oldest will see it .
My youngest daughter … I have to think about it .
I think it 's a different deal if you 've been on set and known the people involved and you know it 's not real .
Yeah , maybe .
" You very much see the consequences of violence in the film .
I think that films that could be said to glamorise violence are ones where there is n't a physical or emotional consequence , where you have people fire off rounds and everyone is dying off cleanly and it does n't matter , whereas here , people are bereaved , people are hospitalised , it 's kind of unpleasant .
" I really do n't think anyone having seen this film would come out of it feeling bloodthirsty …
I do n't think there 's any reliable data proving any correlation between violence and films . "
But was Goldman worried about the effects on Moretz , who , despite starring in the film , is too young to go and see it in the cinema ?
She thinks about this for a moment , hesitating as if to get her thoughts in order .
" The fact that she 's actually enacting the violence is in many ways probably less traumatic for a child actor than a lot of films where the children are victims of violence – serious films where they 're the victims of violence at the hands of family members .
I think actually , emotionally , that 's a lot more disturbing for a child actor whereas this is comic book ; it 's light .
I do n't think it raises any difficult emotional issues for a child to process . "
Still , the Daily Mail is in a predictable tizz about it all .
A few days before we meet , the newspaper runs an article headlined " Jonathan Ross 's wife causes outrage " , as though she had been caught mugging Andrew Sachs on the street for his bus pass .
Does she care about this kind of press coverage ?
" People 's intolerance , I find puzzling , " she says , a vertical crinkle appearing between her eyes .
" The fact that I was singled out , I found bizarre but it did n't upset me , I just thought it was peculiar .
It 's funny – it's very rare that a movie is described as a writer 's movie .
It was kind of ironic that it was only when people had decided there was something negative about it that it was the writer 's movie …
Maybe it's that it makes a good tag on to this ongoing narrative in the press involving other people in my family – it makes it part of that saga . "
That is as close as Goldman gets to mentioning the Jonathan Ross - shaped elephant in the room , and it must be frustrating to be constantly pigeonholed as someone 's wife when she has been quietly pursuing a successful career as a writer for the last 20 years .
Goldman grew up in north London , the only child of liberal , wealthy parents .
Like Hit - Girl , she was terrifyingly precocious – leaving school at 16 with eight O - Levels before being hired as a showbusiness reporter on a casual basis by the Daily Star .
A year later she met Ross at a nightclub while working for the paper , and the couple got married when she was 18 .
Goldman spent most of her 20s having babies but also found the time to write several books ( including a novel , Dreamworld ) , front a television series investigating the paranormal , and cultivate a growing reputation as a screenwriter .
As well as her work with Matthew Vaughn , she has just completed the script for a forthcoming film adaptation of Susan Hill 's ghost story The Woman in Black .
She seems to be intrigued by the supernatural and fantastical and admits to a " geeky " enthusiasm for comic books and computer games .
" I play World of Warcraft , which means I end up hanging out with teenage boys a lot , " she says .
" I really enjoy the company of my kids …
I 'm not one of those people who goes ' Yeah , my kids are my mates ' , that 's a dreadful kind of mother , but I 'm fortunate that there are times that they do want me around , and I feel lucky that they let me into their world . "
There is a part of Goldman that seems to connect easily with childhood , perhaps because she missed out on so much of it herself .
" Yeah , I never hung out in parks and got drunk …
I never did the proper teenage stuff and maybe that 's why it still holds a fascination for me but I like to think it 's because I really like that unbiased outlook on life .
Teenagers come to things fresh and can really teach us an awful lot .
" I 've yet to meet a bitter teenager .
Bitterness , jealousy and jadedness , I think , are the most unattractive qualities in a person , and unfortunately they do seem to come with age . "
In person , Goldman seems to embody both this freshness and a sort of gentleness that is strangely at odds with her love of violent video games and her striking physical appearance .
She has a beautiful face , fire - red engine hair ( re- coloured every three to four weeks ) and a figure that looks as though it has been drawn by a lascivious comic book artist .
Is it a coincidence that she looks like the superheroes she has written about ?
" That 's a huge compliment , thank you , " she says .
" I 've always loved science fiction , fantasy , manga , comic books , so I guess to some degree those things influence my personal idea of what looks nice , which definitely is n't everyone else 's . "
She laughs , but it must take a certain degree of chutzpah to look so flagrantly individual .
" In some way it 's less courageous because it 's essentially saying , ' I 've opted out ' ; it 's saying ' Please do n't judge me against society 's standards !
I know I do n't measure up , I 've opted out , I 'm playing a different game . ' "
It is a game that she plays extremely well – but then , all that time practising on World of Warcraft must surely help .
Kick Ass opens on Friday

The Book of Kells and similarly illustrated manuscripts of seventh - and eighth - century England and Ireland are known for their entrancingly intricate artwork -- geometric designs so precise that in some places they contain lines less than half a millimeter apart and nearly perfectly reproduced in repeating patterns -- leading a later scholar to call them " works not of men , but of angels . "
But behind the artwork 's precision is a mystery :
How did illustrators refine the details , which rival the precision of engravings on a modern dollar bill , centuries before microscope lenses were invented ?
The answer , says Cornell paleontologist John Cisne , may be in the eyes of the creators .
The Celtic monks evidently trained their eyes to cross above the plane of the manuscript so they could visually superimpose side - by - side elements of a replicated pattern , and thereby create 3 - D images that magnified differences between the patterns up to 30 times .
The monks could then refine any disparities by minimizing the apparent vertical depth of the images -- ultimately replicating the design element to submillimeter precision .
Cisne proposed the idea in the July 17 issue of the journal Perception ( Vol. 38 , No. 7 ) .
The paper suggests that the technique , called free - fusion stereocomparison , which takes advantage of the brain 's ability to perceive depth by integrating the slightly different views from each eye , was known nearly a thousand years before it was articulated by stereoscope inventor Sir George Wheatstone in the 19th century .
Cisne analyzed the most detailed illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages , created between 670 and 800 A.D. , including the Book of Kells ( circa 800 A.D. ) .
Some have as many as 30 lines per centimeter .
Provided
The artists stayed mum about their techniques , possibly because their talent gave their Celtic church an edge over the Roman church in the competition for disciples .
" If you 're in the middle of a propaganda war , [ it helps ] if the angels are clearly on your side , " Cisne said .
But they left a few clues , he said , including the high degree of symmetry and repetition among many of the most intricate patterns and the elements ' spacing , which is usually at about the distance between an average person 's pupils .
" It turns out that if you can draw accurately enough , you can easily get a magnification of the lateral [ horizontal ] distance something like 10 , 20 or 30 times -- about the magnification you could get under a dissecting microscope , " Cisne said .
The monks likely created a highly accurate template for the design elements by drawing the same element repeatedly , comparing versions and modifying to create a standardized model .
From there , they could replicate it into complex designs , using free - fusion stereoscopic comparison and minimizing errors along the way .
Many of the design elements contain minute imperfections that are consistent throughout rows or columns , supporting the idea that the monks worked from templates .
And depictions of scribes from the era often show the monks holding pen in one hand and erasing knife in the other -- another clue that they made modifications along the way .
" The idea is that these guys did it just the same way I do when I use a drawing tube and a microscope -- lay down a reference grid , fill in the details , and then compare the details with your template , " Cisne said .
Their knowledge of stereoscopic imagery likely died with the monasteries , which were later decimated by the Vikings , Cisne said .
The original manuscripts are in Dublin and London ; Cisne worked from high - quality reproductions in Cornell 's Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections in Kroch Library .
They 're a reminder , Cisne said , that ingenuity can sometimes trump technology .
" Most people do n't appreciate what a fine instrument they have in their eyes , " he said , " and how their visual system can be used in other than the obvious ways . "
Highlights of Eben Moglen ’s Freedom in the Cloud Talk
Here are some highlights of the talk Eben gave on Freedom in the Cloud at the New York ISOC branch meeting last Friday , February 2 .
A full transcript is available here
The Problem [ 2:55 ] : “ Our calendar is on the web .
Our location is on the web …
The deal that you get with the traditional service called telephony now includes a thing you did n’t know like spying .
It ’s not a service to you .
But it ’s a service .
And you get it for free with your service contract for telephony .
You get for free the service of advertising with your Gmail , which of course means there is another service behind , which is untouched by human hands , semantic analysis of your email …
And you get free email service and some storage which is worth exactly a penny and a half at the current price of storage …
What ’s that got to do with open source ? [ 5:15 ] : “ It does n’t have anything to do with open source but it has a whole lot to do with free software . . ”
From peers to Microsoft [ 5:36 ] : “ So we need to back up a little bit , figure out where we are , how we got here , and whether we can get out and if so how .
It ’s not a pretty story .. We have n’t lost .
We ’ve just really bamboozled ourselves .
And we ’re going to have to unbamboozle ourselves really quickly or we ’re going to bamboozle a bunch of innocent people who did n’t know we were throwing away their privacy for them forever . ”
[ 6:13 ]
“ It begins of course with the Internet .
Designed as a network of peers without any intrinsic need for hierarchical or structural control and assuming that every switch in the net is an independent free standing entity who ’s volition is equivalent to the human beings who control it …
But it never really worked out that way . ”
The Software Problem [ 7:18 ] : “ It was a simple software problem and it has a simple three syllable name .
It ’s name was ‘ Microsoft ’ .
Conceptually there was a network which was designed as a system of peer nodes , but the operating software … that came to occupy the network over the course of a decade - and - a - half was built around a very clear idea that had nothing to do with peers .
It was called ‘ server / client architecture ’ . ”
The Great Idea Behind Windows [ 9:22 ] : “ It was the great idea of Windows , in an odd way , to create a political archetype in the net that reduced the human being to the client , and created a big centralized computer , which we might refer to as the server , that provided things to the human being on ‘ take or it leave it ’ terms .
And unfortunately everyone took it because they did n’t know how to leave once they got in .
Now , the net was made up of servers in the center and clients at the edge .
Clients had quite a little power and servers had quite a lot …
As storage gets cheaper , as processing gets cheaper , as complex services that scale in ways that are hard to use small computers for … the hierarchical nature of net came to seem like it was meant to be there . ”
Logs [ 10:44 ] : “ One more thing happened about that time … Servers began to keep logs .
That ’s good decision …
But if you have a system which centralizes servers , and the servers centralize their logs , then you are creating vast repositories of hierarchically organized data about people at the edges of the network that they do not control , and unless they are experienced in the operation of servers , will not understand the comprehensiveness of , will not understand the meaningfulness of , will not understand the aggregatability of . ”
The Recipe for Disaster [ 12:01 ] : “ So we built a network out of a communications architecture designed for peering , which we defined in client server style , which we then defined to be the dis - empowered client at the edge and the server in the middle .
We aggregated processing and storage increasingly in the middle and we kept the logs – that is information about the flows of information in the net – in centralized places far from the human beings who controlled or at any rate thought they controlled the operation of the computers that increasingly dominated their lives .
This was a recipe for disaster . ”
Welcome to “ The Cloud ” : [ 13:00 ]
The word cloud does n’t really mean anything very much .
The disaster we are having is not the catastrophe of the cloud .
The disaster we are having is the catastrophe of how we misunderstood the net under the assistance of the unfree software that helped us to understand it .
What cloud means is that servers have ceased to be made of iron .
Cloud means virtualization of servers has occurred …
Iron no longer represents a single servers .
Iron is merely a place where servers could be … Cloud means servers have gained freedom .
Freedom to move .
Freedom to dance ; to combine and to separate , re-aggregate , and do all sorts of tricks .
Servers have gained freedom .
Clients have gained nothing .
Welcome to the cloud . "
The Social Consequences of Technology [ 14:54 ] :
“ If you think about it , each step in that architectural evolution away from a network made of peers ; to servers that serve the communication with humans beings to clients which are programs running on heavy iron ; to clients , which are the computers that people actually used in a fairly dis-empowered state and servers are a high concentration of power in the net ; to servers are virtual processes running in clouds of iron at the center of an increasingly hot galaxy and the clients are out there in the dusty spiral arms .
All of these decisions architecturally were made without discussion the social consequences long - term . ”
Disempowering the people who own the clients [ 16:30 ] : “ So we got an architecture that was very subject to misuse , indeed it was begging to be misused .
Now we are getting the misuse we set up …
There are a lot of reasons for making clients dis-empowered …
There are many overlapping rights owners , as they see themselves , each of whom has a stake in dis-empowering a client at the edge of the network .
To prevent particular hardware from being moved from one network to another .
to prevent particular hardware from playing music not bought at the monopoly of music in the sky . ”
What is a Platform ? [ 18:00 ] : “ What we have are things we call platforms ?
The word platform , like cloud , does n’t inherently mean anything .
Thrown around a lot in business talk , but basically what ‘ platform ’ means is places you can’t leave , stuff you ’re stuck to , things that do n’t let you off .
Once the net become a hierarchically organized zone with servers in the center and increasingly dis-empowered clients at the edge , it becomes the zone of ‘ platforms ’ and platform making becomes the order of the day …
Microsoft was never really a software company , Microsoft was a platform management company . ”
Late Google Stage One [ 20:00 ] : “ Search is not a thing that we can easily distribute .
It is a complex service that must be centrally organized and unilaterally delivered …
Search becomes an archetypal complex service and draws a business model for its monetization …
On the underside of the complex service of search is a simple service called advertising .
But that ’s the innocent part of the story .
We do n’t remain in the innocent part of the story .
Where we are , is to the discovery that everything would be better if we have the logs to everything .
The cloud means that we ca n’t even point in the direction of the server anymore .
We do n’t have extra-technical or non-technical means over this disaster .
The stage we ’re in now is late Google Stage One . ”
Enter Mr. Zuckerberg [ 24:00 ] : “ The human race has susceptibility to harm but Mr. Zuckerberg has attained an unenviable record .
He has done more harm to the human race than anybody else his age .
Because he harnessed Friday night , that is , ‘ Everybody needs to to get laid , ’ and turned into a structure for degenerating the integrity of human personality and he has to remarkable extent succeeded with a very poor deal , namely ‘ I will give you free web - hosting and some PHP doodads and you get spying for free all the time ’ .
And it works .
How could that have happened ?
There was no architectural reason .
Facebook is the web with , ‘ I keep all the logs , how do you feel about that . ’
It ’s a terrarium for what it feels like to live in a Panopticon built out of web parts .
And it should n’t be allowed .
That ’s a very poor way to deliver those services .
They are grossly overpriced at ‘ spying all the time ’ , they are not technically innovative .
They depend on an architecture subject to misuse and the business model that supports them is misuse .
There is n’t any other business model for them .
This is bad .
I ’m not suggesting it should be illegal .
It should be obsolete .
We ’re technologists we should fix it . ”
[ 27:30 ]
“ Facebook is a really good example of where we went wrong and what happened to us because .
It ’s trickier with Gmail because of that magical untouched by human handsyness …
Facebook workers know who ’s going to have a love affair before the people do because they can see X obsessively checking the webpage of Y . ”
The Problem is the Cruft and Data Dandruff of Life [ 30:00 ] : “ In fact the degree of potential informational inequality , and disruption and difficulty that arises from a misunderstanding , a heuristic error in the minds of human beings about what is and is not discoverable about them , is now our biggest privacy problem .
My students … show constantly in our dialog they still , think of privacy as the one secret they do n’t want revealed .
But that ’s not their problem .
Their problem is all the stuff that ’s the … data dandruff of life , which they do n’t think of as secret at all but aggregates to stuff they do n’t want to know .
Which aggregates not just to stuff they do n’t want other people to know , but to predictive models about them which they would be very creeped out to know exists at all .
The data that we infer is the data in the holes between the data we already know if we know enough things . ”
Where we Live Now [ 32:58 ] :
“ So where we live has become a place in which it would be very unwise to say about anything that it is n’t known if you are pretty widely known in the net … and all of us are pretty known in the net .
We want to live there .
It is our neighborhood .
We just do n’t want to live with a video camera on every tree and a microphone on every bush and a data miner beneath our feet everywhere we walk , and the net ’s like that now . ”
Freedom Box [ 34:31 ] : “ We have to fess up .
If we ’re the people who care about freedom , its late in the game and we ’re behind .
We did a lot of good stuff and we have a lot of tools lying around that we built over the last 25 years …
I ’m glad the tools are around but we have to admit we have not used them to protect freedom because freedom is decaying … ‘ Open source ’ does n’t matter anymore .
Free software matters a lot because free software is open source software with freedom …
Freedom still matters and what we need to do is to make free software matter to the problem that we have which is unfree services delivered in unfree ways really beginning to deteriorate the structure of human freedom .
Like a lot of unfreedom , the real underlying social process that forces this unfreedom along is nothing more than perceived convenience . ”
Who Could Run a Web Server of Their Own and Keep the Logs ? [ 38:00 ] : “ So what do we need ?
We need a really good web server that you can put in your pocket and plug in any place .
It should n’t be any larger than the charger for your cellphone .
You should be able to plug it into any power jack in the world or sync it up with any wi-fi router that happens to be in this neighborhood …
It should have a couple of USB ports that attach it to things .
It should know how to bring itself up ; how to start its web server ; how to go and collect your stuff from all the social networking places you ’ve got it .
It should know how to send an encrypted backup of everything to your friends ’ servers .
It should know how to micro- blog , It should now how to make some noise that ’s like tweet but does n’t infringe on anyone ’s trademark .
It should know how to … be your avatar in a free net that works for you and keeps the logs .
You can always tell what ’s happening in your server and if anybody else wants to know they can get a search warrant .
“ There ’s a little more we have to do but its all trivial … We need some dynamic DNS .
It ’s all stuff we ’ve already invented .
It ’s all there , nobody needs anything special .
Do we have the server we can put in your pocket ?
Indeed we do .
Off the shelf hardware .
Beautiful wall warts with ARM chips …
How ’s the software stack ?
It ’s any software stack you want to put in there …
You ought to want the Debian , GNU / Linux , social networking stack .
“ This is stuff we ’ve got .
We need to put it together …
I ’m not talking about stuff that ’s hard for us .
We need to make a free software distribution guys .
We need to give a bunch to all of our friends and say , ‘ fool around with this and make it better . ’
We need to do the thing we are already really good at , because all the rest of is done .
In the bag , cheap , ready .
Those wall wart servers are $ 99 now , going to $ 79 .
When there are 5 million of them , they ’ll be $ 29.99 .
Then we go to people and we say , ” $ 29.99 once , for a lifetime .
Great social networking , updates automatically , software so strong you could n’t knock it over if you kicked it , and you know what , you get ‘ no spying ’ for free .
We can do that …
When there is a competitor to ‘ all spying , all the time , whether you like it or not ’ , the competition is going to do really well .
Do n’t expect Google to be the competitor .
That ’s a platform .
What we need is to make a thing so greasy that there will never be another social networking platform again …
It ’s well within our reach .
Are we going to do it before the Facebook IPO or after ? "
“ We do n’t have to live in the Catastrophe [ 4:40 ] : ” It ’s not like we have to live in the catastrophe .
It ’s not like what we have to do to begin to reverse the catastrophe is hard for us .
We need to re-architect services in the net ; we need to redistribute services back towards the edge ; we need to de-virtualize the servers where your life is stored and restore some autonomy to you as the owner of the server .
The measures for taking those steps are technical … as usual the box builders are ahead of us .
The hardware is n’t the constraint .
As usual , nowadays the software is n’t a constraint either because we ’ve made so much good stuff … the bad architecture is enabled , powered , by us the re-architecture is too .
And we have our usual magic benefit .
If we had one copy of what I ’m talking about , we have all the copies we need .
A technical challenge for a social reason [ 46:00 ] : “ There is a technical challenge for a social reason …
It ’s a frontier for technical people to explore .
There is enormous social payoff for exploring it .
The payoff is plain because the harm being ameliorated is current and people you know are suffering from it .
Everything we know about why we make free software says that ’s when we come into our own .
It ’s a technical challenge incrementally attainable by extension from where we already are that makes the lives of the people around us and whom we care about immediately better .
In 25 years of doing this work , I have never seen us fail to rise to a challenge that can be defined in those terms .
So I do n’t think we are going to fail this one either .
Mr. Zuckerberg richly deserves bankruptcy .
Let ’s give it to him , for free . ”
This is actually a story potentially happy [ 48:00 ] : “ If we do it we will have quelled one more rumor about the irrelevancy of us …
We will not be rid of our problems by any means , but just moving the logs from them to you is the single biggest step that we can take in resolving a whole range of social problems .
That I feel badly in what remains of my American constitution ; and that I would feel badly about if I were watching the failure of European data protection law from inside instead of outside ; and that I would feel kind of hopeful about if I were , oh say , a friend of mine in China .
Because , you know , of course we really ought to put a VPN in that wall wart , and we probably ought to put a TOR router .
And of course we got bittorrent and by the time we ’re done with all of that we got a freedom box …
We have a box that not only climbs us out of the hole we ’re in , but we have a box that actually puts a ladder up for people who are deeper in the hole than we are …
We ’re not going to win the war on Internet freedom with Facebook on our backs . ”
The Solution is Made of our Parts [ 55:00 ] : “ It is n’t that this gets all the problems solved .
But the easy work is very rich and rewarding now .
The problems are really bad and getting the easy ones out of the way will improve the politics for solving the hard ones and it ’s right up our alley .
The solution is made of our parts .
We got to do it …
We could put it off until Tuesday but how long do you really want to wait ?
Every day that goes buy there is more data we ’ll never get back ; more inferences we ca n’t undo …
It ’s not like we should say , ‘ one of these days I ’ll get around to it . ’
It ’s way more urgent than that . ”

UNITED NATIONS 
At least 71 journalists were killed across the globe in 2009 , the Committee to Protect Journalists announced Tuesday , the largest annual toll in the 30 years the group has been keeping track .
Twenty - nine of those deaths came in a single , politically motivated massacre of reporters and others in the Philippines last November , the worst known episode for journalists , the committee said .
But there were other worrisome trends .
The two nations with the highest number of journalists incarcerated 
China had 24 journalists imprisoned at the end of 2009 and Iran had 23  were particularly harsh in taking aim at bloggers and others using the Internet .
The number jailed in Iran has since jumped to 47 , the committee said .
“ It is a pretty grim picture , ” Robert Mahoney , the deputy director of the committee , told a news conference , saying that governments had 136 reporters in jail at the close of last year .

MOSCOW — Russia disclosed on Wednesday that Russian and Chinese envoys had pressed Iran ’s government to accept a United Nations plan on uranium enrichment during meetings in Tehran early this month but that Iran had refused , leaving “ less and less room for diplomatic maneuvering . ”
“ The clouds are piling up , ” said a top Russian Foreign Ministry official , briefing reporters on condition of anonymity , following diplomatic protocol .
He said Russia would consider supporting sanctions tailored to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons , though it “ is certainly against any paralyzing sanctions that are aimed not at nonproliferation but at punishing Iran or , God forbid , regime change . ”
At the United Nations , Mark Lyall Grant , the British ambassador , confirmed that political directors from the six countries that could approve sanctions against Tehran had consulted by telephone on Wednesday and that China had finally “ agreed to engage substantively on the issue . ”
Li Baodong , the new Chinese ambassador , emphasized that China is committed to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty .
“ We think it ’s very important to maintain stability and peace in the Middle East , ” he told reporters , but he left ambiguous exactly what China is committing to .

On his radio show today Rush Limbaugh backed out of his promise to leave the country and move to Costa Rica if health care reform passed .
Limbaugh said that he never said that he was going to move there but that , “ Once all this gets implemented , I am going there for my health care . ”
Apparently , Limbaugh ’s trip to Costa Rica will happen at the same time Sean Hannity gets waterboarded .
Here is the original audio from March 8 :
“ I ’ll just tell you this .
If this passes and its five years from now , and all that stuff gets implemented , I am leaving the country .
I ’ll go to Costa Rica . ”

Here is today ’s audio from Media Matters :
Limbaugh said , “ It ’s funny .
I ca n’t tell you how many invitations I am getting to go to Costa Rica today who thought that I said I would move to Costa Rica if we got health care passed .
No , no , no once all this implemented I am going there for my health care .
They ’re asking me to go ahead and move . ”
You know when Rush ’s own listeners are asking him to move to Costa Rica , maybe they are n’t kidding ?
It might not be a joke , Rush .
Your drug fueled delusions and rants might have even started to frighten the blue hairs at home who are tuning in .
In all fairness , Limbaugh was originally asked where he was going to go to get his health care , and that is how the whole Costa Rica thing started , but he did manage to bask in the publicity generated by his statement .
He never bothered to correct it until today .
The moral of this story is that conservative talkers ca n’t be trusted to keep their word on anything .
Remember Sean Hannity ’s offer to be waterboarded for charity ?
Well in light of recent events , maybe bringing up Hannity and charity is n’t such a great example , but these guys never keep their word on anything , so one should not be surprised that Limbaugh backed out of Costa Rica .
If Rush really loved America , then there could be no greater demonstration of his patriotism than leaving it .
Be a patriot Rush , move to Costa Rica !!!
A British court has decided that paying mostly female caregivers less than mostly male gardeners and garbage collectors constitutes gender discrimination .
The decision raises the question : what does income equality really mean ?
Advertisement
When we talk about a gender wage gap in this country , we often mean women getting paid less than men for the same jobs .
And while this has long been an issue , the pay gap between industries dominated by men and those dominated by women is important too .
Doubters like to chalk this up to women naturally choosing less " demanding " professions , but I 'd be far from the first to note the possibility that jobs considered traditionally male are valued more highly than those seen as " women 's work . "
According to Christopher Hall of the Telegraph , the specific case at hand concerned a pay scale introduced in the sixties by the Sheffield City Council , which offered its manual laborers productivity bonuses .
The Council set aside no such bonuses for its predominantly female caregivers and housecleaners ( a mismatch between the Telegraph headline and text makes the women's job category a little hard to figure out , but it seems that , as in the US , caregiving and housecleaning are often linked ) .
When the caregivers argued last year that the arrangement was discriminatory , a court decided that it was fair to deny them bonuses because their productivity was " not measurable . "
But now , one Lord Justice Pill has ruled that , " The effect of the productivity bonus ... is discriminatory .
A sexual taint is present . "

Had such a decision been handed down in the US , critics would certainly begin complaining that employers would be forced to pay women wages they did n't deserve , or to pay the same wage for every job , regardless of qualifications .
I 'd wager this backlash will happen in England too .
It 's certainly true that in a capitalist economy , paying different salaries for different jobs is unavoidable — but what 's is avoidable is automatically valuing " men 's work " higher than women's .
The tribunal that initially dismissed the carers ' case perhaps unintentionally spelled out what may be the bias of many employers : " men 's work can be measured to provide a benchmark for productivity and the women 's work cannot . "
While it 's true that faster caregiving is n't necessarily better , and faster garbage collection probably is , that does n't mean that caring for someone — or cleaning , for that matter — can't be evaluated .
In fact , the idea that one can't put a monetary value on women 's work — sometimes used in disingenuous praise of mothers — may simply be an excuse for not remunerating it .
By calling women 's contributions immeasurable — and the Sheffield City Council is far from the only culprit here — employers and society cunningly exempt themselves from having to measure them .
This may not be the only prejudice at work — men were traditionally paid more because of the assumption that they had to provide for families , and this assumption may have stuck around in the form of higher wages for male - dominated jobs .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Of course , at least in the US , such jobs are disappearing at a faster rate than traditionally female - dominated ones .
The solution to this may not be to bemoan a " man-cession , " but to stop thinking of jobs in such rigidly defined gender categories .
The number of jobs that require large amounts of upper - body strength is declining ( not to mention the fact that plenty of women have such strength in spades ) , and there 's absolutely no reason why men could n't excel at caregiving or any other traditionally female field .
I do n't mean to trivialize the real losses of men whose livelihoods have been casualties of the recession , nor do I think retraining — especially in midlife — is easy .
It 's also true that men simply moving into existing stereotypically female jobs wo n't solve the simple problem that there are n't enough jobs to go around .
But a society where work was not divided by gender would be a more just society — and it might even be a more productive one .

The speed and certainty with which the conventional wisdom in Washington flips can be a comical thing to watch .
A mere forty - eight hours ago , Barack Obama was a struggling president , even a likely one - termer .
Today , in the wake of the House ’s narrow passage of the health - reform bill — which is to say , on the strength of a grand total of four votes , which if cast the other way would have ensured reform ’s defeat — he ’s suddenly once again a political mastermind and one of the most consequential presidents of the last half - century !
I do n’t mean to minimize the importance of the passage of health reform .
It is certainly historic — the largest piece of progressive domestic legislation to become law in an astounding 45 years ( since Medicare ) .
Obama did place an immense amount of political capital at risk in recent days , speaking personally with more than 90 Democratic House members and rallying them Saturday with a fine and even brave speech in which he called on them to set electoral calculations to the side and do the right thing .
Nancy Pelosi , a target of Republican jibes for so many years chiefly because she happens to be from San Francisco , proved herself a skillful leader who is clearly respected across the breadth of her caucus .
Against the combined forces of Tea Party rage and hundreds of corporate millions invested in killing the bill , securing its passage was a formidable accomplishment .
But just as liberal despair in recent months was short - sighted and overwrought , the liberal euphoria of today is similarly worth examining , for three reasons .
First , the passage of the bill into law marks a beginning rather than an end .
The law ’s most conspicuous elements — the creation of the exchanges , the subsidies for coverage , the full range of new regulations governing insurance companies — wo n’t take effect until 2014 .
Even when they take effect , myriad complex questions of implementation will need sorting out .
Whether the exchanges really work will depend , for example , on the success of “ risk adjustment ” policies , so that the plans offered in the exchanges wo n’t vary too greatly in terms of what they charge and offer consumers .
There will be dozens of such questions to be answered by future bureaucrats , and inevitably , there will be misjudgments and unforeseen difficulties .
The passage of this bill merely starts a health - care debate that will continue , at varying levels of ferocity , for years .
Second , there is the matter of the political consequences of this bill — and the way it was passed — for other Democratic initiatives .
It is natural to think that a crucial legislative victory will embolden the winners to push ever onward , aiming their mighty sword at fresh targets .
Progressives will certainly hope that this will be the case — with regard to , say , financial reform , or climate change legislation , or immigration reform .
It seems to me that there are more reasons to think the opposite will be the case .
This battle was so epic that legislators , an extremely cautious class by nature , will be loath to step into another fight like it .
Congress may tackle financial reform this year , since the bill has already progressed fairly far through the Senate ( the House passed its version last December ) .
But it seems likely that senators will try to avoid any health - care - style donnybrook .
Other legislation of consequence will be put on hold until after the mid-term elections , and depending on how they go , the Democrats may not have the numbers necessary to do anything else of importance .
Which leads into my third reason for caution , the Republican Party .
The GOP was determined to make health care Obama ’s “ Waterloo , ” as Republican Senator Jim DeMint put it last year .
That failed .
But the party shows no signs yet of changing its approach .
Here is what Mitt Romney — who as governor of Massachusetts signed into a law a health - care bill that is quite similar in spirit and letter to the one Obama is about to sign , and that , despite budget problems , is working out rather well so far — had to say about Sunday night ’s vote :
America has just witnessed an unconscionable abuse of power .
President Obama has betrayed his oath to the nation — rather than bringing us together , ushering in a new kind of politics , and rising above raw partisanship , he has succumbed to the lowest denominator of incumbent power : justifying the means by extolling the ends .
He promised better ; we deserved better .
He calls his accomplishment “ historic ” — in this he is correct , although not for the reason he intends .
Rather , it is an historic usurpation of the legislative process — he unleashed the nuclear option , enlisted not a single Republican vote in either chamber , bribed reluctant members of his own party , paid - off his union backers , scapegoated insurers , and justified his act with patently fraudulent accounting .
What Barack Obama has ushered into the American political landscape is not good for our country ; in the words of an ancient maxim , “ what starts twisted , ends twisted . ”
His health - care bill is unhealthy for America .
It raises taxes , slashes the more private side of Medicare , installs price controls , and puts a new federal bureaucracy in charge of health care .
It will create a new entitlement even as the ones we already have are bankrupt .
For these reasons and more , the act should be repealed .
That campaign begins today .
The Republicans failed to block health care simply because the Democrats managed to get it through the Senate while they still had their super - majority of 60 votes .
They no longer have that majority , and the near - term prospects of getting any Republicans to agree to work toward good - faith negotiation on anything seem remote ( with the possible exception of climate change , on which South Carolina ’s Lindsey Graham is supposedly committed to a solution ; but on that issue , several Democrats , moderates and others from industrial states , are balking ) .
The broader partisan logjam will continue .
This moment is very much worth savoring , but Obama was not the failure of last week ’s conventional wisdom , and he is not the invincible conqueror of this week’s .
The march remains a long one .

Studies conducted by a group of Italian researchers have revealed the presence of dangerous levels of toxins in the bodies of Palestinian victims of Israeli bombings during operation Cast Lead in 2008 - 2009 .
The results of tests conducted on a sample of 15 dead and wounded victims of the war on Gaza , in addition to another sample of 95 citizens , showed the presence of 30 toxic components , notably high levels of uranium .
A senior Ministry of Health official in Gaza , Medhat Abbas , confirmed the findings during a press conference last Thursday .
According to Mr. Abbas , the study showed the presence of dangerous substances toxic to human embryos which distort and threaten infertility in men and women and affect genes .
It was absorbed through the skin or the mouth during eating .
In a previous study , the same researchers emphasized that the soil of the Gaza Strip now contains toxic metals and carcinogens harmful to embryos .
This was due , they claimed , to the absorption of materials used in the recent Israeli war on the Gaza Strip .
Gaza�s Health Minister , Dr Bassem Naim , said the study of the biological samples proved that the Israelis used internationally proscribed weapons against the Palestinians .
He warned that the large percentage of toxic uranium in the territory would pose a real threat to future generations .
Dr Naim added that his department will send the research findings to the relevant human rights authorities which are documenting Israeli war crimes in the territory .

What better way to get your voice heard than to face a room full of strangers and expose your deepest , darkest secrets for all to hear ?
That opportunity comes to life at the Calgary Story Slam .
The Calgary Story Slam is a storytelling competition held between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. on the third Thursday of every second month at Craft Beer Market .
The event features local storytellers with all levels of experience who tell real and intimate stories of their lives that surround a theme of the evening in a five - minute period .
“ Storytellers are given five minutes to tell the audience a story about themselves .
There are three rules : the story must be true , the story must be about the speaker and no notes are allowed on stage .
It ’s not a creative writing competition , ” says event organizer Jillian Yawney .
The next Story Slam — taking place on Sept. 29 — features the theme “ Busted ! ” Storytellers are asked to tell a tale of a time that they were caught doing something they probably should n’t have been doing .
“ The theme is left deliberately vague so people will bring their own creativity , It ’s interesting to see how each person develops the theme , ” Yawney says .
“ Each night , three random people are picked out of the audience to judge each storyteller on three things : was the story on topic , its awesomeness and audience reaction .
There is a fourth judge not selected from the audience , to make sure the stories stay within the five - minute time limit . ”
In addition to the pride of knowing you ’re a great storyteller , winners of each bi-monthly event eventually come together in a final Story Slam - Off .
The most recent Slam - Off took place on June 5 .
Past Story Slam winner and University of Calgary law student Jeff Reimer says that anybody could tell stories at the event and have a good time .
“ Your story does n’t have to be funny .
Many serious or sad stories are successful .
The most important thing is to be compelling , real , and make it true , ” he says .
“ Truth contributes to the realness .
It just has to be real . ”
Reimer says that one of the best things about the Story Slam is the welcoming environment provided by the audience of open - minded individuals .
“ Story Slam audiences are much more forgiving than comedy audiences .
You ’re definitely not going to get heckled because the expectations [ at the Story Slam ] are different than a comedy club , ” he says .
“ If you want to work on your public speaking , or being a compelling orator , Story Slam is a welcoming audience for you to practice . ”
The next Story Slam will take place Sept. 29 at Craft Beer Market from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m .
The event is open to the public .

On April 1 , bus riders in Vancouver face a 10 - percent rise in the price of monthly bus passes and FareSaver tickets .
The fare increase is one important aspect of the broader process of the privatization of our public transit system .
This process is stripping transit - dependent bus riders of our right to mobility .
It is also robbing the public broadly of an important tool for promoting social justice , public health , and environmental sustainability in our region .
Rapidly rising fares are in themselves a form of privatization .
As the fares increase , the burden of paying for transit shifts from governments — using tax revenues — onto individual riders .
This “ user pay ” model undermines the very essence of a public service — that a necessary public good is paid for by the public and user fees ( if any ) are set at a nominal rate that ensures broad public access .
The redistributive function of public services like transit was one of the things that made it possible for low - wage workers , the unemployed , and low - income seniors and students to survive economically in a context of stagnant incomes .
As we constantly hear from bus riders when we are organizing on the bus and in the community , “ everything is going up except our wages ” .
The second aspect of privatization is private - public - partnerships — the specific mechanism for redistributing the economic benefits of the public transit system to corporations and their shareholders .
The Canada Line , built on the Olympics ’ timeline and on the backs of exploited migrant workers , transferred millions of dollars into the coffers of SNC - Lavalin and includes an “ operating ” contract guaranteeing a profit to the private operator for 30 years , regardless of ridership .
The battle over the Canada Line exposed the lack of meaningful democratic input and accountability in the operation of our transit system .
The B.C. Liberals , in conjunction with right - wing regional politicians , including Vision Vancouver councillor Raymond Louie , forced three separate votes to push through the line despite broad public opposition .
In the wake of the Canada Line struggle , Kevin Falcon , then the transportation minister , decided that something had to be done about this excess of democracy .
Falcon created a new governance structure for TransLink consisting of a board appointed by the province and comprised of “ private individuals ” with extensive ties to big business , the Vancouver Board of Trade , and regional developers .
The new board meets in private and has strict limitations on public input and participation .
This elimination of even the inadequate participation and accountability that existed in the previous board structure constitutes a third aspect of the privatization of public transit in Metro Vancouver .
The fourth and final aspect of this process of privatization is the regime of surveillance , harassment , and criminalization of bus riders .
The South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service , created in 2005 , enforce fares armed with guns and tasers .
Bus riders unfortunate enough to not be able to afford a $ 2.50 fare are faced not only with the humiliation of being singled out and berated , but real or threatened violence , and a $ 173 ticket to add insult to injury .
Moreover , youth of colour , aboriginal people , and people who look poor face the inevitable racial and class profiling endemic in this kind of “ policing ” .
In this aspect of transit privatization , our public transit system , particularly the buses , has been transformed from spaces of public interaction , exchange , and dialogue into “ fare paid zones ” where people who are already oppressed experience additional stress , anxiety , and violence .
Taking a hard look at the process of privatization of public transit gives us insights into the broader processes of privatization happening in our society , a process that shifts the economic benefits and political control over formerly public institutions to corporations and the rich .
Working - class communities are stripped of the limited ( and inadequate ) economic redistribution embodied in public services , and of our sense of entitlement to a public service built by working people , with taxes from working - class communities .
As organizers on the bus and in the community , we constantly hear from bus riders that “ the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer ” .
If we are to reverse this trend toward greater inequality , we need to demand expansion of public services and greater democratic control .
We need to organize for public transit , accessible education , affordable housing , people - centred healthcare , universal daycare , and liveable welfare as fundamental economic human rights .

With so many concept Android tablets floating around lately we were inclined to just ignore this one -- until we learned two particularly interesting aspects : it starts at $ 155 , and it 's actually shipping now .
It 's the zenPad from Enso , a five - inch , 800 x 480 Android 1.6 tablet with 8GB of storage ( on a replaceable microSD ) that , for an additional $ 25 , comes with GPS .
It 's powered by a 667MHz Samsung 6410 processor , pledges six hours of battery life , and has WiFi built - in while an external 3G adapter is just another $ 35 .
That means a fully max'd out unit with GPS and 3G would set you back $ 210 -- plus $ 25 for shipping .
And yes , they are shipping now , as evidenced by a number of the things popping up on eBay .
Sure , it does n't look as fancy as the Dell Mini 5 , but you wo n't have to fly to Shenzhen to get one .

' Do n't forget to bring your own music from home ! ' says Fedcat 's poster
Hairdressers in Spain 's north - eastern region of Catalonia have launched a campaign to avoid paying tax for playing the radio in their salons .
Hundreds of salons in Barcelona have put up posters asking customers to bring their own iPods and MP3 players .
The campaign is being led by Fedcat , the Catalan hairdressers ' association .
It opposes the monthly fee of up to 12 euros ( £ 10 , $ 16 ) imposed by Spain 's General Society of Authors and Editors ( SGAE ) for the music rights .
A spokesman for Fedcat says the situation is " incredible " , as hairdressers do not make money from the music .
Jose Maria Figueres told the Barcelona Reporter that salon owners were simply trying to provide a welcoming atmosphere for clients , " as if our customers were guests in our own homes " .
On the other hand , the SGAE says it is simply protecting the intellectual rights of musicians , and that all shops had to pay the fee .
The rebellion began when the SGAE decided to take legal action against a hairdresser in Barcelona who refused to sign a contract .
Tuesday will be a big day at the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , far and away the most powerful particle - punisher ever assembled by the human race .
For the first time ever , boffins operating the colossal machine will cross the streams produced in its twin mighty hadron cannons , colliding particles at never - before - seen 7 Tera -electron - Volts ( TeV ) energies .
Among scientists this is expected to produce nothing more than interesting showers of sub-subatomic particle frag , which will be scanned by the LHC 's titanic subterranean detector arrays and the ensuing data crunched by CERN 's huge international supercomputing grids .
In time , perhaps , the elusive Higgs boson might be found or not found , so conclusively settling the long - running grudge match between boffinry heavyweight Professor Higgs and his nemesis , famed wheelchair robovoice savant Stephen Hawking .
Alternatively , reputable scientists have assured us here on the Reg boffinry desk that interdimensional portal invasion of some sort might well be on the cards , though most likely of a type so very minuscule and brief as to be rather disappointing .
But there are others who foresee more serious problems .
These days the Tinfoil Torch seems to have passed from the hand of eccentric Hawaii - based botanist , lawyer and soi-disant physicist Walter L Wagner to that of the man known simply as " Doctor Dark Energy " * .
The Doctor contends that the LHC may trigger a " magnetic trap of devil " event , destroying the Earth or anyway some part of it in a " collaptic explosion " .
Evidently his previously announced plans to extirpate CERN head Rolf Heuer " and all his bigbangers " using a nuclear weapon borrowed from Osama bin Laden have run into trouble , because he has now issued a final doomsday prophecy before the Big Collision tomorrow , at the LHC Portal forum .
According to Dr Energy :
I give about 50 % that the dangerous microscopic object will be created .
It will grow , ruining the ordinary matter , and can ruin our planet or a part of it .
Here is my crude estimation of probable outcomes : 1 . Explosion of the whole Earth – 49 % .
2 . Extermination of Geneva – 1 % . 3 . Extermination of Europe – 1 % .
4 . Other harmful unpredictable consequences – 5 % .
5 . Discovery of new subnuclear energy sources – 5 % .
6 . Outcomes with no harm and no use – the rest .
At the point 1 we all will die .
At the points 2 , 3 , 4 a part of humanity will be killed .
Destruction of a part of the Earth will be followed by huge Earthquake all over the Earth .
To raise the probability of survival it is necessary to be at the free air with the stalk of water , food and warm clothes .
The doc seems to have adopted a fatalistic attitude himself , saying that his " health is already ruined by depression ... I can not save myself " .
Given the rather rosier view of the LHC 's consequences painted by more or less every serious physicist who has considered the matter , however , we 'd suggest that there 'll be no need to .
Of course , there have been many cliffhangers and last - minute mishaps at the LHC in the past .
It 's entirely possible that agents of the possible interdimensional police , seeking to prevent humanity acquiring dimension portal capabilities before we 're ready for it , will step in again : either once again deploying feathered baguette - packing saboteurs , or perhaps varying their methods this time .
Even if the 7 TeV collisions go off without a hitch , we can expect plenty more tinfoil frolics over the next couple of years as the day of the even more powerful 14 TeV particle - punching - which the LHC was designed for but can't yet carry out safely - gradually draws near . ®
Bootnote
* Though of course he faces stiff opposition in the fruitcake rankings from retired chemistry prof Otto Rössler , who feels that LHC boffins might avoid imploding the Earth only to carelessly compact the Moon down to the size of a pea , or perhaps put out the Sun .
All of us have heard about the various species under threat of extinction and loads of efforts are being made to help them survive .
But many such species have already disappeared off the face of Earth ... they are extinct .
Here are some of those amazing creatures that wo n't be seen again :
Tyrannosaurus Rex ( Extinct about 65 million years ago )
T. Rex is surely the first that comes to mind when you think of ' extinct animals ' .
Tyrannosaurus rex was one of the largest land carnivores of all time ; the largest complete specimen , measured 12.8 metres ( 42 ft ) long , and was 4.0 metres ( 13 ft ) tall at the hips .
Mass estimates have varied widely over the years , from more than 7.2 metric tons ( 7.9 short tons ) , to less than 4.5 metric tons ( 5.0 short tons ) , with most modern estimates ranging between 5.4 and 6.8 metric tons ( 6.0 and 7.5 short tons ) .

RED KIDNEY BEANS POISONING
See also : Kidney Beans Trivia ; Article on Beans
Red Kidney Bean Poisoning is an illness caused by a toxic agent , Phytohaemagglutnin ( Kidney Bean Lectin )
This toxic agent is found in many species of beans , but it is in highest concentration in red kidney beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris ) .
The unit of toxin measure is the hemagglutinating unit ( hau ) .
Raw kidney beans contain from 20,000 to 70,000 hau , while fully cooked beans contain from 200 to 400 hau .
White kidney beans , another variety of Phaseolus vulgaris , contain about one - third the amount of toxin as the red variety ; broad beans ( Vicia faba ) contain 5 to 10 % the amount that red kidney beans contain .
As few as 4 or 5 beans can bring on symptoms .
Onset of symptoms varies from between 1 to 3 hours .
Onset is usually marked by extreme nausea , followed by vomiting , which may be very severe .
Diarrhea develops somewhat later ( from one to a few hours ) , and some persons report abdominal pain .
Some persons have been hospitalized , but recovery is usually rapid ( 3 - 4 h after onset of symptoms ) and spontaneous .
The syndrome is usually caused by the ingestion of raw , soaked kidney beans , either alone or in salads or casseroles .
As few as four or five raw beans can trigger symptoms .
Several outbreaks have been associated with " slow cookers " or crock pots , or in casseroles which had not reached a high enough internal temperature to destroy the glycoprotein lectin .
It has been shown that heating to 80 degrees C. may potentiate the toxicity five - fold , so that these beans are more toxic than if eaten raw .
In studies of casseroles cooked in slow cookers , internal temperatures often did not exceed 75 degrees C . All persons , regardless of age or gender , appear to be equally susceptible ; the severity is related only to the dose ingested .
No major outbreaks have occurred in the U.S. Outbreaks in the U.K. are far more common , and may be attributed to greater use of dried kidney beans in the U.K. , or better physician awareness and reporting .
NOTE :
The following procedure has been recommended by the PHLS ( Public Health Laboratory Services , Colindale , U.K. ) to render kidney , and other , beans safe for consumption : * Soak in water for at least 5 hours .
* Pour away the water .
* Boil briskly in fresh water for at least 10 minutes .
* Undercooked beans may be more toxic than raw beans .

Not even Bono can pull off wearing huge glasses to use a HUD through life .
But ski goggles ?
They 're practically designed to look ludicrous .
These Zeal Recon Transcend Ski Goggles display GPS , speed , altitude and more in real time .
Advertisement
Available this fall for between $ 350 and $ 450 , Transcend goggles are a partnership between two companies : Zeal Optics and Recon Instruments .
The result is a pair of goggles that contain hardware to measure speed , altitude , time , temperature and GPS coordinates — a slew of information that 's displayed through a HUD .
Charging and data transfer occurs over USB .
Buttons on the side of the goggles will allow you to scan through information on the ski lift , which will be especially useful as Transcend gains additional promised functions , including trail maps , cellphone display integration and video recording .
There 's no doubt about it — the Transcend goggles sound a bit too good to be true .
But we 're childishly refusing to temper expectations while waiting impatiently for fall .
If these things actually worked , I 'd wear them just , like , on the street .
No snowboard required .

For some , this fixture will bring back memories of April ' 07 , when United were two down , won 4 - 2 , and effectively won the league .
For others , Februrary ' 95 , when Duncan Ferguson 's second - half winner derailed United 's title challenge and later gave Everton confidence to win that season 's FA Cup final .
Seeing you ask , I always think of Robbie Wackenshaw , rattling one in as the teams drew 1 - 1 in May 1984 .
Robbie Wackenshaw .
The reason for this : Video Collection and Thames Video's excellent VHS fitba extravaganza : Race for the Championship 83/84 .
Race for the Championship :
It was a great video , produced back in the days when the media did n't treat football fans as mypoic tribalistic morons .
Liverpool won the title that year , but did n't feature too much - Ian Rush 's hat - trick at Aston Villa was the highlight .
Instead , the action was spread around the division - with about 30 minutes of the 90 - minute show set aside for the promotion chase in the Second Division , featuring Howard Wilkinson 's Sheffield Wednesday , the Chelsea of Dixon and Speedie , and a Newcastle team starring Waddle , Keegan and Beardsley , the latter scoring the greatest goal of all time against Brighton .
Brian Moore presented .
God I miss him .
Anyway , today 's game : Gary Neville 's playing , pop kids .
Gary Neville .
Kick off is at 12.45 pm .
Everton : Howard , Neville , Heitinga , Distin , Baines , Donovan , Osman , Arteta , Bilyaletdinov , Pienaar , Saha .
Subs : Nash , Yobo , Vaughan , Gosling , Yakubu , Rodwell , Coleman .
Manchester United : Van der Sar , Neville , Brown , Jonathan Evans , Evra , Valencia , Fletcher , Carrick , Park , Rooney , Berbatov .
Subs : Foster , Owen , Vidic , Scholes , Rafael Da Silva , Obertan , Gibson .
Preening , self - regarding , risible referee , just be thankful this pompous clown can't spoil any of England 's matches at the World Cup : Howard Webb ( S Yorkshire )
The teams line up in the tunnel .
" Neville vs Neville .
I could n't BE more excited , " writes Damian Wims , who should probably take the couple of minutes before kick - off to have a wee think about the direction his life is heading .
The two captains signally fail to exchange glances as they wait to lead their teams onto the pitch , dismally pretending they 're unaware of each other 's existence .
But just as the theme to Z Cars begins to chime over the PA , Gary can't help but steal a quick brotherly glance in Phil 's direction , and allow a proud smile to play across his face .
Aw !
And we 're off !
United set the ball rolling , kicking towards the Gwladys Street end in the first half .
Everton will be happy enough with that .
2 min : It 's a harum - scarum start .
Trap it , someone !
4 min : A wonderful run down the right by Osman , who cuts inside , swans past Evans as though he was n't there , then gives Brown the same treatment , and reaches the area .
Finally three red shirts usher him a bit too wide right , and though he gets a low shot in , aimed for the left - hand bottom corner , it 's well wide from a far too difficult angle .
6 min : Berbatov wins a corner down the right .
Valencia takes , but Heitinga nuts clear in the no-nonsense fashion .
" Speaking of Video Collection classics , " writes Scott W , " I was wondering if any of your readers could help me track down another lost classic .
The video in question is Brian Clough 's Greatest Ever England Team where Ol ' Big Head assesses a long list of England legends , being as typically unflinching / frank / cruel / self - absorbed in his assessment of the greats as you 'd expect ( I think he laughs at the idea that Geoff Hurst was a good player ) .
As you can imagine , I 'd love to watch it again - though the lessons learnt from my childhood viewings seem to have dimmed with time , I still vaguely recall Cloughie calling Kevin Keegan an ' arrogant bastard ' .
And , yes , Brian Moore was doing the interview and voice - over . "
7 min : United win another corner down the right .
Again Valencia takes , Brown getting his head to this one .
The attempt 's weak , well wide left with no pace , but Everton are going to feel a world of pain eventually if they keep letting United fling balls into the box .
9 min : Donovan flings a long ball into the United box from an Everton free kick out on the left .
It 's too deep , and Van der Sar comes out to claim easily .
Saha stands with the radge on ; with the box loaded , that was a terrible delivery .
" I always loved the way that United played when Saha was in the team , " sighs Nick Marchant , " as his back - to - goal hold up play was perfectly suited their counter attacking style .
The fact that he ousted van Nistelrooy from the team says it all .
You 'd also have to question how Everton 's medical team have kept him playing while United 's could n't get him fit for more than a few games at a time .
And finally , much as I enjoy watching Everton , I can't work out why they need to wear those blue cardigans over their lovely white shirts . "
Is that a cardigan ?
It looks more like the sort of V - neck merino sweater Darren from Bewitched would wear while playing golf with Larry .
13 min : United let a meat - and - potatoes lump forward from Everton to bounce twice in the area .
It allows Bilyaletdinov to dig out a cross from the right , forcing Evans to head over the bar .
Corner !
" Duncan Ferguson 's goal in 1995 and his celebratory overhead shirt - twirling as he ran up the touchline reminds me of being in the frankly scary General Smuts pub near Loftus Road just before Everton 's game with QPR a month or so later , " recalls Gary Naylor with a shudder .
" In the huge , windowless back room were masses of Evertonians who were going through the Everton songbook and , on starting the Duncan Ferguson song ( to the tune of the camp anthem , " Go West " ) , hundreds of shirts were swung above now bare torsos .
It was a little bit homoerotic , a little bit inspiring and quite a lot terrifying .
We won 2 - 3 with a last minute Hinchcliffe special and I got home in one piece . "
Yeah , yeah , Naylor .
Anyway , what about Robbie Wackenshaw 's goal ?
14 min : From the corner , Rooney shoves Heitinga in the back as the two go up for a high ball .
That 's a penalty - except it's not , Howard the Risible Clown adding another chapter to his story , soon to be told in a pop - up book with buttons you can press .
14 min : Saha , presumably livid at the non-penalty decision , unleashes a low , hard shot from 30 yards out , just to the right of goal .
It 's a screamer , but Van der Sar dives to smother wonderfully well .
He 's such a good keeper .
16 min : WHAT A SUPERLATIVE FINISH !!!
Everton 0 - 1 Manchester United .
Valencia works himself some space down the right and whips in a dangerous low ball .
An Everton boot tries to slide it clear , but can only poke it to Berbatov , standing just in front of the spot .
He cushions the ball with one touch , then unleashes a screaming shot into the top - right corner , one of those that rushes right round the frame inside the net .
That 's some strike .
19 min : WHAT A SUPERLATIVE FINISH !!!
Everton 1 - 1 Manchester United .
Oh my God .
This is something else .
What a goal .
Evans can't get much on a clearing header , a long ball going down the inside - right channel .
Bilyaletdinov takes up the ball 35 yards out , nudges it inside , and skelps a simply majestic strike into the right - hand side of the net .
Van der
Sar does n't even bother to move , he knows all is lost .
22 min : Phil Neville sends a terrible cross in from the right .
It 's far too deep , but instead of letting it sail out of play , Brown heads it back out .
Pienaar looks to pick the bouncing ball up on the edge of the area , but is nudged in the back , Rooney - style , by Valencia .
That 's a free kick , just to the right of the D , for the home side .
23 min :
And it 's wasted , Pienaar attempting to recreate his heroics from the same spot of the Goodison pitch against Manchester City , but only succeeding in slapping a terrible effort straight into the wall .
25 min : Baines goes after a long ball down the left and whips a dangerous low bouncing ball into the United area .
Saha can't connect , but Bilyaletdinov rushes in .
However , eight yards out , he can only shin wildly over .
26 min :
This is breathless , brilliant stuff .
The ball 's slipped down the inside - left channel towards the edge of the Everton area , Rooney breaking clear of the Everton back line .
He rounds the advancing Howard on the left , but his touch is uncharacteristically heavy , allowing Phil Neville to come back and hustle him off the ball .
That 's great last - ditch defending , because Rooney 's not the sort to cede possession easily , especially with the goal gaping .
28 min : United had been rocking for a few minutes , but they 're quickly back into the match now .
Rooney having nearly scored a couple of minutes ago , now Park sails in from the left and belts a decent shot towards the bottom left corner .
Howard claims well .
" I wonder if Brian Moore ever commentated on himself while out driving or doing the shopping , " wonders Ian Copestake .
I 'm glad you 've kept it to outdoor solo pursuits , I can tell you that for nothing .
32 min : United have spent the last three or four minutes swinging balls into the Everton box from left and , especially , right .
Valencia is enjoying the run of the park .
From an Everton perspective , this can't continue , or more goals are surely going to whistle past Howard at some point .
Meanwhile here 's some tinder - dry analysis of the Bilyaletidinov goal from James Tyler : " I 'm surprised more youth teams are n't learning from the master .
When Bilyaletidinov brought the ball down , Brown 's first instinct was to turn his back , jog back towards goal and watch the shot sail over his shoulder and into the net .
Impressive that Brown also managed to block his goalkeeper 's view of the shot , leaving him unable to make a move . "
34 min : Berbatov attempts a needlessly elaborate backheel , 35 yards out on the right , when bringing it down would have left him in possession with three team - mates in attacking positions across a scattered Everton back line .
He was trying to flick it past Distin and spin him in one deft movement , and he was nowhere near making it .
He ends up standing still , shoulders slumped , head down , the ball bouncing safely back to Howard in the area , a picture of abject defeat .
Even his hapless failures have a strange beauty .
I like watching him .
38 min :
The ball falls to Donovan in the United six - yard box , as Brown fails to get any meat on his clearance .
Again .
He neither heads nor kicks it , basically , letting it slap off a combination of chest and forearm ( a penalty would have been super - harsh , though there are shouts ) .
Luckily for the hapless United defender , the USA international takes a complete fresh - air swipe with the ball rolling across the six - yard line and the goal gaping .
What a chance spurned .
40 min : Now it 's Everton 's turn to swing balls into the opposition area from this way and that .
Despite a lot of determined challenges from Saha and Donovan , the home side can't get any sort of strike on goal , Evans and Brown dealing with every ball - but only just , with a lot of last - ditch challenges and plenty of use of the eyebrow .
United 's centre - back pairing are n't looking particularly comfortable .
43 min : Valencia and Rooney combine well down the right , and are this close to springing the former clear , 30 yards out .
But Rooney sort - of - stands on the ball in an attempt to cushion it into space , and Everton clean up .
United are n't quite getting it together , yet there 's still that constant threat of them breaking upfield and really getting on Everton 's end .
HALF TIME : Everton 1 - 1 Manchester United .
That was a highly entertaining half of football between two teams with attack on their minds .
What a pair of goals .
And we - well , they - are off again !
Everton are kicking towards their favoured Gwaldys Street end .
Osman immediately chases after a long ball down the middle , eventually being brought down by Fletcher before he reaches the area .
Brown was ahead of them both , so that 's only a yellow .
But just outside the D , right in the centre ... this is a dangerous free kick for Everton .
48 min : After fannying around for some time , Baines lifts a hilariously bad free kick high into the stand .
This happens so often .
I 'm simple folk , but is it so much to ask for a professional footballer to get a shot at least within 10 metres of the target from 25 yards out ?
51 min : It 's all Everton in the centre of the park , though they 're not putting United 's back line under any pressure .
That 'd be an idea , because it 's looking very creaky today .
" While the match may be good , it seems it 's not going to be the Nevtacular I was hoping for , " writes Damian Wims , who has totally ignored my pre-match advice to have a wee think about the direction his life is heading .
If anything , he 's ramped things up .
I fear the Nevilles are never quite going to furnish you with the kicks you are seeking .
This is how the seeds of dangerous habits are sown .
52 min : United 's first meaningful attack of the half so nearly ends in a goal .
Fletcher heads down to Rooney , with his back to goal on the edge of the area .
Rooney lays it off back to the Scotland captain , who sends a low , hard , curling effort just wide of the bottom - left corner .
Lovely crisp play .
54 min : United look the most likely all of a sudden .
Rooney twists and turns on the left , sending a deep cross to the far post .
Berbatov is on hand to guide a cushioned header just wide right of goal .
An unlucky miss .
His head drops momentarily .
He 's probably dreaming of smoking a fag while listening to Ascenseur Pour L'Echafaud by Miles Davis .
57 min : Donovan snaps into the tackle down the left , and sends a low cross towards Osman , waiting to break into the United area down the inside - right channel .
Evans makes a spectacular interception - and a timely one , because Osman would have been clear on goal .
Lovely play all round .
61 min : Heitinga Gerrards a raking 50 - yard pass upfield towards the left wing for Pienaar .
Where does the ball end up ?
The clue is in the verb .
62 min : Park cuts a ball back from the byline , just to the left of the Everton goal .
Rooney flicks the ball onto the bar - and prepares to belt the rebound into an empty net , Howard and Phil Neville having been drawn to the near post , when the whistle goes .
The ball had sailed out of play before Park got a boot on it .
63 min : L'EXISTENTIAL PAIN DE DIMITAR BERBATOV .
He takes the ball up , 40 yards out , with his back to goal .
A deft touch and a turn sends him clear of Arteta and racing towards the box .
He drops a shoulder beautifully , cuts inside , advances further on the area , cocks the trigger , and ...
... scuffs his shot five feet in front of him , allowing Distin to scoot clear with the ball .
Does anyone have a spare Gitanes ?
66 min : Arteta is booked for pulling back Park .
Falling to the ground is the last act of the match for the Korean , who is replaced by Obertan .
Meanwhile Scholes also comes on - and Berbatov goes off to light up and listen to some hard bop , dad .
67 min : Rooney has a right old whack but his low shot sails right of goal .
70 min : Manchester United having hooked off their goalscorer , Everton follow suit by getting rid of Bilyaletdinov and replacing him with advertising legend Dan Gosling .
72 min : Osman , Neville and Gosling combine beautifully down the right , some crisp passing , eventually winning a throw - in right by the corner flag .
And then a corner .
From it , Donovan wins the ball just to the right of the United area and loops a cross into the centre ; Gosling gets his head to it , but can only guide it lamely wide left of the goal .
74 min : Pienaar picks up his daily booking for a risibly obvious wild slash at Evra 's ankles , in a failed attempt to stop the left - back romping upfield .
When the attack peters out , Webb takes centre stage to flourish the card .
He just about stops short of doing a brief soft - shoe shuffle .
76 min : OUT OF NOTHING ...
A GOAL !!!
Everton 2 - 1 Manchester United .
It 's so simple when it comes .
Pienaar dances down the left , reaches the byline , and pulls the ball back into the centre .
Saha misses the ball , but Gosling does n't , shinning a shot into the bottom - right corner , with Van der Sar once again totally unable to influence events .
Unlike ITV ,
Sky did n't cut to the ads .
77 min : Goodison is rocking .
" What 's bread got to do with existentialism ? " asks Jim Lewis , of our 63rd - minute nod to Franglais and Louis Malle .
79 min : Pienaar once again sails clear down the left .
He cuts the balll back again , this time for the onrushing Arteta - who takes a fresh air swipe as Goodison was daydreaming of a purler from the edge of the area arrowing into the top corner .
80 min : Saha takes a shot on goal after the whistle had gone for offside .
Webb somersaults in , juggles three flaming batons , tells a few jokes , sings a couple of standards , and completes his show by brandishing a totally needless yellow card .
81 min : With boos that would put Anfield to shame , Goodison greets Michael Owen , who comes on for Valencia .
83 min : A dangerous free kick for United , just to the left of the area , 35 yards out .
Carrick 's delivery is witless , never likely to beat the first man .
84 min : Carrick now takes a directionless corner , the danger easily cleared .
United have n't forced Howard into action at all .
86 min : Gosling , steaming down the right , tries to free Saha with a raking pass into the centre , but hits it too hard and forces the striker wide .
That was half a chance to wrap this up for Everton , as United only had two men running back with the Everton pair .
87 min : Osman nudges Rooney off the ball as the United striker races towards the Everton box .
That 's a free - kick , and a yellow card , for once delivered without fuss by Webb .
The ball 's placed just to the right of centre , 30 yards out .
Rooney steps up and sends the ball curling towards the top - right corner at speed ...
88 min : ... but the ball flicks off Distin 's head and misses by this much .
It 's deflected away for a corner , inches past the goalframe .
88 min and a bit : Pienaar is replaced by Rodwell .
90 min : WHAT A GOAL !!!
WHAT A SUBSTITUTION !!!
Everton 3 - 1 Manchester United .
Rodwell takes the ball up in the centre , just outside the centre circle .
He races straight towards goal , sending Brown then Evans backpedalling out of control .
Rodwell nudges the ball right once , twice , and then a third time , entering the area then sliding the calmest of shots into the bottom - left corner .
That really is a wonderful goal .
He 's booked for taking his shirt off in celebration .
Thank you , my Fifa !
90 min +
1 : There will be four added minutes of this , but , y'know .
90 min + 3 : Saha scoots after a ball down the centre , but is beaten to it by Van der Sar , who races miles from his area to head clear .
Well , if Evans and Brown do n't pass muster ...
AND THAT'S IT !
Everton 3 - 1 Manchester United .
That was a wonderful game , and a deserved win for the home team .
That goal from 18 - year - old Rodwell ... oh me , oh my .
One for the video collection , right there .
BERKELEY , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
As more research is done into the recall of certain vehicles made by Toyota Motor Corp. , the more likely it is that the sudden - acceleration phenomenon due to supposedly faulty gas pedals may actually be a software glitch .
In other words , an electromagnetic pulse outside the vehicle or a unusual series of commands to the onboard computer may trigger the hazardous condition .
Now we understand that the high - tech Ford Motor Co. F , +0.90 % models -- the Fusion and Milan , both hybrids -- have a software glitch that may indicate a brake failure when there is n't one .
The cars will be brought back for a code patch .
When the concept of " fly - by - wire " cars ( known in the auto industry as drive - by - wire , or DBW ) became public , I was under the impression that some mechanical systems would remain in place , and that networks within the vehicle would be used for lights , instrumentation and engine fine - tuning .
Most people remember the 1988 incident at the Paris Air Show , where a fly - by - wire Airbus crashed into the trees during a demonstration .
Although there is still a debate over the exact causes , some tech pundits are convinced that the computer , not liking the pilot input since it made no sense to the software , crashed the plane .
This very public accident is one of hundreds , if not thousands of software - related incidents , many grisly .
Now we have the Toyota TM , - 1.34 % " sticking " accelerator .
In a Prius , as well as many computer - controlled Toyotas , the accelerator pedal is more like a volume - control knob than anything else .
In the olden days when you stepped on the pedal , it would be directly connected to , say , a carburetor , and open a valve mechanically as you pushed down .
This is now passé , as this activity is done electronically on the most modern cars by network signaling .
The original concept behind computer - networked cars began with engine - control units ( referred to as car computers ) in the 1980s , which handled the complicated fuel injection and other aspects of the modern engine .
But car makers knew that the real benefit to them would to find some way to run a computer network throughout the car to get rid of the repair bugaboo and nightmarish cable harness / wiring assembly built into automobiles .
The cable harness had wires for everything electric within the car .
A dedicated set of wires would go from the light switch , for example , to the headlamps and taillights .
This was an expensive proposition when compared with a computer network with one wire looping around the entire car , telling every device what to do based on what switches ( sensors ) were turned on and off .
Because computer networks are easier to troubleshoot than a harness with a bunch of wires in it , cars got more reliable .
So companies took the next money - saving step , which was to think seriously about a complete drive - by - wire car .
I can assure you that in the 1980s when this was first being discussed , this drive - by - wire idea was verboten .
But hey , it works on airplanes , why not cars ?
Of course , the software , if it is going to be used in the first place , should be coded to recognize a panic situation and shut down the engine or reset the gas pedal , or do something proper .
Perhaps something as simple as a panic button or kill switch would suffice .
Unlike mechanical systems , software is nothing more than a lengthy series of instructions that require an inordinate amount of intense logical thought and second - guessing on the part of the software writer (s ) .
At the end of the day , you always get a bug .
Apparently , at least for Toyota , the bug can be lethal .
This sort of problem can never be fully resolved or eliminated in complex systems .
If we are going to continue to trust software and computers to run everything , disaster will forever occur .
So get ready for this sort of problem to reemerge over and over in the decades to come .
The next step for the auto industry is drive - by - wire steering .
I think we can already imagine how this is going to turn out .
The FEC requires any individual that makes a contribution of $ 250 or more to a PAC or candidate to disclose his or her occupation and employer .
This bit of information is probably the easiest to leave blank or just intentionally ambiguous — for instance , writing down ambiguous job titles such as ‘ self - employed , ’ ‘ businessman , or ‘ internet warrior . ’
Regardless , the disclosure rate for occupations generally hovers around 90 percent .
Combined with the procedure described the previous post , this allows for interesting comparisons of ideological giving patterns across industries / professions .
As a first cut , I recovered ideal point estimates for the 3125 PACs and 131,000 individual contributors that gave to two or more unique candidates during the 2007 - 2008 election cycle and scaled them using the IMWA procedure .
The figure below ranks a subset of occupations from left to right based on the mean ideal point of the members of each occupation .
As a point of reference , the occupation ideal points are imposed over the density plots for all Democratic and Republican candidates .
Update : Improved versions of the graph that include all repeat contributors during the 1990 - 2008 election cycles are posted here .
Mr. Amidi and Mr. Nozad refuse to discuss their returns , beyond saying that seven of their portfolio companies have been acquired .
They acknowledge that at least one of them was sold at a loss .
Still , their power - broker status has impressed some longtime Silicon Valley figures .
“ They really get the way Silicon Valley works , ” said Ron Conway , an investor who has helped finance dozens of high - tech companies , including Google .
“ They started as landlords to technology companies and then worked their way up the food chain . ”
The Amidis ran a string of successful businesses in Iran , then fled after the Islamic revolution .
They arrived in California in 1979 and quickly set up a number of new businesses under the umbrella of the Amidi Group .
These included the rug store , the Medallion Rug Gallery ; an international water distribution business , which , according to Mr. Amidi , brings in $ 150 million a year ; and large real estate holdings , which are mostly managed by his brother , Rahim Amidi .
But as the boom in technology gathered force in the late 1990s , its lure proved irresistible .
Medallion Rug and the University Avenue building proved ideal entry points for a family with scant background or connections in the technology world .
It was at Medallion Rug , for instance , that Mr. Amidi and Mr. Nozad met Andy Rubin , Danger ’s founder , when he came in to buy a carpet .
The sale turned into a lengthy negotiation during which they learned of Mr. Rubin ’s start - up plans .
Once the deal for the carpet was settled , Mr. Amidi and Mr. Nozad told Mr. Rubin that they invested in start - ups and wanted him to meet Mr. Amidi ’s father , now deceased .
“ He came over to our offices and we showed him what we were planning on doing , ” said Mr. Rubin , who has worked at Google since it acquired another start - up he founded .
“ He looked at us , and he told Saeed and Rahim that he wanted to invest . ”
Their investment fund put $ 400,000 into Danger , and the Amidis gave the company a discount on office space .
Mr. Amidi says the decision was more a bet on Mr. Rubin ’s abilities — as demonstrated during negotiations over the rug — than on the technology itself .
He swaggered into town with a can - do attitude , a cheeky - chappie smile , and a burning desire to help the world 's fattest schoolchildren .
But less than an hour later , the impertinent English superchef was being reduced to tears as hostile locals told him to lay off their beloved nuggets , pizza , and chocolate milkshakes .
Jamie Oliver crossed the Atlantic on Sunday , hoping to administer the sort of wake - up call that five years ago saw him invited to Downing Street to explain what the nation 's school canteens should do with their Turkey Twizzlers .
But like many a British star before him , he found America to be a tough nut to crack .
The Naked Chef swapped his trademark scooter for a vintage SUV and rolled into the city of Huntington , West Virginia , to launch the ABC series Jamie Oliver 's Food Revolution , a hybrid US version of the various TV series in which he 's attempted to educate Britain about the virtues of fresh fruit and vegetables .
Bringing that message to Huntington proved to be quite a challenge : the city was recently named by the Centres for Disease Control as the least healthy city in the least healthy state of America , the most overweight nation in the developed world .
Oliver 's campaign got off to a tricky start .
At the local talk radio station , the " shock jock " told him to take the busybody act elsewhere : " We do n't want to sit around eating lettuce all day ! " said the DJ .
" Who made you king ? "
Complaining that he " thought miserable bastards like that only existed in England " , Oliver adjourned to the local school , where children were tucking into their daily breakfast : pizza and chocolate milk .
" I have never seen pizza served for breakfast , " he said , shocked .
Oliver then watched aghast as the dinner ladies whipped up a lunch of chicken nuggets and reconstituted " pearls " of processed potato .
" It 's that kind of food that 's killing America , " he announced .
Oliver was introduced to the morbidly obese wife and children of a local truck driver , whose entire diet consisted of fried , re-fried , deep - fried and microwavable junk .
" This is going to kill your kids , " he declared .
The mother duly broke down in tears .
If there 's one thing middle America hates it 's being lectured to by sniffy foreigners .
And the tense atmosphere in Huntington reached boiling point when a newspaper quoted Oliver suggesting his host country 's obesity epidemic might be due to ignorance .
True ?
Maybe .
Oliver was promptly forced to issue a grovelling apology .
" They do n't understand me , " he declared to the camera , breaking down in tears .
" They do n't know why I 'm here ! "
Sunday 's show , a preview for a series that commences this Friday , received mediocre ratings : only 6.1 million viewers tuned in , fewer than such shows as Undercover Boss , Celebrity Apprentice and Family Guy .
And the reviews were also mixed .
The Washington Post said the show " has all the problems of most network reality pap " .
The Los Angeles Times could n't have been more effusive , though .
" Despite an accent that is usually referred to in the UK as ' mockney ' and the product - tousled hair men of his age inexplicably favour , Oliver is eminently and instantly likeable , " said its review .
" He may in fact wind up being reality TV's most engaging star . "
( Natural News ) After 11 years of secrecy , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has decided to reverse a prior decision that allowed pesticide manufacturers to conceal the inert ingredients from their product labels .
Since many of these ingredients are toxic , the agency now believes that consumers should know what ingredients are hiding in pesticide products .
As opposed to active ingredients , inert ingredients in pesticides do not kill or control pests .
A typical pesticide product is composed of over 99 percent inerts while the remaining 1 percent or less are the actual active ingredients .
Prior to the EPA 's announcement , manufacturers were not required to disclose any of the inert ingredients contained in their products , even though federal law classifies many of them as hazardous .
Some of these include formaldehyde , bisphenol A ( BPA ) , toluene , sulfuric acid , styrene , and benzene , all of which are known carcinogens that are implicated in causing everything from breathing problems to sexual dysfunction .
Petitions filed by ten state attorneys general and an environmental group in 2001 to require inert ingredient labeling were denied by the EPA .
A federal appeal in 2004 was also struck down , upholding the precedent that labeling was neither important nor necessary .
However this year the agency has had a change of heart , deciding to initiate new regulations that it says will increase transparency and encourage manufacturers to remove toxic ingredients from their products and replace them with safer , more environmentally friendly components .
Many pesticide companies are resistant to the idea because they say it will force them to reveal confidential information about their formulas and make public their trade secrets .
They also allege that the EPA is practicing double speak by approving the formulas as safe for public use while at the same time expressing concern over the toxicity of inert ingredients .
All inert ingredients in pesticides have always been made available to the EPA in order to be approved , a process that the industry believes releases them from responsibility .
While not all inert ingredients are toxic , many being simple plant and oil extracts and other harmless fillers , many experts and industry watchdogs believe it is necessity to reveal all ingredients , especially toxic ones , in order to maintain public health .
The EPA plans to work with the pesticide industry , consumers , and other stake holders to craft appropriate legislation .
Federal law , whether constitutional or not , allows only the EPA to decide what must be included on pesticide labels , which has caused a firestorm of petitions from 15 state attorneys general providing suggestions for the new legislation .

Serious news story about the closure of my workplace , Interzone GamesAt first I was quite hesitant to talk about this online , but given the amount of media coverage that s now out there , it seems like a good time .
My workplace , Interzone Games , in Perth , Australia , is about to be liquidated by the ATO due to unpaid tax debts .
Interzone Games is a game development studio , working on an MMO that was scheduled for release later this year .
Money for these taxes was meant to be sent by the parent company , Interzone Entertainment , based in the USA .
The parent company has also failed to send money to pay employees salaries .
Theyve been constantly late with payments , and as we currently stand , .
They have also , in my case , for about two of the two and a half years Ive worked there .
The last year I have spent there , weve had multiple occasions where our pay was extremely late ( almost two months at one point ) and naturally during these times the US company had nothing but a huge stream of promises of incoming money , of which next to none of these promises were kept .
They were never up front with us about the condition of the company , and .
There has also been no resident director for the Perth company since 2008 ; also illegal by Australian law .
There were also two other branches of the company , one in Brazil and one in China .
Very similar things happened to both ; they werent paid and were liquidated , while the directors from the US company got away with it .
As far as I understand it , if the directors of a company are out of the country , theres very little you can do to them .
Ex-employees from both companies have been in serious trouble financially as a result .
You re probably wondering , why the hell I stuck around , with a company with a CEO and directors as dodgy as that .
First of all , Ive learnt a lot from them , and I would still love to work with them in the future .
I dont regret staying with the company , even through all the shit that we went through .
We always very active , striking when not paid for extended periods , seeking all the legal and government advice and action we could .
However , pretty much all the avenues we have pursued turned to be either hopelessly slow at acting or unable to help us .
The ASIC in particular , the one organization that could have detained the directors from the parent company when they were in Australia , turned out to be completely useless , as any investigation they made had a turnaround of almost a month , by which time the directors could have run back to the US .
I feel absolutely no obligation to the parent company , who screwed us over in any way they possibly could .
But for the people I worked with and the game we were working so hard to complete , you know , I really wanted things to at least hold together until wed shipped the game .
But you know what ?
I havent even GOTTEN to the story that s unfolded this week , so Ill share what I can with you , here .
This week , with the ATOs closure of the company imminent , ( ie. the intellectual property ) and leave with it before all the buildings assets were seized .
Theres a lot of controversy surrounding this , naturally .
To start with , Turner turned up at the office , with no paperwork , expecting us to HELP him download the IP from the servers .
We said as we hadnt paid , we wouldnt co-operate .
He then came back after dark , when wed all gone home and changed all the locks , telling us we were all suspended and that we were trespassing ( both of these are false .
You cant be suspended when there is outstanding pay , and we were on public property ) .
With the help of a contracted Bigworld Technology server engineer , over the next two days they downloaded an unknown quantity of data from the servers , quite possibly including property that was not their own .
As an employee , I m horrified at the idea of the parent company swooping in and flying off with all our hard work that they havent paid for , and dodging all responsibility for the massive debt they re leaving behind .
Supposedly , their plan is to get another studio in the USA to finish the game , which is a ridiculous idea .
Anyone who knows anything about developing games would know how much longer it would take to release the game if you re starting with a new development team who dont know the game engine or the code .
Oh , and theyll pay out everything were entitled to once the game ships and makes money ( Hahahaha .
Seriously , a promise from Marty ?
Like all those other promises ?
Even if the game shipped and made money , the chances wed see a cent of it are pretty much nil ) .
Also , this means that they DID have the money to pay our debts , but decided it would be cheaper not to .
That s the situation weve all found ourselves in .
It s all over the news , if youd like to read more , there are a number of videos and articles :
What you can do to help : I would love these news articles to be the first thing you see when you Google  Marty Brickey .
People need to know not to trust them .
Hes the sort of character whos all charisma and promises , but his word is worthless .
Im not in dire need of any financial support for the time being , so please dont worry .
I should be able to apply for GEERS , a government organization , which pays any outstanding payroll in Australia in the event of a company being liquidated .
That 'll most likely take a year or more though .
I will lose the superannuation , and yes , it sucks , but that at least I m pretty well resigned to .
However , if you would like to support the rest of the team several members of Interzone work on game projects in their spare time .
Ill later post another article with more detail showcasing some of the iPhone games , because one , itll help them financially in a small way , and 2 , THEYRE AWESOME !
I have decided to wait until all the drama has calmed down before looking at my options for further work .
Do the photovoltaics that can transform sunshine into electricity require a revolution ?
Our current Secretary of Energy and Nobel Prize–winner Steven Chu thinks so .
But Subhendu Guha , chairman of PV maker Uni-Solar , disagrees : " People say we need a revolution to get to grid parity .
The revolution has already happened . "
Uni-Solar manufactures thin - film solar cells made from amorphous silicon .
The company has built a machine in Auburn Hills Michigan that churns out nine miles of such photovoltaics in 62 hours — and Guha hopes to make the revolutionary machine even bigger soon .
Uni-Solar is not alone .
Manufacturers that make traditional crystalline silicon solar panels are boosting efficiencies and dropping prices thanks to equipment improvements plus cheap Chinese labor and materials .
Another U.S. company , First Solar , claims it can make its variety of thin - film solar cells for less than $ 1 per watt .
That 's been the goal of solar panel makers for a long time , because as those prices decline electricity from the sun costs the same as , or is even cheaper than electricity from burning fossil fuels .
And that means a " deployment revolution " might be imminent or , as Guha says , " a roof is a terrible thing to waste . "

A new large - format multi - touch technology launched today by DISPLAX , a developer of interactive technologies , will transform any non-conductive flat or curved surface into a multitouch screen .
The DISPLAX Multitouch Technology , believed to be the first of its kind , has been developed based on a transparent thinner - than - paper polymer film .
When applied to glass , plastic or wood , the surface becomes interactive .
Significantly , this new multitouch technology can be applied to standard LCD screens as well , making it an attractive choice for LCD manufacturers .
The new technology will also be available for audiovisual integrators or gaming platforms to develop innovative products .
The DISPLAX Multitouch Technology dramatically extends the capabilities of the interactive format .
It can be applied to flat or curved , opaque as well as transparent surfaces up to three metres across the diagonal .
It is hyper sensitive , allowing users to interact with an enabled surface not just by touching it but , for the first time , by blowing on it , opening up new possibilities for future applications .
Currently , the technology can detect up to 16 fingers on a 50 - inch screen .
The number of fingers detected is expected to increase as development progresses .
" Multitouch is the future of interacting with a wide range of technologies .
For the commercial markets , the DISPLAX Multitouch Technology will open up new opportunities for many market players , technology vendors as well as businesses , " said Miguel Fonseca , chief business officer of DISPLAX .
" It is extremely powerful , precise and versatile .
Almost everyone who sees it thinks of new applications , from converting LCDs into a multitouch screens , tables into multitouch tables , to creating interactive information screens in stores , shopping malls or public areas , to developing new exciting gaming environments .
We already have a number of interesting pilots in progress across Europe . "
The technology was primarily developed for commercial environments , but Displax expects potential customers to come from industries as diverse as telecoms , retail , property , broadcast , pharma or finance .
DISPLAX expects consumer applications to be developed using the new technology as well .
Based on patent - pending projected capacitive technology , DISPLAX Multitouch Technology uses a controller that works by processing multiple input signals it receives from a grid of nanowires embedded in the film attached to the enabled surface .
Each time a finger is placed on the screen or a user blows on the surface , a small electrical disturbance is caused .
The micro-processor controller analyses this data and decodes the location of each input on that grid to track the finger and air - flow movements .
The DISPLAX Multitouch technology controller combined with a projected capacitive nanowired film is a lightweight and highly scalable solution , ranging from seven inches ( 18 centimetres ) to three metres across the diagonal thus opening up a wide range of commercial applications suitable for indoor or outdoor displays .
DISPLAX works with partners and directly with customers to deliver multi - touch rich - media applications , enabling people to take full advantage of the latest developments .
DISPLAX Multitouch Technology will be available in the market with several embedded business applications at no extra cost , designed especially for the kind of installations that interactive technology companies work on .
This Apps Pack will allow customers to display photo and video streams , provide users access to Google Maps and social networks , integrate news streams via RSS and play multitouch games .
More applications will be available later in 2010 directly from DISPLAX and other developers .
The DISPLAX Multitouch Technology will begin shipping in July 2010 .

The Wider Context for Twenty - Somethings ( Gen Y ) in America
( February 19 , 2010 )
Gen Y , your time has come .
Spend the next few years of devolution preparing yourselves to lead by example as one of The Remnant .
I received an important request from a 26 - year old reader , Charlie O. I try not to give unsolicited advice more than four times a week , but since Charlie was kind enough to ask me to sketch a " wider context for the experience of a twenty - something in a rapidly changing America , " here goes .
This is one of the most critical tasks we face as a nation .
The Boomers and their parents have crowded round the status quo's Kool - Aid bowl for decades , and as a result the nation 's future now rests with Gen X ( citizens in their 30s / early 40s ) and Gen Y .
Even at this late date , the Boomer - controlled government and mainstream media are pushing the status quo propaganda that all you need to do is get out there and take on more debt and spend , spend , spend , and pay more taxes , of course , and everything will be just fine .
Here are Charlie 's comments : I would like to ask if you could address some issues facing younger Americans in some of your future articles .
I am 26 , I have a degree , and I was going to become a History teacher , but after working in the school systems for two years and witnessing its dysfunction I decided not to waste my working years in its service .
Since then I have left my graduate program , internship , catering job , my apartment and my car to become a traveling farm apprentice .
I started in upstate New York , then went to South Florida and now I am on my way to Illinois for the next year ( and quite possibly to settle down for a while ) .
I simply want to convey my feeling that twenty - somethings are in a strange place .
A lot of the articles about financial issues for us recent graduates that I come across seem to have a tone of admonishment as if we are " dragging our feet " or " ca n't get it together , " when I know that many of us are savvy and doing our best .
So -- they 're useless , but it would be nice to have a wider context for the experience of a twenty - something in a rapidly changing America .
Thank you , Charlie , for stating the critical task so well .
It is truly essential to establish the wider context .
Without an integrated understanding , then all actions will be mere flailing about , misguided and largely wasted .
I know it seems like I 'm always pitching my own work , but the fact remains that this " wider context " is precisely why I slaved away for a year to write the 140,000 - word Survival + and why I prepared a shorter version , Survival +
The Primer , for those who prefer a 140 - page book to a 400 - page book .
Just off the top off my head , here is a rough sketch of the wider context : 1 . The status quo is doomed to implosion .
Clinging to the propaganda that the American State / Empire is sustainable is self - destructive .
Harbor no illusions .
The status quo cannot be " reformed , " as I explain in the chapter " Insurmountable Barriers to Structural Reform . "
The upper -caste Elites who thrive in protected fiefdoms are mounting a full spectrum defense of the status quo .
Minor tweaks in parameters ( " we 're raising the Medicare payment by $ 5 a month , " " city employees agree to a 3 % pay reduction , " etc. ) will not " save " structurally unsustainable systems .
2 . Differentiate between simulacra of optimism and true optimism .
The American " ethos " is supposedly " can - do , " but that has devolved to a charade , a mockery and a sham of optimism .
What is served up as " optimism " ( everything will be fine if you shut up , keep your head down , pay your taxes and follow orders ) is in fact denial on a scale so massive and pervasive that it qualifies as a cultural psychosis .
Accepting reality is optimism ; denial is a sure path to self - destruction .
3 . The American economy / Empire / State has a financial and cultural sickness unto death .
Chimeras , illusions , delusions , denial , simulacra and facsimiles abound ; artifice and propaganda rule the corporate airwaves and the State machinery .
One way to start clearing your mind of propaganda is to stop watching MSM ( mainstream media ) TV and listening to MSM radio .
Read more , watch less .
Ask cui bono of all statements : to whose benefit ?
4 . As I noted in Why I am Optimistic , this devolution is a cause of optimism ; it is truly deranged to fear the implosion of Empire , debt - serfdom , the drug - war / gulag complex , the State ruled by Protected Fiefdoms which strip - mine the middle class and the impoverishment imposed by a Financial - Rentier Power Elite .
5 . Understand that the Financial - Rentier Power Elite controls the productive wealth of the nation .
That is the key context to keep in mind when viewing the propaganda which attempts to present the Demopublicans as " your only choice . "
Both are owned lock , stock and barrel ( " captured " is the current word for this ) by the financial Elites .
Frequent contributor U. Doran submitted an excellent portrayal of this reality : The Economic Elite Have Engineered an Extraordinary Coup , Threatening the Very Existence of the Middle Class .
Here is researcher G. William Domhoff 's summary :
In terms of types of financial wealth , the top one percent of households have 38.3 % of all privately held stock , 60.6 % of financial securities , and 62.4 % of business equity .
The top 10 % have 80 % to 90 % of stocks , bonds , trust funds , and business equity , and over 75 % of non -home real estate .
Since financial wealth is what counts as far as the control of income - producing assets , we can say that just 10 % of the people own the United States of America .
For reasons too complex to go into here , it is the top 1 % which have the political power ; the other 9 % are wealthy but not politically dominant except at a local level ( i.e. the real estate development interests who typically control local politics ) .
6 . If you follow this through , it is easy to see what " the rest of us , " especially young people should do : most importantly , do not take on any more debt for any reason .
The Financial Plutocracy feeds off debt .
It is the lifeblood of their wealth and of your impoverishment .
7 . Do not count on the Savior State to pay your bills and arrange your life .
As difficult as it may be , make other arrangements to care for yourself and those you care about .
The Savior State has two options : destroy the currency via inflation so your Social Security check will buy a loaf of bread , or it will default on its debts and entitlements .
There is not enough real money in the Universe to pay all the promises the State has made .
8 . Base your self - worth on integrity , not on what you own or wear .
Create an independently constructed sense of self ( Survival + 101 ) which exists independently of the mass media / marketing complex ( " you are nothing unless you own what we 're selling " ) , the State ( " you exist to pay taxes and take orders " ) and the Plutocracy ( " you exist to consume and make us profit and to toil as a debt - serf " ) .
9 . Invest in yourself , not with student loans tossed into the maw of academia , but in your own experiential skillsets , social network / social wealth and well - being .
Focus your energies on radical self - reliance which is founded on reciprocity ( " to take care of Number One , start taking care of Numbers 2 through 9 " -- Survival + 101 ) .
10 .
Study , join , participate and lead voluntary , transparent , non-privileged parallel structures which exist independently of the status quo Corporatocracy and Savior State .
The mainstream media has marginalized the late 1960s / early 1970s Counterculture , but as a participant I can assure you it was a truly radical idea and structure , being entirely voluntary , transparent , non-privileged , networked , reciprocal and independent of the State and predatory / crony corporate interests .
I learned to fear the State .
So - called " Progressives " who naively see the State as their benefactor and Savior never crossed the State 's machinery of suppression .
If they had , they would n't be so naive .
The Counterculture solution was to opt out as much as possible , and that remains the best , most productive alternative to debt - serfdom , resentment and a soul - draining passivity .
As Rome crumbled , opting out was the only solution .
Reform was impossible due to the entrenched interests who held sway .
Taxes went up to feed the protected Elites , crushing the dwindling productive class .
Government edicts were ignored , the currency was debased , etc. etc.-- all the symptoms of terminal decline we see in abundance today .
11 . Opt out means : pursue self - sufficiency , build social capital ( Survival + 101 again ) and skillset capital , slowly assemble and own your own means of production .
Seek resilient communities and entrepreneural networks .
Seek to fill a niche of need ; as a default setting , focus on the FEW resources : food , energy , water .
Minimize debt , income and thus taxes .
Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's , but have as little to do with Caesar as possible , with one exception : 12 .
Vote .
Always vote , no matter how futile the gesture may seem .
Vote against the incumbents , and for any voice of reason , innovation and courage ( meaning anyone who says the status quo is unsustainable and borrowing trillions more to prop up Protected Fiefdoms is only hastening the implosion ) .
Ignore party affiliations as just more mist generated by the propaganda machines .
Vote for Third - Party candidates and independents .
13 . A New American State is possible and indeed , inevitable .
Right now the corrupted , venal , rapacious American State is dominated and controlled by parallel shadow structures of privilege which operate behind the facade of legitimate governance .
The apparently powerless voluntary , transparent , non-privileged parallel structures which are slowly self - assembling will be the template for the New American State .
Yes , there is a role for government , if it is truly transparent , limited in scope and under the control of an engaged citizenry .
Such a New State becomes possible when the current State implodes into insolvency .
14 . Be productive .
Even if you 're not being paid , be productive .
I pick up the trash on the curb and in the street around my neighborhood ; that small work is unpaid but productive .
Beauty ( flowers , art , live music , etc. ) is a form of social capital ; ugliness , trash and passivity are core elements of the cultural sickness unto death .
15 .
Seek a life of hybrid work : some paid , some unpaid , some grunt work , some creative , some community / family / networked , some individual .
The structural instabilities which are devolving the status quo are large - scale , but the opportunities for well - being and full - spectrum prosperity are small , local , regional , networked and individual .
You are what you do every day .
When 20 % of the populace have opted out then the Pareto principle suggests their influence will grow dramatically .
Become one of that 20 % .
There are no " disabled " people except the severely mentally ill and people who have lost all motor control .
People now dismissed as " disabled " can perform useful tasks : maintaining " eyes on the street " is a useful task .
Taking care of pets is useful and life - affirming .
Much work can be performed online .
16 .
Invest in your own health by eating well , cooking well , sharing good food , and by stretching , being fit and working productively .
17 .
Turn off the TV , iPod , iPhone , PDA , radio , gaming device and computer for several days a week .
The digital fire hose destroys reflection , contemplation , and appreciation ; it fosters distraction , disorientation , anxiety , distorted thinking , depression , and passivity , which is the mortal enemy of truth , creativity , innovation , growth and beauty .
18 . Prepare for leadership by leading by example .
The Remnant leads by example , not talk - radio exhortations .
19 .
Grow some food , even if it a single tomato plant in a pot on the patio of an apartment .
What you gain from this experience cannot be easily summarized .
20 .
Trust in failure , rejection and mistakes .
They are the teachings we remember .
Seek them out .
Embrace the courage of learning from your mistakes and failures .
Try something else ; keep learning , keep building your own means of production and social capital ( resilient , self - organizing , voluntary , entrepreneural , sustainable networks ) ; seek social networks of reciprocity , avoid the Savior State mentality of entitlement / resentment .
21 .
Be accountable , first to yourself and then to others .
Stop making excuses .
The only operant phrase with any meaning is " I made a mistake , I 'll do better next time . "
22 .
Put another way : Nurture the Divine within .

Since the beginning of March , the ongoing saga between Infinity Ward and Activision has rocked the gaming masses by exposing controversial practices at the flagship studio .
While reports surfaced that insubordination was the cause of two key departures , the biggest story came when it was announced that unpaid royalties also played a crucial role in the incident .
Last night further suspicion arose when it was announced that the first Modern Warfare 2 DLC pack titled “ Stimulus Package ” would be released on March 30 for a whopping 1200 Microsoft points ( $ 15 ) .
Here are a few detailed reasons why you should n’t be so eager to pull the trigger on purchasing this package .
3 ) Late Release and Competition
Call Of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 was released on all major gaming platforms on November 10,2009 .
The marketing campaign was hugely successful due to the job Activision and GameStop did with promoting the game right up until it ’s release date .
As a standard business practice dictates with this industry , there is a designated grace period where a game receives an onslaught of attention before being tossed to the side in favor of a newer game .
This particular game had its time to shine but is now being overshadowed by Battlefield : Bad Company 2 .
While many Call Of Duty fans may disagree with my statement , the proof lies in the fact that when researching the latest
First person shooter games online , virtually every gaming site acknowledges Bad Company 2 as the hottest title in that genre right now .
For Modern Warfare 2 to remain relevant , the map pack should have dropped sooner rather then later .
Now it seems like it will be released only as a strategy to go head to head with it ’s competition and therefore only provide minimal satisfaction to the gamer .
2 ) Same Maps : Less Value
One of the biggest gripes I have with this package is the lack of value for your money .
Activision has reported that the map pack will include 3 new maps and 2 old maps from the first Modern Warfare game .
While this practice may seem fine for a gamer that did n’t play the original title , this leaves the hardcore fan of the series frustrated and angry .
Adding on that these 2 maps are fan favorites seems like even more of an excuse to round out the total number at 5 maps .
Honestly if these are favorites then they should have already been available free as part of the original package .
However ,
The actual idea of re-releasing the same content is n’t a new practice as Bungie clearly illustrated this point when they unveiled Halo 3 : ODST to the masses .
While the campaign and firefight remained the bread and butter of the package , the highly controversial 2nd disc received attention mainly because it included the same maps from Halo 3 multiplayer .
Many people who purchased the game never realized this fact until they plunked down their hard earned money and opened the box , immediately losing the right to return the game for full value .
This practice should be deemed both lazy and disgraceful because its works off the consumer ’s fanboy demeanor for a game .
Just like with most things in life it ’s your responsibility to investigate whether or not something is worth the price and value .
The continued use of this practice by Activision should clearly define these logistics and is living proof that we live in a society where recycled ideas are praised over original content .
1 ) Price
The single most important reason why I ’d recommend that you pass on this content is the actual pricepoint at which its being sold .
Up until now , every Call Of Duty map pack has featured original maps and maintained the value of 800 Microsoft points ( $ 10 ) .
Given that there are only 3 new maps and the price has risen a whole 5 dollars more , as a consumer you should be questioning if your really getting more for your money .
This method seems as if the creative team is banking on the fact that this pack will be so highly anticipated that you ’ll have no choice but to pick it up and play immediately .
However , might I remind you that on the very same day Bad Company 2 releases their first map pack as well .
Right then and there you get a sense that the pressure is on Activision but they do n’t seem the least bit rattled by it .
You gather this perception from the fact that the price has been raised and behind that is a sense of arrogance that more expensive= more valuable .
This is a daily issue in our world today and often accounts for why so many people are in debt .
The philosophy of “ Keeping Up with The Jeffersons ” is a dynamic that houses these beliefs and once you look at its relation to purchases you notice an ever - growing trend .
On the same token , one can argue that the price increase could be due to the fact that Activision is suggesting this is the final Modern Warfare game , making it a priority to milk it for all it ’s worth .
If someone is down to their last 1200 points , they may opt to purchase the pack and thus be unable to buy the Bad Company 2 content as a result .
If that ’s the case then perhaps all the rumors you heard about royalties and lawsuits were true .
The funny thing is that up until now EA has been portrayed as the power hungry company aiming to be the number 1 publisher , developer , and distributor of every game ever made .
Now this move clearly orchestrated by Activision proves without a shadow of a doubt that perhaps EA is the lesser of both evils .

Meg Stapleton ( right ) , a top adviser to former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , has resigned .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Top Palin aide resigns
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ’s senior adviser and spokeswoman , Meghan Stapleton , has resigned , POLITICO has learned .
Stapleton has been a Palin confidante since December 2006 and one of the governor ’s most trusted aides since she was vaulted onto the national political scene by being picked as GOP presidential nominee John McCain ’s running mate .

Stapleton said she resigned to spend more time with her husband and 2 - year - old daughter , Isabella .
“ While it has been an honor to help Gov. Palin and her family over the last few years , I am also honored to have this incredible opportunity to stay home with my precious miracle , Isabella , ” Stapleton told POLITICO . " [ She is ] 2 years old , [ and ]
I have missed significant moments in her life , but I look forward with great happiness to celebrating milestones as well as mundane moments with her as I refocus my priorities .
I also look forward to seeing my saint of a husband again , too ! ”
Since the end of the presidential campaign , Stapleton has been one of only a handful of aides and trusted contacts maintained by Palin through her transition from governor , to national political figure , to author , to Fox News contributor and one of the unofficial leaders of the tea party movement .
In that time , Stapleton was a key strategic adviser and the pipeline for anyone seeking Palin ’s attention , including Republican officials and reporters .
“ Meg has been deeply involved in all things Palin and instrumental in Sarah 's many successes , ” Fred Malek , a prominent Republican fundraiser and Palin friend , told POLITICO .
“ It ’s hard to replace anyone so loyal , tireless and effective , but the Palin phenomenon will continue .
Meg has surely earned the privilege to devote more time to her 2 - year - old daughter , but I expect she will continue to render advice to her good friend on key issues . ”
Prior to working for the former governor , Stapleton was director of scheduling and advance for Republican National Committee Co-Chairwoman Jeanie Austin , an assistant for Malek at Thayer Capital Partners and a local television news reporter in New York , Pennsylvania and Alaska .
Palin and her now ex-aide have been talking about her stepping down for some time , and it became official on Wednesday — Stapleton ’s birthday .
Stapleton has been employed by Palin ’s PAC since helping to launch it in January 2009 .
In an e-mail to the staff last week , she wrote : “ Earlier this week , I handed Governor Palin my resignation , effective the end of this month . ”
“ While I had hoped to work together on so many more projects , time with my precious 2 - year - old has been further minimized with the whirlwind commitments of all things Palin , ” she told the SarahPAC staff .
“ I have done my best to scale back , but Isabella is now resorting to hiding my BlackBerry , and she should n't grow up begging for a mother to start acting like a mother . ”
Low levels of circulating vitamin D are associated with a greater risk of colorectal cancer , European researchers say .
A case - control study found that people in the top fifth of vitamin D levels had 40 percent lower risk for colorectal cancer than those in the bottom fifth , according to Mazda Jenab of the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon , France , and colleagues .
But more research is needed to see if increasing circulating vitamin D can effectively reduce the risk of the disease , they concluded online in the British Medical Journal .
The main role of vitamin D is to maintain calcium levels in cells and bone metabolism , the researchers noted in the journal .
But there is some evidence that it may also play a role in cancer control by modulating cell growth and death and by reducing the development of blood vessels to support tumor tissue .
Unfortunately , they said , epidemiological evidence -- mostly based on counting people 's dietary intake of vitamin D rather than taking blood circulating levels -- is inconclusive .
To fill the gap , they turned to the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition ( EPIC ) study , which is prospectively following 520,000 volunteers from 10 European countries .
Jenab and colleagues compared 1,248 people who developed colorectal cancer after enrollment with 1,248 controls who were disease - free .
Dietary and lifestyle data were obtained from questionnaires and researchers measured circulating vitamin D concentrations .
The researchers found :
There was a linear trend for colorectal cancer .
Those in the lower fifths of vitamin D levels significantly more likely to get the disease than those in higher fifths .
The same trend was seen for colon cancer but not rectal cancer .
Compared with volunteers with a mid-level concentrations , those in the lowest fifth had a 32 percent increased risk of colorectal cancer .
Higher concentrations were associated with lower risk .
The vitamin D concentration was associated with lower colorectal risk in a dose - response manner , the researchers reported .
The study 's strengths include its large size and prospective ( following a group of people before any got sick ) design , the researchers said .
Also levels of circulating vitamin D before a diagnosis of cancer were available for all participants .

This is an artist 's impression of a small Kuiper Belt Object ( KBO ) occulting a star .
NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope recorded this brief event and allowed astronomers to determine that the KBO was only one - half of a mile across , setting a new record for the smallest object ever seen in the Kuiper Belt .
In a cosmic version of the old needle - in - a - haystack finding , astronomers have spotted an object less than a mile wide that is 4.2 billion miles away , in the outer solar system .
The object is part of the Kuiper Belt , a ring of icy rocks beyond Neptune .
The object , spotted in visible light by the Hubble Space Telescope , is about 3,200 feet ( 975 meters ) across .
Previously , the smallest object seen via reflected visible light in the Kuiper Belt was 30 miles wide .
The discovery , though small , is the first observational evidence for a population of comet - sized bodies in the Kuiper Belt that are being ground down through collisions , astronomers said .
The Kuiper Belt is therefore collisionally evolving , meaning that the region 's icy content has been modified over the past 4.5 billion years , since the solar system was born .
Interestingly , the object is actually 100 times dimmer than Hubble can see directly .
So the discovery was made by using a trick of light .
Hubble has three optical instruments called Fine Guidance Sensors ( FGS ) that provide high - precision navigational information to the space observatory 's attitude control systems by looking at select guide stars for pointing .
Hilke Schlichting of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , Calif. , and her collaborators figured that the instruments ought to detect any object passing in front of a star , should such an occultation occur .
So they collected 12,000 hours worth of such Hubble data — covering 50,000 stars — that focused on the main plane of the solar system , where the Kuiper Belt objects should be .
Schlichting and her team found a single 0.3 - second - long occultation event .
They assumed the KBO was in a circular orbit around the sun and inclined 14 degrees to the ecliptic — the main plane of the solar system in which planets orbit .
The object 's distance was estimated from the duration of the occultation , and the amount of dimming was used to calculate the size of the object .
The discovery was announced in the Dec. 17 issue of the journal Nature .
Other observations , including some by Hubble , have shown that other stars are encircled by disks of debris that are also the leftovers of planet formation , as is the case with our Kuiper Belt , where some objects are as large as Pluto .
Over billions of years , debris in the disks should collide , and grind bigger objects down to smaller pieces , as has now been detected .
Sure , he may be uncomfortable with the impoverished , but we should just be proud of former President Bush for making is through this whole visit to Haiti without one of his trademark hilarious verbal goof - ups , like " we do n't torture . " )
Towards the end of World War 2 the Japanese military created and employed the `kaiten` , a manned suicide torpedo designed to blow up American ships with great accuracy .
At that point in the War Japan had suffered severe losses , was experiencing rapid decline in its industrial capacity compared to the US , and American troops were closing in on the home islands .
Surrender was out of the question , so Kaiten ( along with kamikaze planes ) were brought in to help tilt the balance .
Kaiten facility observation point .
` Kaiten` means `sky change` or `change of the heavens` , and it was hoped the little two - seater midget submarines would dramatically turn the tide of the war .
It was thought that manned guidance would ensure every kaiten was a hit , and since they were cheaply made and the pilots who steered them barely trained , it was hoped they would cause disproportionate amounts of damage .
Early designs incorporated an escape hatch that would allow pilots to bail out when the torpedo`s course was almost complete .
That hatch was removed in later versions though , leaving only the greater glory of the Emperor , great personal honor , and a post - mortem promotion of two ranks , as reward for making the ultimate sacrifice .
The project was almost an abject failure .
The kaiten were made too cheap to function well , and only a few American ships were confirmed sunk by them .
Many missed , detonated early , detonated late , or simply failed to explode .
Its hard to imagine the frustration and shame felt by the pilots who missed , and whose auto - detonation devices failed to work .
Since the kaitens were essentially single - use torpedos , they had no method of propulsion or steering .
Those that missed and failed to detonate would simply sink to the ocean floor like lead weights , probably cracking open due to poor construction before they reached any considerable depth , drowning the pilots inside .
Kaiten schematics .
Kaiten , along with kamikaze plane pilots , could be considered outgrowths of the infamous Japanese `banzai charge` , a notion deeply inbred into Japanese military and samurai culture .
Surrender was simply not an option .
When faced by a superior enemy , the answer was not to give in but to fight until every last man , woman and child was dead .
It`s a somewhat alien concept , but one that is hard not to respect .
They really thought they were the Empire of the Sun .
They really thought foreigners were evil devils .
They really believed their Emperor was a God .
They were prepared to die to protect his Empire , and did so in vast numbers .
There are arguments that the nuclear bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima were a necessary evil to force the Japanese Emperor into surrender , as had he not , the war could have continued on and on in guerrilla action until many more were dead .
Well , those are arguments proposed by others , and I don`t necessarily support them - I`m not an expert on the subject .
What I want to talk about is my brief foray into that world , to a ruined kaiten suicide boat facility on the coast of Kyushu .
SY and I went as the second haikyo on our recent Kyushu haikyo trip - the first being Kyu Nagasaki Prison .
The Kaiten base was a long cold walk from the train station , but well worth it .
Three main structures remained , haunted by an old fisherman at the edge of the gun-turret pier , catching fish after fish and dumping them into his plastic bucket .
We started off with the factory , a large two room stone hall where they built the torpedoes .
There was nothing left to indicate that anymore , certainly no schematics , no metal equipment , tools , only the stone walls and mechanic`s pits cut into the floor .
It wasn`t very big , scarcely as large as you`d expect a facility making mini-submarines to be .
It was open to the sky , quiet , and peaceful .
Looking through to the gun turret .
In the foreground are shallow pits , presumably to allow mechanics to get under the kaiten .
Second we walked up to the observation tower , once accessible by a metal bridge .
Now the bridge is long gone leaving an expanse of cold grey water between us and the ghosts of the islanded structure .
From there soldiers would man binoculars , searching the horizon for any sign of the incoming American fleet .
A pair of sneakers sat ominously beside this big hole .
Last was the gun-turret , the last line of defence against invasion .
SY chatted to the old guy fishing , who tried his best to explain to her what each building was for .
` Gyorai` , he said many times .
Only later did we learn that meant `torpedo` .
There`s the torpedo factory , here`s the gun-turret , there`s the observation tower .
Gun turret with observation tower in back .
Through a gun turret window .
SY chats to the old fellow with his bucket of fish .
All three almost in fish - eye ; factory , gun turret , observation post .
It got dusky as we left .
It was cold , and I found myself waiting for a shiver of recognition , that sense that you`re connecting to something .
Perhaps I felt it , I`m not sure .
The place is now weathered and barren , projecting more the level of impersonal ruin you see at an ancient druidic stone circle than anything recognizable as a station of modern war .
I wondered about how the men who had served here , who had trained here , who had boarded boats and submarines as kaiten pilots , would feel about me walking around now .
Taking photos of a facility symbolic of their country`s last grasp for victory .
Would they look forwards these 66 years and think -
“ I`m glad that`s all done with . ”
Or would they feel an inchoate rage that we were there at all ?
I wondered on this as SY chatted to the old fellow , who had a lot of fish in his bucket and was constantly adding more .
He was old enough to have been alive when this place was operational , old enough to have known the Emperor as a God .
I mused on this for a while .
It got coldr as the sun sank behind the clouds , and we decided to leave .
We smiled at the old fellow and thanked him for the information .
As we began to walk away he got up and offered us one of his fish .
We were touched .
It was still flopping in his hands .
We declined , because how would we cook a fish when we were staying at a hotel ?
He smiled as he seemed to realize this , nodded , then went back to his fishing .

I`ve been to in the galleries :

Rival colonies of bacteria can produce a lethal chemical that keeps competitors at bay , scientists report .
By halting the growth of nearby colonies and even killing some of the cells , groups of bacteria preserve scarce resources for themselves , even when the encroaching colony is closely related .
" It supports the notion that each colony is a superorganism , a multicellular organism with it's own identity , " said Eshel Ben-Jacob , an adjunct senior scientist at UC San Diego 's Center for Theoretical Biological Physics and professor of physics at Tel Aviv University .
Ben -Jacob and lead author Avraham Be'er of the University of Texas , Austin , and other colleagues at these institutions report their discovery in the early online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Alone in a dish , colonies of the bacterium Paenibacillus dendritiformis will send branches of cells in all directions .
But when forced to share a plate of limited nutrients with another colony , the branching patterns of both colonies become lopsided , leaving a space between the two .
It 's not a lack of food that halts the growth .
The researchers found nutrients in the gap , but they also found a protein there that was n't present elsewhere on the dish .
When they dabbed a bit of the purified protein on a fresh dish inoculated with P. dendritiformis , the bacteria formed a lopsided colony that shied away from the spot .
And the cells at the edge of the colony closest to the suspect protein were dead .
They named the protein " sibling lethal factor , " for its ability to kill even closely related colonies derived from a single original colony , and identified its gene .
But the gene made a protein that was too large , heavier that the lethal factor by two - thirds and harmless .
They concluded that some other factor must be in play .
Rather than guess , or poke about experimentally to figure out what was going on , Ben -Jacob and his colleagues created a model to guide their thinking .
" In physics , we use models to make predictions , " Ben -Jacob said , noting that biological models often present what is already understood .
The model told them that they should be looking for something that would prune the full - size factor to its smaller lethal form as the colonies began to compete , a factor that might be harmless or even helpful until it reached a certain threshold .
P. dendritiformis also secretes a protein called subtilisin , which promotes growth , except in high concentrations .
Subtilisin , which was already known and is available commercially , clipped the full - sized protein to the size of that found between competing colonies .
This smaller piece slices the bacteria cells open and spills their contents into the medium , they found .
" Very often , you discover that in order to explain what 's going on , you need to imagine mechanisms that are beyond what the biologists have specifically discovered about the system , " said Herbert Levine , a physics professor at UC San Diego who co-directs the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics , but was not involved in this study .
" In this work , they 've succeeded in taking the next step , " he said .
" They were able find the chemical messenger that is actually playing the role they hypothesized . "
MONTREAL
W hat would it take for Parliament to return to majority rule ?
If the new normal at the federal level is a deadlocked public opinion , can politics as usual ever provide either of the main parties with enough momentum to capture the 155 seats required to control the House of Commons ?
With the 10th anniversary of the last federal majority victory coming up in a few months , those two questions are increasingly being asked in public forums and in the partisan backrooms of Parliament Hill ( although not at next weekend 's Liberal thinkers ' conference . )
But there are not many shortcuts to a governing majority .
Together the NDP and the Bloc Québécois capture about one in four votes .
Under the current leaders , their combined support has rarely gone under 20 per cent .
If Jack Layton or Gilles Duceppe retired , their respective parties might take a hit in the following campaign .
But there is no lack of able ( bilingual ) aspirants for the NDP leadership .
In the absence of other factors – such as a backlash against a provincial NDP government in one or more major provinces – the core New Democrat vote would likely hold throughout a leadership transition .
While Duceppe 's caucus is star - challenged , its Parti Québécois partner has a number of up - and - comers who could find the prospect of leading a party in Parliament more alluring than waiting for an elusive cabinet seat in Quebec 's National Assembly .
While leaders matter , it is dangerous to overestimate their contribution to a party 's success .
For the record , the difference between the Bloc 's share of the Quebec vote score after Duceppe 's first accident - prone campaign in 1997 and the results of the last election amounts to a measly two - tenths of a percentage point
If the wheels fell off Michael Ignatieff 's campaign bus in the next campaign , the Conservatives might reap enough votes to reach their coveted majority .
But in the last election the Liberals ran under a leader who had difficulty communicating his message effectively in English and whose main platform staple was an unpopular tax and still the Conservatives could not secure a majority .
How much worse can the Liberal campaign be next time ?
A big scandal involving the Conservatives would almost certainly bring about a change in government .
But as with the sponsorship scandal in 2006 , there is no guarantee the substitute government would hold a majority .
All the above scenarios have one feature in common .
They rest on a circumstantial change in the fundamentals of the federal scene .
In the same fashion the Chrétien majorities were the product of the once - in - a- national - lifetime combination of a divided right and an Ontario backlash against the NDP .
A more structural approach to bringing back majority rule to the federal scene would involve a reorganization of the federalist forces that are to the left of the Conservatives on the political spectrum .
But many Liberals fear a rapprochement with the NDP would only drive more votes to the Conservatives and enable Stephen Harper to own the centre .
And more than a few New Democrats fear their voices would be drowned in the mix of an arrangement with the Liberals .
In comparison to a full - fledged merger , an electoral coalition would mitigate those risks but both require an amount of political will that is so far not in evidence within either party .
It was the fear of a Liberal sweep under Paul Martin and not the strategic genius of Stephen Harper or Peter MacKay that drove their two parties into each other 's arms in 2003 .
By all indications the Liberals and the NDP are not – at this point – desperate enough to think out of the box of their long - standing adversarial relationship .
Until they do , federal majority governments stand to be the exception rather than the rule .

Her column appears Monday , Wednesday and Friday .
AT&T Labs researcher David Johnson will receive this year ’s Knuth Prize from the ACM “ for his contributions to theoretical and experimental analysis of algorithms ” .
While Johnson is best known for his NP - Completeness book with Michael Garey , he has had an extraordinarily influential career in both the theory of approximation algorithms and in research on experimental evaluation of algorithms .
From the announcement :
The ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory ( SIGACT ) will present its 2009 Knuth Prize to David S. Johnson of AT&T Labs for his contributions to theoretical and experimental analysis of algorithms .
Johnson ’s innovations helped lay the foundation for algorithms used to address optimization problems , which involve the process of finding the best solution from all feasible solutions .
In addition , Johnson made many contributions to the early development of NP - completeness theory , which helps identify those problems that are hard to solve efficiently .
The Knuth Prize , named in honor of Donald Knuth of Stanford University who has been called the “ father ” of the analysis of algorithms , will be presented at the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing ( STOC ) June 6 - 8 , 2010 , in Cambridge , MA , where Johnson will present the Knuth Prize Lecture .
I got to know David almost 20 years ago when I agreed to coordinate one of his DIMACS Implementation Challenges .
This cooperation resulted in a book and , a decade later , a special issue of Discrete Applied Mathematics ( with Anuj Mehortra ) .
These Challenges are one of the ways David has explored issues in the evaluation of algorithms .
I had the chance recently to give a presentation on the effect of those Challenges .
David has had an enormous influence on me as I think about how to provide a firmer underpinning to the experimental analysis of algorithms and the way individuals and a field report on results .
This Prize makes me wish I had more time to spend on completing a planned system for reporting and confirming computational results .
I guess I am only surprised that David had n’t already won this prize !
Very well deserved .
A new analysis shows that a deadly mud volcano in Indonesia may not have been a natural disaster after all .
The research lends weight to the controversial theory that the volcano was caused by humans .
Villagers near Sidoarjo noticed a mud volcano beginning to erupt at 5 a.m. local time May 29 , 2006 .
It was about 500 feet from a local gas - exploration well .
Every day since then , the Lusi mud volcano has pumped out 100,000 tons of mud , or enough to fill 60 Olympic - size swimming pools .
It has now covered an area of almost 3 square miles to a depth of 65 feet .
Thirty thousand people have been displaced , and scientific evidence is mounting that the company drilling the well caused the volcano .
" The disaster was caused by pulling the drill string and drill bit out of the hole while the hole was unstable , " said Richard Davies , director of the Durham Energy Institute and co-author of a new paper in the journal Marine and Petroleum Geology , in a press release .
" This triggered a very large ' kick ' in the well , where there is a large influx of water and gas from surrounding rock formations that could not be controlled . "
Mud volcanoes can form in two different ways .
New fractures in rock that caps mud deposits can open , allowing the mud to rise to the surface if it 's under pressure .
Or , an earthquake can liquefy mud that then travels through pre-existing cracks to the surface .
Davies argues that the " kick " fractured the rock in the area , opening up new pathways for pressurized mud to come flowing up to the surface .
Davies ' team 's research uncovered new evidence from a drilling log that the drilling company , Lapindo Brantas , pumped drilling mud down their well to try to stop the mud volcano .
" This was partially successful , and the eruption of the mud volcano slowed down , " Davies said .
" The fact that the eruption slowed provides the first conclusive evidence that the bore hole was connected to the volcano at the time of eruption . "
The new paper came in response to a paper published by the company 's lead driller in the same journal .
Lapindo Brantas has long maintained that drilling did not cause the eruption .
Instead , the company claims an earthquake that occurred two days before and about 175 miles away did the damage .
Obviously , there are financial ramifications if the drilling company is found liable for the disaster .
The problem with the earthquake hypothesis is the stress changes caused by the quake would have been relatively small , too small to cause the volcano , said Davies ' co-author , University of California at Berkeley geologist Michael Manga .
" There is 1,000 times not enough energy to cause the eruption , " Manga said .
He was drawn into the controversy when the drilling company cited one of his papers on how earthquakes can cause mud volcanoes and have on 32 occasions .
But Manga noted that based on all the historical examples that scientists have , what the company claimed happened was impossible .
" So I wrote a one - page paper [ in 2007 ] saying it could not possibly have caused the mud volcano , " he said .
Other scientists came to similar conclusions , although some doubts remained .
An even stronger piece of evidence that the earthquake could not have created the mud volcano , Manga said , is that in the years before the quake , there were " bigger and closer earthquakes that did not cause an eruption . "
In fact , the stress changes associated with the tides are larger than the stresses caused by the earthquake that happened to strike two days before the mud volcano eruption began .
Still , the editor of the journal in which both the company 's paper and the Manga - Davies rebuttal was published said that it was possible that the same data could be subject to multiple interpretations .
" In geology , sometimes it 's not about being right or wrong , it 's about being reasonable or unreasonable , " said editor Octavian Catuneanu , geologist at the University of Alberta .
" The funny thing is that sometimes datasets can be interpreted by different people in different ways , and this leads to arguments and controversies . "
Still , there is a large financial incentive for Lapindo Barantas ' scientists to find that their company was not responsible .
" The drilling company cannot say anything different , right ? " Manga said .
But Catuneanu said that no matter who the scientists were working for , they still had to meet the scientific standards of the journal .
" I guess there would be some bias there , but as a journal editor , what I need to make sure is that the authors of an article stick to the science , " he said .
" If they want to have something publishable , they have to bring data and discuss it in a scientific manner . "
Lapindo Barantas could not be reached for comment .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A wary U.S. military prepared on Tuesday for an eventual repeal of its “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy barring gays from serving openly , but made clear movement should be gradual on the politically charged change requested by President Barack Obama .
The Pentagon will take at least a year to act .
Obama called for repeal of “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” in his State of the Union address last week , putting a spotlight on the hot - button issue before congressional elections in November and in the middle of efforts to get his budget through a skeptical Congress .
Many gay activists were frustrated last year that Obama had not moved quickly to carry out a promise to overturn “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell . ”
Gays and lesbians strongly backed Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who has voiced caution in the past against moving too quickly to repeal the policy , said he fully supported Obama ’s decision and announced a team of advisers to start reviewing steps the U.S. military would have to take to integrate openly gay servicemembers .
“ The question before us is not whether the military prepares to make this change , but how we best prepare for it , ” Gates told the Senate Armed Services Committee .
“ We received our orders from the commander in chief and we are moving out accordingly . ”
Americans favor allowing gays to serve openly in the military by a margin of 56 percent to 37 percent , according to an April poll of just over 2,000 registered voters by Quinnipiac University .
Support was higher among younger voters , although there was majority support in every age group .
Many top military officers and Republicans in Congress assert that having gays openly serve in uniform would undermine morale and discipline .
“ At this moment of immense hardship for our armed services , we should not be seeking to overturn the ‘ do n’t ask , do n’t tell policy , ” said Republican Senator John McCain , who was his party ’s presidential nominee and lost the 2008 election to Obama , a Democrat .

The internal Pentagon review , to be led by Army General Carter Ham and General Counsel Jeh Johnson , is expected to look at sensitive issues including how a change might affect unit cohesion , recruitment and retention , as well as the possibility of extending marriage and bereavement benefits to the partners of gay soldiers .
REVIEW BY END OF 2010
Gates said the review team would complete an implementation plan by the end of 2010 , but that additional time would be needed to carry out the panel ’s recommendations .
As an interim step , Gates said , the Pentagon would review existing policies within 45 days to determine how “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” could be enforced in a more “ humane and fair manner . ”
This could include halting disciplinary proceedings against gay members of the military who are “ outed ” by others .
Opponents of “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” say the policy is ineffective and unfair .
“ Speaking for myself and myself only , it is my personal and professional belief that allowing homosexuals to serve openly would be the right thing to do , ” the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , told the Senate panel .
“ I have served with homosexuals since 1968 , ” Mullen added .
“ Everybody in the military has . ”
The “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy was signed into law in 1993 by Democratic President Bill Clinton as a compromise after the military objected to his calls to open its doors to gays .
It bans openly gay people from serving in the military but prohibits military officials from initiating inquiries on sexual orientation when soldiers are abiding by the rules .
More than 13,500 members of the military have been dismissed under the law , according to the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network , an advocacy group that opposes the ban .

A right - wing blogger went through tax returns for Hannity 's Freedom Concerts , performances to raise money for veterans and their children .
She alleged that most of the money goes on lavish expenses .
The charity , and other bloggers , fought back .
Conservative fight !
The blogger , Debbie Schlussel , has some history with Hannity .
In 2007 she accused him of ripping off her reporting ( or something ) in this screed .
Schlussel says she was acting on a second - hand tip from a friend who had spoken to a friend at Fox News and alleged that , for the performances , Hannity got the use of " a Gulfstream 5 plane to fly him and his family / entourage to the concerts ; a " fleet " ( that 's the word the guy used ) of either Cadillac or Lincoln SUVs for him and his family / entourage ; and several suites at really expensive hotels for him and his family / entourage .
The promoter apparently values Hannity 's star demands at well over $ 200,000 per event . "
When she dug into the tax returns she found that in 2006 Freedom Alliance , the Oliver North - backed charity affiliated with the concerts , reported revenue of $ 10,822,785 .
But that only $ 397,900 , or 3.68 per cent , went to troops or the children of troops while 62 per cent " went to " expenses , " including $ 979,485 for " consultants " and an " advisor . " ...
The tax forms show that " New World Aviation " got paid $ 60,601 for " air travel . " ...
And finally , that year , Freedom Alliance spent $ 1,730,816 on postage and shipping and $ 1,414,215 on printing , for a total of $ 3,145,031 . "
She found similar patterns in the returns from 2007 and 2008 .
Freedom Alliance has issued a response denying all of Schlussel 's claims .
She counters that they 're now merely redefining the spending .
Other right - wing bloggers respond that the reason so little money has been paid out is that it 's being held in a college fund for the children of veterans .
It 's almost impossible , unless you 're an accountant or an expert on heated ' I love our troops more ' right - wing feuds , to figure out whether Hannity is corrupt or Schlussel has an axe to grind .
Or neither .
Or both .
But if you have any ( non-rant - based ) information to share , email at the address below .
UPDATE : The inevitable David Frum weighs in and backs ...
Hannity .
His case is fairly convincing .

BEIRUT , Lebanon  Police officers in Iran opened fire into crowds of protesters on Sunday , killing at least 10 people , witnesses and opposition Web sites said , in a day of chaotic street battles that threatened to deepen the country ’s civil unrest .
The protests , during the holiday commemorating the death of Imam Hussein , Shiite Islam ’s holiest martyr , were the bloodiest and among the largest since the uprisings that followed the disputed presidential election last June , witnesses said .
Hundreds of people were reported wounded in cities across the country , and the Tehran police said they had made 300 arrests .
One of the dead was Ali Moussavi , a 43 - year - old nephew of the opposition leader Mir Hussein Moussavi .
The decision by the authorities to use deadly force on the Ashura holiday infuriated many Iranians , and some said the violence appeared to galvanize more traditional religious people who have not been part of the protests so far .
Historically , Iranian rulers have honored Ashura ’s prohibition of violence , even during wartime .
Few machines represent
The Future like the flying car , and no publication has championed the fantasy more zealously than Popular Science .
Here 's a look back at its feverish , 77 - year - long vision .
Advertisement
When Google Books announced that it had archived 137 years of Popular Science , we got giddy .
With the exception of the unrelated Popular Mechanics , PopSci is as Jalop as mass - market magazines get — a bright - eyed , optimistic look at the art of the gearhead possible .
( Full disclosure :
They did n't pay us to say that .
We just like rocket - powered cars and levitating trains and such . )
And while a host of different vehicles have graced the magazine 's cover , only one kind of machine has kept us coming back for more .
We are hopelessly in love with the flying car .
Walk through the gallery to read more of the story .
A perpetual beacon of bright and shiny Future Hope , the airborne auto refuses to go away .
It is what a college professor of mine once called an " impossible possible " — it 's technically doable , but it 's also logistically unworkable .
Like the bacon - wrapped , deep - fried Twinkie , the flying car seems doomed to be both tantalizingly close ( all we need is a bucket of hot oil a plane with four wheels ! ) and disturbingly out of reach .
( Just what does " third heart attack of the week " " crappy plane , crappier car " mean ? )
Advertisement
Still , that dichotomy is what keeps the concept alive .
A GBooks / Popular Science search for the phrase " flying car " brings up 28 issues of the magazine that contain the term .
The articles are fascinating largely because they reflect the eras in which they were written : Wartime articles are filled with guarded optimism , mid-century stories bubble over with good cheer , and modern pieces offer a more careful , analytical approach .
One of the earliest features , from May of 1933 , refers to a levitating railway car .
The most recent one , from October of 2008 , refers to a " driving airplane . "
Both are filled with the same sense of giddy wonder .

But as the nation changed , so changed the fantasy .
While the middle part of twentieth century saw America trade its technological innocence for a reasoned , weary skepticism , the flying car remained .
What began as a disconnected flight of fancy — a " Hey , look !
We can do this ! " moment — evolved into a more practical approach to the transportation problem .
Advertisement
Predictably , the concept is held dear by car enthusiasts .
We spend our lives constrained by traffic and artificial pathways , reined in by a host of factors outside our control .
Airplanes can set us free , but they are complex , intimidating beasts ; a car that can fly is somehow more approachable .
We find ourselves ignoring the idea 's obvious flaws because the possibilities are so fantastically cool .
Advertisement
Why does this matter ?
Why are we continually drawn to an idea almost universally acknowledged to be a non-starter ?
The reason is simple :
It 's in our bones .
Americans are a restless people , and the airborne car builds upon the dream of manifest destiny .
It represents untapped possibility and the notion that our world still offers , after centuries of development , a new kind of freedom .
( General aviation also promises this , but we tend to fool ourselves into thinking that a flightworthy car would be more affordable and require less training to operate . )
And although the dream is not new , it refuses to flicker and dim : According to a recent MSNBC poll , 90 percent of the country would buy a flying car if given the chance .
" Why is the airborne car such an enduring dream ?
There 's something tantalizing about the freedom of a personal transportation device unhampered by roads or traffic , particularly in a world where gridlock and invasive airport - security checks have become the norm .
If history is any guide , we 'll be seeing a slew of new personal levitating devices in coming years — if nowhere else , then in the pages of [ this magazine ] . " — Adam Voiland , Popular Science
Perpetual optimism :
It 's what America was built on , and neither PopSci nor our air - car dream would exist without it .
We endorse that kind of thinking — heck , the phrase " flying cars " was once part of this site 's motto — even if it fails to produce results .
In other words , we 'll keep looking to the skies .
Asphalt bonds , however strong , can't hold us forever .

I did not know that 420 info , but I do know this ;
After many decades of fighting this same war on illegal drugs ; it would be safer , faster and much cheaper to end this war by legalizing the drugs .
The worst resistance would come from the drug cartels and the terrorist networks in the Middle - East .
Without the illegal drug industry funding the terrorists , this global war on terror could end much sooner .
At the same time for just a few more years ( not decades ) the United States will still have to continue clearing up the mess by the once illegal drugs ; the same way as usual , with tax - payer funded drug rehabs , including heroine or methadone babies and their medical costs etc .
Our society needs to get more faith in itself , because in the Middle - East where it is much easier to get heroin than it is to get clean drinking water , they are not a society of drug addicts .
This would also cut off the funded government corruption in the Middle East , Mexico and the United States .
In time this will also solve many other problems in our economy especially the cost and availability of health care .
The repercussions this would help to create for a few years ( not decades ) is one of the best examples of why our forefathers emphasized so strongly on the necessity of separation between the church and state .
Perhaps only in California could a group of marijuana smokers call themselves fiscal realists .
And yet , faced with a $ 20 billion deficit , strained state services and regular legislative paralysis , voters in California are now set to consider a single - word solution to help ease some of the state ’s money troubles : legalize .
On Wednesday , the California secretary of state certified a November vote on a ballot measure that would legalize , tax and regulate marijuana , a plan that advocates say could raise $ 1.4 billion and save precious law enforcement and prison resources .
Indeed , unlike previous efforts at legalization — including a failed 1972 measure in California — the 2010 campaign will not dwell on assertions of marijuana ’s harmlessness or its social acceptance , but rather on cold cash .
“ We need the tax money , ” said Richard Lee , founder of Oaksterdam University , a trade school for marijuana growers , in Oakland , who backed the ballot measure ’s successful petition drive .
“ Second , we need the tax savings on police and law enforcement , and have that law enforcement directed towards real crime . ”
Supporters are hoping to raise $ 10 million to $ 20 million for the campaign , primarily on the Internet , with national groups planning to urge marijuana fans to contribute $ 4.20 at a time , a nod to 420 , a popular shorthand for the drug .
The law would permit licensed retailers to sell up to one ounce at a time .
Those sales would be a new source of sales tax revenue for the state .
Opponents , however , scoff at the notion that legalizing marijuana could somehow help with the state ’s woes .
They tick off a list of social ills — including tardiness and absenteeism in the workplace — that such an act would contribute to .
“ We just do n’t think any good is going to come from this , ” said John Standish , president of the California Peace Officers Association , whose 3,800 members include police chiefs and sheriffs .
“ It ’s not going to better society .
It ’s going to denigrate it . ”
The question of legalization , which a 2009 Field Poll showed 56 percent of Californians supporting , will undoubtedly color the state race for governor .
The two major Republican candidates — the former eBay chief executive Meg Whitman and the insurance commissioner , Steve Poizner — have said they oppose the bill .
Jerry Brown , the Democratic attorney general who is also running for governor , opposes the idea as well , saying it violates federal law .
And while the Obama administration has signaled that it will tolerate medical marijuana users who abide the law in the 14 states where it is legal , a law authorizing personal use would conflict with federal law .
Supporters of the bill say the proposal ’s language would allow cities or local governments to opt out , likely creating “ dry counties ” in some parts of the state .
The proposed law would allow only those over 21 to buy , and would ban smoking marijuana in public or around minors .
Stephen Gutwillig , the California state director for the Drug Policy Alliance , a New York - based group that plans to raise money in favor of the measure , said he expected “ a conservative implementation , ” if passed .
“ I think most local jurisdictions are not going to authorize sales , ” Mr. Gutwillig said .
Local opt - out provisions are part of a strategy to allay people ’s fears about adding another legal vice and to help capture a group considered key to passing the bill : non-pot - smoking swing voters .
“ There ’s going to be a large sector of the electorate that would never do this themselves that ’s going to sort out what the harm would be versus what the supposed good would be , ” said Frank Schubert , a longtime California political strategist who opposes the bill .
“ That ’s where the election is going to be won . ”
But Dan Newman , a San Francisco - based strategist for the ballot measure , said he expected broad , bipartisan support for the bill , especially among those Californians worried about the recession .
“ Voters ’ No. 1 concern right now is the budget and the economy , ” Mr. Newman said , “ which makes them look particularly favorable at something that will bring in more than $ 1 billion a year . ”
Opponents , however , question that figure — which is based on a 2009 report from the Board of Equalization , which oversees taxes in the state — and argue that whatever income is brought in will be spent dealing with more marijuana - related crimes .
Mr. Standish said : “ We have a hard enough time now with drunk drivers on the road .
This is just going to add to the problems . ”
He added : “ I can not think of one crime scene I ’ve been to where people said , ‘ Thank God the person was just under the influence of marijuana . ’ ”
Advocates of the measure plan to counter what is expected to be a strong law enforcement opposition with advertisements like one scheduled to be broadcast on radio in San Francisco and Los Angeles starting on Monday .
The advertisements will feature a former deputy sheriff saying the war on marijuana has failed .
“ It ’s time to control it , ” he concludes , “ and tax it . ”
Not everyone in the community is supportive .
Don Duncan , a co-founder of Americans for Safe Access , which lobbies for medical marijuana , said he had reservations about the prospect of casual users joining the ranks of those with prescriptions .
“ The taxation and regulation of cannabis at the local or state level may or may not improve conditions for medical cannabis patients , ” Mr. Duncan said in an e-mail message .
He added that issues like “ police harassment and the price and quality of medicine might arise if legalization for recreational users occurs . ”
Still , the idea of legal marijuana does not seem too far - fetched to people like Shelley Kutilek , a San Francisco resident , loyal church employee and registered California voter , who said she would vote “ yes ” in November .
“ It ’s no worse than alcohol , ” said Ms. Kutilek , 30 , an administrator at Metropolitan Community Church of San Francisco .
“ Drunk people get really belligerent .
I do n’t know anybody who gets belligerent on marijuana .
They just get chill . ”

An archaeological mystery in a half - ton lead coffin

In the ruins of a city that was once Rome 's neighbor , archaeologists last summer found a 1,000 - pound lead coffin .
Who or what is inside is still a mystery , said Nicola Terrenato , the University of Michigan professor of classical studies who leads the project --- the largest American dig in Italy in the past 50 years .
The sarcophagus will soon be transported to the American Academy in Rome , where engineers will use heating techniques and tiny cameras in an effort to gain insights about the contents without breaking the coffin itself .
" We 're very excited about this find , " Terrenato said .
" Romans as a rule were not buried in coffins to begin with and when they did use coffins , they were mostly wooden .
There are only a handful of other examples from Italy of lead coffins from this age --- the second , third or fourth century A.D.
We know of virtually no others in this region . "
This one is especially unusual because of its size .
" It 's a sheet of lead folded onto itself an inch thick , " he said .
" A thousand pounds of metal is an enormous amount of wealth in this era .
To waste so much of it in a burial is pretty unusual . "
Was the deceased a soldier ?
A gladiator ?
A bishop ?
All are possibilities , some more remote than others , Terrenato said .
Researchers will do their best to examine the bones and any " grave goods " or Christian symbols inside the container in an effort to make a determination .
" It 's hard to predict what 's inside , because it 's the only example of its kind in the area , " Terrenato said .
" I 'm trying to keep my hopes within reason . "
Human remains encased in lead coffins tend to be well preserved , if difficult to get to .
Researchers want to avoid breaking into the coffin .
The amount of force necessary to break through the lead would likely damage the contents .
Instead , they will first use thermography and endoscopy .
Thermography involves heating the coffin by a few degrees and monitoring the thermal response .
Bones and any artifacts buried with them would have different thermal responses , Terrenato said .
Endoscopy involves inserting a small camera into the coffin .
But how well that works depends on how much dirt has found its way into the container over the centuries .
If these approaches fail , the researchers could turn to an MRI scan --- an expensive option that would involve hauling the half - ton casket to a hospital .
The dig that unearthed this find started in summer 2009 and continues through 2013 .
Each year , around 75 researchers from around the nation and world , including a dozen U - M undergraduate students , spend two months on the project at the ancient city of Gabii ( pronounced " gabby " ) .
The site of Gabii , situated on undeveloped land 11 miles east of Rome in modern - day Lazio , was a major city that pre-dates Rome but seems to have waned as the Roman Empire grew .
Studying Gabii gives researchers a glimpse into pre-Roman life and offers clues to how early Italian cities formed .
It also allows them broader access to more substantial archaeological layers or strata .
In Rome , layers of civilization were built on top of each other , and archaeologists are not able or allowed to disturb them .
" In Rome , so often , there 's something in the way , so we have to get lucky , " Terrenato said .
" In Gabii , they should all be lucky spots because there 's nothing in the way . "
Indeed , Terrenato and others were surprised to find something as significant as this coffin so soon .
" The finding of the lead coffin was exhilarating , " said Allison Zarbo , a senior art history major who graduates this spring .
Zarbo did n't mind that after the researchers dug up the coffin once , they had to pile the dirt back on to hide it from looters overnight .
" The fact that we had to fill the hole was not so much of a burden as a relief ! " Zarbo said .
" For academia to lose priceless artifacts that have been found fully in context would be very damaging to our potential knowledge . "
Students spent most of their time pick - axing , shoveling , and manning the wheelbarrows , said Bailey Benson , a junior who is double majoring in classical archaeology and art history .
" By the end of the day , not even a 20 - minute shower can remove all the dirt and grime you get covered in , " Benson said .
" It 's hard but satisfying work .
How many people can say they uncovered an ancient burial ? "
President Obama said he does not think the public option has the votes :
In a private meeting at the White House this afternoon , Obama told a roomful of House Dems he does n’t think the votes are there to pass the public option , and urged them to take the long view and to support the Senate bill as merely the beginning of reform , Dem Rep Lynn Woolsey tells me .
The Plum Line : Obama Tells Liberals Public Option Does n’t Have Votes
We can still try , though .
I believe the House should pass the senate bill and the recon bill .
This will help people .
The more important point to me is that the President endorsed the left advocacy of people like Woolsey .
Some here may say it is only " lip service " and I have no way of seeing into Barack Obama 's heart .
Many people have been alienated in this fight .
Some see the Democrats are permanently corrupted and seek a third party where none seems to exist .
Like some felt in 2000 and joined the Green Party .
These are people of good faith and their choice is one not made lightly .
Some others here see " progressives " or " leftists " as the problem and seek to eliminate or diminish their influence .
Many of these people are also people of good faith and do not come to their positions lightly .
I supported a different candidate in the primaries ( John Edwards ) who had great positions on many issues as I saw them , and who subequent events have shown to be unqualified to be president because of personal ( not policy ) failings .
Those battles were hard in 2007 and January 2008 .
I was part of the primary wars .
Even then , though , I saw more overlap between Obama and my beliefs than I did with other candidates ( excluding Kucinich I suppose ) .
I did see Obama as a decent person .
I saw him as left of center , not as left as Edwards ' rhetoric and issue positions , but left of center .
At the end of those primary wars , it took me months to endorse Obama , partly because I was waiting on Edwards endorsement , but mostly because of the resentments I had with some Obama supporters .
The anger and frustration I had with some people influenced my views .
That was a mistake , but I am human .
We have just been through a version of those wars .
We will lose some people on either side of the divide I described above , and I do n't think that is good , but it may be inevitable .
My hope is we can create a coalition , a popular front as Meteor Blades calls it , around the beliefs we do share and in opposition to the radical right wing that controls the Republican Party .
And we will fight again .
It is in the nature of a coalition where left and center come together .
( The center really is in the Democratic Party because the Republicans are dominated by the extreme right wing .
Goldwater and Reagan won and the Rockerfeller Republicans have long migrated into the Democratic Party , just as southern racists inhabit the Republican Party ) .
So we will have disputes again and fight and be angry .
It is the nature of Dkos .
I suspect these words will be forgotten , but they matter to me :
Obama thanked the assembled , mostly liberals , for their ongoing insistence from the left over the months that the bill be improved , Woolsey says .
" He thanked us , " she recalled .
" He said the bill would n’t have been nearly as good as it is if we had n’t advocated . "
Namaste and peace .
Let 's pass the senate bill and reconciliation bill and help people .
And keep fighting for the public option .
My only feeling on this is that if we cannot get the PO , we should still pass the bills we can get .

BBC News , Garissa district , Kenya
Under the shade of a thorny tree in the small Kenyan village of Saka Junction , students sit learning the alphabet - spelled out in the sand using goat droppings .
" Teachers are supposed to be innovative , " says Abdi Salat of Garissa district 's education office .
" The teacher has to use goat droppings and wild fruits and all these things at his disposal as his teaching aids . "
Herding livestock is the daily activity for children in these nomadic pastoralist communities .
For that reason hundreds of thousands of Kenyan children are missing out on an entire education .
Now there are efforts to change that :
If the children cannot go to the schools , then take the schools to the children .
Scorpion sting
With no walls to display any visual aids the teacher , Hassan Farah , had pinned a few posters to the twigs of the tree to help with the English lesson .
If it was not for me they would not have gone to school
Hassan Farah
" We had more posters up yesterday , " he says .
" But it rained last night and a few were washed away . "
The children operate a shift system - lessons in the early morning are followed by a stint looking after the animals and then they return for another class in the late afternoon .
These children no longer have to make a choice between their nomadic lifestyle and an education - they can do both .
" I really enjoy this job as I am from the same community and I want to help these children , " says Mr Farah , who teaches a total of 57 students - two - thirds of them boys .
" If it was not for me they would not have gone to school . "
Outdoor lessons do throw up the occasional unexpected problem .
Halfway through the class , one young boy started screaming and clutching his right foot .
" He was stung by a scorpion and most of them here are poisonous , " says Mr Farah .
" But with our traditional medicine he 'll be all right in a couple of hours . "
In addition to the mobile schools , Mr Farah suggests a mobile clinic would also be a great help .
Donkey promised Just in front of the school several women were building a home - a dome shaped shelter made from flexible sticks tied together with rope which is then covered in thatch .
Adan wants to work in Nairobi - a major change in lifestyle
It took just a few hours to put up and it was clear that the women , in their long bright dresses and head scarves , had done this plenty of times before .
Whenever a drought hits , they pack up their homes , load up the camels and move nearer pasture and water .
The plan is that the teacher will go with them and look for another shady tree to set up his classroom .
" We want to give them education according to their culture , according to their way of living , " says the education office 's Mr Salat .
" Once we move them to the villages , this is displacing them and we do not want to do that .
" We have to reach them where they are and then they continue with their normal lives . "
He says Mr Farah will soon be receiving a donkey and cart to allow him to keep up with his students whenever they relocate .
The teacher is waiting on a long list of promises .
He has not been paid in months .
Cultural threat ?
There are 10 of these schools in Garissa district and each year some of their students will head off to board in government primary schools .
The teachers now follow nomadic communities " I want to continue at another school and then become a teacher in Nairobi , " says 10 - year - old Adan , speaking the Somali language , much to the amusement of several of the village elders .
Some fear that Adan 's dream of heading to the bright lights of the Kenyan capital is a sign that the days of these nomadic pastoralist communities are numbered .
But not everyone agrees .
" This school is a good idea because we are moving away from ignorance , " says Zainab Sahal , as she puts the finishing touches to the frame of her new home .
" Education has been brought closer to us .
We have to appreciate that .
It 's good that one of our own people is teaching here and our children are now gaining knowledge .
" I have no fear of our way of life dying out .
These children are our children .
When they go to town they will come back .
So long as we are in the villages wherever they go they will come back . "

Texas Sen .
Kay Bailey Hutchison is at risk of finishing third in next month ’s Republican gubernatorial primary , according to a Public Policy Polling survey that shows tea party favorite Debra Medina rapidly gaining ground on Hutchison and incumbent Gov. Rick Perry .
Perry leads Hutchison by 11 points in the poll , 39 percent to 28 percent , but Medina registers nearly a quarter of the primary vote , drawing 24 percent .
The numbers are similar to a Rasmussen Reports survey that showed Perry with a 44 percent to 29 percent lead over Hutchison last week , with Medina ’s vote growing to 16 percent .
While Perry and Hutchison have spent millions on their campaigns to date , the underfunded Medina has relied on two strong televised debate performances to draw attention to her insurgent bid .
A former volunteer for Texas Rep. Ron Paul ’s presidential campaign , Medina has presented herself as an outsider and down - the - line conservative .

If there 's one trend that we hope both The Losers and Kick - Ass will jumpstart , it 's one where British comic creators get their due in Hollywood .
Particularly because that could lead to these 2000 AD movies we 've always longed for ...

Yes , yes ; Judge Dredd is about to get his second chance at big screen stardom ( And much - deserved it is , too , considering the mess that was made of his first try ) but , as good as John Wagner 's political and social satire with added pyrotechnics is , it 's really only a taster of what 2000 AD has to offer cinema .
Here are some other movies that Tharg The Mighty 's " Galaxy 's Greatest Comic " could give to the world :

Robo - Hunter
Man versus machine ... literally .
The original comic was essentially " Clint Eastwood as wise - cracking hard - ass private dick in a world populated by robots of every variety from killer to comedic , accompanied by two robotic sidekicks - one of whom is his talking cigar " and , aside from changing the words " Clint Eastwood " to , say , " Will Smith , " there 's very little about that that does n't sound like a summer blockbuster waiting to happen .

Rogue Trooper
Blue - skinned genetically engineered soldiers fighting a future war ...
Wait , why did n't this comic strip claim that Avatar was ripping it off ?
2000 AD 's archetypal future war series pitched a macho pacifism as one lone clone ( Well , aside from his talking , sentient equipment , given the personalities of his fallen comrades ) tried to find out who was behind the intergalactic war while staying alive in a universe where everyone wanted him dead .
Give it a good special effects budget , and step back to watch the box office dollars roll in .

The Vatican 's top supernatural exorcist is a vampire .
He also has a body like Pumping Iron - era Schwarzenegger , a face ( and personality ) like Terry Thomas , and a tendency to find himself in the middle of all manner of supernatural trouble at any given moment .
This Judge Dredd spin-off has the potential to be the crossover between Saw and St. Trinians that cinema has always waited for .

Which part of " Johnny Alpha is a mutant who travels through time and space tracking down the most evil men in existence ( including , at one point , Hitler ) armed with sci - fi weaponary and accompanied by a giant trash - talking Viking " does n't make you wish that this were playing at your local theater right now ?
Because , let me tell you :
That part of you needs to be surgically removed as soon as possible .

ABC Warriors
Heavy Metal Carnage to rival Michael Bay 's secret Transformer fantasies could be the key to ABC Warriors ' cinematic success .
Another future war story , the Warriors were created for battles no human could withstand ( Their name comes from their ability to survive Atomic , Bacterial and Chemical warfare ) on Mars , but the series outlasted its original " bigotry , even anti-robot bigotry , is wrong " morality to see the Warriors strike out on their own and discover their true identities beyond their original programming .
Dollhouse meets Transformers , perhaps ...?

Flesh
Start with giant dinosaurs and then add in time travel , robot policing and social satire about our diets and need for ghoulish entertainment , and you have Flesh , one of 2000 AD 's first ever strips .
Set in a prehistoric past where dinosaurs are farmed for their meat by time - traveling cowboys who employ android lawmen and allow tourist trips to earn some extra income , it 's Ray Bradbury 's " A Sound of Thunder " crossed with Food , Inc. and Jurassic Park .
Someone give Steven Spielberg a call .

The Ballad of Halo Jones
Arguably Alan Moore 's first classic ( and with great art by Ian Gibson ) , Halo was created as a " girl 's comic " alternative to the boys - own atmosphere of the rest of 2000 AD , and chronicled one woman 's journey outside of the passive , pressimistic hedonism of mainstream culture to war and beyond .
Although unfinished , due to a disagreement over rights , there 's more than enough material in for someone - preferably a director with a strong eye for visuals - to make an impressive , if off - kilter , classic movie .

If ever there was a movie role Lady Gaga was born to play , it 's this pop culture iconoclast ( and part - lizard lady ) who starts out as a genetic thief creating clones of celebrities from stolen DNA before mixing careers as cause célèbre artistic sensation and freelance adventurer ...
Oh , and then her reality has to get shutdown and rebooted , leaving her as a nun who happens to have unparalleled skill with heavy weaponry .
Imagine The Hitchhikers ' Guide To The Galaxy as written by Bret Easton Ellis , William Gibson and the cast of Project Runway , and you can see why this movie needs to be the science fiction alternative to Sex And The City 2 .

Nikolai Dante
Take everything awesome about the very idea of " swashbuckling " - Grand romance , dashing swordfights with bravado and grinning heroes , and corrupt familial dynasties that need bringing down - and place them in a distant future filled with a resurgent Russian empire and genetically - modified humans with special superpowers , and you have the world of Nikolai Dante .
If Hollywood can't make a success of a science fictional version of old Errol Flynn movies with added sex and a bigger budget , it 's possibly time they just packed up en masse and went home .

Okay , I admit it - I included this one just to see the lawyers in the audience get pale , considering the legal status of this series is murky , at best ; the series that made Grant Morrison 's name may begin like a British Watchmen , but with a parallel - earth spanning war between superheroes , celebrity culture meltdown and Lovecraftian demons all coming into play before the story is done , there 's a lot more to this series than another tired take on " real life " superheroes .
Also , considering the amount of superheroes - turned - popstars in the storyline , imagine the potential for a killer soundtrack .
Flashback Friday .
I just have to say “ wow ” to this ad for Quartz counter tops , sent it by Lisa Ray of Parents for Ethical Marketing and Corporate Babysitter :
The ad depicts a little girl fantasizing about growing up , but growing up means ( extremely ) high patent leather pumps ; growing up means sexualizing herself .
And the ad does sexualize the little girl who , from the top - scanning - down , looks like a sweet girl trying on mommy ’s shoes , but from the bottom - scanning - up , looks like an adult woman who suddenly transforms into a child .
The white cotton dress implies innocence and purity , but it ’s a costume we regularly see adult women wear when we want to both sexualize and infantilize them .
In other words , this ad nicely plays into the mythology endorsed by pedophiles that even little girls want to feel sexy , even little girls want men ’s attention , even little girls want sex .
And , yet , we are supposed to think this is sweet .
The text , “ Harmonizing Beautifully with Life ” is , of course , ostensibly about the counter tops .
But aligned with the image , it naturalizes both the girl ’s fantasy and the conflation of female sex with the performance of sexualized femininity ( it ’s just “ life ” ; as if there ’s a gene for Christian Louboutin shoes that activates in the presence of double X chromosomes ) .
More than simply naturalizing the girl ’s fantasy of self - objectification , it endorses it ( it ’s beautiful harmony ) .
Notice also the class story in the ad .
Who exactly is class privileged enough to have the freedom to allow “ the quiet moments ” to “ steal the show ” ?
Well , apparently people who are rich enough to wear Louboutin shoes .
Louboutin began putting red soles on all his shoes as a not - so - subtle way to advertise that the shoe was Louboutin and , therefore , a very expensive shoe .
It worked .
Fashion writers started pointing out the red soles with glee , as in this story about Angeline Jolie on a red carpet .
The fact that the sole of this shoe is red is no accident , it ’s meant to add class to the counter tops , in both senses of the word .
A final word on race :
That the girl in the ad is white is no accident .
And it ’s not only because marketers expect the majority of their customers to be white , but because of what whiteness represents .
Her white skin symbolizes the same thing that the white counter tops and white dress symbolize : purity , cleanliness , even innocence .
It is only because all those symbolic elements are there that we can put a black patent leather heel with a red sole on her and still think “ sweet . ”
Imagine the same ad with a black child .
In the U.S. , black women are often stereotyped as sexually loose , morally corrupt , irresponsible teen mothers on welfare .
With that symbolic baggage , this ad would be a morality lesson on the hypersexuality of black girls and their propensity to “ grow up too fast . ”
It would n’t look sweet , it ’d look dangerous .
“ Harmonizing beautifully , ” indeed .

Dec. 18 , 2009 -- Marijuana is the most widely used illegal drug in the U.S. , but little is known about the genes that influence its use .
Now new research suggests that many of the same genetic factors that lead people to drink alcohol also lead them to smoke marijuana .
Researchers interviewed 2,761 sets of identical and fraternal twins in their mid-20s to mid-30s about their use of alcohol and marijuana .
They found little overlap between the environmental factors that influences alcohol and marijuana use , but significant overlap in the genetic factors driving use of the two substances .
" We wanted to know if the same genes that affect risk for alcohol dependence also affect risk for marijuana dependence , " study researcher Carolyn E. Sartor , PhD , tells WebMD .
" Twin studies like this one help us understand how much of a given trait is traceable to genetics or environment . "
Dependence on Alcohol and Marijuana The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that 21 million Americans aged 12 or older , or about one in 10 people , abuse or are addicted to drugs or alcohol .
Of the nearly 7 million people who were classified as dependent on drugs other than alcohol , roughly 4 million abuse marijuana .
According to one study , between 8 % and 12 % of marijuana users are considered dependent on the drug , meaning that they use the drug compulsively even though it often interferes with family , school , work , and recreational activities .
Twin studies are conducted to better understand how genes influence behaviors by comparing the actions of identical twins , who have identical genes , with those of fraternal twins , who share just some genes .
Results from earlier twin studies , suggest that between 50 % and 60 % of the variance in alcohol dependence can be explained by genetic factors .
Studies also suggest that genes play a major role in marijuana dependence and dependence on other drugs .
Common Genes Drive Dependence
The newly published study included 2,761 twin pairs and 736 people who were not twins enrolled in an Australian twin registry .
All were between the ages of 24 and 36 when interviewed .
Based on their responses , researchers concluded that over 60 % of the variance in alcohol and marijuana use and marijuana dependence could be linked to genes .
The study appears online today and will be published in the March issue of Alcoholism : Clinical & Experimental Research .
" We found considerable overlap between the genes that contribute to marijuana dependencies and alcohol use and dependence , " Sartor says .
Other researchers are working to identify specific genes that influence substance use and abuse .
" What we know from studies like this one is there are many genes working together , " substance abuse researcher Christian Hopfer , MD , of the University of Colorado School of Medicine tells WebMD .
He says the findings add support to the idea that common genes play a role in all substance abuse .
Sagging Skin
Growing old is natural .
The aging people feel and experience very difficult phenomenon .
The bones start weakening , the movements slow down , and gray hair turns white with need for glasses and hearing aids .
Another prominent factor that confirms and shows all ages is sagging skin .
The skin loosens and hangs as the muscles slack down .
The wrinkles and deep lines on facial skin grow deeper with the advancing age .
The old age takes its toll starting with fore head wrinkles .
The feet and heals start splintering and lastly a sagging skin is obvious on our faces .
The remedies for old age “ Defects ” cannot reverse the aging process in any way .
It is natural to grow old decay and vanish to make room for new generation to take over .
Scientific research and technology advancement has derived certain ways to improve the sagging skin outlook artificially .
These dos not undo old age but makes people look reasonably younger .
These techniques involved experience medical treatments and cosmetic surgeries .
The painful injections and chemical peels undertaken have serious side effects , rendering them often inadvisable , particularly in diabetic patients .
Further all these treatments were cost heavily very few people could afford these .
These days the research is directed on the very important aspect to solve the problem of affordability .
The latest research has discovered the elements in the skin that keep it stick .
The first step in this regard is to change your approach to “ prevent ” sagging skin than to cure it .
Once you are conscious of the factors that promote sagging skin , you can be confident to have slowed this aging riddle by half already .
You can bow delay the process of aging by continuous skin care , mostly by un-costly practices and some vitamin intake regulation .
Read carefully what follows :
Smoking
Smoking effects health badly .
The damage to mouth , teeth and lungs is carried further to the rest of the body by blood transfer , and is injurious to health .
Our skin needs nutrition to stay healthy .
So discourage smoking steadily as immediate reversal is difficult .
Increase water for skin hydration
Your daily water intake should be about 8 glasses of fresh water .
The skin stays moisturized and soft .
The pores and hair roots keep flushing away toxics through swetilng .
The hydrated skin muscles keep the skin tight and flexible .
The colored drinks , coffee and tea cause dehydration .
You can rely on pure water and herbal teas to help out .
To make tasty drinks add orange and lemon slices to water , with or without sugar .
Wash your face at bedtime
Bedtime wash clears the facial skin pores that could cause skin infections .
Rub your skin gently to dislocate dirt and grease .
Hard rubbing and dragging can damage skin tissues when pores are blocked by makeup or dirt .
Do it daily to prevent sagging skin .
Sunbathing or sun tanning
Direct sunlight for long hours affects skin adversely causing skin aging .
Excessive direct exposure could cause skin cancer .
Therefore you sunbathe in small spurts or use sunscreen of SPF 15 or above to avoid unhealthy side effects , growing old is natural but is better to look great in late years without sagging skin .
Use skin care better products adequately .
Rely on natural preventions .
Loose weight slowly
Our skin is elastic and restores tightness steadily .
Pregnancies and overweight bungles stretch the skin .
Skin loosened in child births restore comparatively quicker by natural shrinking .
The sagging problem occurs when tummy bulges of permanent nature are reduced in days .
The fast weight reduction eats away some muscle tissues under the skin along with fats .
Therefore shrink process is slow as the body rebuilds the tensioning muscles along with the shrinking .
So it is best to rid obesity steadily and let the relaxed gain strength to adjust to new shape .
Forget 50 lbs off in 3 months ads and stick to exercises and steady dieting for reducing .
Remember your skin becomes less elastic with age .
When you feel you have to do it , then plan it out at early age .
You will have better results with less effort .
Some spend thrifts prefer to consume everything first , become bulging hippos and then spend again on costly medicines , diets and bulge reducing methods and finally on curve of side effects too .
Nutrition rich food intake
Choose foods that have less sugar content but high in minerals and vitamins .
This will keep your skin nourished and elastic .
Avoid junk food , whether small .

Tomorrow .
We Love You .
Tomorrow .
Two weeks ago , the prophet Sawyer foretold what you see before you .
While this is a preview post , the author has been inhabited by a darker , more sinister spirit : me ( Charlie ) .
Okay , Maggie and I are switching roles – but not bodies – this week , as work demands have destined me to preview duties and Maggie to a late - night review tonight .
I must say , writing a Dharma Blog article in the daylight is refreshing .
Hey !
Maggie writes in the light of day , I write in the dark of night .
Metaphor !
Anyway , tonight we tackle the 10th chapter of LOST ’s whirlwind finale tour de force .
It ’s a Sun & Jin episode titled , “ The Package , ” and it also marks the first “ That ’s What She Said ” episode title since last season ’s “ Jughead . ” ( sorry , mom . )
Dharma
Blog regulars know that my love for Sun has dwindled in the past year .
While ( almost ) every other actor on the show has improved over the course of the series , Yunjin Kim has regressed markedly .
Daniel Dae Kim plays her doggedly loyal , battle - ready husband Jin brilliantly , but Sun ’s presence has bordered on obnoxious as of late .
However , her primary drawback for two seasons has been that her dialogue has been relegated to “ I need to find my husband , ” and variations thereof .
No actor can make that interesting 20 different times .
So in the spirit of resolution that has marked this final season of LOST , perhaps tonight ’s episode will mercifully treat us to their reunion .
Let ’s see what we know .
Last we saw Jin , he was tenuously bunking with Kate , Sawyer , crazyClaire , crazySayid and Not -John - Locke at Camp Poop Baby .
Jin was captured / saved by Claire , who subjected him as a witness to the murder of innocuously - named Other , Justin .
Then , he and fellow Flockester Sawyer awaited the return of their bald eagle and his band of Temple converts .
We did n’t see much of Jin during “ Recon , ” while Flocke was playing Michael Walton to his bickering charges ( Sawyer , Kate and Claire ) .
But Jin ’s presence on Team Flocke is an interesting one .
For now , he appears to be playing possum , waiting to see just what Flocke , Claire , Sayid and Sawyer have planned .
You get the sense that – understandably – Jin is n’t a track - suit - wearing , card - carrying member of this team .
And why should he be ?
He has n’t even given Flocke something to exploit – and Flocke has n’t given him something to hate .
Yet .
Alright Yunjin Kim , change my mind about your acting skills .
Or die already .
Sun – like her husband – has taken on a role as team player since last season .
When Ajira 316 crashed , she and unlikely cohort Frank Lapidus hijacked a boat to the main Island , where they met up with creeper Christian Shephard ( Man in Black ? ) in the former Dharma Welcome Room .
That room , as we saw it in 2007 , had been ransacked and deserted long ago .
Broken pictures and tattered welcome banners adorned the facility , but Christian led Frank and Sun through the wreckage and showed them a picture of the Dharma Initiative ’s Class of 1977 , of which Jin was a member .
That was the moment Sun knew that Ben had n’t lied to her off the Island when he told her he could reunite her with her husband .
It was also the moment that Sun was reduced to a single dimension and a single mission : Find Jin , even if it means sacrificing acting skills ( Okay , I ’ll stop harping on her now ) .
After her close encounter of the Christian kind , Sun joined up with Flocke , Richard , Ben Linus and the Others as they headed to the Temple to confront Jacob .
Initially , she joined up with Flocke because he said he could deliver her to Jin .
When it became clear that Flocke had a different mission , Sun fell in with the remnants of Team Jacob – Ilana , Ben , Miles , Lapidus and ( eventually ) Richard , Jack and Hurley .
This realignment presumably coincided with the Jughead detonation , or whatever it was that “ merged ” the two timelines .
That ’s where we sit now , with Sun making camp on the beach amidst yet another group of people she hopes can lead her to Jin.
Interestingly enough , Sun and Jin are in really similar positions right now : biding their time within a group of people they do n’t necessarily trust , tracking the carrot on a stick that is their shared reunion .
The question becomes , what will be the catalyst that finally allows them to meet up ?
My guess at the answer : John Locke .
More specifically , the Man - in - Black / Smoke Monster as John Locke .
We ’ve seen that this entity ’s modus operandi is to find people who have something he needs , then offer them something that exploits a weakness or longing they have .
In this case , Flocke has two malleable subjects – Sun and Jin – with the same weakness / longing : each other .
Sun and Jin are very vulnerable right now .
We ’ve seen them both take uncharacteristic paths in the hopes of finding each other .
Sun is aligned with a man she does n’t really know ( Frank ) , a woman who gives me nightmares ( Ilana ) and the shell of a man that she ’s never fully trusted ( Jack – remember , in their Oceanic Six stint , she was very distrusting of the good doctor ) .
Jin , in the same vein , is making camp with self - destructive Sawyer , two “ claimed ” souls ( Sayid and Claire ) and the man who claimed them ( Flocke ) .
Clearly , the Kwons have pushed in all their chips , betting the farm on this chance to reunite .
That ’s where Flocke comes in .
He likes ‘em good and vulnerable .
A man who just lost the love of his life ( Sawyer ) , a woman whose child was taken away from her ( Claire ) and a tortured torturer ( Sayid ) are just his recent recruits .
But as we saw last week with his recruitment of Richard , the Man in Black / Flocke has a keen eye for souls in need of a purpose .
My guess , tonight we ’ll see the last temptation of Kwon .
I ’m just not sure which one .
Flocke has easy access to Jin , but I imagine he ’s a little more suspicious of the entire situation .
Sun , however , would follow Jeffrey Dahmer to a Cannibal Convention .
I think Flocke will swing for the low - hanging fruit here , and go after Sun .
Remember , when we last saw Flocke , he was eavesdropping on Hurley and Richard ’s heart - breaking , Isabella - motivated test of faith .
It ’s a hop , skip and a smoke over to the beach where Sun is just waiting for someone to tell her what to do .
Among the many mysteries surrounding the concept of “ candidacy ” is the identity of # 42 : Kwon .
Jin ? Sun ? Baby Ji Yeon ?
( Settle down Maggie , you baby - loving LOST addict . )
I kind of think it ’s both .
Ilana said six candidates were left .
I do n’t think John Locke is legitimately one of them anymore .
Which would leave Jack , Hurley , Sawyer , Sayid and two , two , two Kwons !
But to me , the Kwondidate mystery is second to the “ What are they candidates for ? ” mystery .
I ca n’t get past the cave that Flocke showed Sawyer , and its narrative juxtaposition with Jacob ’s lighthouse .
Two structures , each with numbers and candidates .
But one is dark ( cave ) and one is light ( house ) .
I get the sneaking suspicion that the cave is actually a list of the Man in Black ’s candidates .
He said that the candidates were those who could possibly take over for Jacob .
I wonder if that was a lie to Sawyer , and if , actually , the cave candidates were people whom Man in Black thought he might be able to exploit in order to uncork his prison and leave the Island .
Interestingly , the cave and the lighthouse have ( mostly ) the same candidates and numbers .
Maybe the cave is where Man in Black is keeping his own records , trying to match Jacob , soul - for - soul , in his bid for escape .
Hey , also , did you like how I used the word Kwondidate in that last paragraph ?
God , that was great .
But where do Sun and Jin enter into this ?
I think tonight we ’ll find out .
Perhaps their natural “ goodness ” will be tested against their capacity for corruptibility .
They ’re interesting character studies in that way .
In their back stories , we ’ve seen both sides of the Kwon Koins ( another play on words !
I ’m on fire when I ’m not writing at midnight ) .
First , look at Sun.
Sweet , good - natured , loyal Sun .
Who cheated on her husband and learned English behind her husband ’s back with the intention of leaving him at the airport .
Then , look at Jin.
Hard - working , equally loyal Jin who will do anything to win the favor of his wife ’s very judgmental father .
Anything , including murder .
Also , he subjugated his wife , deeming her a second class citizen .
And he told her to button up that blouse in Season One , thus denying all the Oceanic 815 men some much - needed cleavage .
In a sense , the Kwons are each other ’s ever - evolving yin and yang .
And no , I ’m not just saying that because they ’re Asian .
I ’m 1/14 Asian , due to the presence of my Chiniece ( Chinese niece ) , so I can say things like that .
But really , when one goes bad ( Sun learning English and wanting to leave her husband ) , the other goes good ( Jin brings her a flower , tells her she looks beautiful and promises to take her away from their horrible life ) .
And when one goes good ( Sun making peace with the other survivors , planting a garden and assimilating herself into the makeshift culture ) the other goes bad ( Jin deriding other survivors , being obstinate and kicking the shit out of Michael for wearing his watch ) .
The Kwons represent the dichotomy of good and evil , while simultaneously showcasing the moral ambiguity of mankind .
On multiple occasions , they ’ve eluded cookie - cutter “ good ” or “ evil ” characterizations .
They ’ve shown their heart , and they ’ve shown their dark sides .
So tonight , perhaps , the true nature of the Kwons will be revealed .
Will they prove themselves good - hearted souls , capable of taking over for Jacob as the Island ’s protector ?
Or will they prove themselves susceptible to evil , and thus become pawns in Flocke ’s great escape ?
So many puns today .
I ’m Kwon a roll .
Sorry .
We also must prepare for the alternate - reality Kwon storyline .
Last we saw Sun , she was watching with fear as Jin was dragged into a TSA holding cell .
Last we saw Jin , he was being rescued from a freezer , where Keamy and Omar were holding him captive .
I assumed , after that , that Keamy and Omar were still working for Widmore in the alternate reality .
Perhaps , thought I , Jin’s “ delivery ” was for Widmore , and Keamy and Omar were upset with him for getting held up at the airport .
Keamy and Omar were killed by Sayid , who was on the warpath looking for answers to his brother ’s assault .
And when we departed , Sayid found Jin in the deep freeze , and we were left to wonder where they went .
Perhaps out for coffee , with Juliet .
Personally , I hate spoilers , but I generally allow myself to read the episode title and description .
I do n’t always like to read the guest list , but I ’ve done it this week to fulfill my previewer duties ( ha , I said , “ duties ” ) and I ’ll break it down for you ( there ’s not much to it ) .
So , if you ’re a spoiler purist , stop reading this and we ’ll see you in the morning .
Those who want a cryptic - but - doesn ’t - actually - tell - us - much tease , read on .
The official episode description for tonight : “ Sun and Jin desperately continue their search for one another , and Locke confronts his enemy .
” Whoa .
Okay , we tackled the first 2/3 of that tease , but I was n’t aware of the final 1/3 .
“ Locke confronts his enemy . ”
That has to mean Jacob , right ?
Will Flocke channel the postmortem abilities of his Man in Black core to speak with recently - deceased Jacob ?
Things could get awkward .
“ Hey , how ’s it going . ”
“ Oh not bad , except the whole thing where you manipulated my most loyal follower into killing me . ”
“ Eee. Right .
Have some wine .
” We have n’t seen MIB - as - Locke talk to Jacob since right before he murdered him and kicked him into the fire .
It ’ll be interesting to see them talk about what has transpired since then .
And I ’d wager , we ’ll get a little insight as to the nature of the candidates , and their respective statuses .
MIB has Sayid , Sawyer and Kwon 1 . Jacob has Jack , Hurley and Kwon 2 .
I ’d say the pieces are on the board , and maybe tonight we ’ll see one of the combatants make the first move .
THE WAR .
IS .
ON .
Alternative possibility : the “ enemy ” is Widmore , and Flocke heads over to Hydra to survey the scene .
I do n’t think so , though .
I think Widmore is far from an “ enemy ” of the Man in Black .
Of note on tonight ’s guest list , we ’ve got Alan Dale as Charles Widmore , Kevin Durand as Keamy , Anthony Azizi as Omar , Sheila Kelley as Zoe , Fred Koehler as Seamus and a few people whose characters are unknown to us at this point .
That makes sense .
We ’ve got Widmore , his off - Island henchmen ( Keamy and Omar ) and his on - Island henchman and woman ( Seamus and Zoe ) .
I , for one , am pumped for some Keamy .
I mean , the guy makes good eggs .
Wait a second though .
As I mentioned earlier , Keamy and Omar were offed by Sayid as they held Jin captive .
Does that mean their appearance tonight will be of the on -Island variety ?
I do n’t think so .
My guess is , tonight ’s story will fill in the blanks of how , exactly , Jin came to be held captive by Keamy and Omar in that freezer .
There is one very curious little nugget on the guest list : Andrew Divoff as Mikhail Bakunin .
Huh .
Here I thought he died 8 times already .
I wonder if he ’ll surface in the alternate reality , perhaps as an accomplice to Keamy and Omar .
We ’ve already seen Others Dogen and Ben Linus relegated to alternate reality normalcy , so maybe that ’s where Mikhail ends up , too .
I hope he likes eggs .
Maggie will be back in the a.m. with a review of The Package ( again , that just sounds dirty ) .
Until then , enjoy Sun , Jin and the rest of the gang .
Namaste .

I am a fiction writer ! "
Now that people of Intelligent Mind are no longer freaking out so much about politics -- on one side or the other -- the world is ripe for fiction again .
The right needs fantasies to keep them strong in this age of paranoia and control .
The left needs myths to keep them hopeful in the face of hostility and aggression .
Reality just is n't good enough !
Whatever inch of the political yardstick you occupy , you will be happy to learn that two good things are happening in the world of American fiction : " Reading Rainbow " is returning to television and will be rebooted for a new generation , and " The Atlantic Monthly " is going to start publishing fiction again .
These two small tactical victories for the artful and confabulated are good news for all red- blooded Americans , whether these Americans qualify for godless health - care reform or not .*** It appears that " Reading Rainbow " will be rebooted with more of an " internet " edge , but I feel like this is a mistake , and that the new angle that " Reading Rainbow " should take is to use fiction as a gateway into the marginalized , desperate , and terrifying .
It should be the only kid's show that visits prisons , mental health hospitals , and mortuaries .
It should visit the Hell of the World with a book under its arm , dragging children along and promising to show them how things really are with a grim , world - weary determination to find the deeper truth .
The treat at the end is a piece of fiction that makes sense of it all .
After LeVar Burton interviews a death row inmate about his methods for abducting and killing children , THEN he will turn to the camera and tell viewers .
" And that 's why you should never talk to strangers or join the Cub Scouts .
And now , here 's Morgan Freeman reading " The Night Kitchen , " by Maurice Sendak ...
" Why sell fiction to children as anything less than the art that both opens your mind and then helps you deal with the new horrors of your functional imagination ?*** Regarding " The Atlantic Monthly " : while I am happy they are recommitted to publishing fiction , they are going to have to work a fuck of a lot harder than releasing some shit for the iPhone or the Kindle and calling this a fiction section .
"
We think -- we hope ! -- we are seeing renewed interest in the short story , " wrote James Bennet , " The Atlantic Monthly " editor .
" Last fall , we started a digital fiction series , publishing to the Amazon Kindle two short stories a month by authors like Christopher Buckley , Curtis Sittenfeld , and Paul Theroux .
" Basically , doing this is doing nothing , except putting money into the hands of Apple and Amazon , the world 's biggest electronics and shoe stores , respectively .
Hey " Atlantic Monthly " : fire your news department , use the money to hire some flash developers , and start making embeddable fiction widgets designed by real artists that feature audio files of short fiction from real writers .
Make it fun !
Get some interviews !
Maximize your resources !
Find a jolly host who takes on the world with sly wit and who appears to have benefited in her life from reading fiction !
Go vertical : do podcasts , do internet publishing , and do print - on - demand .
Fiction everywhere .
Fiction coming out of the fucking walls .
Kids getting fiction tattoos .
Fiction overtaking sports and fashion on graphs full of jagged red lines labeled " importance over time in countries that matter . "
Fiction getting us into space , giving us something to do in space , making sense of our junked - up lives , healing wounds we did n't even know we had , making us smart enough to live in a world without borders , limits , or necessity ...
In short , the new " Atlantic Monthly " needs to be more like the old " Reading Rainbow , " and vice versa .

Method for HTTP Abstract Several applications extending the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ( HTTP ) require a feature to do partial resource modification .
The existing HTTP PUT method only allows a complete replacement of a document .
This proposal adds a new HTTP method , PATCH , to modify an existing HTTP resource .
Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document .
This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF ) .
It represents the consensus of the IETF community .

RFC 5789 HTTP PATCH March 2010 RFC2616 ] , Section 9.1 .
A PATCH request can be issued in such a way as to be idempotent , which also helps prevent bad outcomes from collisions between two PATCH requests on the same resource in a similar time frame .
Collisions from multiple PATCH requests may be more dangerous than PUT collisions because some patch formats need to operate from a known base - point or else they will corrupt the resource .
Clients using this kind of patch application SHOULD use a conditional request such that the request will fail if the resource has been updated since the client last accessed the resource .
For example , the client can use a strong ETag [ RFC2616 ] in an If - Match header on the PATCH request .
There are also cases where patch formats do not need to operate from a known base - point ( e.g. , appending text lines to log files , or non- colliding rows to database tables ) , in which case the same care in client requests is not needed .
The server MUST apply the entire set of changes atomically and never provide ( e.g. , in response to a GET during this operation ) a partially modified representation .
If the entire patch document cannot be successfully applied , then the server MUST NOT apply any of the changes .
The determination of what constitutes a successful PATCH can vary depending on the patch document and the type of resource (s ) being modified .
For example , the common ' diff ' utility can generate a patch document that applies to multiple files in a directory hierarchy .
The atomicity requirement holds for all directly affected files .
See " Error Handling " , Section 2.2 , for details on status codes and possible error conditions .
If the request passes through a cache and the Request - URI identifies one or more currently cached entities , those entries SHOULD be treated as stale .
A response to this method is only cacheable if it Dusseault & Snell Standards Track [ Page 3 ]

Error Handling Section 3.1 to notify the client what patch document media types are supported .
Unprocessable request : Can be specified with a 422 ( Unprocessable Entity ) response ( [ RFC4918 ] , Section 11.2 ) when the server understands the patch document and the syntax of the patch document appears to be valid , but the server is incapable of processing the request .
This might include attempts to modify a resource in a way that would cause the resource to become invalid ; for instance , a modification to a well - formed XML document that would cause it to no longer be well - formed .
There may also be more specific errors like " Conflicting State " that could be signaled with this status code , but the more specific error would generally be more helpful .

Security Considerations [ RFC2616 ] , Section 9.6 ) .
These include authorizing requests ( possibly through access control and / or authentication ) and ensuring that data is not corrupted through transport errors or through accidental overwrites .
Whatever mechanisms are used for PUT can be used for PATCH as well .
The following considerations apply especially to PATCH .
A document that is patched might be more likely to be corrupted than a document that is overridden in entirety , but that concern can be addressed through the use of mechanisms such as conditional requests using ETags and the If - Match request header as described in Section 2 .
If a PATCH request fails , the client can issue a GET request to the resource to see what state it is in .
In some cases , the client might be able to check the contents of the resource to see if the PATCH request can be resent , but in other cases , the attempt will just fail and / or a user will have to verify intent .
In the case of a failure of the underlying transport channel , where a PATCH response is not received before the channel fails or some other timeout happens , the client might have to issue a GET request to see whether the request was applied .
The client might want to ensure that the GET request bypasses caches using mechanisms described in HTTP specifications ( see , for example , Section 13.1.6 of [ RFC2616 ] ) .
Sometimes an HTTP intermediary might try to detect viruses being sent via HTTP by checking the body of the PUT / POST request or GET response .
The PATCH method complicates such watch - keeping because neither the source document nor the patch document might be a virus , yet the result could be .

Illinois Democrats chose the daughter of the late U.S. Sen .
Paul Simon as their nominee for lieutenant governor Saturday following a scandal that forced the primary election winner to step down .
The Democratic State Central Committee chose Sheila Simon to fill the vacancy , passing over a longtime legislator who was the runner - up in last month 's primary .
Voters generally choose the governor 's running mate in Illinois , but this year 's winner , pawn shop owner Scott Lee Cohen , withdrew after allegations surfaced of domestic abuse , steroid use and failure to pay child support .
Cohen denied the allegations but stepped down amid political pressure , leaving Democratic leaders to pick a candidate .
Simon had the backing of Gov. Pat Quinn , who praised her public service and said it was important to have a downstate resident on the Democratic ticket .
Simon , 49 , teaches law at Southern Illinois University and served four years on the city council in Carbondale .
Quinn is from Chicago , while both Republicans candidates are from downstate .
Committee members picked Simon over state Rep. Art Turner , who finished second in the primary .
Some Democratic leaders said rejecting Turner , a black lawmaker from Chicago , would sour black voters on the Democratic ticket .
But Quinn brushed aside that suggestion after Saturday 's vote , predicting that he and Simon would appeal to all voters .
Simon also could help Quinn 's image as a reformer .
She was a member of his Illinois Reform Commission , which recommended government changes after Gov. Rod Blagojevich was arrested on federal charges of trying to sell President Barack Obama 's former U.S. Senate seat .
Quinn , as then - lieutenant governor , took over after Blagojevich was removed from office .
Turner said Saturday he was a little hurt by how things turned out but understands the decision .
He encouraged his supporters , hundreds of whom traveled to Springfield for the committee 's vote , to support the Democratic ticket in the November general election .
On January 29 , 1931 , the world 's premier physicist , Albert Einstein , and its foremost astronomer , Edwin Hubble , settled into the plush leather seats of a sleek Pierce - Arrow touring car for a visit to Mount Wilson in southern California .
They were chauffeured up the long , zigzagging dirt road to the observatory complex on the summit , nearly a mile above Pasadena .
Home to the largest telescope of its day , Mount Wilson was the site of Hubble 's astronomical triumphs .
In 1924 he had used the telescope 's then colossal 100 - inch ( 254 - centimeter ) mirror to confirm that our galaxy is just one of countless " island universes " inhabiting the vastness of space .
Five years later , after tracking the movements of these spiraling disks , Hubble and his assistant , Milton Humason , had revealed something even more astounding :
The universe is swiftly expanding , carrying the galaxies outward .
On the peak that bright day in January , the 51 - year - old Einstein delighted in the telescope 's instruments .
Like a child at play , he scrambled about the framework , to the consternation of his hosts .
Nearby was Einstein 's wife , Elsa .
Told that the giant reflector was used to determine the universe 's shape , she reportedly replied , " Well , my husband does that on the back of an old envelope . "
That was n't just wifely pride .
Years before Hubble detected cosmic expansion , Einstein had fashioned a theory , general relativity , that could explain it .
In studies of the cosmos , it all goes back to Einstein .
Just about anywhere astronomers ' observations take them — from the nearby sun to the black holes in distant galaxies — they enter Einstein 's realm , where time is relative , mass and energy are interchangeable , and space can stretch and warp .
His footprints are deepest in cosmology , the study of the universe 's history and fate .
General relativity " describes how our universe was born , how it expands , and what its future will be , " says Alan Dressier of the Carnegie Observatories .
Beginning , middle , and end — " all are connected to this grand idea . "
At the turn of the 20th century , 30 years before Einstein and Hubble 's rendezvous at Mount Wilson , physics was in turmoil .
X - rays , electrons , and radioactivity were just being discovered , and physicists were realizing that their trusted laws of motion , dating back more than 200 years to Isaac Newton , could not explain how these strange new particles flit through space .
It took a rebel , a cocky kid who spurned rote learning and had an unshakable faith in his own abilities , to blaze a trail through this baffling new territory .
This was not the iconic Einstein — the sockless , rumpled character with baggy sweater and fright - wig coiffure — but a younger , more romantic figure with alluring brown eyes and wavy hair .
He was at the height of his prowess .
Among his gifts was a powerful physical instinct , almost a sixth sense for knowing how nature should work .
Einstein thought in images , such as one that began haunting him as a teenager :
If a man could keep pace with a beam of light , what would he see ?
Would he see the electromagnetic wave frozen in place like some glacial swell ?
" It does not seem that something like that can exist ! " Einstein later recalled thinking .
He came to realize that since all the laws of physics remain the same whether you 're at rest or in steady motion , the speed of light has to be constant as well .
No one can catch up with a light beam .
But if the speed of light is identical for all observers , something else has to give : absolute time and space .
Einstein concluded that the cosmos has no universal clock or common reference frame .
Space and time are " relative , " flowing differently for each of us depending on our motion .
Einstein 's special theory of relativity , published a hundred years ago , also revealed that energy and mass are two sides of the same coin , forever linked in his famed equation E = mc² .
( E stands for energy , m for mass , and c for the speed of light . )
" The idea is amusing and enticing , " wrote Einstein , " but whether the Almighty is …leading me up the garden path — that I cannot know . "
He was too modest .
The idea that mass could be transformed into pure energy later helped astronomers understand the enduring power of the sun .
It also gave birth to nuclear weapons .
But Einstein was not satisfied .
Special relativity was just that — special .
It could not describe all types of motion , such as objects in the grip of gravity , the large - scale force that shapes the universe .
Ten years later , in 1915 , Einstein made up for the omission with his general theory of relativity , which amended Newton 's laws by redefining gravity .
General relativity revealed that space and time are linked in a flexible four - dimensional fabric that is bent and indented by matter .
In this picture , Earth orbits the sun because it is caught in the space - time hollow carved by the sun 's mass , much as a rolling marble would circle around a bowling ball sitting in a trampoline .
The pull of gravity is just matter sliding along the curvatures of space - time .
Einstein shot to the pinnacle of celebrity in 1919 , when British astronomers actually measured this warping .
Monitoring a solar eclipse , they saw streams of starlight bending around the darkened sun .
" Lights All Askew in the Heavens .
Stars Not Where
They seemed or Were Calculated to be , but Nobody Need Worry , " proclaimed the headline in the New York Times .
With this new insight into gravity , physicists at last were able to make actual predictions about the universe 's behavior , turning cosmology into a science .
Einstein was the first to try .
Yet as events showed , even Einstein was a fallible genius .
A misconception about the nature of the universe led him to propose a mysterious new gravitational effect — a notion he soon rejected .
But he may have been right for the wrong reasons , and his " mistake " may yet turn out to be one of his deepest insights .
For Newton , space was eternally at rest , merely an inert stage on which objects moved .
But with general relativity , the stage itself became an active player .
The amount of matter within the universe sculpts its overall curvature .
And space - time itself can be either expanding or contracting .
When Einstein announced general relativity in 1915 , he could have taken the next step and declared that the universe was in motion , more than a decade before Hubble directly measured cosmic expansion .
But at the time , astronomers conceived of the universe as a large collection of stars fixed forever in the void .
Einstein accepted this immutable cosmos .
Truth be told , he liked it .
Einstein was often leery of the most radical consequences of his ideas .
But because even a static universe would eventually collapse under its own gravity , he had to slip a fudge factor into the equations of general relativity — a cosmological constant .
While gravity pulled celestial objects inward , this extra gravitational effect — a kind of antigravity — pushed them apart .
It was just what was needed to keep the universe immobile , " as required by the fact of the small velocities of the stars , " Einstein wrote in 1917 .
Twelve years later , Hubble 's discovery of other galaxies racing away from ours , their light waves stretched and reddened by the expansion of space - time , vanquished the static universe .
It also eliminated any need for a cosmological constant to hold the galaxies steady .
During his 1931 California visit , Einstein acknowledged as much .
" The red shift of distant nebulae has smashed my old construction like a hammer blow , " he declared .
He reputedly told a colleague that the cosmological constant was his biggest blunder .
With or without that extra ingredient , the basic recipe for the expanding universe was Einstein's .
But it was left to others to identify one revolutionary implication : a moment of cosmic creation .
In 1931 the Belgian priest and astrophysicist Georges Lemaître put the fleeing galaxies into reverse and imagined them eons ago merged in a fireball of dazzling brilliance — a " primeval atom , " as he put it .
" The evolution of the world can be compared to a display of fireworks that has just ended : some few red wisps , ashes and smoke , " wrote Lemaître .
From this poetic scenario arose today 's big bang .
Many were appalled by this concept .
" The notion of a beginning … is repugnant to me , " said British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington in 1931 .
But evidence in its favor slowly gathered , climaxing in 1964 , when scientists at Bell Telephone Laboratories discovered that the cosmos is awash in a sea of microwave radiation , the remnant glow of the universe 's thunderous launch .
Ever since then the image of the big bang has shaped and directed the work of cosmologists as strongly as Ptolemy 's celestial spheres influenced astronomers in the Middle Ages .
In 1980 Alan Guth , now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , gave the big bang a boost , adding new particle physics to Einstein 's flexible space - time .
He realized that for its first trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second , the infant cosmos could have undergone a supercharged expansion — an instant of " inflation " — before settling into more measured growth .
Inflation would have helped smooth out the matter and energy in the universe and flattened its overall space - time curvature , just as satellites have found by making precise measurements of the cosmic microwaves .
And these days some theorists believe inflation was n't a flash in the pan .
In an ongoing process of creation , spacetime could be inflating into new universes everywhere and all the time — an infinity of big bangs .
Within our own universe , the high priests of astronomy have continued the cosmological quest initiated by Einstein and Hubble , first at Mount Wilson , then at the 200 - inch ( 508 - centimeter ) telescope on California 's Palomar Mountain , 90 miles ( 145 kilometers ) to the south .
How fast is the universe ballooning outward ?
they asked .
How old is it ?
" Answering those questions , " says Wendy Freedman , director of the Carnegie Observatories , " turned out to be more difficult than anyone anticipated . "
Only at the turn of this century , with the help of a space telescope aptly named Hubble , did Freedman and others confidently peg the universe 's current rate of expansion , as well as its age .
A birthday cake for the universe would require some 14 billion candles .
Astronomers have found some strange objects in this expanding universe — and these too are Einstein 's children .
In the 1930s a young Indian physicist , Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar , applied special relativity and the new theory of quantum mechanics to a star .
He warned that if it surpassed a certain mass , it would not settle down as a white dwarf at the end of its life ( as our sun will ) .
Instead gravity would squeeze it down much further , perhaps even to a singular point .
Horrified , Eddington declared that " there should be a law of Nature to prevent a star from behaving in this absurd way ! "
There was no such law .
Chandrasekhar had opened the door for others to contemplate the existence of the most bizarre stars imaginable .
First there was a naked sphere of neutrons just a dozen miles ( nineteen kilometers ) wide born in the throes of a supernova , the explosion of a massive star .
A neutron star 's density would be equivalent to packing all the cars in the world into a thimble .
Then there was the peculiar object formed from the collapse of an even bigger star or a cluster of stars — enough mass to dig a pit in space - time so deep nothing can ever climb out .
Einstein himself tried to prove that such an object — a black hole , it was later christened — could not exist .
Like Eddington , he loathed what would be found at a black hole 's center : a point of zero volume and infinite density , where the laws of physics break down .
The discoveries that might have forced him to acknowledge his theory 's strange offspring came after his death in 1955 .
Astronomers identified the first quasar , a remote young galaxy disgorging the energy of a trillion suns from its center , in 1963 .
Four years later , much closer to home , observers stumbled on the first pulsar , a rapidly spinning beacon emitting staccato radio beeps .
Meanwhile spaceborne sensors spotted powerful x-rays and gamma rays streaming from points around the sky .
All these new , bewildering signals are believed to pinpoint collapsed objects — neutron stars and black holes — whose crushing gravity and dizzying spin turn them into dynamos .
With their discovery , the once sedate universe took on an edge ; it metamorphosed into an Einsteinian cosmos , filled with sources of titanic energies that can be understood only in the light of relativity .
Even Einstein 's less celebrated ideas have had remarkable staying power .
As early as 1912 he realized that a faraway star can act like a giant spyglass , its gravity deflecting passing light rays and magnifying objects behind it .
He eventually concluded that this tiny effect defied " the resolving power of our instruments " and had " little value . "
With today 's telescopes , astronomers are seeing galaxies and galaxy clusters act as powerful gravitational lenses , offering a peek at galaxies farther out .
Since the light - bending depends on the mass of the lens , the effect also lets observers weigh the lensing galaxies .
They turn out to have far more mass than can be seen .
It 's part of the universe 's mysterious dark matter , the roughly 90 percent of its mass that can't be found in stars , gas , planets , or any other known form of matter .
A cosmic web of dark matter is now thought to have governed where galaxies formed .
Dark matter is the universe 's hidden architecture , and gravitational lensing is one of the few practical ways to " see " it .
An effect Einstein thought insignificant has become a key astronomical tool .
Theorists have also dusted off his discarded cosmological constant to explain a startling new discovery , and now Einstein's " biggest blunder " is starting to look like one of his greatest successes .
Astronomers had assumed that gravity is gradually slowing the expansion of the universe .
But in the late 1990s two teams , measuring the distances to faraway exploding stars , found just the opposite .
Like buoy markers spreading apart on ocean currents , these supernovae revealed that space - time is ballooning outward at an accelerating pace .
For Einstein , the cosmological constant was a way to steady the universe .
But if its repulsive effect — now called dark energy — is big enough , it could also drive the acceleration .
" The need came back , and the cosmological constant was waiting , " says Adam Riess of the Space Telescope Science Institute , one of the discoverers of the acceleration .
" It 's totally an Einsteinian concept . "
So is a prediction of general relativity that , if confirmed , could open new insights into the cosmos : ripples in space - time called gravity waves .
To detect them , physicists have built three giant sensors , in south - central Washington State , Louisiana , and south of Pisa , Italy .
In each one , laser beams run up and down miles - long pipes to measure the slight stretching and squeezing of space - time expected if a gravity wave passes by .
By triangulating these measurements , scientists might trace gravity waves back to their sources .
Only stunningly violent events could cause spacetime to shudder — a supernova , for example , or the titanic collision of two neutron stars or black holes .
" If two black holes collided , gravity waves would be the only signals to come out , " says Adalberto Giazotto , a scientist with the Pisa project .
The mighty jolt of cosmic birth probably also generated gravity waves , which would still be resonating through the cosmos .
These remnant ripples could hold direct evidence of the fleeting moment when physicists believe all of nature 's forces were united .
If so , Einstein 's gravity waves could at last offer clues to something he tried and failed to develop : a " theory of everything . "
Physicists are still seeking such a theory — a single explanation for both the large - scale force of gravity and the short - range forces inside the atom .
Catching these faint echoes of the big bang is a major goal of NASA 's next generation of space astronomy missions , a plan the agency has tagged " Beyond Einstein . "
As noted the other day , Gerry North was one of the presenters at Ralph Cicerone ’s AAAS panel .
North had previously been chairman of the NAS panel on Surface Temperature Reconstructions , where he described their due diligence process as “ not doing any research ” and that they just “ winged it ” – the sort of due diligence failure when charged with responsibility that has allowed climategate to fester so long .
More recently , North was one of two “ expert ” witnesses interviewed by the Penn State Inquiry .
To non-climate scientists , North ’s admission that he had n’t read the Climategate Letters {out of “ professional respect ” ) would seem to disqualify him as an expert , but not , it seems , in the bizarro world of modern climate science .
There was an extremely interesting blog post a few days ago by Rob Bradley , an old friend of North from Enron days – where North had been Bradley ’s climate consultant – in which Bradley asked North very pointed questions in which he compared the present behavior of climate scientists to Climategate to their shared experience ( as innocent parties not in the know ) through the gradual revelation of Enron problems .
Bradley :
I challenged Gerald North and this panel with an analogy between Climategate and bad behaviors that sank Enron ( where I used to work and where North was my climate consultant )
Here is a lengthy excerpt from Rob Bradley ’s letter to North :
I see that you are going to be part of a panel at the Friday AAAS meeting on Climategate .
Some of us fear too much downplaying .
You were a consultant for me at Enron for several years on climate science and watched the fall of the company with great interest .
So I would like to challenge you to interpret Climategate in terms of the fall of Enron .
Here are some themes from Enron to consider applying .
1 ) Slippery slopes where small deviations from best practices escalated into problems that were not anticipated at the beginning of the process .
2 ) A lack of midcourse correction when developing problems were not properly addressed .
3 ) Old fashioned deceit when the core mission / vision was threatened ( for Enron it was ‘ to become the world ’s leading company ’ – for Jones et al. , it was there is a big warming and a climate problem developing )
4 ) The ( despised ) short sellers busted the Enron mirage .
Ken Lay at the last employee meeting even likened the short sellers to ‘ terrorists ” ( this was just a few months after 9/11 ) .
Question : does mainstream climate science regard Internet ‘ peer review ’ of Jones et al. like the Enron faithful regarded the short sellers who first discovered the problems of Enron ?
5 ) Enron suffered from the “ smartest guys in the room ” problem .
Does Climategate reveal arrogance and a lack of humility among “ mainstream ” climate scientists ?
6 ) Denial : we employees were almost all in denial when the problems at Enron first surfaced .
Have you and others who are close to the scientists of Climategate been slow to recognize the problem ?
Has Nature and Science also been slow ?
If so , What does this say about human nature .
7 ) Taking responsibility .
Skilling and Lay never did and , in fact , they joined together in a legal cartel where the unstated strategy was to not blame each other for anything and sink or swim together .
Has this happened , or is it still happening , with Climategate if you believe that scientific protocol and / or legal rules were violated ?
Bradley continued his post with a discussion of “ Circling the Wagons ” ;
I do leave Dr. North with the challenge to more forthrightly deal with Climategate , which he has failed to do to date .
I am very discouraged about the circle - the - wagons mentality of too many academic scientists who are covering for each other ( many are long time personal friends , and they are united in THE CAUSE of climate alarmism ) .
As I complained to North in another email : Your own reaction to Climategate has shaken my faith a bit when you say it is no big deal and then you have n’t read the emails .
Analogies are always treacherous , because , all too often , one gets drawn into debates about the analogy that are just as complex as the original issue .
Or debates about the validity of the analogy .
So one needs to take care in trying to go a bridge too far in this sort of comparison .
Nonetheless , as it happens , in the early days of Climate Audit , I posted on both Bre -X and Enron .
Here are some relevant posts on Enron :

https://climateaudit.org/2008/09/17/lehman-bros-and-consensus/
In the first post , I observed ironically that there was a “ consensus ” in 2000 that Enron was the best - managed company in the US , seizing that honor from GE .
Money managers and analysts are not stupid people – the intriguing question for me was ( and this sort of question interested me before I was interested in climate ) is how could so many smart analysts get it wrong ?
And at what point did it change from “ shame on you ” to “ shame on me ” i.e. at what point could an alert analyst have spotted inconsistencies and problems ?
And what were early warning bells ?
One of Bradley ’s questions draws attention to the visceral hatred at Enron for the short sellers that “ busted the Enron mirage ” :
The ( despised ) short sellers busted the Enron mirage .
Ken Lay at the last employee meeting even likened the short sellers to ‘ terrorists ” ( this was just a few months after 9/11 ) .
Question : does mainstream climate science regard Internet ‘ peer review ’ of Jones et al. like the Enron faithful regarded the short sellers who first discovered the problems of Enron ?
Ironically , I ’d been very impressed by the anecdote about short sellers in Eichenwald ’s book and connected this incident to proxy reconstructions in an early CA post :
In Eichenwald ’s terrific book on Enron , the first person credited with noticing the problems was a short seller , who really came out of left field .
He simply noticed what was , in effect , a statistical anomaly – the profits were miniscule relative to the capital employed and they always came out fractionally positive .
When you had large fluxes in and out , it did n’t make sense that the knife edge always came out just positive .
He wondered what accounting decisions had been made .
I think like a short seller .
Whenever I see knife edge balances , like the knife edge balance by which the net index from modern proxies comes out a hair warmer than the index from medieval proxies in many multiproxy studies , I wonder what accounting decisions were made .
You can dress it up in statistical language , but civilians can think of the issues as being accounting decisions .
Sometimes you need to look at more than one thing .
Andrew Fastow did .
The stories in Eichenwald ’s book about Fastow ’s rage reminded me of Mann ’s rage – often exemplified in public , but now placed further into context by the Climategate letters .
The comparison with Enron may also be helpful in placing Climategate into context .
Obviously , corruption at Enron did not prove that all business enterprises were corrupt .
Conversely , no defence lawyer for Ken Lay or Jeffrey Skillings or Andrew Fastow would have stood before a court and argued that , because no one had showed that all business enterprises were corrupt , corruption at Enron did n’t “ matter ” .
It did matter .
Honest businessmen did not discourage an investigation of Enron or try to sweep it under the carpet .
The best way to restore confidence in the rest of the system was to do a proper investigation of Enron .
I think that there is a useful analogy here .
Defects in proxy reconstructions do not prove the non-existence of AGW just as corruption at Enron does n’t prove that all businesses are corrupt .
But the fact that some lines of scientific argument are unaffected by CRU conduct or misconduct does n’t mean that potential misconduct by CRU and others does n’t “ matter ” .
It does .
The difficulty of the “ community ” in understanding this does not reassure the public – that ’s for sure .
I also think that the “ community ” under -estimates the public prominence of the Team as the face of climate science , in large part because of their prominence in the under - estimated blogosphere .
Michael Tobis , for example , thought that the entire topic was unimportant because he was n’t interested enough in Mann ’s work or proxy reconstructions to bother understanding the questions .
That ’s fair enough .
But because these disputes have been so visible in the blogosphere , the net result ( whether the community likes it or not ) , long before Climategate , Mann , Jones and Briffa were much more prominent as the public face of climate science than they were within the “ community ” .
The Climategate Letters arrived on a scene where there was already a large audience that could readily understood the “ dank ” nuances of Yamal , bristlecones and most notably divergence .
This audience knew exactly what the “ trick … to hide the decline ” meant , while the climate science community was still hallucinating that the “ trick ” might be a sophisticated statistical method .
In my posts about Enron , I discussed their “ trick ” – in order to avoid reporting business losses , losses which would have punctured the mirage and prevented them from raising fresh money to keep the scheme alive – they sold worthless assets to off balance sheet limited partnerships with complicated guarantees .
The trick to hide the losses had considerably more sophistication than the trick to hide the decline in the IPCC 2001 report .
My own take on Enron was that the failure was n’t caused by the “ trick ” , but by horrendous non-performing investments – the “ trick ” merely disguised the recognition of the non-performing investments .
Making bad investments is n’t an offence , but tricks are .
And these were what ultimately cost Fastow , Skillings and Lay – with Lay arguing to the end that he was so far above the fray that he did n’t know about the trick .
I think that there ’s a moral for the science community from business failures in how to handle a problem like Climategate .
In order to get past something like Enron , the affair could not be ignored .
It had to be investigated properly .
( Judy Curry has an editorial here from a different perspective )
For obvious reasons , people with employment history in Enron or shareholders in Enron would not be appropriate people to serve on an investigation commission , though their testimony and information would be invaluable to the investigation .
BROSSARD - Le Canadien s'est départi d'un deuxième espoir en autant de semaines , mercredi .
Après avoir envoyé Guillaume Latendresse au Wild du Minnesota , le Tricolore a échangé Kyle Chipchura aux Ducks de Anaheim , obtenant en retour un choix de quatrième tour en 2011 .
Chipchura , réclamé au premier tour de la séance de repêchage de 2004 , est le quatrième premier choix de l'équipe qui quitte l'organisation en l'espace de cinq mois , après Chris Higgins ( 2002 ) , Mike Komisarek ( 2001 ) et Ryan McDonagh ( 2007 ) .
Higgins et McDonagh ont été impliqués dans l'échange de Scott Gomez , avec les Rangers de New York , fin juin .
Komisarek , lui , a accepté l'offre contractuelle des Maple Leafs de Toronto , à l'ouverture du marché des joueurs autonomes , début juillet .
La semaine dernière , l'organisation a jeté l'éponge dans le cas de Latendresse , deuxième choix ( 45e au total ) en 2005 .
On a cédé l'ailier au Wild afin de mettre la main sur Benoit Pouliot , premier choix du Wild en 2005 , tout juste devant Carey Price .
Price est d'ailleurs l'un des deux premiers choix qu'a formés le Canadien , entre les années 2000 et 2007 , l'autre étant Andrei Kostitsyn ( 2003 ) .
" En raison de l'arrivée de Pouliot et de l'émergence de quelques jeunes de l'équipe - école de Hamilton , les Ryan White , Tom Pyatt et Sergei Kostitsyn , l'organisation a jugé préférable de l'envoyer ( Chipchura ) sous d'autres cieux et d'obtenir un choix de repêchage " , a expliqué l'entraîneur Jacques Martin .
Le Canadien n'avait pas le loisir de retourner Chipchura aux Bulldogs , sans avoir à soumettre son nom au " ballottage " , d'où la transaction .
En 68 matchs dans la LNH depuis que le Tricolore a appelé son nom au 18e rang de la séance de 2004 , le patineur natif de Westlock , en Alberta , a cumulé une fiche de quatre buts et 10 passes .
Cette saison , il n'avait pas récolté de point en 19 rencontres , ayant écopé 16 minutes de pénalités et montrant un piètre rendement de moins - 10 en défense .
Mardi , Chipchura n'a effectué que quatre présences sur la glace totalisant 1:59 de temps de jeu .
Il a été sur la patinoire pour les deux premiers buts des Leafs , étant directement responsable du deuxième .
" C'est difficile de voir partir un bon ami .
Nous étions très proches l'un de l'autre , a souligné Price .
Nous avons gagné la coupe Calder ensemble dans la Ligue américaine en 2007 et nous sommes arrivés au même moment chez le Canadien . "
Le jeune gardien s'est dit heureux pour lui qu'il puisse relancer sa carrière ailleurs .
A Anaheim , il retrouvera son ancien capitaine , Saku Koivu .
" Tout ce qu'il a besoin , c'est d'obtenir une bonne occasion de faire ses preuves , a avancé Price .
Chez le Canadien , il a quelque peu eu sa chance , mais il doit en avoir une meilleure .
De repartir en neuf dans une autre organisation est ce qu'il lui fallait .
Kyle est un bon joueur , doté d'un bon sens du jeu , en plus d'être très fiable en défense . "
Chipchura était en ville , mercredi , mais indisponible pour répondre aux questions des journalistes , nous a -t - on indiqué .
Possédant de bonnes aptitudes de meneur , il était fort discret dans l'entourage de l'équipe cette saison .
Comme Latendresse , il devait sentir le tapis lui glisser sous les pieds .
Joueur de centre naturel , il avait été muté à l'aile , dernièrement .
A l'entraînement , on lui a même demandé de " remplir un chandail " comme défenseur .
" C'est un autre bon gars qui part , a commenté le joueur de centre Maxim Lapierre , qui était l'inséparable compagnon de Latendresse jusqu'à son départ .
Je lui souhaite de connaître du succès dans sa nouvelle équipe .
C'est un gars qui travaille fort et qui a une bonne attitude . "
Le départ de deux joueurs envoie - t - il le message au reste de l'équipe qu'on ne se montrera pas patient ?
" Ces choses - là ne me regardent aucunement , a répondu Lapierre .
Je ne commencerai pas à analyser chacun des mouvements de personnel que fait l'équipe . "
At every stage of early development , human babies lag behind infants from other species .
A kitten can amble across a room within moments of birth and catch its first mouse within weeks , while its wide - eyed human counterpart takes months to make her first step , and years to learn even simple tasks , such as how to tie a shoelace or skip a rope , let alone prepare a three - course meal .
Yet , in the cognitive race , human babies turn out to be much like the tortoise in Aesop ’s fable : emerging triumphant after a slow and steady climb to the finish .
As adults , we drive fancy sports cars , leap nimbly across football fields and ballet stages , write lengthy dissertations on every conceivable subject , and launch rockets into space .
We have a mastery over our selves and our environments that is peculiar to our species .
Yet , this victory seems puzzling .
In the fable , the tortoise wins the race because the hare takes a nap .
But , if anything , human infants nap even more than kittens !
And unlike the noble tortoise , babies are helpless , and more to the point , hopeless .
They could not learn the basic skills necessary to their independent survival even if they tried .
How do human babies manage to turn things around in the end ?
In a recent article in Current Directions in Psychological Science , Sharon Thompson - Schill , Michael Ramscar and Evangelia Chrysikou make the case that this very helplessness is what allows human babies to advance far beyond other animals .
They propose that our delayed cortical development is precisely what enables us to acquire the cultural building blocks , such as language , that make up the foundations of human achievement .
Indeed , the trio makes clear that our early vulnerability is an evolutionary “ engineering trade - off , ” much like the human larynx — which , while it facilitates the intricate productions of human speech , is actually quite a precarious adaptation for anyone trying to swallow safely .
In the same way , they suggest , our ability to learn language comes at the price of an extended period of cognitive immaturity .
This claim hinges on a peculiar and unique feature of our cognitive architecture : the stunningly slow development of the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) .
While other animals ’ brain regions development in synchrony , in humans , the development of the PFC lags far behind that of other areas .
The PFC is the swath of gray matter that makes up the anterior frontal lobes , and functionally , it appears to be heavily implicated in a wide - range of sophisticated planning and attention driven behaviors .
Indeed , it is often referred to as the “ control ” center of the brain .
One of its main functions appears to be that of selectively filtering information from the senses , allowing us to attend to specific actions , goals , or tasks .
For this reason , “ cognitive control ” tasks are thought to be one of the best assessors of PFC function and maturity , and they are tests that young children reliably , and ignominiously , fail .
The Stroop task serves as a simple assessor of PFC function in adults .
The task involves naming the ink color of a contrasting color word : for example , you might see the word “ red ” written in green ink , in which case you have to say “ green . ”
The task is tricky since it demands that we override a well learned response ( saying “ red ” in response to seeing the word red ) with a new response specific to the task ( naming the conflicting ink color ) .
Tricky or not , healthy adults can successfully complete the task with only minor hesitation .
Children , with their immature PFC’s , are a different story .
Typically , the younger children are , the worse they are at solving Stroop - like tasks , and under the age of four , they outright fail them .
While young children are sensitive , apt learners , and often appear to fully understand what is being asked of them , they are unable to mediate the conflicting demands present in these sorts of tasks , and thus fail them , time and time again .
Three - year olds simply cannot direct how they attend to or respond to the world .
Thompson - Schill and her colleagues suggest that this inability to direct attention has important consequences when it comes to learning about uncertain events .
To explain this , it helps to imagine you are playing a guessing game :
You have to choose one of two options , either A or B , one of which leads to a prize , and one of which does not .
After a few rounds , you notice that about three fourths of the time the prize is at A , and the rest of the time it is at B , so you decide to guess “ A ” 75 percent of the time and “ B ” 25 percent of the time .
This is called probability matching , and it is the response pattern most adults tend to adopt in these circumstances .
However , if the goal is to win the most prizes , it is not the best strategy .
In fact , to maximize the number of correct predictions , you should always pick the more frequent outcome ( or , in this case , always pick “ A ” ) .
Interestingly , if you were playing this kind of guessing game with a toddler , you would see that they would employ the maximization strategy almost immediately .
Thompson - Schill and her colleagues suggest that this is because toddlers lack the cognitive flexibility that would allow them to alternate between A and B .
Since young children are unable to selectively switch between responses , they can only choose the most likely option .
Fortunately for them , in this guessing game scenario , maximization is the right choice .
While it may not be immediately obvious what this has to do with language learning , it just might have everything to do with it , because language relies on conventions .
In order for language to work , speakers and listeners have to have the same idea about what things mean , and they have to use words in similar ways .
This is where toddlers come in .
Young children , as it turns out , act like finely tuned antennas , picking up the dominant frequency in their surroundings and ignoring the static .
Because of this – because toddlers tend to pick up on what is common and consistent , while ignoring what is variable and unreliable – they end up homing in on and reproducing only the most frequent patterns in what they hear .
In doing so they fail to learn many of the subtleties and idiosyncrasies present in adult speech ( they will come to learn or invent those later ) .
However , this one - track learning style means that what they do learn is highly conventionalized .
The superiority of children ’s convention learning has been revealed in a series of ingenious studies by psychologists Carla Hudson - Kam and Elissa Newport , who tested how children and adults react to variable and inconsistent input when learning an artificial language .
Strikingly , Hudson - Kam and Newport found that while children tended to ignore “ noise ” in the input , systematizing any variations they were exposed to , adults did just the opposite , and reproduced the variability they encountered .
So , for example , if subjects heard “ elle va à la fac ” 60 % of the time and “ elle va à fac ” 40 % of the time , adult learners tended to probability match and include “ la ” about 60 % of the time , whereas younger learners tended to maximize and include “ la ” all of the time .
While younger learners found the most consistent patterns in what they heard , and then conventionalized them , the adults simply reproduced what they heard .
In William James ’ terms , the children made sense of the “ blooming , buzzing confusion ” they were exposed to in the experiment , whereas the adults did not .
Children ’s inability to filter their learning allows them to impose order on variable , inconsistent input , and this appears to play a crucial part in the establishment of stable linguistic norms .
Studies of deaf children have shown that even when parental attempts at sign are error - prone and inconsistent , children still extract the conventions of a standard sign language from them .
Indeed , the variable patterns produced by parents who learn sign language offers insight into what might happen if children did not maximize in learning : language , as a system , would become less conventional .
What words meant and the patterns in which they were used would become more idiosyncratic and unstable , and all languages would begin to resemble pidgins .
While no language is completely stable , there is a balance to be struck between an individual ’s expressivity and the conventions that underpin it , and children clearly play an important role in maintaining this balance .
Children may learn the established idiosyncrasies of their community ( saying “ eggplant ” instead of “ aubergine ” or “ parking lot ” for “ car park , ” for example ) , but they do so only because these forms are stable in their input .
They are unlikely to adopt highly unusual or idiosyncratic forms or sequences that they ’ve heard only rarely , and when they themselves make errors , they are similarly unlikely to incorporate these errors into their language use over the long run .
Individual societies are built upon these kinds of cultural and linguistic conventions , and a vast array of them .
As social animals , human babies must somehow master not just “ culture and language , ” but the specifics of their culture , and their language .
Explaining how babies manage to learn all of this information is a formidable task .
The research reviewed here reveals one advantage that nature may have conferred on human infants : when it comes to convention learning , children ’s inability to think unconventionally or flexibly may be of huge benefit .
Indeed , a number of neurological studies suggest that autistic children , who often exhibit marked language delays and idiosyncratic language development , experience a massive overgrowth of the prefrontal cortex over the first two years of life .
It might be that if children were able to think like adults , they simply could not learn conventions in the same way , if at all .
If that were the case , we might not be winning any races after all .

Roses are red ,
Violets are purple ,
Which is a very hard word to rhyme
And makes me happy that on February the 14th we do n't traditionally have to give each other oranges .
Democrats may feel today as though they just fought -- and won -- the equivalent of a 100 - year war .
The House passage Sunday night of sweeping healthcare legislation ends months of caustic debate over the plan and the way it was enacted , marked by a steep decline in approval for Democrats almost everywhere .
Now , they hope , the discussion will finally shift in their favor .
President Obama was spared a devastating defeat , and squabbling lawmakers showed they could accomplish something epic and important in the face of unanimous GOP opposition .
That should count for something , they hope , at a time when many voters had written off Washington as utterly dysfunctional .
“ The American people got too close a look at how Congress actually legislates and that ’s an ugly thing , ” said Jim Jordan , a Democratic campaign strategist .
“ Once the legislative process is done , the debate turns to what ’s in the bill , ” adding that what ’s in the bill is , “ by and large , extremely popular with the public . ”
But in fact , the political battle is just beginning .
The party now must live or die with its landmark legislation in hundreds of congressional districts across the country , in the most hostile midterm election climate Democrats have faced since the Republican landslide year of 1994 .
“ Given that Democrats have basically lost the healthcare messaging fight for the last year , I ’m not sure why we should think they will begin to win over the next seven months , ” said Charlie Cook , one of Washington ’s leading election handicappers .
Strikingly , both sides walked away Sunday night believing they had won politically .
Republicans were not rejoicing .
They lost the vote , after all .
But party strategists were convinced Sunday ’s vote would enhance their chances of winning control of the House and maybe the Senate in November ’s elections .
To their mind , passing a sweeping healthcare overhaul in the face of negative public opinion -- and turning legislative somersaults to accomplish the feat -- only served to underscore the arrogance and obtuseness of the Democratic majority .
“ Their choice was to pass bad legislation or prove they ’re incapable of governing , ” said David Winston , a Republican pollster who works closely with the party ’s House and Senate leadership .
Moreover , he said , the effort was off point ; by far the greatest concern of most voters is the nation ’s stubbornly high unemployment rate .
“ When are they going to get time to sell this thing ? ” Winston asked .
“ They need to be talking about jobs . ”
This year figured to be tough for Democrats , whatever happened Sunday .
The party holding the presidency almost always loses House seats in the first midterm vote .
Since World War II the average is 16 .
( It ’s been pretty much a wash in Senate races . )
Democrats would be thrilled if that were the outcome Nov. 2 , but it seems highly unlikely in this seething anti-incumbent environment .
Handicappers give Republicans a good shot at picking up several dozen
House seats in November and a decent chance of winning the 40 needed to seize control of the chamber .
The GOP needs 10 seats to take the Senate and , though that seems a much taller order , it is not out of the question .
For Democrats , the next several months will be spent trying to hold down their losses , which makes passage of the gargantuan healthcare bill all the more audacious -- especially when the chief animating force in politics today is a profound mistrust of Washington and anger over the expansive growth of government , embodied by the rise of the “ tea party ” movement .
Democrats are betting they can gain from a number of the provisions in the bill , including popular measures that would allow adult children to stay on their parents ’ policies until they turn 27 , close the gap that forces some on Medicare to pay more for drugs and ban insurance companies from denying or dropping coverage for people because of preexisting conditions .
They also believe they will benefit from all the things that wo n’t happen after Obama signs the legislation :
The sky wo n’t fall , grandma wo n’t be put to death , federal troops wo n’t be occupying hospitals , as Jordan sarcastically put it .
But it ’s hard to benefit politically just because things do n’t turn out as bad voters feared .
Consider last year ’s economic stimulus package , which experts say prevented a steep economic downturn from being a whole lot worse .
Obama and Democrats have received little credit for their rescue effort ; to the contrary , the stimulus and serial bailouts that began under President George W. Bush have only fueled populist anger .
Politicians like to say that good policy makes good politics , and some believe it .
The merits of the bill passed Sunday will be debated for years to come .
ObamaCare , as opponents derisively call it , may eventually prove as popular as Social Security and Medicare , two programs that provoked fierce debate but , over time , grew politically sacrosanct .
Even so , Democrats must have in the back of their minds the memory of President Lyndon Johnson who , upon signing the 1964 Civil Rights Act , said his party had lost the South for a generation .
It ’s been longer than that , though few today would question the rightness of outlawing racial segregation in theaters , restaurants , hotels and other public places .
That may prove cold comfort , however , for Democrats who cast an aye vote Sunday and , as a result , may have to await history ’s verdict in forced retirement .

Thousands to lose jobless benefits April 5
WASHINGTON ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Extended jobless benefits will run out for at least 212,000 Americans out of work after April 5 because the Senate closed up shop Friday afternoon without a deal to extend filing deadlines .
Senate Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on passing a House version of the extension of deadlines to apply for federal unemployment benefits and the COBRA health insurance subsidy .
In 10 days , those receiving state jobless benefits wo n't be able to apply for additional federally paid unemployment insurance , and anyone already receiving those checks could be cut off .
They also wo n't be able to sign up for the 65 % federal subsidy for COBRA unemployment insurance .
Key Democrats say they hope to pass a retroactive extension , compensating the unemployed for a gap in funding , after they return from a two - week break the week of April 12 .
If approved , it would be the seventh time the deadline has been extended since June 2008 .
However , if lawmakers pass a retroactive package extending benefits , it could still take a couple of weeks to trickle down to some states with older processing systems , said Judy Conti , coordinator for the National Employment Law Project , an advocacy group .
" Those who are getting these benefits have been unemployed for at least six months and are already living paycheck to paycheck , " Conti said .
" This could really be disastrous for people .
They have no margin of error for that one week . "
On Friday , senators in both parties blamed each other for breaking without a deal .
Democrats said extending this benefits package is an emergency situation and that they 'd rather pass the House version extending benefits for another month and work toward a longer term solution .
They point out that Republicans are willing to pay for war spending without offsetting that .
" We have a crisis here , this is an emergency , " said Sen. Jack Reed , D - R.I .
" We routinely vote to aid flood - stricken areas across the country , and here we are with a disaster that 's causing thousands of people in my home state and others to be unable to provide for their families . "
Republicans - in particular , Sen. Tom Coburn , R - Okla .
- are balking at extending benefits without finding a pot of money to offset the spending .
Extending benefits costs about $ 10 billion a month .
" If we 're going to take the immoral choice and spend money that we do n't have , and not eliminate programs that are not effective , I feel obliged to stand in the way of it , " Coburn said .
Last week , the House - which adjourned Thursday - extended long - term unemployment insurance through May 5 and health insurance subsidies for jobless workers through April 30 .
The measure would also pay 2,000 furloughed workers who were put on temporary unpaid leave because legislation to fund federal highway projects is also tied up in a different congressional fight .
And it would also extend the national flood insurance program , which will expire March 28 .
About 11.5 million people currently depend on jobless benefits .
Nearly one in 10 Americans are out of work and a record 41.2 % have been unemployed for at least six months .
The average unemployment period lasts a record 30.2 weeks .
Federal unemployment benefits kick in after the basic state - funded 26 weeks of coverage expire .
During the downturn , Congress has approved up to an additional 73 weeks .
These federal benefit weeks are divided into tiers , and the jobless must apply each time they move into a new tier .
If the Senate fails to act , the jobless would stop getting checks once they run out of their state benefits or current tier of federal benefits .
In February , Sen. Jim Bunning , R - Ky. , single - handedly blocked a previous extension .
This time , Coburn 's fight gained support from several other Republicans , including Sen. George LeMieux , R - Fla. , and Sen. Susan Collins , R - Maine , a moderate who had previously opposed Bunning 's objection .
Police have charged a 13 - year - old boy with murder after the fatal stabbing of Elliott Fletcher at St Patrick 's College north of Brisbane this morning .
Elliott , 12 , died of stab wounds after an altercation at the private Catholic boys ' high school at Shorncliffe at about 8.15 am .
Distraught students were picked up early from St Patrick 's College after 12yo Elliott Fletcher ( inset ) died of stab wounds .
Police tonight said a 13 - year - old boy will appear in Brisbane Children 's Court tomorrow .
Past and present students have set up a Facebook group in Elliott 's honour .
PARIS — The British Broadcasting Corp. on Tuesday yielded to critics of its aggressive expansion , proposing sweeping cuts in spending on its Web site and other digital operations .
The proposals were published in a strategic review , only weeks before a British election that could usher in a period of austerity .
Members of the Conservative Party , which is expected to make electoral gains at the expense of the governing Labour Party , have called for the BBC to be reined in , echoing commercial rivals who have complained about the public broadcaster ’s growing reach in areas beyond traditional radio and television .
Mark Thompson , director - general of the BBC , said the plans marked a “ step - change with the past ” at the BBC , which is financed by a mandatory fee on all television - owning British households .
“ After years of expansion of our services in the U.K. , we are proposing some reductions , ” he said in a speech .
“ The point of the reductions is not to diminish the service we offer to the public , but rather to focus the license fee and the creative energy of the BBC on delivering the highest quality and the maximum public value . ”
OTOY , a remote - gaming rival to OnLive , said Wednesday that the AMD - powered Fusion Render Cloud Servers , upon which its service is built , will come to market sometime in the second quarter of 2010 .
OTOY , a remote - gaming rival to OnLive , said Wednesday that the AMD - powered Fusion Render Cloud Servers , upon which its service is built , will come to market sometime in the second quarter of 2010 .
The servers , originally at the January 2009 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , will make up the hardware infrastructure for the OTOY service , designed to allow games to be remotely played via PCs , without the need for enthusiasts to constantly reinvest in new hardware .
OTOY will compete with OnLive , which on Wednesday as well .
" In 2003 AMD delivered Opteron , ending the sole source enterprise technology barrier , " said Charlie Boswell , director of digital media and entertainment at AMD , in a statement .
" This forever changed the Internet as providers were allowed to innovate freely .
Today AMD 's Fusion Render Cloud is igniting the next evolution in cloud computing by enabling server side rendering of fully interactive HD content . "
OTOY did not announce details of its service , including service pricing and what it will cost to rent games .
But it did disclose the capabilities of the hardware , and at least implied the number of simultaneous users the service will be able to support - which is n't many .
The Fusion Render Cloud hardware will generate 3,000 concurrent HD streams ( 720p/1080 p or higher at 60 Hz , OTOY said ) for streaming video games , high end CAD programs and full virtual desktops for all major operating systems , OTOY said .
In a press release , OTOY also indicated that its service will supply an additional 12,000 concurrent SD streams at 120 Hz .
However , whether those streams will replace the HD streams , as opposed to supplementing them , could n't be absolutely confirmed .
OTOY did not say how large its potential customer base could be , based on those numbers ; since the company 's users wo n't typically log on a 24/ 7 basis , the number of potential customers should be somewhat larger than its total available concurrent streams .
Neither OTOY nor AMD representatives could be reached for comment at press time .
The compute power available to the OTOY service , via the Fusion Render Cloud servers , will be 1 petaflop of computing power , made up of 125 1U rackmount servers deploying some combination of 500 AMD " Cypress " graphics chips ( also known as the Radeon HD 5870 ) and an additional 250 AMD Opteron G34 " Magny Cours " CPUs .
The servers themselves will be designed and built by SuperMicro .
" The launch of the Fusion Render Cloud platform through Supermicro 's product line marks a major milestone for cloud computing , " said Jules Urbach , OTOY 's chief executive , in a statement .
" Streaming high performance games and graphics remotely is an indisputably disruptive technical achievement .
The very idea has invited both excitement and skepticism during the 14 months since AMD and OTOY announced their plans to enter into this space .
With the addition of a major OEM supplying servers to datacenters next quarter , this technology will be commoditized by an ecosystem of partners as diverse as the web itself .
The future of graphics in the cloud has never been brighter . "
OTOY also did not give any indication on the proximity limits it would impose on its customer base .
OnLive has been said to be building three servers across the United States , requiring each user to live within 1,000 miles or face latency , or lag , issues that may degrade game play .
Kaspersky Labs , a cybersecurity group based in Russia , was recently awarded the patent for a hardware antivirus device that aims to keep your computer secure by attaching directly to the disk drive , below rootkit access .
Advertisement
Software can always be compromised , and solution proposed by the mad geniuses at Kaspersky is to put an antivirus system deeper in your computer than your infected software can reach .
Here 's the device , as explained the abstract for the patent :
An anti-virus ( AV ) system based on a hardware - implemented AV module for curing infected computer systems and a method for updating AV databases for effective curing of the computer system .
The hardware - based AV system is located between a PC and a disk device .
The hardware - based AV system can be implemented as a separate device or it can be integrated into a disk controller .
An update method of the AV databases uses a two - phase approach .
First , the updates are transferred to from a trusted utility to an update sector of the AV system .
Then , the updates are verified within the AV system and the AV databases are updated .
The AV system has its own CPU and memory and can be used in combination with AV application .

Soldiers !
Your labours , your privations , your sufferings and your valour will not be forgotten by a grateful country . "
The inscription on the plinth below a statue of Sir Henry Havelock , Major General of the British Army during the 1857 campaign in India , is as potent as it is appropriate .
The monument stands guard at the south - eastern corner of Trafalgar Square , casting a steely eye over the junction between The Strand and Northumberland Avenue .
It 's an unusually tranquil pocket of central London today , as tourists roam around the rare open space , and the fountains drown out the rumbling of the London traffic .
And yet it was here , 20 years ago on the final day of this month , that flames sent smoke billowing into the blue skies above the capital as protests against the Poll Tax escalated into some of worst rioting post - war Britain has seen .
Tube stations were closed and much of the capital had to be cordened off as cars and police vans were set alight , shops looted and police and firefighters were pelted .
Perhaps the most enduring image from the day is the shocking sight of a woman being trampled by a charging police horse .
According to David Maynell , the then deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police , trouble sprang from only 3,000 or so protesters out of a total estimated at up to 200,000 , but the fall - out was far - reaching : £ 400,000 worth of damage , 400 arrests , 113 injured and , arguably , the downfall of Margaret Thatcher , who resigned leight months later .
The Poll Tax was a flagship policy of the Thatcher government .
It had been implemented in Scotland a year earlier and its deployment south of the border was looming , slated for the start of the new tax year the following month .
The tax would see the abolition of rates based on the value of a property , replaced by a fixed charge per adult resident and set by each local government .
In practice , critics pointed out , that meant a millionaire living alone in a mansion would pay less than the average family , but Thatcher , defending the tax earlier that month in the Commons , argued that it was " a very much fairer system than domestic rates which preceded it " , where , " a single person in one house would pay the same rates as four or five people in the next door house . "
Few agreed with her .
Particularly the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation ( the Fed ) , a national body of anti-Poll Tax unions set up by Militant Tendency , forerunners of today 's Socialist Party , who organised a mass protest march to take to the streets of London and Glasgow simultaneously .
Saturday , 31 March 1990 was an unusually warm spring day , and by 11 am a crowd had begun to gather for the initial rally in Kennington Park , south London , ahead of a march to Trafalgar Square .
Steve Glennon , the Fed 's chief steward , says it felt different to the average demonstration .
" People who had never been on a demo before in their lives came out .
That was how far - reaching an issue it was .
There was a sea of people and a real carnival atmosphere – people with kids had come out with the little ones in pushchairs . "
Drummers , bands and jugglers lent a colourful air , but did n't dilute the focus .
" I remember an electric atmosphere , " says Chris Bambery , then 34 and protesting with the Socialist Workers ' Party .
" It was really positive and everyone was keen to make a stand , " including , he recalls , the miners .
" They saw it as another chance to have a go after everything Thatcher had already put them through .
I remember a real feeling that things are changing here – we had been taking it on the chin repeatedly but enough was enough . "
Thatcher 's popularity had been sliding .
According to a March 1990 Mori poll for the Sunday Times , support for her among the electorate stood at just 15 per cent .
While the overall atmosphere was positive , problems began to emerge .
At the last minute , police changed the agreed drop - off points for more than 800 coaches , sending stewards to the wrong places .
At 1.30 pm , the crowd set off on the two - and - a - half - mile journey to Trafalgar Square , where speakers including George Galloway and Tony Benn were to address them .
The 70,000 - capacity Square filled up in no time ; police had closed off much of the immediate area , at the organisers ' request , creating space for 190,000 people in total .
Three weeks earlier , organisers had requested that the march be diverted to Hyde Park to accommodate the crowd .
The request was denied .
Jane Spencer , from north London , was 22 at the time , and went along with several friends .
" It was just such an evil tax , " she says .
" It played entirely into the hands of the wealthy and a lot of poorer people could n't afford to pay it . "
( As part of the protest , an estimated 17 million people in England also refused to pay when the tax did take effect in April .
When the tax was abolished under John Major 's leadership of the Conservative party , in 1993 , councils were £ 2bn in arrears as a result . )
Ms Spencer adds : " There was nothing like being around such a strong group ; we felt protected and untouchable – we could really change something .
It felt like we were going to overthrow the State . "
At around 4 pm , Steve Glennon got a report from a stewards at Downing Street that a sit - down protest in nearby Whitehall had become " a bit of a ruck " between police and protesters .
This was to be the turning - point .
As protesters refused to be moved , the police began making arrests – only to be pelted with missiles .
The ripple of violence spread quickly to Charing Cross Road , Pall Mall , Regent Street and Covent Garden .
" Next thing I knew , " says Chris Bambery , who was in the Square , " there were police charging up Whitehall .
At that point we did n't know what was happening at Downing Street .
The crowd just responded and ran at them , and the riot cops ran away .
That really stands out for me , the moment I saw the cops turn and run .
That 's when I knew this was different to any other demonstration I had been to . "
Carmela Ozzi , then 29 , from west London , was protesting with her then - partner and his brother and remembers vividly the feeling of unease that spread through the crowd .
" The tensions had started before we got to Trafalgar Square ; then things got really bad really quickly once we were there . "
She was caught in the thick of the action when the police returned to charge the baying crowd .
" It was very scary .
We were near a van that was driven into the crowd , and with the horses we were being pushed back and back into a corner .
I remember thinking , ' Somebody is going to get hurt here today ' .
I felt we were penned in like caged animals . "
The trio got caught up in a charge ; a scuffle ensued and she says she and her partner were arrested , trying to protect his brother .
" That day was a defining moment for me , and dreadfully painful ; I knew I would never look at the police the same again . "
Tommy Sheridan , who was chairman of the Fed , was preparing to address the crowd in Trafalgar Square when the violence erupted .
" I was standing next to George Galloway and his daughter , listening to Tony Benn speak , when it all kicked off .
George was very worried for his daughter 's safety because there were bits of wood and debris being hurled at the police . "
Meanwhile , protesters had set fire to builders '
Portacabins at a building site on the corner of The Strand and Northumberland Avenue , lacing the air with the acrid smell of burning rubber .
Meanwhile , according to Steve Glennon , a police commander was standing on the empty plinth in front of the National Gallery co-ordinating charges .
Glennon pleaded with him to call off his men in an attempt to quell the growing panic .
" We had agreed with the police that if Whitehall became blocked we would go through north Embankment and Northumberland Avenue , which we did , " explains Glennon .
" But then there was a phalanx of riot police right across the top of Northumberland Avenue stopping people getting out and causing a pressure point . "
Unable to escape , he says , fleeing protestors began to panic .
" You had this great mix of people , right down to small kids , " adds Glennon , " and yet they were all getting repeatedly charged by police horses . "
Ken Smith , then the press officer for Socialist Party newspaper Militant , arrived at the Square mid-riot .
" I heard it before seeing it , " he says .
" At first it did n't register that the noise was connected with the demonstration .
I remember a lot of sirens .
It was bewildering how something so positive had ended up in confrontation .
The approach by the police had been a big contributing factor . "
The Metropolitan Police 's David Meynell , thowever , told the BBC at the time that a peaceful march had been " completely overshadowed " by the actions of a minority who had " launched a ferocious and sustained attack on the police " .
As the crowd began to disperse , mostly back to their coaches south of the Thames , small groups of activists marauded through the affluent areas surrounding Trafalgar Square , overturning cars before setting them alight and smashing - up and looting shops .
Calm was not restored until 3am .
Now , watching huddles of tourists snapping each other in front of Nelson 's Column , it 's hard to imagine the mayhem of 20 years ago .
And despite the protest 's enduring association with violence , Chris Bambery sees it as a victory .
" We felt we had dealt a big blow to Thatcher , " he says .
" When she 's talked about on TV there are two images that are always used , the one of her being driven away in tears and the shots of Trafalgar Square .
It was one of the defining moments of her tenure .
My feelings were like everyone else 's – we were no longer on the receiving end .
We were taking a stand .
It was a moment for people power in this country . "
The law provides an exemption from the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax for every worker who has been unemployed at least 60 days and is hired after Feb. 3 through the end of this year .
Employers will get an additional $ 1,000 income tax credit for new employees retained for at least a year .
The Senate estimated the measure will cost $ 13 billion over 10 years , though most of the cost will be in the first two years .
While employers are expected to claim the credit for as many as five million workers , Timothy J. Bartik , senior economist at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research , estimated that the new law would create no more than 200,000 jobs that would not otherwise have existed .
“ The design of the Senate bill passed today is particularly beneficial to high - turnover companies , like restaurants , which in a typical year might replace fully half of their work forces , ” said John H. Bishop , an economist in the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell .
“ To get the hiring subsidy , it does n’t require that a company actually grow . ”
While the measure won support from some Republicans , others in the party were skeptical that it would help create jobs , or said they were distressed at its cost .
“ This is n’t so much a jobs bill as it is a debt bill , ” said Senator Judd Gregg , a New Hampshire Republican .
The measure is partly paid for by tightening rules on offshore tax havens , but some costs would be added to the deficit .
The bill was the first in some time to draw a sizable bloc of Republicans in the polarized Senate , an indication that some Republicans acknowledge they cannot stand in blanket opposition to Democrats on economic matters .
Some Republican support was due to the push for more road and bridge building , which creates good - paying jobs for idle construction workers .
“ The funding in this bill sends the message to struggling states like Ohio that they can move forward with shovel - ready transportation projects — projects that will put people back to work quickly and contribute to economic growth , ” said Senator George V. Voinovich , Republican of Ohio .
Is that really Bob ?
You 've seen him hundreds of mornings for the last 10 years at local coffee shops .
Since he started dating Sara , he looks you in the eye -- and smiles .
Sara takes every opportunity to let coffee shop cronies know that Bob is her guy and to gush about how funny he is .
And he is .
Who knew ?
Think of Sara like Michelangelo chipping away at a block of marble to release the ideal figure slumbering within .
A new international review of seven papers on " the Michelangelo phenomenon " shows that when close partners affirm and support each other 's ideal selves , they and the relationship benefit greatly .
" To the degree that the sculpting process has gone well , that you have helped mold me toward my ideal self , the relationship functions better and both partners are happier .
And over the long term , I more or less come to reflect what my partner sees and elicits from me , " said Eli Finkel , associate professor of psychology in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences at Northwestern University .
Finkel co-authored the review with Caryl E. Rusbult , Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam , and Madoka Kumashiro , Goldsmiths , University of London .
" The Michelangelo Phenomenon " appears in the December issue of the journal Current Directions in Psychological Science .
The Michelangelo effect is not simply about supporting your partner , nor is it about promoting what you think your partner 's ideal self should be .
" Even if partners treat us in perfectly loving , supportive ways , if the treatment is not consistent with the person we dream of becoming , we have to pay attention to those red flags , " Finkel warned .
" Is that the person you want to be married to 10 years down the road ? "
The Michelangelo studies show that close partners sculpt one another 's traits and skills and promote , versus inhibit , one another 's goal achievement .
" It 's not just that you treat me positively , " Finkel said .
" You treat me in particular ways that dovetail with my ideal self . "

That 's how Sara , an outgoing person with a great social network , brought Bob 's best out in him .
Sara made Bob more comfortable being the person he wanted to be .
With Sara celebrating his ideal self , he became much funnier .
Just as the sculptor chisels , carves and polishes away flaws in the stone to reveal the ideal form , so do skillful partners support their loved ones ' dreams , aspirations and the traits they hope to develop , such as completing medical school or becoming more fluent in a second language or more sociable .
Supporting a partner 's image of his ideal self , whether it is a vague yearning or a clearly articulated mental representation , helps the loved one reduce the discrepancy between the actual self and the ideal self .
Sara consciously may interpret the disparities between Bob 's actual self and ideal self in a benevolent way .
She may help Bob become more sociable at a dinner party , for example , by subtly directing him to tell one of his most charming stories .
Conversely , a relationship can run into trouble when an individual emphasizes attributes that are peripheral to the core elements of what a partner ideally wishes to become .
Take Mary , a leading researcher and a beauty .
If she prizes her scholarly accomplishments above her physical virtues , she will feel disaffirmed when her partner affectionately refers to her as his " Colorado cutie . "
What that term of endearment represents could ultimately doom the relationship .
Some people such as Sara , who is so warm and empathic , are better sculptors than others and are particularly adept at bringing out others ' ideal selves .
Some individuals may be on the verge of achieving great personal growth and be open to any number of people who could help them .
And others , the studies show , may have a much more difficult time bringing out someone 's ideal self or be much more resistant to the Michelangelo effect .
The studies reviewed in the journal article used longitudinal procedures to examine how people grow toward their ideal selves over time as a result of how their partners treat them .
At the beginning of the studies , individuals reported on their actual and their ideal selves , and their partners reported on how they view the individuals .
To gain an external perspective , some studies incorporated the perspective of the individuals ' friends .
Across studies , individuals were especially likely to grow toward their ideal selves when their partners viewed them in line with this ideal .
The process ultimately promoted both relational and personal well - being for both partners .
" When deciding on a life partner , we consider many factors , " Finkel observed .
" But we frequently neglect to think about whether the person I hope to be in 10 years is consistent with the person you want me to be in 10 years .
When our partners can chisel and polish us in a way that helps us to achieve our ideal self , that 's a wonderful thing . "
In all the excitement over President Obama 's appearance at the briefing today , we almost forgot another item of interest : Press secretary Robert Gibbs mocking Sarah Palin for writing crib notes on the palm of her hand .
" Oh , I wrote a few things down , " Gibbs said , looking at palm when asked upcoming health care talks .
" I wrote , 'eggs , milk , and bread . ' "
( Actually , he wrote the words " hope " and " change , " Obama campaign mantras . )
Commentators have had fun with the fact that Palin glanced at notes written on her palm during her weekend appearance at the Tea Party convention in Nashville , Tenn .
Her notes included such reminders as " energy , " " budget , " and " tax . "

Hello everyone !
It 's actually finals week for me next week , so wish me luck !
Have you had the feeling where you knew exactly how much work you had to do to ace an exam , but did n't have the time ?
That 's how I feel now .
ARGH .
I 've been procrastinating with this .
I also saw Caprica this week .
It 's set pre-Battlestar - era roughly half a decade , detailing the creation of the very first cybernetic life - form node , or cylon .
I actually did n't like it as much as I liked the Battlestar Galactica mini series .
It 's not that it was n’t a good movie ... it did raise a lot of interesting questions ( Is it right to create humans ?
What makes up a human ?
Etc. ) , and was well - paced , and such .
It 's just ... BSG just appealed to me a lot more .
Apparently it 's been picked up for 2010 , though .
I suppose I ’ll be watching it out of loyalty .
Speaking of humanoid robots ...
I also rewatched Blade Runner this weekend , and it was neat to see Edward James Olmos ( Commander Adama ) young and such !
I did n't remember that Blade Runner had coined the term " skinjob " for humanoid robots .
Um , I also saw the Bones season finale .
… Talk about jumping the shark .
I wo n’t discuss it more for those who have n't seen it yet .
Colleen bought me the StarCraft novelizations at a book sale , so I guess I can read those for the plane ride back to California . =)
Without Wax ,

As a marketing guy I know fear is a powerful tool to influence people .
With that said , say what you will about the Republicans they are masters at both staying on messaging and playing off of fear .
Fear that if Obama is elected the terrorist are going to come kill you .
Fear that if health care reform is passed the government will let your mother or grandfather die .
The list could go on and on .
Mark my words , the Republicans are going to adopt the message used by Tony Perkins ( Family Research Council ) last night on Larry King !
The fear if DADT is repealed somebody you love and care about will be drafted and sent off to fight in Iraq or Afghanistan .
If you read the transcript form the show , and listened to the debate on a few other shows ( like Hardball ) it would seem those on the right think there are so many people ( I heard the number of 10 % on Hardball ) that would not either enlist or reenlist if " gays " serve , therefor we 'll need to institute a draft .
In a twisted sort of way , it is kind of a brilliant tactic .
First they do n't have to argue that a gay person can't fight and serve their nation just like a straight person , cause we already have many examples they can .
Or put more bluntly they do n't even have to say they flat out hate the entire LGBT community and would like to outlaw their activities .
Cause in ' 10 that would create an " Epic Fall " with a vast , vast majority of the population .
But most importantly it plays to core fears with a national security angle thrown in for good measure .
Or they do n't " hate " gay people , this is just about national security and your safety .
Now I would think how Obama and our elected leaders push back should be clear .
That the same things were said about the integration of African Americans and women into our military .
That the same arguments were most likely made by the far right in Canada , EU nations , Israel , and Australia and the " world did n't end " when gays were allowed to openly serve .
That is there are already members of the LGBT community serving in all branches of our military and it seems to be functionality pretty darn well .
And finally our troops also serve with Canadian , NATO / EU , and Australia troops where their policies on this topic are the exact opposite of ours and I 've never heard a single report of a problem .
But alas , I do n't think we 're even going to see this talking point coming , getting blind - sided yet again , much less have the ability to push back on it in an effective manner .
Therefore like the " Death Panels " and many other examples we could all list it is going to take a " hold " with the public as something that is just true and the next thing you know folks like Nelson , Bayh , Landrieu , Lieberman ( OK , bad example ) , et al will jump to the Republicans on this issue .
At this point the repeal of DADT will either ( 1 ) fail or ( 2 ) get studied for the next few years with nothing ever happening .
Again , mark my words !
Update :
It appears Tony Perkins is citing a Military Times email survey ( which they appear to conduct each year ) of their subscribers .
A total and complete take down of the entire methodology of said survey is here and worth a read .
The actual , snarkless AP caption for the photo above :
Tim Beach , Vice President of Game Operations and Events for the New York Islanders and Media Intern Josh Mevorach hold an 18 foot piece of aluminum flashing that fell 50 feet from the roof of the Nassau Coliseum due to severe weather .
A 12 x 12 foot piece of aluminum flashing also fell during an NHL hockey game Saturday , March 13 , 2010 , in Uniondale , N.Y. ( AP Photo / Kathy Kmonicek )
A bit from the Post , under the heading " Nassau Coliseum Falling Apart " :
Strong winds brought down two pieces of the aluminum façade that goes around the entire building at approximately 5:30 yesterday -- about 90 minutes before the Islanders hosted the Devils -- near the box office .
The larger piece was 10 feet by 18 feet .
The jokes write themselves , what with the age of the building , the squabbles over the lease and a replacement venue , and the tales of locker room plumbing problems of yore .
But the nostalgic sap in me always come back to the acoustic purity of stuff like this :
While succeeding in modern NHL hockey requires the " enhanced revenue streams " and other assorted inflationary non-hockey mumbo - jumbo * a new venue provides , the act of watching hockey does n't require any of that .
* This $ 5 pizza ?
Now magically an $ 8.50 pizza !
Just for you !
Progress !
How 'bout a $ 12 beer with that ?
We 'll even tell you when to cheer !
I 've been to the glitzy new arenas with their shiny glass exteriors , plush seats , unfortunate sound - absorbing surfaces and special sections for corporate donors .
I 've also experienced some of the now - extinct old barns .
Very real and overdue reasons for a new Islanders venue aside , when an intense NHL game is on the line and the crowd is there for hockey , I know which place I 'd rather be : I 'll take the frills - free noisy old barn , every time .
( Of course if I need to get to the bathroom or need a mid - game sushi , well that 's another matter . )
So what do Israelis think of it all ?
Friday is weekend newspaper day in Israel , and when the political waters are stormy that ’s normally an occasion for the big papers to tell the public what their fellow citizens think with some new polling data .
This week was certainly not without its political turmoil in Israel , and this sabbath ’s papers did not disappoint .
The leading circulation daily Yedioth Ahronoth and the more high - brow Ha’aretz both carried new surveys delving into the U.S. - Israel spat and how it is impacting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government .
Israel Radio ( Reshet Bet ) released its more minimalist numbers yesterday .
Bits and pieces of this have been reported in the English language media , including the Ha’aretz headline , " Most Israelis see Obama as fair and friendly , " but we are not aware of a more comprehensive translation of this new data regarding Israeli public attitudes .
So here it is – with only a little editorializing .
Bottom line – opinion , unsurprisingly , is divided on whom to blame and what next , with sympathy for the position of the Obama administration polling higher than might have been expected .
Netanyahu has been hurt by this - noticeably though not dramatically - and there is a suggestion that the right - ward shift in Israeli opinion is beginning to be reversed when the consequences of the right ’s policies for U.S. - Israel relations are brought into sharp relief .
The polling numbers are divided into thematic categories below , and the more in the local , political weeds parts of the surveys have not been translated ( it might be entertaining to discover , for instance , that only 8 percent of Israelis know which position Deputy PM Dan Meridor holds in the government , but it is of little consequence on this side of the pond ) .
1. U.S. - Israel relationship
Yedioth : " Can Israel exist securely without the support of the U.S. ? "
Yes - 28 percent ; No -68 percent .
Ha’aretz : " Do you think Obama was exploiting the building in Jerusalem to try and bring down the Netanyahu government ? "
Yes - 31 percent ; No -55 percent ;
Do n’t know - 14 percent .
Israelis value and understand the importance of the U.S. relationship to Israel and most are instinctively uncomfortable when the relationship appears in any way wobbly , especially when their own government might be behaving in an irresponsible manner .
Early this week , Yedioth ran a several article feature on how a deterioration in U.S. - Israel relations could negatively impact Israel , including in terms of the economy , security , and diplomatic cover in the world .
When Netanyahu was first prime minister in the late 1990’s and when Yitzhak Shamir was prime minister in the beginning of that decade both were seen to cause ruptures in the special relationship , and both lost subsequent elections in part though not exclusively as a consequence of that .
Jeffrey Goldberg in his blog has claimed that Obama is trying to bring down the Netanyahu government – Israelis apparently do n’t see it that way .
2 . This week ’s disagreement : who was to blame ; to freeze or not to freeze
Haaretz : " How would you define PM Netanyahu ’s management of this episode – responsible or irresponsible ? "
Responsible - 42 percent ; Irresponsible - 37 percent ;
Do n’t know - 27 percent .
Yedioth : " Who is to blame for the crisis with the U.S. ? "
Israel - 35 percent ; U.S. - 37percent .
Israel Radio : " Who contributed more to this crisis between the U.S. and Israel ?
Mainly Barack Obama - 41 percent ; mainly Benjamin Netanyahu - 37 percent ; both of them equally - 7 percent
Israel Radio : " Do you think the American government ’s response toward Netanyahu and Israel was …" Justified and at a correct and appropriate level - 17 percent ; Justified but totally exaggerated - 31 percent ; Both unjustified and exaggerated - 43 percent .
Haaretz : " Some say that Israel needs to stop building in Jerusalem until the conclusion of negotiations with the Palestinians , others say that Israel needs to continue building in all of the city even if the cost is tension with the United States .
What is your position ? "
Keep building in all Jerusalem with cost vis U.S. - 48 percent ; Stop building in Jerusalem through negotiations - 41 percent ;
Do n’t know - 11 percent .
Yedioth : " Should the construction in East Jerusalem be frozen as well ?
Yes - 46 percent ; No -51 percent .
Yedioth : " Should Netanyahu extend the construction freeze in the settlements ? "
He should extend the freeze - 44 percent ;
He should stop the freeze - 46 percent .
It can be considered somewhat eye - opening that the numbers are so evenly split on responsibility and blame , and on whether to build or not in East Jerusalem – especially given everything we had been previously told about how little trust Israelis place in Obama .
Israelis are not rallying behind their prime minister in great numbers .
That such high percentages would support an East Jerusalem freeze is perhaps most striking .
Jerusalem is , of course , a particularly contentious issue and the freeze position has almost zero support in the Knesset ( the number of Zionist members of Knesset who express support for an East Jerusalem freeze can be counted on less than one hand ) .
The Israeli public is well ahead of its elected officials on this score .
3. President Obama ’s standing in Israel
Only the Ha’aretz poll explored the broader issue of how Israelis view the current U.S. president , and it picked up on a story this week in which Benjamin Netanyahu ’s brother - in - law very publicly accused Obama of being an anti-Semite .
" There are people who claim that President Obama is an anti-Semite – do you agree or disagree ? "
Agree - 27 percent ; Disagree - 56 percent ;
Do n’t know - 17 percent .
" How would you define the way in which President Obama relates to Israel ? "
To the point ( or " fair " in the Ha’aretz headline translation - 51 percent ; Hostile - 21 percent ; Friendly - 18 percent ;
Do n’t know - 10 percent .
The numbers hardly hit a historical high note for an American president , but largely accord with what this New America Foundation poll found late last year and further put to rest the misreported and essentially spurious " single digit approval rating " meme that some Republican and pro-Israel right wing sympathizers continue to promote .
A minority but a numerically noteworthy one in Israel clearly do not like or trust the president and are willing to use the anti-Semite label .
4 . How does this affect Netanyahu ’s standing ?
Haaretz : " Are you satisfied or not satisfied with the performance of PM Netanyahu ? " Satisfied - 42 percent ;
Not satisfied - 44 percent ;
Do n’t know - 14 percent .
Yedioth : " Does the government , in its decisions and its behavior , represent you ? "
Yes - 31 percent ; No - 64 percent .
Yedioth : " Does Netanyahu lead the government , or do his partners lead him ? "
He leads - 41 percent ;
He is led - 47 percent .
Israel Radio – " In terms of leadership ability , to what extent is PM Netanyahu suitable to being Israel ’s prime minister ? "
Very suitable - 16 ½ percent ; Suitable enough - 27 percent ;
Not so suitable - 26 percent ;
Not at all suitable 25 percent .
Yedioth : " Who is most suitable to serve as prime minister ? " Benjamin Netanyahu - 41 percent ; Tzipi Livni-33 percent ; Ehud Barak - 11 perecent .
Ha’aretz : " Who is most suitable to be prime minister ? " Benjamin Netanyahu - 36 percent ; Tzipi Livni -26 percent ; Avigdor Lieberman - 9 percent ; Ehud Barak - 6 percent .
The Yedioth poll also has numbers that show Israelis would much prefer Kadima to be in the governing coalition in place of Shas and Yisrael Beiteinu ( Lieberman ’s party ) .
These approval / suitability numbers are not good for Bibi , and he is on a downward trend in terms of his personal ratings ( will try to update this later with comparative numbers over time , but they are down ) .
Netanyahu has taken a knock from this latest episode .
The flipside is that Israelis are still not convinced that Opposition Leader Livni is suited for the top job .
Part of that is no doubt that she has simply never been prime minister , but it also shows that she still has some convincing to do .
Ehud Barak is irrelevant as a leader of the Labor Party but extremely useful to Netanyahu internationally as an apparent legitimizer of the government ’s " pro-peace " credentials – not surprising then that Barak is reportedly joining Netanyahu and will be in all of the meetings during his U.S. visit next week .
5 . And its impact on Israeli electoral politics
Yedioth : " If Knesset elections were to be held today , how would you vote ? "
Kadima - 32 ; Likud - 29 ; Yisrael Beiteinu - 13 ; Shas - 10 ; Labor Party - 8 ; Meretz - 6 ; United Torah Judaism - 6 ; Hadash - 4 ; United Arab List - Arab Movement for Renewal - 4 ; Balad - 3 ; National Union - National Religious Party - 3 ; Jewish Home - 2 .
( Israel Radio did a similar poll , but they included as an option a non-existent party that is thus far only being talked about and that would be led by popular TV and media personality Yair Lapid .
The non-existent party polled sufficiently high – 14 seats as to categorize that poll under the heading quirky rather than serious ) .
In many ways , this is the big news – it is the first poll for some considerable time that has the center - left back in play as a potential governing alternative by approaching the magical Israeli political number of 61 ( the Knesset has 120 seats ) .
It may prove to be a one - off but if not , this begins to get interesting .
Israeli politics basically divides into the following blocs : right / far - right / religious right versus center / center - left / Arab - left .
These are of course generalizations but the division into two blocs , right versus center - left along these lines , is the defining one in Israeli politics and in forming governing coalitions .
In the last election , the split was right 65 - center - left 55 , and since then the numbers have trended further rightwards .
This recent poll had the split at 70 - 50 to the right .
This weekend ’s numbers swing back to a competitive 63 - 57 divide .

To add to the Numberwatch big list of things supposedly caused by global warming , there ’s now an oddball “ irrefutable ” ( their words ) story circulating around the net since Friday from Craig Anderson , a psychologist from Iowa State university known for video game violence studies , shown at left .
A Google News search reveals a number of news outlets picking this story up .
The source for all these stories seems to be this one article in Newswise :
Researchers Present Study on How Global Climate Change Affects Violence
In that article , they cite it as :
Released : 3/19/2010 1:00 PM
EDT
Source : Iowa State University
Problem is when you go to Iowa State to look for the source of the press release , it ca n’t be found .
For example look at the Iowa State News site at : http://www.news.iastate.edu/
it is not listed on the page , nor if you look at the release page http://www.news.iastate.edu/releases/ page .
Or do a search using their search engine .
On that search I found a vignette done apparently on Feb 26th , but no official Iowa State news release .
Here ’s the meat of the vignette , which looks like it was written for an internal newsletter :
He found that increases in average annual temperature or global warming , has an increasing effect on murders and assaults in this country , even after controlling for a variety of other factors .
“ For every one degree increase in average temperature , we can expect an increase of 4.58 additional murders and assault cases per every 100,000 people , ” Anderson said .
“ There are obviously other factors involved , ” he continued .
“ I would never claim that temperature alone would be the main factor that causes violent crime to be higher .
However , there is now considerable evidence from a variety of sources that suggesting that high temperature is one cause that contributes to violent behavior , including violent criminal activity . ”
Note to Anderson : correlation is not causation
Iowa State ’s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences news page also does not list the story about Anderson ’s claims on global warming driving increased violence .
I did find a mention that Anderson has a paper in the journal Current Directions in Psychological Science but the latest 2010 edition is apparently not online .
It appears Anderson may have done his own press release , because I certainly have n’t been able to find any evidence that Iowa State official made any sort of news release of Friday March 19th , as cited by the “ ground zero ” Newswise story .
It is odd that Iowa State does n’t have any official release .
Maybe something will turn up Monday at the Iowa State News site .
In the meantime , his last offical news release on video games and violence gets a thorough drubbing from Techdirt :
===================================
Long Time Video Game Critic Claims Conclusive Evidence That Violent Video Games Cause Aggression ; Conclusive Except That It Is n’t …
from the except - for - the - details dept
excerpt :
So it seems a bit ridiculous for anyone — especially a professor who has been solidly on one side of the debate for many years , to stand up and claim that he has conclusively shown that violent video games make kids more “ aggressive ” ( found via Slashdot ) .
First , note the choice of words : not violent , but aggressive .
Iowa State psychology professor Craig Anderson , who has already staked his reputation on saying that violent video games have a negative impact on kids , is n’t about to back down .
He claims that he went through 130 studies and concluded that the support is unequivocal :
“ We can now say with utmost confidence that regardless of research method — that is experimental , correlational , or longitudinal — and regardless of the cultures tested in this study [ East and West ] , you get the same effects , ” said Anderson , who is also director of Iowa State ’s Center for the Study of Violence .
“ And the effects are that exposure to violent video games increases the likelihood of aggressive behavior in both short - term and long - term contexts .
Such exposure also increases aggressive thinking and aggressive affect , and decreases prosocial behavior . ”
Of course , reality is a bit more fuzzy .
The same journal that is publishing Anderson ’s new paper is also publishing a commentary from other researchers who disagree and suggest that Anderson has a pretty bad selection bias problem .
But the biggest problem — as we noted above , is that all of these “ violent video games are bad ” studies seem to show incredibly weak effects that do n’t appear to be significant in any meaningful way .
As the commentary shows :
Psychology , too often , has lost its ability to put the weak ( if any ) effects found for VVGs on aggression into a proper perspective .
In doing so , it does more to misinform than inform public debates on this issue .
Meanwhile , just last year , two Harvard Medical School professors also went through a whole bunch of different studies on violent video games and came to the exact opposite conclusions as Anderson did .
It found little actual evidence to support Anderson ’s claims , and found significant problems with research suggesting there was a serious link between violent video games and actual violence .
Among that report ’s findings :
In the last 10 years , video games studies have been overwhelmingly popular compared to studies on other media .
Less than half of studies ( 41 % ) used well validated aggression measures .
Poorly standardized and unreliable measures of aggression tended to produce the highest effects , possibly because their unstandardized format allows researchers to pick and choose from a range of possible outcomes .
The closer aggression measures got to actual violent behavior , the weaker the effects seen .
Experimental studies produced much higher effects than correlational or longitudinal studies .
As experimental studies were most likely to use aggression measures of poor quality , this may be the reason why .
There was no evidence that video games produce higher effects than other media , despite their interactive nature .
Overall , effects were negligible , and we conclude that media violence generally has little demonstrable effect on aggressive behavior .
======================================
Well I ’ll give him some credit , in a news release I could find on his video game - violence conclusion , at least he did n’t use the word “ robust ” .
Though when your link between violence and global warming is “ irrefutable ” why use a lesser word ?
Oh , and I almost forgot to mention .
Dr. Anderson has apparently embraced a whole new type of science called “ Human Thermodynamics ” .
Here ’s an encyclopedia cover at the EoHT Wiki of which he is a member :
There ’s even has an equation to quantify the human thermodynamic effect , nicely presented in a non-violent manner .
From the EoHT Wiki main page :
Tattoo ( or inking ) of the Clausius inequality ; photo by Marco Fantoni ( March , 2008 ) ; an example of art thermodynamics .
In the photo , showing a hand holding both a new and burnt match , “ the hand represents the capacity of the human mind to analyze and understand natural phenomena [ such as ] the power and imperative of irreversibility . ” [ 3 ]
He found that increases in average annual temperature or global warming , has an increasing effect on murders and assaults in this country , even after controlling for a variety of other factors .
“ For every one degree increase in average temperature , we can expect an increase of 4.58 additional murders and assault cases per every 100,000 people , ” Anderson said .
“ There are obviously other factors involved , ” he continued .
“ I would never claim that temperature alone would be the main factor that causes violent crime to be higher .
However , there is now considerable evidence from a variety of sources that suggesting that high temperature is one cause that contributes to violent behavior , including violent criminal activity . ”
UPDATE : WUWT commenter P Wilson shares this map circa 2009 and asks :
What does it show ?
Rather than Austrialia havin inexorable crime rate , the highest crime rates seem to be in relatively cool countries .
WUWT ?
Indeed , according to the map , the top ten countries for crime are :
1. Iceland
2. Sweden
3. New Zealand
4. Grenada
5. Norway
6. England and Wales
7. Denmark
8. Finland
9. Scotland
10 . Canada
With the exception of Grenada , all are cooler climate countries .
So much for Dr. Anderson ’s theory of heat in the form of AGW = crime .
Maybe that ’s why Iowa State never published a press release , they were just too embarrassed to do so .

LOST Season Six , Episode Nine : Ab Aeterno
See You In Hell
Pre-Existing Conditions
Hangman is Coming Down From the Gallows
This Place is a Prison
Here Comes the Man in Black
Jacob the Baptist
Tale of the Tape
“ Think of this wine as what you keep calling ‘ hell . ’
There ’s many other names for it , too .
Malevolence , evil , darkness .
And here it is , swirling around in the bottle , unable to get out .
Because if it did , it would spread .
The cork , is this Island .
And it ’s the only thing keeping the darkness where it belongs . ”
“ That man who sent you to kill me believes that everyone is corruptible because it ’s in their very nature to sin .
I bring people here to prove him wrong .
And when they get here , their past does n’t matter . ”
Bottled Up

that
We got Richard ’s full back story ( thankfully without lingering holes ) while doubling our total Man in Black screen time .
We got illusions of hell and the devil .
And we got one seriously symbolic bottle of wine .
I ’m going to take the unusual path of recapping this episode as it unfolded , instead of storyline - by - storyline , in hopes of making this make sense .
Here we go .
To start , we filled in the holes of Jacob ’s bedside visit with Ilana .
We learned that she was indeed tasked with protecting the six remaining candidates by shepherding them to the Island .
Lingering question : what put her in that hospital bed ?
She looks pretty roughed up , and I think it might be tied to Jacob ’s comment that this task was what she had been “ training for .
” Back on the beach , Ilana explains ( per Jacob ) that Richard will know what to do next .
After some hearty scoffing from Richard , we see the continuation of his complete and utter brokenness , his loss of faith .
He explains that Jacob is a liar and that he ’s leaving to follow someone else .
And he drops a bombshell on the gang , explaining that they ’re all dead and that the Island is , get this , hell !
As we later learned , that statement was indeed too dramatic to be true .
It was merely an extension of the suicidal Richard we saw in the Black Rock .
The bottom had dropped out of a faith he spend 150 years developing when Jacob died and MIB took over .
He was in pure desperation mode , stuck in an eternally meaningless existence without a moral compass .
And what ’s an immortal , lost soul to do in such a situation ?
Retreat to the literal jungle , and into his own figurative one .
In what constituted our first true flashback in some time , we were whisked away to Delaware .
Hi , I ’m in Delaware .
No wait , wrong thing .
We were in fact transported to a land just off the west coast of Africa , the Canary Islands .
It was 1867 , where a familiarly - distraught Richard Alpert was in a race to save his wife ’s life .
Isabella ’s case of coughing - up - blood - itis had reached its critical stage , and Richard – with her cross necklace in hand – went to see what he could do .
In town , the doctor tells Richard that the treatment Isabella needs is very expensive , and he does n’t have the money ( or collateral ) to pay him .
[ Insert your timely overreaction to health insurance reform here ] .
Tensions escalate , and Richard kills the doctor in the same exact way Desmond killed Inman : an accidental blow to the back of the head .
Medicine in hand , Richard retreats to his beloved , only to find himself a few hours late and a vile of mysterious white medicine short .
To make matters worse , Canary Island ’s finest were right behind him , ready to haul him off to jail .
What intrigues me about Richard ’s story is how very ordinary it was .
There was nothing supernatural about him .
He did not seem “ special . ”
He was simply a man who got caught up in all the wrong kinds of circumstances , and had to pay the price .
It ’s almost as if Richard ’s normalcy is the grounding force – the palate cleanser – that Jacob needed in order to deal with all his varies tortured and pre-destined souls on the Island .
Yup , second Styx lyric referenced by a subhead this season .
Count it .
Imprisoned for physicia - cide , Richard reveals to a ( probably crooked ) priest that he is learning English , from a bible opened to a passage about Jesus casting a demon out of a man in Galilee .
The priest tells Richard that his sins cannot be absolved , and that penance is not an option , as his hanging has already been scheduled .
It is here that the seed of “ hell , ” is planted in Richard ’s head by the priest , who tells him that ’s right where he ’s headed .
But not yet .
En route to the gallows , blindfolded Richard is intercepted by Captain Magnus Hanso , who purchases him as an indentured servant for his ship , The Black Rock .
Side note : Hanso – as Maggie pointed out – is the surname of the Dharma Initiative ’s financier ( Alvar Hanso ) .
Chew on that one .
How did the Black Rock get to the Island ?
How did the statue get destroyed ?
How did the ship get so far inland ?
Three questions , one answer : a hell of a tsunami .
I kind of brush that off as a copout on the answers to those questions , but I ’ll forgive it , if only because this episode included a minimum amount of dialogue from Sun.
Alpert and the other slaves awaken on the ship , hearing their overlords lament their plight .
Captain Hanso comes downstairs , and in his anger kills three slaves .
But just before he can preemptively kill Richard , the familiar tick - tock of Smokey is heard , and the death rattles of the Black Rock ’s commanding officers follow .
As blood drips onto Hanso , he looks up just in time to see Smokey lift him out of the ship and kill him .
I ’ll say one thing for Smokey , he makes an entrance .
In fact , you could say it ’s a calling card of sorts .
Remember that the first time we saw him ( in the Pilot episode ) , he jolted Jack , Kate and Charlie from the fuselage and killed the pilot ( Ha ! Pilot and Pilot , I just got that ! ) .
It would seem that Smokey – in his infinite anger over Jacob ’s relentless “ testing ” – likes to fire a little warning shot to new arrivals to the Island .
I also took notice of his scanning – and subsequent sparing – of Richard .
As Jacob later said , MIB / Smokey is on the hunt for “ corruptible ” souls .
Did he see in Richard an opportunity for corruption ?
I think so .
I think he saw Richard ’s angst over Isabella , his pressing fear of being hell - bound and his lamentation of his doomed existence .
And when he saw it , he spared Richard .
Because those very corruptible elements were something he could use later .
It brings to mind Smokey ’s scans of Kate , Eko , John Locke and others .
And it makes me wonder if MIB saw in Locke the same sort of malleable , corruptible elements – daddy issues , purposelessness , constant feelings of inadequacy and frustration with his physical paralysis .
I think he saw those in Locke , and he knew right away he might have found his ticket off the Island .
Richard – trying desperately to unshackle himself – is visited by what we can only assume is another MIB apparition .
His beloved Isabella drops by to tell him that they are indeed dead and in hell , and even mentions the devil .
Then she leaves , and we hear her scream at the hands of Smokey .
Sign of hope ?
Nah .
Try “ elaborate ruse . ”
I think that was all a Smokey production , meant to reaffirm in Richard his fears of hell and the devil .
He even used the most effective wedge possible with Richard : his dead wife .
Shame on me for questioning whether or not this dude was evil .
He is , and that manipulative hoax is all the proof I need ( until next week , when I ’ll believe he ’s good again ) .
But the Devil ’s greatest trick was convincing the world he did n’t exist .
Or , in this case , convincing Richard that the devil was someone else .
The MIB visits newly - rebroken Richard and does exactly what Locke said he did to Claire : he gives him someone to hate .
That someone , for Richard , is Jacob .
MIB tells Richard that it was Jacob who was the devil , that it was Jacob who took Isabella , that Jacob was imprisoning them both and that Jacob needs to die in order for Isabella to be safe and for them to escape hell .
And – much in the same way that Locke last week distanced himself from Smokey while speaking to his followers – MIB told Richard he was a “ friend .
” All MIB asked in return for this gift of epiphany was complete , blind allegiance .
And Richard was all too happy too oblige , even when MIB revealed that it would mean killing the devil .
How , you ask ?
With a dagger through the heart , delivered before the devil can speak .
Sound familiar ?
It should .
That ’s how Dogen told Sayid he had to kill MIB / Locke / Smokey a few weeks ago .
Also , a quick closing of a loop : MIB tells Richard that it ’s good to see him out of his chains .
This explains why Richard looked so terrified when Locke said that to him earlier this season – and why Richard knew at that moment who Locke really was .
What this all boils down to is MIB ’s very primitive , ill - conceived attempt at escape .
We saw last season the lengths that MIB had to go to in order to kill Jacob .
But last night , we saw his failed earlier attempt , using Richard .
It ’s interesting to think about how far MIB has come in his sophistication .
He went from “ use this knife , ” to “ I ’ll inhabit the dead body of one of Jacob ’s candidates , who I ’ll have to manipulate for 50 years in order to get him right into position .
” This also brings to mind a quick thought on Widmore , who told Locke that he had to get back to the Island in order to be on “ the right side ” of the war .
He ’s also the man that employed Matthew Abbadon to get people where they needed to go – which , for John Locke , meant an Australian walkabout trip that ultimately resulted in his presence on the Island .
I ’m starting to see a clearer link between Widmore and the MIB .
If Jacob had Ben , it would appear that MIB has Widmore .
Keep that in mind as you watch Charles and his submarine crew operate on the Island in the coming weeks .
Upon reaching the statue , Richard is intercepted by a stiff right hook to the jaw .
That hook belonged to Jacob , who surprised me with his fighting skills .
After roughing Richard up , Jacob takes the dagger away , and Richard reveals that it was the MIB who told him Jacob was the devil , promised him reunion with his wife , and sent him on his homicidal mission .
Half out of pity and half out of angst , Jacob sets out to prove to Richard just who exactly is good and evil .
He grabs him and drags him into the water , where he proceeds to dunk him in the water until Richard admits he wants to live .
It does n’t take a Sunday School teacher ( Maggie ) to catch the baptism symbolism here .
Jacob bestowed upon Richard a new life .
It was one with purpose , a mission and someone to follow .
As long as we ’re on the biblical tract , let me jump out of order here to talk quickly about the next - to - last scene , in which the forgiveness motif of LOST ’s final season was continued .
But this time , the forgiver and the forgiven were one in the same .
Richard Alpert finally forgave himself for the things he ’d done in the name of finding Isabella again .
Standing in the jungle , yelling for MIB to overtake him , Richard was mercifully interrupted ( and saved ) by good ole ’ fun time Hurley , who spoke Spanish and Ghost - anese to give Richard the peace , closure and acceptance he had sought for 150 years .
This moment was beautifully acted by Jorge Garcia and Nestor Carbonell .
It was a strange scene that , done wrong , would ’ve been cheesy .
But I believed the calm in Richard ’s face as Isabella left him for the last time .
And I believed the urgency in Hurley ’s voice when he told Richard that Isabella insisted he , “ Stop the man in black .
Stop him from leaving the Island , or else , we all go to hell .
” This scene , to me , was Richard Alpert ’s epiphany .
In it , we saw him reconcile his primitive notions of evil with his more learned , informed understanding of hell .
Hurley restored Richard ’s faith with one conversation , elucidating for him that hell was n’t some man in a statue or some dark - robed jungle tyrant .
What was it ?
Well , I ’ll let Jacob explain that .
Richard ’s first service at the Church of Jacob was one of the better moments of the season , as it very clearly broke down the battle between Jacob and MIB .
I ’m going to recap it pretty precisely , and in the next section I ’ll get to a bigger analysis .
Jacob seemed almost annoyed at Richard ’s preoccupation with hell and the devil .
It was as if such talk was beneath him , and what he was doing on the Island .
While I wo n’t be surprised if Jacob and the MIB ’s origins are biblical in nature , I also sense in their dialogue a sentiment that their purpose transcends religion .
Instead , their argument seems aimed at the hears and minds of mankind , and the very nature of good and evil .
Last night , Richard got a shallow , fear - based lesson in the dangers of evil from MIB .
But it was his deeper , more purposeful talk with Jacob about the power of good that held more sway .
When Richard asks Jacob why he brought the Black Rock to the Island , Jacob holds up a bottle of wine and responds , He continues , And finally , he tells Richard that his group is not the first , and that the others before him were all dead .
When Richard asks why Jacob did n’t save them , it prompts this excellent exchange : Jacob : “ I wanted them to help themselves .
To know the difference between right and wrong without me having to tell them .
It ’s all meaningless if I have to force them to do anything .
Why should I have to step in ? ” Richard : “ Because if you do n’t , he will .
” And right there , Jacob is stopped dead in his tracks .
Richard ’s assertion struck a chord , and Jacob ’s reaction was to offer Richard a job as the intermediary between himself and those he brought to the Island .
When Jacob tells Richard that he can’t pay him by absolving his sins or reuniting him with Isabella , Richard laments that he wants to live forever ( so he never has to deal with the hell of his past ) .
Bingo .
Jacob obliges with a hearty shoulder grab , and ageless Richard Alpert is born , and he delivers that message to MIB with a poignant white rock .
Then , realizing that his hope for reunion with Isabella is dead , Richard puts the necklace six feet ( okay , inches ) underground , burying his hope of ever seeing her again .
The next morning ( presumably ) , we see MIB and Jacob meet in the jungle , with MIB clutching Jacob ’s celebratory white rock .
MIB explains why he ’s trying to kill Jacob : he wants to leave .
But Jacob vows not to let that happen , and warns MIB that even if he kills him , “ Someone else will take my place . ”
MIB threatens to kill any replacement prison guard , too .
Finally , Jacob gives MIB the bottle of wine that he had used as a metaphor for their relationship when talking to Richard , and in what I think was one hugely symbolic moment , MIB smashes the bottle over a log .
Okay , here 's my take on what this all means .
I said right before that last section that Hurley redefined the notion of evil for Richard Alpert in the course of their otherworldly conversation .
And here ’s what I meant .
As explained by Jacob , evil / darkness / malevolence is not embodied by a man ( MIB , or the devil ) or a place ( the Island , or hell ) .
To Jacob , evil is the MIB ’s worldview that man is “ corruptible , ” and that “ it ’s in their very nature to sin .
” Jacob ’s metaphor of the bottle can be extrapolated out in this manner .
The “ release of MIB from the Island ” represents the permeation of evil into the world .
And to Jacob , “ evil ” is defined as mankind ’s resignation to its worst demons .
It is not the mere idea of malevolence , it ’s the acceptance of malevolence as an inevitability .
Last night , Jacob said that intervening in man ’s capacity to determine what was right or wrong was counter - productive to his end game .
He could n’t get in the way , or make man ’s decisions for him .
Why not ?
Because every man willhe does n’t want to be evil , but in order to prove the absence of evil ’s influence , man has toto turn away from it .
He has to choose to forego wrongdoing at the expense of his own selfish motives .
In this context , examine MIB ’s manipulation of Locke .
MIB / Smokey examined Locke , and found in him several corruptible elements ( the aforementioned issues with his father , his physical limitations and his inadequacies as a man ) .
And so , in order to prove himself right to Jacob , MIB manipulated Locke ( partially by manipulating Ben , another tortured soul ) into perpetrating Jacob ’s death .
And that is damn brilliant .
Because the MIB that haphazardly tried to get Richard to kill Jacob has since learned one hell of a lesson : that in order to kill Jacob , he must kill Jacob ’s premise .
Stay with me .
MIB could only kill Jacob by proving just how corruptible , evil , malleable and dark mankind could choose to be .
He did it through Locke and Ben .
And only by showcasing for Jacob just how dark their very average souls were capable of being , could that dagger finally pierce – and kill – Jacob .
And thus , MIB freed himself from the argument and the imprisonment .
This all matches up fairly well , because it would appear that in current Island time , MIB ’s got the upper hand .
He has his minions in place and Jacob is dead ( though still influencing Hurley , Jack and others ) .
The question now becomes , “ How does MIB escape ? ” I mean , this guy ’s not just gonna get on a plane and touch down at LAX to start a drug ring or something is he ?
My guess : the alternate timeline .
I ’ve theorized that the alternate timeline is the world into which MIB / Smokey and his followers will escape .
But how ?
Well , remember , the wine was MIB , the cork was the Island , and Jacob was essentially the bottle itself .
So by shattering that bottle , MIB was foreshadowing his shattering of Jacob ’s entire concept of the goodness of man in order to put all the dominos in place for his escape .
And in practice , he did that through the manipulation of Ben and Locke .
So is the alternate reality a world in which man has resigned himself to the inevitability of evil ?
Or is it a pure world , in which our characters have foregone their inner darkness in order to lead their best possible lives ?
It appears to be the latter , based on things like Jack ’s good father skills , Ben ’s selflessness , Kate ’s heart and Locke ’s acceptance of his inadequacies .
MIB 's ability to prove the inevitability of evil and corruption in this alternate reality is the very " war " that we ’ve heard allusions to for a couple season .
It involves if , when , how and to what degree “ evil ” can enter that world .
For centuries , the presence of MIB 's brand of evil has been confined to ( or " bottled up by " ) the Island .
Will he truly succeed in shattering the bottle ?
I thinkwill rely on our main characters ’ ability to channel the lessons they learned on the Island in order to do what ’s right ; and prove Jacob right once and for all .
Or they ’re all aliens .
Namaste .

Milwaukee arson investigators and state and federal fire officials have been called to the scene of a blaze that destroyed the building that houses the well - known Pizza Man restaurant Tuesday morning on the city 's east side .
The four - alarm fire started at 3:33 a.m. in the 2300 block of N. Oakland Ave. , and was declared to be under control just before 9 a.m .
Crews were able to get gas shut off to the building just before 7:30 a.m.
Firefighters have been dealing with low water pressure and needed help from We Energies to remove nearby power lines that blocked their ladder trucks .
About 150 firefighters are on the scene of the blaze , and officials have not declared that the fire is under control , a fire department spokeswoman said at 7 a.m .
All of the occupants of the building have been evacuated , and no firefighters have been injured , Milwaukee Fire Department Acting Chief Michael Jones said .
Two parts of the building collapsed as firefighters fought the blaze , Jones said .
He said the building was a total loss .
A few fire crews were at the fire within a few minutes of the initial call , but the fire quickly escalated to a four - alarm blaze , Jones said .
Firefighters from other agencies are helping to cover other areas of Milwaukee .
The night club CUSH lounge , the Greek restaurant Grecian Delight and the Black and White Cafe are in the same building as Pizza Man .
A spokeswoman for the American Red Cross said there are 10 apartment units above the businesses and that at least two apartment occupants have asked the organization for assistance .

The mainstream media reporting on Saturday ’s English Defence League and Unite Against Fascism demonstrations in Bolton has proved worryingly misleading .
It indicates that important lessons must be learned by UAF and all those who oppose the growth of the far - right EDL .
Frustratingly I was stuck in a 2 - hour tailback on the M6 on Saturday morning , so missed the first stages of the counter - demo .
However , I ’ve been able to piece together the following from speaking to people in the afternoon and from media reports ( though more on whether to trust those later ) .
Essentially , the EDL and UAF demos were scheduled to begin around 1 pm .
Greater Manchester Police had established two distinct protest areas for each group , separated by barriers ( and later by police with dogs standing between the barriers ) .
However , UAF protestors attempted to occupy the entire protest area in the morning , in a bid to deny the EDL the ability to protest at all .
The police response was one of zero - tolerance : riot police and horses were sent in , and the area cleared .
The majority of UAF arrests – that have been so publicised in the media – were therefore made in the morning before the EDL had arrived .
Certainly , I only saw one arrest in the entire course of the afternoon , and nothing like the 55 reported .
I must therefore say that it was a tactical mistake by the UAF organisers to attempt to take over the entire protest area .
Police spokesmen had already been bragging about how the day would test their resolve , and that they were going to show zero - tolerance .
By attempting to subvert the police ’s plans for two controlled demonstrations , UAF invited the police firstly to initiate arrests , and secondly – as we shall see – to spin the day against the anti-fascist protest and in favour of the EDL .
Let me be clear : I have no problem in principle with taking measures to prevent the EDL from being able to demonstrate at all .
Yet tactics must be picked carefully , and yesterday they were n’t .
However , this does not excuse – though perhaps it helps to explain – the shockingly misleading reporting that has subsequently been carried in virtually all of the mainstream media .
Let ’s start with the figures for participation .
By late Saturday evening a uniform figure of 2,000 EDL and 1,500 UAF was being carried by most outlets .
Yet this figure cannot possibly be correct .
By my reckoning , the anti-EDL protest outnumbered its rival by at least 3 - 1 .
Indeed , the UAF and affiliates were contained in two separate “ kettles ” , versus the EDL ’s one .
Furthermore , the UAF “ kettle ” facing that of the EDL was manifestly and considerably larger in size , as anybody present could have seen .
There is simply no way that the official figures being presented are correct .
Yet by carrying these figures – and by emphasising the greater number of arrests on the UAF side due to the morning attempt at taking over the entire protest area – a very disturbing thing has occurred : the anti-EDL / UAF protest has been represented as a minority of troublemakers .
The EDL is now being portrayed as the bigger ( i.e. more popular ) group , and that causing the least trouble .
Yet , again , this is highly misleading .
The anti-EDL / UAF - side of the protest was characterised by your normal myriad of leftist protestors .
Old men in flat caps , girls in punk gear , trades unions representatives , middle - aged women with prams .
Standard fare for anyone who has ever been on a leftwing demo .
The EDL side , however , was difficult to distinguish from what most of its members are – a gathering of angry , drunk , football hooligans .
Indeed , this assessment was backed up by more than just appearances .
At about 2.30 pm , missiles started to be launched from the EDL side of the barriers .
Starting with cigarette lighters , those on the UAF side soon found themselves under a rain of coins , half - filled plastic bottles , crushed beer cans and , eventually , glass bottles .
In the end I counted at least 5 glass bottles smashing to the ground , narrowly avoiding the heads of people on the anti-EDL side .
This continued for over an hour , until the police finally responded to calls of “ do your job ! ” and cleared the EDL out of the protest area .
It ’s worth repeating : although some UAF protesters picked up the missiles thrown at them and returned the favour to the other side , the vast majority of missiles were being thrown by the EDL .
Indeed , the situation started to become so dangerous that the police had to clear the EDL away .
Not the UAF / anti-EDL protesters .
And it ’s worth noting that this also gives good indication of the relative size of each group : the police cleared out the thugs first , because there were fewer of them .
Yet you will search high and low to find reports of how the protest ended in the mainstream news reporting .
Some stories state that two UAF protesters suffered minor head injuries – but where are the accompanying clarifications regarding how those head injuries were ( likely ) received , and why this resulted in the protest being cleared ?
I do n’t know if the girl I saw take a lucozade bottle in the face was one of the reported injured , but she was lucky not to lose an eye .
What appears to have happened is that the mainstream media has taken its news reports – which show a suspicious uniformity given how few journalists were present – from wire agencies , and from ( surprise surprise ) police statements .
Certainly , the police must be issuing the ( manifestly wrong ) participation figures .
The result is that an incredibly skewed image of the protests has emerged .
This is made worse by the media focusing especially on dramatic images such as this .
To the unsuspecting eye , that looks photo like a raving , snarling , out - of - control rioter .
Of course , if the context was that the woman had been snatched at random ( as happens at protests ) and was having her arms twisted behind her back , that could simply be a look of pain and outrage .
Without the context , we do n’t know .
But using that image and similarly confrontational depictions of the anti-EDL / UAF protest , along with reports of anti-fascist demonstrators being arrested , re-enforces the impression that the anti-EDL protest constituted a minority of troublemakers .
Yet as those of us who were actually there will tell you , the exact opposite was the case .
Those who oppose the rise of the EDL must learn important lessons from this .
Although the UAF / anti-EDL demonstration won the protest on the day ( it was the EDL that was forcibly cleared for its violent behaviour ) it looks like the EDL have won the battle nonetheless .
The news reporting – helped by misleading police figures and emphasis on the early UAF attempt to occupy the entire protest area – has , if anything , allowed the EDL to come off best .
Given the now clear bias of the police against the UAF , and the media ’s supplicant willingness to uphold that interpretation , we must all trend incredibly carefully from now on .
This is not an even battlefield we find ourselves upon .
Iran 's enthusiastic guardianship of its sovereignty appears to have extended to international air travel .
From now on , the Iranian government has announced , any airline which refers to the waterway between Iran and Arab states as the Arabian Gulf rather than the Persian Gulf will be banned from its airspace .
" The airlines of the southern Persian Gulf countries flying to Iran are warned to use the term Persian Gulf on their electronic display boards , " the country 's transport minister , Hamid Behbahani , told the Daily Iran newspaper .
" Otherwise they will be banned from Iranian airspace for a month the first time and upon repetition their aircraft will be grounded in Iran and flight permits to Iran will be revoked . "
Although the warning seems to be aimed at airlines based in neighbouring countries , the newspaper reported that Iran has also punished a foreign employee of one of its own airlines for making the same mistake .
It said that a Greek employee of Iranian commercial carrier Kish Air had been fired for using the term Arabian Gulf on a display board , and the airline had been asked to apologise over the incident .
Last month the Saudi - based Islamic Solidarity Sports Federation said it had made the decision to scrap the Islamic Solidarity Games which were to be held in Iran in April because of a dispute over whether the Gulf waterway is Arab or Persian .
Designation of the key waterway for global oil and gas supplies has long been a touchy issue among the countries bordering it – Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Qatar , Bahrain , the United Arab Emirates , Oman , Iraq and Iran .
Iran says it is the Persian Gulf ; the Arab states say it is Arab .
Foreign language descriptions can offend either party if they use one name or the other , or decide to omit an adjective altogether .
The directive from Tehran also reflects international tensions over Iran 's nuclear enrichment activities .
Some Gulf Arab states – many of which buy large quantities of US weapons and offer facilities to US military forces – share Washington 's concerns that Iran is seeking to develop a nuclear weapons capability .
The dispute over Iran 's nuclear energy programme , which Tehran says is aimed solely at generating electricity , is part of a wider concern among Sunni Muslim - led Arab governments over Iranian expansionism in the Middle East .
Iran has a network of allies including Shia groups in power in Iraq , the Syrian government , Lebanon 's Hizbullah and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas that rules Gaza .
President Obama was angry .
He was on the phone with President Dmitri A. Medvedev last month to finalize a new arms control treaty with Russia , only to be confronted with new demands for concessions on missile defense .
A deal that was supposed to be done was unraveling .
“ Dmitri , we agreed , ” Mr. Obama told Mr. Medvedev with a tone of exasperation , according to advisers .
“ We ca n’t do this .
If it means we ’re going to walk away from this treaty and not get it done , so be it .
But we ’re not going to go down this path . ”
Mr. Obama hung up and vented frustration .
Some of his advisers had never seen him so mad .
A picture taken by a White House photographer captured his grim face in that moment of uncertainty .
For a year he had been trying to forge a new relationship with Russia , starting with a treaty to slash nuclear arsenals .
And for a year Russia had been testing him , suspecting he was weak and certain it could roll over him .
If Mr. Obama overestimated his powers of persuasion in reaching quick agreement with the Russians , they misjudged how far they could get him to bend .
In the end , they compromised on nonbinding language .
And so , after all the fits and starts , all the miscalculations , the vodka toasts that proved premature and the stare - downs that nearly sank the whole enterprise , Mr. Obama hung up the phone again with Mr. Medvedev on Friday , this time having finally translated aspiration into agreement .
Research described on this blog has been supported by grants from the NSF USIP and Duke University , but the views expressed here are the responsibility of none but the author herself .
Earlier today , self - described conservative blogger Solomon " Solly " Forell posted a tweet that included a call for assassination , as well as this line : " We 'll surely get over a bullet 2 Barack Obama 's head ! "
It gets worse :
Forell then followed that tweet up with this one :

That tag he added ?
# TCOT ?
It stands for " top conservatives on Twitter . "
According to his Google profile , Forell is the author of a blog titled Barack Obama Was An American Electorate Mistake , which centers around Forell 's disappointment in Obama 's presidency .
This disappointment spills over into Forell 's other blogs , including Anybody But Barack Obama 2012 , and The Audacity of Hype , which both touch upon Forrell 's disgust with the " cult " of Obama , " a man who has done little with his life , but has written about his achievements as ifhe had found the cure for cancer in between winning a marathon and building a nuclear reactor with his teeth . "

Forell may think he 's protected by the First Amendment when it comes to his tweets , but the law begs to differ , specifically 18 USC Sec.
871 :
Whoever knowingly and willfully deposits for conveyance in the mail or for a delivery from any post office or by any letter carrier any letter , paper , writing , print , missive , or document containing any threat to take the life of , to kidnap , or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States , the President - elect , the Vice President or other officer next in the order of succession to the office of President of the United States , or the Vice President - elect , or knowingly and willfully otherwise makes any such threat against the President , President - elect , Vice President or other officer next in the order of succession to the office of President , or Vice President - elect , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years , or both .

You 'll note however , that there 's nothing specified about electronic threats .
Perhaps that 's why , as of now , Forell 's Twitter account does not appear to be suspended ; the tweet threatening the President 's life was posted roughly six hours ago and has not yet been removed .
Update : While Forell has n't removed the offensive tweets , he has posted an apologetic P.S. :

Uh , maybe the President would respect your opinion more if you did n't , you know , encourage people to kill him .
Just a thought .

Update # 2 : Forell is now backtracking like crazy , complaining about " whining liberals " and asking that we " all renounce the harsh rhetoric about the POTUS .
Several , including myself , hv used inappropriate language .
Let 's remain civil ! "
A little too late , I 'd say .
Update # 3 : I just received an email from Twitter , dated 2:55 pm PDT , stating the following :
We have removed this profile due to violation of Twitter 's Rules , specifically listed under " Content Boundaries and Use of Twitter " : * Unlawful Use :
You may not use the service for any unlawful purposes or for promotion of illegal activities .
It is against the Twitter Terms of Service to use the service to commit illegal acts .
Threatening the life of the president ( or president - elect ) is a federal offense under Title 18 , USC , section 871 .
All accounts in violation of our Terms of Service are permanently suspended and we report to legal authorities accordingly .

However , as of 6:06 pm EST , Forell 's account appears to still be up and running .
Update # 4 : Sam Gustin at DailyFinance is reporting that the Secret Service is now investigating Forell 's tweets , with Secret Service spokesperson Max Milien stating : " We are aware of the actual posting and are actively investigating . "

And though Twitter sent an email earlier declaring that Forell 's profile had been removed , it appears that only the assassination - related tweets have been deleted from his account : as of 9:00 pm EST , his account still appears to be active .

The World ’s New Gay Rights Battlegrounds
The struggle for gay rights in the United States has been going on now for decades , brought into the national consciousness by the AIDS crisis in the 1980s and 1990s and most recently crystallized by the battles over same - sex marriage and the “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy for gays in the military .
In other parts of the world , however , the fight is in much earlier stages .
Here are four countries where nascent gay - and transgender - rights movements are just picking up steam — and meeting some ugly backlash as well .
UGANDA
The battle : Uganda ’s Parliament , not content with the colonial - era anti-gay legislation that already exists , is considering the Anti-Homosexuality Bill , which seeks to punish “ aggravated homosexuality ” — essentially , sex if one of the participants is HIV - positive — with death , and other forms of gay sex with life imprisonment .
Those who are aware of homosexual activity and fail to report it face up to three years in prison .
The bill , which could be voted on as soon as this month , would also criminalize working for gay rights , with a possible sentence of up to seven years .
The outlook : After intense pressure from foreign governments and human rights NGOs , Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has distanced himself from the bill , believing that passing it would potentially jeopardize foreign donors ’ willingness to send aid to Uganda .
But , though the bill has catalyzed action in Uganda and overseas ( and focused attention on three American evangelicals who appear to bear some accidental responsibility for the bill ’s genesis ) , anti-gay sentiment is still stubbornly entrenched there , and it will take a lot for that to change .
Uganda is far more likely to remain one of the almost 40 African countries that still bans homosexuality altogether than it is to join South Africa , the only country on the continent to legalize gay marriage .
MALAWI
The battle : Like many Ugandans , Malawians see homosexuality as an evil Western import , something that would n’t naturally exist in their country if it were n’t for the influence of outsiders .
So a few cases involving newly visible gay Malawians have shocked people in this African country , where homosexuality can be punished with up to 14 years in prison .
First , on Dec. 28 , two men , Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga , were arrested for celebrating their engagement with a traditional chinkhoswe ritual — the first time a gay couple had ever done so .
The verdict in their case is expected by March 22 .
On Jan. 30 , another man was arrested for “ disturbing the peace ” by putting up a poster that read “ Gay Rights Are Human Rights . ”
Then , during a Feb. 15 anti-gay crackdown , a 60 - year - old was arrested for “ sodomy . ”
The outlook :
The arrests and Monjeza and Chimbalanga ’s subsequent mistreatment in prison have led to condemnation from international NGOs , as well as escalated tension between gay rights activists and the government , which actively taunted activists to show their faces — in other words , to risk arrest and imprisonment .
“ As far as the Malawi government is concerned , we only have two gays in Malawi — Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga , ” said government official Kingsley Namakhwa .
“ If there are others , let them come out in the open . ”
In a country where one in 14 people has HIV / AIDS , with eight people dying every hour , according to the international AIDS nonprofit AVERT , coming out into the open might be a great idea — if that meant better access to health services , not prison and torture .
PAKISTAN
The battle : Hijras , or transgender and transvestite men in India and Pakistan , have long been a recognized and partially tolerated population , scraping together a living as wedding dancers and prostitutes and facing the constant threat of aggression and discrimination .
India decriminalized homosexuality last summer , but it is still illegal in Pakistan , and a private gay marriage ceremony there in 2005 was met with death threats .
So it was big news in July 2009 when Pakistan ’s Supreme Court ruled that hijras would be officially recognized and registered as citizens .
Like India , whose election commission began allowing hijras to mark their gender as “ other ” on ballot forms last November , Pakistan is recommending that a third gender option be researched for entry on the country ’s state - issued identity cards .
The outlook : Since the historic 2009 ruling , there has been a significant increase in hijra activism , with demonstrations and celebrations taking place across the country , and the country ’s first ever hijra cricket team beat a professional squad last August .
But the fight for equality is by no means won — the cricketers had trouble convincing any local politicians to show their faces at the match .
Meanwhile , Pakistan ’s gays continue to live privately .
If they find community , it ’s in small , isolated , urban pockets .
Grassroots movements may be encouraged by the recent legal victories there and in India , but broad social acceptance is still a ways off .
TURKEY
The battle : Turkey is widely recognized as being one of the most LGBT - tolerant countries in the Middle East .
It is one of only four countries in the region — the others being Israel , Jordan , and , since 2003 , Iraq — where gay sex is legal , and Istanbul has a lively gay community .
But Turkey ’s ostensibly liberal society has come under scrutiny over the last couple of years due to a string of murders committed against gay and transgender people .
In 2008 , Ahmet Yildiz was killed by his father in Turkey ’s first reported honor killing of a gay person .
Over the last two years , meanwhile , at least eight transgender people have been murdered .
In the first months of 2010 alone , two transgender women were killed , apparently due to homophobic violence .
The country is split between a modernizing Islamist government that hopes to join the European Union and a conservative population that is squeamish about the increasingly visible role of gay people in Turkish society .
But now , on top of the killings , Ankara is cracking down on gay rights activists , filing civil proceedings to close local group Black Pink Triangle on the grounds that it violates “ Turkish moral values and family structure . ”
The outlook : International NGOs are in an uproar over the violence and the government ’s attempt to hinder activist groups .
And Turkey ’s effort to join the European Union will probably lead it to temper some of its worst excesses .
Still , the deaths and the governmental repression suggest that Turkey ’s reputation as a relative oasis of human rights in the Middle East is n’t going to last long .

The Putin Economy in Shambles
We learned last week that merger and acquisition activity in Russia fell a shocking 62 % last year .
Activity in the areas of consumer goods and retail , financial services and metals and mining was even worse , down a devastating 80 % .
Investors spurned Russian risk with a furious vengeance , and for this same reason the Russian stock market ’s value remains utterly puny compared to the theoretical value of the assets it represents .
The world , you see Mr. Putin , is getting wise to you .
As Anders Aslund points out , the failure of the Putin economy is nowhere better illustrated than by looking at Gazprom , Russia ’s most potent commercial force .
He writes :
In May 2008 , Gazprom ’s market capitalization exceeded $ 350 billion , but it has dropped to $ 135 billion today .
The Russian oil sector increased its production and exports last year , but gas exports fell by 11 percent and Gazprom ’s production decreased by 16 percent because of low demand .
Ouch .
Gazprom ’s management , by the Kremlin itself , has been breathtakingly incompetent .
The company has failed to invest and develop new fields , it has failed to anticipate new sources of competition , and it failed to anticipate the vicious effects of the global economic crisis , not just in terms of suppressing demand but in terms of encouraging the development of alternatives to Gazprom products .
Aslund gapes slack - jawed at the incompetence of Kremlin management :
Gazprom ’s management — that is , the Russian government — does not seem to understand the severity of these challenges .
After a long time in denial , it has reacted ad hoc .
It is trying to maintain the old European demand while ceding new markets and cutting its supplies .
It has reduced purchases from Central Asia and postponed the development of the giant fields Yamal and Shtokman .
Gazprom is moving to a new defensive strategy , but strangely it is still intent on building the two new huge European pipelines , Nord Stream and South Stream , for which neither new demand nor new gas supply is available .
If actually built , these two pipelines might become wasteful white elephants , as it is far cheaper to use the existing pipelines through Ukraine .
In fact , the Kremlin ’s management of Gazprom contradicts basic economic common sense :
In a rational market economy , a conglomerate such as Gazprom would n’t exist .
Noncore assets from farms to television companies should be sold off .
Production of gas should be separated from transportation and sales in different companies .
Undeveloped medium - sized and small fields should be auctioned off to independent gas producers .
The gas pipeline system could stay state - owned but be separated from production and be open to all on equal pricing .
As a result of reduced flaring , Russia would benefit from a huge cheap additional supply of gas , while air pollution would decline .
Russia , in other words , ruled by the KGB , has not surprisingly created an irrational economic system that is doomed to failure .
Gazprom has already been forced to start rewriting its basic contracts with European consumers , something few thought could ever occur in the arrogant days when fuel prices were soaring .
Now , the world sees Russia , and the Putin economy , exposed as wholly different than they first appeared , wretchedly incapable of responding to stress and already teetering on the brink of collapse .
One more good hard economic jolt , and down they go .
BATAVIA , IL — In October , Fermilab scientists joined a growing number of physicists around the world in warning that the Very Large Earth Collider — a $ 117 billion electromagnetic particle accelerator built to study astronomical phenomena by colliding Earth into various heavenly bodies — could potentially destroy Earth when it sends the planet careening headlong into Mars , Jupiter , or even the sun .
Advertisement
" The Large Earth Collider will surely gain us priceless scientific insight by offering a brief glimpse of the universe at the moment of its destruction , " Fermilab director Gordon Josephs said .
" But because the Collider achieves this by hurling the Earth into another large celestial object , there are some who feel the risks associated with annihilating our world are too high .
All I know for certain is that this rigorous debate will only end when we activate the VLEC , make the Earth collide with another planet , and obtain results through firsthand observation . "
" That 's just good science , " Josephs added .
Physicists at CERN and Brookhaven National Laboratory , who underwrote the VLEC 's construction with donations from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , agree that there are " some troubling variables " whenever attempting to launch Earth through the vacuum of space into a massive body of solid matter .
Yet , they insist , the academic benefits of a planetary collision outweigh any risk of annihilating the Earth .

" When we boil the oceans , tear the tectonic plates from the globe , and peel back the layers of the Earth to expose its molten core , we 'll be seeing firsthand what end - times researchers have only theorized about , " said Greg Giddings , a planetologist at the University of Michigan .
" It might be worth the chance — which , if you ask me , is very small — of destroying the Earth in the process just to see that . "
" There will always be Chicken Little types , " theoretical physicist and futurist Michio Kaku said .
" When the first nuclear reaction was achieved , there were those who said its very existence made it a weapon of unspeakable power , and there is evidence they may have been right .
It 's probably worth asking if the Very Large Earth Collider may in fact pose some minute danger to the Earth . "

While the project remains controversial , physicists agreed in late November to reconvene and evaluate the risk factor of the project after a small - scale field test , during which the Very Large Earth Collider will be turned on at 10 percent capacity , catapulting Earth into the moon at only half the speed of light .
Every minute in the morning is vital .
The alarm goes off and you lie in bed , sometimes with your eyes open , sometimes closed , but you 're always doing the daily math problem in your head .
" If I lie in bed for an extra 15 minutes , what am I cutting out so I 'm not late for work ? "
Showers are usually the same daily .
Unless you miss a spot or are one of those people who think standing in water constitutes cleanliness , you are bathing a minimum of five to seven minutes .
The other essentials may include walking your dog , doing your hair , brushing your teeth , and / or ironing .
Before you know it , you 're sitting in traffic with a growling stomach , wondering if your boss will notice your tardiness if you swing by a fast - food joint to grab some grub to calm the rumbling .
There 's no escaping the fact that breakfast is the most important meal of the day .
But no one is going to make grown adults stop to eat a meal in the
morning when that extra time could be spent spooning your pillow .
Each morning that you skip breakfast , your body starts to intensely crave high - calorie foods ,
such as pizza , soda , and sweets .
While I 'm definitely a fan of all of
the above , even I know daily doses take their toll .
Instead of putting
off eating until lunch for greater risk of subconscious cravings , take
a look at five breakfasts that can be made in five minutes .
That 's ten
extra minutes with your pillow .
5. Bagel with peanut butter .
Do n't roll your eyes at me .
Carbs are OK to jump - start
your morning .
Peanut butter is a fantastic source of protein , which
will also get you extremely excited about those TPS reports .
4. Oatmeal .
I can not stand oatmeal .
Unless it 's The Oatmeal .
I can , however , stand oatmeal that resembles other food : peaches 'n '
cream , brown sugar , and apples & cinnamon .
It 's also bearable with
milk instead of water .
If you 're worried about the high sugar content ,
grab original oatmeal and add the fruit and sugar to your liking .
I
throw in strawberries , bananas , and blueberries .
3. Cereal .
I do n't care what you say , the Special K diet
works only if you have plans to numb your taste buds for weeks on end .
Maybe
some people are into that sort of thing , but I gag at the mere thought .
Instead , I take good fiber + kind of sugared cereal with Raisin Bran
Crunch .
It 's no Lucky Charms , but I get my fix , and it does taste good .
Other good choices are Wheaties and Cheerios .
2. Yogurt .
Do not underestimate the power of yogurt .
There 's 400
mg of calcium in an eight - ounce cup of yogurt , which is 100 more than what
you would get from a glass of milk that was the same size .
It also has
the same amount of potassium as a banana .
I prefer the plain Stoneyfield Organic Yogurt , where I can add sliced apples and bananas .
1. Smoothies .
As kids , it 's like the prize we get for being good
in the grocery store or behaving for the babysitter .
As adults , it's
our breakfast savior .
Men 's
Health makes a quick blueberry smoothie
( and even gives you time for a toasted cheese sandwich ) .
Just about any
smoothie mixture will do your breakfast craving justice .
Conservative commentator Ann Coulter and the ACLU are teaming up to take on these new intrusive body scan machines at airports .
Obviously , they have very different angles on the story .
Coulter has a few reasons , but most interestingly is her worry it wo n’t stop “ foreskin ” and “ anus ” bombing .
Last night on The O’Reilly Factor , Bill O’Reilly and Coulter talked about the “ most intrusive ” new method the TSA has implemented to crack down on potential terror attacks .
Coulter worries about the privacy issue ( you know , she is sounding like the ACLU now ) .
“ Your naked body will show up on Page Six , ” she tells O’Reilly .
Also : “ Females do object to this a lot more than males , particularly the ones with the better figures , worried about Bill Clinton signing up for a civil service job . ” ( Zing !
Someone ’s been moonlighting as a Jay Leno Show writer . )
But mainly , according to Coulter “ it wo n’t do anything . ”
O’Reilly disagreed .
“ If you have a body scan and you have a bomb in your underwear , they can see the bomb through the body scan , ” he said .
But Coulter countered , quite graphically :
It was spread throughout the diaper .
Unless the bomb is inserted under the foreskin , and by the way , I do n’t see a clear angle on the anus .
That ’s a pretty easy hiding place for this .
So Coulter has examined these body scan images , and , at this present time , she does n’t “ see a clear angle on the anus . ”
She has looked , though .
And no clear angle yet .
As for whether the body scan could have stopped the Christmas Day attempted terror attack , it sounds like O’Reilly is right .
Coulter is wrong that explosives were “ spread throughout the diaper . ”
Instead , it was a “ six - inch packet of explosive powder sewn into the crotch of the underwear . ”
We know this because there are images of the packet still in the underwear , since it never ignited .
If Coulter thinks the body scan is too intrusive of a process , she has yet to give an alternate option .
Obviously she would agree something must be done , but she gives no indication what that would be .
Even if there is profiling , she makes the claim the body scan is ineffective .
So what ’s your next best option , Ann ?
Here ’s the Coulter interview :

New York ’s insular ultra-Orthodox Jewish community collided with the area ’s secretive and ultra- wealthy hedge fund industry , leading to the arrest of a politically well - connected rabbi on blackmail and fraud charges .
The rabbi , Milton Balkany , was arrested Thursday , accused of trying to extort $ 4 million from a Connecticut hedge fund by threatening to expose purported illegal insider trading by the fund .
Half the money was to go to a religious school for girls that Balkany runs in Brooklyn , according to a criminal complaint filed by the U.S. attorney ’s office in Manhattan .
The other half was to be a “ loan ” to another school , the complaint says .
Balkany , who was released on bail after his arrest Thursday , intends to plead not guilty , said his lawyer , Ben Brafman .
The case is the latest in a string of legal problems to hit the region ’s ultra-Orthodox Jewish community , most notably a sting last summer carried out against a group of New Jersey rabbis , who were charged with peddling political influence .
Balkany is the brother - in - law of the owner of a kosher meat factory in Iowa who went to prison last year after being convicted of financial fraud .
Balkany himself avoided prison on 2003 federal charges , brought by the same U.S. attorney ’s office , that he had made personal use of a government grant .
The complaint quotes from recorded conversations it says Balkany conducted on the phone and in person last month with lawyers for the hedge fund .
The government did n’t identify the hedge fund .
The government filing suggests that Balkany tried to play on a wave of investigations of possible financial wrongdoing in the wake of the mortgage meltdown and credit crisis .
In one conversation , according to the complaint , Balkany told the hedge fund ’s lawyers that the government was “ very thirsty . ”
“ You have no idea , the pressure and the thirst , on behalf of the government , that ’s out there , ” Balkany is quoted as saying .
The U.S. attorney ’s office that brought the charges against Balkany is currently prosecuting managers of Galleon Group , a hedge fund firm , on insider - trading charges .
Hedge funds are known for their strategic acumen -- and the complaint details how the lawyers for the hedge fund steered Balkany into the arms of law enforcement officials over the course of dozens of phone calls and meetings .
At the same time , Balkany appeared to be in awe of the fund managers -- asking whether , a few months down the road , he might be “ able to spend 10 minutes with [ a hedge fund manager ] .
Not asking him for anything . . . just to meet him , and to say hello to him , and that ’s it , ” according to the complaint .
In the 1990s , Balkany was dubbed the “ Brooklyn bundler ” for his facility in pulling together political donations from the Jewish community , particularly for Republican candidates such as former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
“ He had great access and influence , ” said Hank Scheinkopf , a New York political consultant .
In 2003 , Balkany was welcomed to the U.S. House of Representatives as a guest chaplain .
But a few months later , the rabbi faced a criminal charge accusing him of making personal use of a $ 700,000 government grant for the Bais Yaakov school , which he runs as dean .
The U.S. attorney ’s office agreed to defer prosecution in that case after Balkany admitted wrongdoing , paid back most of the money and agreed to certain restrictions on his work .
Since then , Balkany has remained politically involved , giving to local , state and national candidates .
But Scheinkopf said Balkany ’s “ star had faded ” since Giuliani ’s departure from the New York mayor ’s office and Republicans ’ loss of control of Congress .
The ultra-Orthodox community has come under scrutiny for its use of government funds to support its religious schools and institutions .
“ They ’re always looking for some angle , ” Samuel Heilman , a City University of New York sociology professor who has studied the ultra-Orthodox .
“ In the boom times it was easier to find that . ”
Rabbi David Zwiebel , head of Agudath Israel of America , an influential ultra-Orthodox organization , said the arrest would cause further problems for a community that has been reeling since the arrests of the New Jersey rabbis last year .
“ There was a point in time when one of the greatest assets that we had when dealing with issues out there was a general sense that this was a community of integrity , ” said Zwiebel , who deals with elected officials on behalf of his community .
“ When that reputation gets tarnished , it certainly makes my job harder . ”

Humans , other great apes and bears are among the few animals that step first on the heel when walking , and then roll onto the ball of the foot and toes .
Now , a University of Utah study shows the advantage : Compared with heel - first walking , it takes 53 percent more energy to walk on the balls of your feet , and 83 percent more energy to walk on your toes .
" Our heel touches the ground at the start of each step .
In most mammals , the heel remains elevated during walking and running , " says biology Professor David Carrier , senior author of the new study being published online Friday , Feb. 12 and in the March 1 print issue of The Journal of Experimental Biology .
" Most mammals -- dogs , cats , raccoons -- walk and run around on the balls of their feet .
Ungulates like horses and deer run and walk on their tiptoes , " he adds .
" Few species land on their heel : bears and humans and other great apes -- chimps , gorillas , orangutans . "
" Our study shows that the heel - down posture increases the economy of walking but not the economy of running , " says Carrier .
" You consume more energy when you walk on the balls of your feet or your toes than when you walk heels first . "
Economical walking would have helped early human hunter - gatherers find food , he says .
Yet , because other great apes also are heel - first walkers , it means the trait evolved before our common ancestors descended from the trees , he adds .
" We [ human ancestors ] had this foot posture when we were up in the trees , " Carrier says .
" Heel - first walking was there in the great apes , but great apes do n't walk long distances .
So economy of walking probably does n't explain this foot posture [ and why it evolved ] , even though it helps us to walk economically . "
Carrier speculates that a heel - first foot posture " may be advantageous during fighting by increasing stability and applying more torque to the ground to twist , push and shove .
And it increases agility in rapid turning maneuvers during aggressive encounters . "

The study concludes : " Relative to other mammals , humans are economical walkers but not economical runners .
Given the great distances hunter - gatherers travel , it is not surprising that humans retained a foot posture , inherited from our more arboreal [ tree - dwelling ] great ape ancestors , that facilitates economical walking . "
Measuring the Costs of Different Modes of Walking and Running
Carrier conducted the study with Christopher Cunningham , a doctoral student in biology at the University of Utah ; Nadja Schilling , a zoologist at Friedrich Schiller University of Jena , Germany ; and Christoph Anders , a physician at University Hospital Jena .
The study was funded by the National Science Foundation , Friedrich Schiller University of Jena and a German food industry insurance group interested in back pain .
The study involved 27 volunteers , mostly athletes in their 20s , 30s and 40s .
Each subject walked or ran three different ways , with each step either heel - first , ball - of - foot first with the heel a bit elevated or toes first with the heel even more elevated .
In his lab , Carrier and colleagues measured oxygen consumption -- and thus energy use -- as 11 volunteers wore face masks while walking or running on a treadmill .
They also walked on a " force plate " to measure forces exerted on the ground .

Part of the study was conducted at Anders ' lab in Germany , where 16 people walked or ran on a treadmill as scientists monitored activity of muscles that help the ankles , knees , hips and back do work during walking and running .
Findings of the experiments included :
" You consume more energy when you walk on the balls of your feet or your toes than when you walk heels - first , " Carrier says .
Compared with heels - first walkers , those stepping first on the balls of their feet used 53 percent more energy , and those stepping toes - first expended 83 percent more energy .
" The activity of the major muscles of the ankle , knee , hip and back all increase if you walk on the balls of your feet or your toes as opposed to landing on your heels , " says Carrier .
" That tells us the muscles increase the amount of work they are producing if you walk on the balls of your feet . "
" When we walk on the balls of our feet , we take shorter , more frequent strides , " Carrier says .
" But this did not make walking less economical . "
Putting the heel down first and pivoting onto the ball of the foot makes the stride longer because the full length of the foot is added to the length of the step .
But that has no effect on energy use .
The researchers wondered if stepping first on the balls of the feet took more energy than walking heel - first because people are less stable on their toes or balls of the feet .
But increased stability did not explain why heel - first walking uses less energy .
Stepping heel - first reduced the up - and - down motion of the body 's center of mass during walking and required less work by the hips , knees and ankles .
Stepping first onto the balls of the feet slows the body more and requires more re-acceleration .
Heels - first steps also made walking more economical by increasing the transfer of movement or " kinetic " energy to stored or " potential " energy and back again .
As a person starts to step forward and downward , stored energy is changed to motion or kinetic energy .
Then , as weight shifts onto the foot and the person moved forward and upward , their speed slows down , so the kinetic energy of motion is converted back into stored or potential energy .
The study found that stepping first onto the balls of the feet made this energy exchange less efficient that walking heels - first .
Heel - first walking also reduced the " ground reaction force moment " at the ankle .
That means stepping first onto the ball of the foot " decreases the leverage , decreases the mechanical advantage " compared with walking heel - first , Carrier says .
In sum , walking heel - first is not more economical because it is more stable or involves fewer , longer strides , but because when we land on our heels , less energy is lost to the ground , we have more leverage , and kinetic and potential energy are converted more efficiently .
Form and Function of the Foot
If heel - first walking is so economical , why do so many animals walk other ways ?
" They are adapted for running , " Carrier says .
" They 've compromised their economy of walking for the economy of running . "
" Humans are very good at running long distances .
We are physiologically and anatomically specialized for running long distances .
But the anatomy of our feet is not consistent with economical running .
Think of all the animals that are the best runners -- gazelles , deer , horses , dogs -- they all run on the ball of their feet or the tips of their toes . "
When people run , why is there no difference in the amount of energy they expend when stepping first onto their heels versus the balls of their feet or toes ?
The answer is unknown , but " if you land on your heel when you run , the force underneath the foot shoots very quickly to the ball of your foot , " Carrier says .
" Even when we run with a heel plant , most of the step our weight is supported by the ball of our foot .
Lots of elite athletes , whether sprinters or distance runners , do n't land on their heel .
Many of them run on the balls of their feet , " as do people who run barefoot .
That appears to be the natural ancestral condition for early human runners , he adds .
" The important thing is we are remarkable economical walkers , " Carrier says .
" We are not efficient runners .
In fact , we consume more energy to run than the typical mammal our size .
But we are exceptionally economical walkers . "
" This study suggests that one of the things that may explain such economy is the unusual structure of our foot , " he adds .
" The whole foot contacts the ground when we walk .
We have a big heel .
Our big toe is as long as our other toes and is much more robust .
Our big toe also is parallel to and right next to the second toe . "
" These features are distinct among apes , and provide the mechanical basis for economical walking .
No other primate or mammal could fit into human shoes . "
PORT ORANGE , Fla. , Feb. 10 ( UPI ) -- A Florida man says the state is trying to force him to pay child support for a child who was born when he was 7 years old .
Rusty Cole , a National Guardsman from Port Orange , Fla. , said his tax return was delayed by the state because officials told him he owes support payments for a child born in 1995 -- despite the fact that Cole was born in late 1987 , Central Florida News 13 reported Wednesday .

Cole said weeks of phone calls and office visits failed to yield any results .
" They were like , ' Oh , yes , we have it on here that you are the father , ' and I was like , ' Ma'am , there 's no way , ' " Cole said to News 13 .
He said an e-mail message to Gov. Charlie Crist finally yielded him an apology from the department of revenue and the promise that his return would be processed .
However , Cole said he will not consider the matter closed until the return is in his hands and he is ensured it will not be a problem again .
" I want this completely off my record , " Cole told the television station .
" I do n't want this ever affecting me later on in life . "
We live in an era in which the power of the new hypermedia is so intense and politics so rabid that it ’s almost impossible for Congress to do anything more difficult than tax cuts or highway construction .
Yet , here ’s this huge , complicated , controversial reform  bigger than any domestic program in decades .
If it passes , the short - term political consequences are unknowable .
But in 10 years , people will look back in amazement that we once lived in a time when Americans could n’t get health care coverage if they were sick , when insurance companies could cut off your benefits for being sick , and when run -of - the - mill serious illnesses routinely destroyed families ’ financial security .
And if it passes , Barack Obama will have validated his presidency .
He came into office on the wave of hope so enormous there was no way he was not going to disappoint .
He broke promises  we still remember that one about holding health care negotiations on C - Span .
He sure failed to deliver on that more respectful , bipartisan spirit in Washington .
He seemed , day to day , so much less Obama - like than the guy who made people faint at campaign rallies .
But the core qualities that got him elected were his coolness under pressure and the sense that he would never stop fighting for change .
No matter what you think of it , this health care bill is one heck of a change .
And no matter what you think of the White House strategy , Obama has been incredibly tenacious in pushing for it .
All year , his party has been begging him to drop health care and do something about jobs  or more specifically , give the impression of doing something about jobs .
The government has only so much power to stimulate the economy .
And even at the height of his postelection power , Obama could only get a medium - size stimulus bill through the Senate .
What many Democrats really wanted was just a change of conversation  away from the complicated , frustrating subject of health care to rewarding fights for proposals that would embarrass the Republicans even if they did n’t pass , and small , symbolic programs that would be the 2010 equivalent of supporting public school uniforms .
Plus lots of photo - ops at construction sites .
Walter Frederick Morrison , from Utah , got the idea for the Pluto Platter after tossing cake tins on the beach
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Walter Frederick Morrison , the man credited with inventing the Frisbee , has died at the age of 90 .
Lawyer Kay McIff , who represented Morrison in a royalties case , said the American inventor died at his home in Monroe , Utah , on Tuesday .
" That simple little toy has permeated every continent in every country , as many homes have Frisbees as any other device ever invented , " McIff , who is from Morrison 's hometown , Richfield , Utah , said .
" How would you get through your youth without learning to throw a Frisbee ? "
Morrison 's son , Walt , told The Associated Press this week that " old age caught up " with his father and that he also had cancer .
" He was a nice guy .
He helped a lot of people , " he said .
" He was an entrepreneur .
He was always looking for something to do . "
Morrison sold the production and manufacturing rights to his Pluto Platter in 1957 .
The plastic flying disc was later renamed the Frisbee , with sales surpassing 200 m discs .
It is now a staple at beaches and spawned sports such as Frisbee golf and the team sport Ultimate .
Morrison co-wrote a book with Frisbee enthusiast and historian Phil Kennedy in 2001 .
Kennedy released a brief statement on Thursday , wishing his late friend " smoooooth flights " .
According to Kennedy , Morrison and his future wife , Lu , used to toss a tin cake pan on the beach in California .
The idea for what would become the Frisbee grew as Morrison considered ways to make the cake pans fly better and , after serving as a pilot in the second world war , he began manufacturing his flying discs in 1948 .
He would hawk the discs at local fairs and eventually attracted Wham - O Manufacturing , the company that bought the rights to Morrison 's plastic discs .
Kennedy says Wham - O adopted the name Frisbee because that 's what college students in New England were calling the Pluto Platters .
The name came from the Frisbie Pie Co , a local bakery whose empty tins were tossed like the soon - to - be Frisbee .
Walt Morrison said his father is survived by three children .
Every woman remembers her wedding day with a tear in her eye – but , here in Ethiopia , the tears are different , and darker , and do not stop .
Nurame Abedo is sitting in her hut high in the clouds , remembering the day she became a wife .
She lives hundreds of miles into the countryside , thousands of feet above sea-level , in the hills of the bridal - kidnapping capital of the world .
For 40 years , she did n't talk about her wedding , or how it came to happen .
If she tried , she was beaten by her captor , who said good women never speak of such things .
So she tells her story slowly , haltingly , her sentences punctuated by sudden high - pitched laughs that seem to erupt involuntarily from her gut .
Nurame was in her bed when she was woken by an angry mêlée .
In her family 's hut there were grown men – an incredible number , 10 or more , all in their 30s , all standing over her father , shouting .
They reached for her .
At night here , where there is no electricity , perfect darkness falls , and everything becomes a shadow - play of barely visible flickers .
But even though she was eight years old , she suspected at once what was happening .
She had heard whispers that , when a girl is considered ready for marriage , a man will seize her , and rape her , and then she must serve him for the rest of her life .
" That was the culture , " she says .
But it was n't her culture : like all the other little girls , she did n't want it .
" I started screaming and tried to run out of the hut , " she says .
" I hid in the trees – hah ! – but one of the men found me . "
She was taken back to his home , held down in front of his family , raped , and taken to be married the next morning .
Dazed , she signed the papers , and waited for a moment when she could flee .
After three days , he finally left her alone in the hut .
She ran for miles barefoot back to her family , wanting to return to her life , and to her childhood .
She hurried through the door , weeping with joy .
" But my father told me that now I had had sex with him , nobody else would want me because I was ruined goods , and I had to go back to him and be a good wife , " she says .
" My mother was very sad but she said it was true .
I thought then , ' I have to do this .
I have no choice ' .
I just prayed to God , ' Please help me , please ...'
I went back .
Soon after that I was pregnant , and what could I do ?
Hah !
Now many years have passed and I have six children .
Life is hard for a woman .
Hah ! "
She is crumpled now , her walk halting , her face creased .
She stares past me , to where white wisps of cloud are swirling past the bare , bright - red soil .
Nurame has a distant sense of another life , one she will never lead now .
" If it had n't happened to me ... I would have been educated and got my own work and lived my own life .
I wish to God that had happened . "
Her laugh erupts again , like a muffled scream .
" Maybe I could have been happy .
Now I am old .
I have to be happy – at least I have children ; I love them . "
She adjusts her black bandana and looks down .
But then she says suddenly : " My husband is a good man .
He does not beat me now .
I love him .
He is a very good man . "
She gives a big gap - toothed smile of apparent sincerity .
All the old women I meet – abductees for a lifetime – insist on this upbeat ending , in almost identical language , after recounting their tales of rape .
" It is only hard for the first five years , " one of them tells me , quite seriously .
I think of Natascha Kampusch , the Austrian girl held in a cellar for eight years , and who now grieves for her captor who killed himself .
She has bought the house he imprisoned her in and reportedly sits in his cellar , alone .
As I leave Nurmae , I ask her how she would feel if one of her daughters was abducted .
Her face hardens .
" I would find her .
I would get her back . "
I wait for the awkward laugh , but this time it does n't come .
She stares , determined .
In Ethiopia , Nurame 's story happens every day .
In 2003 – the last year for which statistics are available – the National Committee on Traditional Practices of Ethiopia found that 69 per cent of marriages begin like this , with the triple - whammy of abduction , rape , and a forced signature .
In a country with a mixture of Protestant , Catholic and Muslim , all religions practise it equally .
These stories have been sealed away for millennia , behind masks of pain and repression , but sometimes there are moments when history suddenly accelerates – and this is one of them .
Across the fields and huts of this country , a mass rebellion of abductee - brides has broken out over the past decade .
Ethiopian women have started to refuse to watch their sisters disappear into servitude .
They are fighting back – and now they are asking for our help .
I Honey , honey
" Yes , I kidnapped several of my wives , " says the tall , thin market trader , in a bland matter - of - fact tone .
Abebe Anebo is a wiry 45 - year - old man , with sunken eyes that are partially concealed in the shade of a grubby white baseball cap .
He makes his living selling pots crafted from the earth by his seven captive - brides and his 25 children .
He is returning from market when I meet him , leaving tracks in the muck .
It has been raining for days , and the land seems to have erupted with wild green foliage and molten mud everywhere .
Everyone is slipping and sliding .
Like many men here , he sees nothing wrong with kidnapping a woman – indeed , he claims it is a sign of love .
" I used to see her in the market where I sell pots , " he says fondly of the first woman he took .
" She was beautiful .
I never talked to her , but I loved her .
One Monday I called my friends and we picked her up and took her to the car and away with us . "
What did she do ?
" She cried but once she was in the car she shut up .
I knew her family and I wanted to be part of it – it's a good family .
I told her cousin I was going to take her and he said it was fine . "
He says it as though he is describing buying a tin of beans .
I try to match his casual tone as I ask ' Did you rape her ? '
He laughs .
It is not an embarrassed laugh , but an anticipatory guffaw , and he leans towards me , like he is about to offer a punchline .
" I got her to sleep in the hut between me and the fire .
The fire was very hot .
In the end she had to come closer to me ! "
With that he cracks up , and all the men standing around laugh with him .
I repeat the question ' So did you rape her ? '
" Yes , I did , obviously , " he says , as though I am grouchily missing the gag .
What was married life like ?
" Once she was abducted , she fell into line .
She lived her life .
She made pots .
She did what she had to .
A man is like honey , honey to a woman – once she has honey , she is happy . "
She died in an accident a few years ago , he says .
At a wedding , somebody shot a pistol in the air in celebration , and the bullet came back to earth and hit her between the eyes .
Fortunately , he had seized a second wife , so he was n't left alone .
But he grieves for that wife because she was a good worker .
" Women are our factories .
They work for their husbands .
They cultivate land , they make pots , they treat animal skins ...
A woman should obey .
If I tell one of my wives to do something , she does it . "
Why should she ?
" That 's life .
Even if I became a cripple , she would obey me .
She is a woman .
They like it . "
But if women want it , why abduct them ?
Why not just ask ?
He is finding these questions grating now .
He looks to the other men and smirks a little , then looks back at me .
" This is how we did it !
I thought it was normal .
Our ancestors did it , our grandfathers did it , our fathers did it .
My mother was kidnapped by my father . "
He admits that , yes , his mother sometimes cursed this fact , but that is just proof of her generally lazy and ungrateful nature .
" She had a wealthy family , so when she was with them she was very lazy , and very proud that she did n't have to work .
When my father took her she had to work , and she was always bitter and angry about that .
She just had to get on with it though . "
How would he feel if one of his daughters was abducted ?
" I 'd pity the poor man who took her ! " he says , and everyone falls about laughing again .
But then suddenly the conversation slams into a 180 - degree reverse , as it seems to everywhere on this subject .
He says , with a solemn look : " I think abduction is illegal now .
It 's bad , you should n't do it .
It 's wrong . "
He says this with great solemnity , as if describing the death of a loved one .
I 'm confused : you just said a minute ago that women like it .
He shouts : " Nowadays men have to be different !
If I kidnap a woman now I 'll probably be punished ! "
Then his tone shifts again , just as quickly and just as entirely .
He warmly shakes me by the hand , bumps his shoulder against mine – a sign of affection – and continues on his way .
For days , none of this seems real to me .
I drive along long clear roads where my vehicle is always the only car , and watch the women huddled together , walking miles for water , or food , or the market .
They wear bright shimmering clothes , and , despite their look of pure and perfect exhaustion , they often smile and wave as I pass .
Are they really captives ?
I watch the men strolling and joking and drinking .
Are so many really kidnappers ?
Are they kidnapping tonight ?
II Blackout
I uncover the story of how the fight - back began in the middle of a blackout – both electrical , and political .
The capital city , Addis Ababa , has been without electricity for three days .
Nobody is surprised .
Nobody expects it to come back any minute .
Nobody listens to the explanations from the dictatorship on the radio – the power plant is failing because wicked contractors inexplicably ripped off the government , and the government is doing all it can to stop this sabotage etcetera .
No : the people are irritated instead because , one - by - one , their mobile phones are dying .
With no way to recharge , the city 's cell network is falling silent , and nobody can find their friends .
The city is slowly getting lost .
In the middle of this darkness , Boge Gebre is sitting in her office , working .
( Her name is pronounced Bo-gay . )
She is the woman who began the rebellion of Ethiopian women – and at first glance , this is not improbable .
She is slim and tall , like a weapon .
When she was born in the early 1950s , she was expected to have the same life as Nurame .
She says : " Women were regarded as no better than the cows they milked .
We have round houses made from mud , and within each home there is a strict division .
One side is for the men , and other is for the women and the animals .
" My mother 's life was a nightmare .
I do n't know how she survived , " she adds , looking down .
" She was a very intelligent , very wise woman – but all her life she was abused and beaten – for nothing .
She had her back stooped , her legs broken , her jaw broken , even though she did everything right .
It was a nightmare , but for her it was a life .
And somehow she still smiled .
When there is no alternative , you somehow accept this as all you will get .
In that situation , many women accept their situation as God - given , not man-made . "
When Boge was 12 , she was pinned down and had her genitals cut out with a knife .
This is called " circumcision " – but it is actually mutilation , and it nearly caused her to bleed to death .
It is part of a system that sees a woman 's sexuality as something to be scraped and raped away .
Afterwards , all that remains is scar tissue , with a little piece of wood inserted so urine can still pass through a tiny hole .
This happened to all Boge 's sisters too – and it killed one of them .
When she came to give birth , her vagina had no elasticity , and the baby could not pass through the mess of poorly - healed scarring between her legs .
" They could n't pull out the baby , " Boge says , " so they both died . "
Men came to abduct
Boge twice – but both times she ran away before they could rape her .
" So – here I am ! " she says .
When she was told this was her culture and she had to accept it , she found the argument ridiculous .
" I thought – how can this be my culture , if it kills me ? " she says , leaning forward .
" What is culture ?
It is something that is constantly changing .
In Europe , you burned witches .
That culture changed .
Every woman has a sense of her own dignity .
I knew I was not a cow , a chattel , and I did not want to be treated like one .
No woman wants to be abducted or cut up .
This is true whatever your culture .
Culture is not stagnant – it is transient . "
One day , as a little girl , she was sent to stay overnight with one of her cousins when she saw the Amharic alphabet on the wall .
She knew that , when she went home , she would not be allowed to see it again – her father beat her mother for even suggesting she go to school – so she sat up all night and memorised all 268 characters .
Not long after , she ran away to a missionary school – they were amazed she knew the alphabet – and became the first girl in her village to be properly educated .
They helped her get a scholarship to go to high school in Addis Ababa , and then she got another , to study microbiology in Jerusalem .
From there , she was given a Fulbright scholarship to the University of Massachusetts .
She saved any money she could from her grants and sent them back to her mother , who built a house with them .
The village was in awe – a woman , providing for her family ?
Boge knew she could have stayed in America , and tried to forget all this .
" Yes , I could have had a better house and gone jogging on the beach or gone to a spa every weekend .
But is that what life is all about ?
Could I have stayed there knowing my sisters were being cut and abducted and turned into servants ?
Einstein said you start living when you give yourself out .
I feel I 'm living now . "
So she went back to Kembatta in the 1990s .
" I knew the women themselves wanted to change it .
Women do n't lack brains , we only lack opportunity – to go to school , to be free and independent , to make our own choices . "
She went to the church – hers is a Protestant area – and asked to address the congregation .
She talked about HIV / Aids .
Many men were shocked : they considered it an affront , a dirty subject .
Afterwards the elders told her to forget about all that because the biggest problem in the area was the nearby gorge : kids could n't cross it to get to the nearest school , and traders could n't pass it to get to market .
She knew she would gain credibility if she solved it – so she provided the cement and the iron bars and within a few months there was a bridge .
" That bridge connected the village to the other side of the gorge , " she says , " but it also connected me to their hearts . "
So she suggested a bolder plan .
She set up local assemblies where anyone could speak about the problems in the area – a place where old men and young girls could address each other as equals .
Everybody said it was impossible , ridiculous , unthinkable .
But she pressed on and established an organisation called Kembatti Mentti Gezzima - Tope ( KMG ) – Kembatta Women Standing Together – and began organising the villages .
Steadily , one - by - one , the assemblies happened , and at first women made mild and modest demands ( from our point of view , at least ) .
Could n't men and women sit together in public ?
Could n't girls stay at school as long as boys ?
Could n't women become elders too , and decide on the affairs of the community ?
On a torrentially rainy Sunday , I watch an assembly happen , in a classroom that seems to be in the process of being slowly smothered by vast , outsized plants .
An old man stands up and says humbly : " Before KMG came , a woman never sat with a man .
She was n't even allowed to sit with her husband at meals .
First the man ate , then the woman ate .
Women were nothing .
Things are better now , I can see that . "
A cacophony follows – of girls talking about the need for contraception , and abortion , and Aids tests , and men agreeing .
As the meetings went on over the years , their demands for equality swelled .
Why should women 's vaginas be mutilated ?
They screened a video of a female " circumcision " taking place for the men .
One passed out ; four vomited .
" The rebellion just grew and grew , " Boge says .
At a wedding in 2003 , the bride and all her bridesmaids wore signs saying : " I am uncircumcised . "
It was a Spartacus moment , and the women here weep as they remember it .
Bridal abductions have been technically illegal since 2005 , but , outside the capital , the law is interpreted very loosely by the police and judges .
When a 13 - year - old girl called Woineshet Zebene Negash became the first Ethiopian ever legally to challenge a bridal abduction , the judge at her trial said : " What is the problem ?
He loves you – that 's why he abducted you . "
He added she probably was n't a virgin before the kidnapping – the medical tests were inconclusive – and so it could n't be rape because " nobody wants to rape a girl who is n't a virgin " .
Even the girl 's defence attorney said in court : " I think [ she ] was , like , ' Please rape me ' . "
But in these new forums , women began to speak about their terror of being kidnapped – and Boge was there to explain that KMG would ensure any man who committed it went to prison .
She would harangue the police until they acted .
KMG began to raise money from abroad – Boge says the money from the British charity Comic Relief ( which spends the money raised through Sport Relief ) was " a lifesaver " .
But , just as light seemed to be breaking through , a bitter backlash began .
One morning , a village elder awoke to find his 13 - year - old daughter was missing .
He had been a prominent convert against bridal abduction – and now , he was told , the men of the area were " taking revenge " for " undermining our culture " .
Boge would not let the police rest until they found her – and once the girl was rescued , the local women refused this time to say she was dirty and ruined and shun her .
Not this time .
Not this girl .
Samiya Abebe , now a small 15 - year - old girl in an outsized women 's suit , tells me softly : " He grabbed me at the market and had my vagina mutilated and ... "
She can't bring herself to say much more .
After he and his brothers held her captive for three months , she was pregnant .
Before the rebellion , she would have become another Nurame , and faced a lifetime serving her rapist .
" Actually , I would have killed myself , " she says , with certainty .
But when she ran back , she was running into a transformed culture .
Her family said it was n't her fault and she was " brave and brilliant " for escaping .
A group of girls her age who went to the KMG meetings arranged to walk with her to school and back every day so she would n't be scared .
" They bought me presents – soap and schoolbooks – and said they would n't let anyone be mean to me ...
Now people know a girl can be kidnapped and come back – and live . "
Her baby was adopted .
After all this , she came seventh out of 110 students .
" If I finish my education , I can still be the woman I want to be , " she says , and beams .
What is replacing abduction ?
The younger women say they want to choose their own husbands , with a firm , decisive nod .
But when I ask the men , they disagree .
" I will decide whom [ my daughter ] marries , and I will expect a high bridal price because my daughter is beautiful – 50 cows , " one father tells me .
I ask Awano Busmalo , the man who resisted bridal abductions so fiercely his own daughter was kidnapped , and even he says : " I will choose her husband .
I will make sure he is HIV - negative and has enough money to provide , " he says .
And will his daughter be allowed to refuse to marry a rich , HIV - negative man ?
" No .
That is my decision , " he says .
In his stare , I see that eradicating abductions is the start of the story of freeing Ethiopian women , not its climax .
The lights outside Boge 's office – and across Addis Ababa – blink on for a moment , and then vanish again .
She says : " I know if this progress is going to last , I have to change all of the community – including the men . "
It led her towards a man nobody saw as her ally – and a startling conversion .
III St Paul ?
As I skid along the mud-streets of Kembatta with Alemu Dutbecho Kinole , women hail him everywhere .
They cross the road to clasp his hand ; with moist eyes , they cry " Thank you !
Thank you ! "
He is a 39 - year - old man with a slight beard , a leather jacket , and an intense , stooped stare .
He looks creased , like he has been stored away in an old suitcase for years .
He acknowledges their thanks with a nod , and a rat - a - tat - tat of questions about their lives today .
" He rescued me from being cut ! " one woman beams .
" He saved my cousin from abduction , " another adds .
This is not how anyone thought Alemu 's life would turn out – since he used to be Kembatta 's most notorious bandit , and a kidnapper of women .
Alemu speaks in a low , catarrh - clogged growl , the result of a problem with his chest that no doctor here has been able to diagnose .
He always sounds like he is hissing – and when he describes his past , this seems oddly appropriate .
We sit in the sun in the hills and he lets loose a long monologue : " I took my wife by force in 1994 .
She was engaged to somebody else .
I negotiated [ with her family ] for her but I lost to another man .
So I used my Kalashnikov .
I went to market with my Kalashnikov and I said if she did n't come with me I 'd kill her .
She came , there was no choice .
I put her in my uncle 's house and she was kept there .
Her family refused to negotiate for her so I went with two grenades and I said if you do n't negotiate I will blow you and your house up .
They agreed and we were married .
I thought , ' I love her , this is how you do it ' .
I did n't care if she loved me or not .
On the second day she might escape , so on the first day you rape her . "
He had been taught to seize and to steal , always .
He was conscripted into the Ethiopian army by the communist dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam when he was 14 and sent out to fight against the rebel guerrillas .
" I was very frightened , and every day I thought I would be killed , " he says .
They lived by seizing from the people at gunpoint .
" I was fighting hot battles – there was a lot of violence . "
Once he was demobilised from the army , he just carried on living the same way – raiding passers - by and villages , and living off the proceeds .
" I robbed so many people it is a miracle I am still alive , " he says .
Violence was how he ate and drank – and married .
When Boge first arrived in this area , he was sceptical .
Why are these women trying to change the way things have worked here for as long as anyone can remember ?
What good can come of it ?
" I went to see the video of the circumcision taking place , and I was shocked .
I did n't know it was so violent , so bloody .
That was the first time I began to think , " he says , lighting a cigarette .
His wife – who was only 16 when she was seized – began to attend the KMG meetings and talk about the feelings she had long interred .
When I meet her , Desalech Alema says bluntly : " I had been angry for a long time .
I went with him because I had no choice .
He raped me .
I was crying so I could n't shout for help .
I wanted to run back to my family but he threatened to shoot me .
Then I could say some of this . "
Alemu nods , and says : " I had n't ever thought in this way .
I changed .
When I heard about abductions , I began to weep .
I felt guilty . "
Desalech breaks in : " He became a better husband .
He started fetching water for me , and being kind . "
He laughs : " I am always checking to make sure she is fat !
I want her to be very well - fed ! "
They both giggle , sharing a long glance .
The transformation seems so vast and so sudden that , for days , I find it hard to credit .
Is it opportunistic ?
How could he not have known that abduction harmed women , and that it was wrong ?
Did n't he hear her screams ?
And yet it 's not as if every man makes this show of repentance .
The Kembatta Zonal Prison has a large guard - tower made of rusty sheet metal and barbed wire .
But once the guards let you pass , it seems incongruous – a long rolling patch of greenery with a few white dorm huts with cows strolling around casually in the sun , flicking away flies with their tails .
Swaying upbeat African music is blaring from a radio , while , in the corner , some prisoners are chopping wood .
" I will bring you the kidnapper , " says a female guard merrily .
They bring Zemach Subego into the prison office .
He is a long - faced , long - limbed 22 - year - old man who seems to feel no embarrassment about the reason why he is here serving a seven - year sentence .
" I helped my cousin kidnap a girl , " he says casually .
" He loved her and he wanted to marry her .
I do n't see it as a crime .
I did n't know it was supposed to be wrong .
We offered her family an ox [ as a bridal - price ] . "
He rubs his thighs with his palms and smirks .
" How could I know it was a crime ?
It is how my father got married .
I did n't think the law would get involved . "
When I ask how the girl feels about it , he chuckles : " I am sure she is waiting for us when we get out !
Who else will marry her now ? "
He laughs , and the guards laugh , and soon the whole room is in stitches .
Outside , a cow hears the noise , and moos cheerfully .
When I come out , I look at Alemu differently .
I watch him dart from meeting to meeting – one lobbying the police to prosecute abductions , another helping girls arrange workshops to stop genital mutilation .
There is an intensity and frenzy to it that seems authentic – an act of manic repentance .
I think of the story of St Paul , who persecuted Christians , only to become their defender .
In a pause between meetings , Alema stands with me , and smokes .
" I think a man can learn , " Alemu says , and then corrects himself : " I think a man must learn . "
IV Exodus
In Kembatta – the area where KMG is based – they have slashed the rate of bridal abductions by more than 90 per cent .
Because of them , Nurame 's daughters and grand - daughters will not rerun their mother 's story in an endless recurring loop of misery .
" It shows cultures can change when women are given a chance , " Boge says .
She stresses " we could n't have done it " without the support of the money raised through Sport Relief .
I think of all the kids doing sponsored runs and all the people calling up to make donations .
The cynicism – the money does n't get through , it 'll never make a difference – is , in this place , this time , flat - out wrong .
Now they need more money to save more girls : there are areas where the abductions remain endemic – and there is an added reason to act fast .
In theory , the Ethiopian government supports moves to eradicate bridal abduction : they know the country cannot develop if half its population is terrorised and not free .
But a new law threatens to wipe out the progress that has been made – and effectively to dismantle the women 's organisations .
Ethiopia has been slipping in a political mudslide towards being a police state for years .
Ask a taxi driver or a random person on the street what he thinks of the Prime Minister , Meles Zenawi , and he looks jolted and afraid .
He will mumble a non-committal phrase – such as " He is our leader , yes " – and try to get away from you a soon as possible .
The press serves up only the gruel of propaganda , pre-approved by the regime .
As a former Marxist guerrilla , Zenawi was never a true democrat , but political freedoms have been in freefall since the last election .
Critics of the regime and opposition politicians vanish into torture - jails and emerge lame and silent years later .
There has been an exodus of Ethiopians who work in human rights , and they are now scattered across the globe .
To a dictator , any self - organising , self - confident community is a threat to be dispersed – even if the community is organising to achieve a goal the regime shares .
If the people can talk to each other , there is a risk they will talk against the dictator .
So last year , the Ethiopian government passed one of the most restrictive laws anywhere in Africa .
They banned international human rights groups , saying it is " imperialist " to check to see if Ethiopians are being kidnapped or tortured .
At the same time , they passed a law saying all Ethiopian human rights groups need to raise 90 per cent of their income inside the country .
In practice , this means most of them have all but shut down .
The Ethiopian Women 's Lawyers Association ( EWLA ) has been the great legal champion opposing abduction and genital mutilation .
Now its leaders are in exile , unable to help anyone here .
At first , its senior figures nervously refuse to talk to me .
When one finally agrees to meet for coffee in an Addis Ababa café , she speaks only in oblique , fractured sentences , as if a secret policeman is standing over her shoulder .
( I wo n't give her name , for obvious reasons . )
" More than 80 per cent of our staff have had to be laid off , " she says , but adds quickly : " It is not a problem of government . "
The most she will say is there are still " some bad judges " .
When the interview is over , she seems physically to relax , her shoulders finally rolling out of a tense hunch .
KMG has been classified as a " humanitarian " rather than a " human rights " organisation – at every turn , it stresses it does n't oppose the government , but only wants to hold it to the standards it says it sets for itself – so for now it can still raise international funds .
But nobody knows when that too could be choked off – so the time to give is now .
On my final day in Ethiopia , Alemu takes me to meet a group of girls he has helped rescue from abductors .
They do not have the broken incoherence of the older women I met , who have never known freedom .
They talk about becoming doctors and lawyers and teachers ; they meet my eye , and argue back to the men around them .
When darkness begins to settle , we watch them disappear into the distance , joking and laughing among themselves .
Alemu sucks on his cigarette with a hard wheeze and says : " If somebody had abducted Boge , what would this area look like now ? "
He shakes his head , and looks away .
Some names have been changed to protect the identities of the women involved
Researchers at MIT and elsewhere have succeeded in creating a synthetic crystal that can very effectively control the transmission of heat — stopping it in its tracks and reflecting it back .
This advance could lead to insulating materials that could block the escape of heat more effectively than any present insulator .
This crystal structure was built using alternating layers of silicon dioxide ( the basis of the dielectric layers in most microchips ) and a polymer material .
The resulting two - component material successfully reflected phonons — vibrational waves that are the carriers of ordinary heat or sound , depending on their frequency .
In this case , the phonons were in the gigahertz range — in other words , low - level heat .
Edwin L. Thomas , head of MIT ’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering and the Morris Cohen Professor of Materials Science and Engineering , was a co-author of a new paper , published on March 10 in the journal Nano Letters , that describes this creation of phononic crystals in the hypersonic range ( that is , above the frequency range of sound , and thus can be considered in the range of heat ) .
Phonons may sometimes be thought of as particles , and sometimes as vibrational waves , analogous to the dual wave and particle nature of light .
Physically , the phonons are manifested as a wave of density variation passing through a material , like the wave of compression that travels along a child ’s Slinky toy when you stretch it out and give one end a shove .
Thomas says phonons , which exist in all solids , are usually a nuisance that must be disposed of with cooling systems .
They have been “ denigrated and ignored , but they could be the future star attraction if we can train them to do tricks for us . ”
Among other things , this could lead to highly efficient ways of scavenging heat that is now wasted , in everything from computers and cell phones to cars and power plants , in order to produce electricity .
This latest research , funded by the National Science Foundation and its German equivalent , DFG , is still at the level of simple tricks , he says : “ It ’s a step on the path . ”
Phonons can be controlled through manufactured crystal - like structures .
In this latest research , Thomas and his colleagues in Germany and Greece fabricated a “ one- dimensional periodic ” crystal structure , which means that although the material has three dimensions , its regularly varying molecular structure — in this case , alternating layers of two different materials — only varies along one direction , like a stack of vanilla and chocolate ice cream where the layers alternate .
So if you look at a single layer , there ’s just a uniform color , but if you drill through the stack , you find regularly alternating layers .
When the spacing between similar layers matches the wavelength of the phonons , those phonons are blocked and reflected back .
The phonons that are reflected from this newly developed material are in the range of low - frequency heat ( since anything above absolute zero , or minus 273 degrees Celsius , is considered heat , which is just due to the movement of vibrational waves ) .
Hence , this reflector currently only works at sub- freezing temperatures .
Further work on decreasing the thickness of the layers could bring them closer to the range of a theoretical “ perfect insulator ” that could block heat of a certain frequency range in an ordinary room - temperature environment .
And this could open up a host of potential applications .
No material is ever going to be perfect , but even a material that reflects back a very high percentage of heat could be a big improvement over present insulators .
For example , a shell of such material could be used to maintain the temperature in a package of delicate research instruments in a frigid environment .
How far off are such applications ?
“ It ’s close , if you do n’t worry about price , ” Thomas says — which may be the case for some uses such as spacecraft , or instruments deployed in Antarctica .
And as the technology develops and as production gets scaled up , prices could eventually come down far enough to enable more widespread applications .
Ihab El - Kady , a researcher at Sandia National Laboratories , says that while much current research on phonons involves the creation of two - or three - dimensional crystals , which may have greater long - term applications , there are some advantages to studying one - dimensional crystals as Thomas and his co-authors did in this case .
“ One - D systems are still preferable for their ease of fabrication , and can offer particular insight into the basic physical mechanics of phononic crystals , ” he says .
“ In that light , this paper represents a novel and insightful tool ” for analyzing fundamental wave phenomena , as well as the interactions between phonons and other particles such as photons .
Most early work on phonons dealt with sound - wave frequencies , which can be manipulated using larger crystal structures , but advances in nanotechnology have made it possible to create materials with structures small enough to handle the high - frequency , short - wavelength phonons associated with heat .
The best way to understand the enormous potential of devices that control phonons is by comparing them to devices that control electrons and photons , says Thomas .
He explains that our growing understanding of electrons and photons — which carry electricity and light , respectively — has led to decades of technological innovation , including the invention of lasers , transistors , photovoltaic cells and microchips .
These basic inventions , in turn , made possible most of the devices that define modern life , including cell phones , computers , DVD players and flat - screen TVs .
Now there are a lot of people trying to understand phonons , he says , which could lead to a similar proliferation of new — and impossible to predict — technologies .
As a result , Thomas says , the field of phononics “ has the potential to rocket off . ”
London , England ( CNN ) --
There are " compelling reasons " to believe the Israeli government was responsible for forging British passports used in a plot to kill a Hamas leader in the United Arab Emirates earlier this year , British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Tuesday .
" Such misuse of British passports is intolerable , " Miliband said , adding that the fact that Israel was an ally of the United Kingdom " only adds insult to injury . "
The passports were " copied from genuine British passports " in a " highly sophisticated operation , " indicating a government was behind it , Miliband told the House of Commons .
Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency concluded that the 12 British people whose passports were cloned where " wholly innocent victims of identity theft , " the foreign secretary said .
The UK expelled an Israeli diplomat and changed the advice it gives its citizens about traveling to Israel as a result of the scandal , Miliband said .
He did not name the diplomat or say what rank the envoy held .
" The UK had absolutely no advance knowledge of what happened in Dubai nor any involvement whatsoever in the killing " of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , he said .
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman complained that the Israelis " have not been given any evidence pointing to Israel 's involvement in the affair . "
" We attribute great importance to our relations with Great Britain , " he said .
" We maintain several different and sensitive dialogues with the UK , and we regret the British decision . "
French authorities also have opened an investigation into the alleged use of forged documents , the Paris prosecutor 's office said Tuesday .
Suspects in the killing allegedly used four doctored French passports , the prosecutor said in a written statement .
" Further investigation has revealed that these four passports were actually false as the photos did not correspond to the names appearing in each document , " the statement said .
Al - Mabhouh , a founding member of Hamas ' military wing , was found dead January 20 in his Dubai hotel room .
Police believe he was killed the night before , allegedly by the secretive Israeli foreign intelligence unit Mossad .
Two sources told CNN earlier this month that the number of identified suspects in al - Mabhouh 's death was up to 27 .
Of them , 26 were carrying European or Australian passports , authorities have said .
The sources -- an official familiar with the investigation and a police source -- did not say which nation issued the passport used by the 27th suspect .
The 27 suspects are believed to have acquired false passports to travel to Dubai for the killing , then scattered to several far - flung locations afterward .
But Lt. Gen. Dahi Khalfan Tamim , Dubai police chief , has said not all the suspects had fraudulent passports --
" We know some of the names are real . "
Interpol , the international police agency , has issued " red notices " to help search for the suspects .
The notices are not international arrest warrants , but are a way of alerting police forces around the world that the suspects are wanted by United Arab Emirates authorities .
Interpol expands search for suspects
Interpol Secretary - General Ronald K. Noble said investigators have established " clear " links through passport records , video surveillance , DNA analysis , witness interviews and hotel , credit card , phone and transport records , according to a statement .
Police have said toxicology results show al - Mabhouh was injected with succinylcholine , a drug used to relax muscles during surgery or as an anesthetic , before he was suffocated .
Signs indicated that al - Mabhouh resisted as he was being suffocated , police said .
Al - Mabhouh 's family members were told earlier that police had found blood on a pillow .
Authorities have also said the killers left some of al - Mabhouh 's medication next to him in an apparent effort to make the death appear natural .
But " the medication left next to him in the room has nothing to do with the killing , " Tamim has said .
Tamim told CNN last month that he is " 100 percent sure " Mossad was responsible .
" The Mossad needs to be ashamed of its actions , " he said .
" They sent 26 , 27 persons to assassinate one man who was involved in the capturing and killing of two Israeli soldiers . "
Dubai police : Mossad should be ' ashamed '
Hamas has said al - Mabhouh was behind the 1989 deaths of the Israeli soldiers .
Israel has a stated policy on security matters of neither confirming nor denying involvement .
Lieberman , however , told Israel Army Radio earlier this month , " There is certainly no reason to think that the Mossad and not some other intelligence agency of another country operated there . "
The total of 27 suspects does not include two Palestinians arrested in Jordan and returned to Dubai .
Tamim said one is not believed to be directly involved in al - Mabhouh 's death , but " he is wanted by one of the Palestinian factions in the Palestinian territories and he is sentenced to death and that 's why we will extradite him . "
He declined to discuss anything about the other Palestinian .
CNN 's Guy Azriel in Jerusalem and Niki Cook in Paris , France , contributed to this report .

Tough luck if your team is hurting for points this week , there are n't too many valuable players on the wire that 'll help with buckets .
If Marcus Thornton or Darren Collison are still out there , run do n't walk to pick them up .
With Chris Paul out 4 - 6 weeks , there will be plenty of shots to go around between these two guys .
Assuming you 're in the average fantasy league where Collison and Thornton are long gone , there are still some guys with value out there , but do n't expect any help in points .
Here are a few guys that can help in other categories .
J.J. Redick , ORL
Redick has been getting good minutes in the last few games for Orlando and has not disappointed .
In his last 3 games , Redick is averaging 2.0 threes per game as well as 4 dimes and is shooting 90 % from the stripe .
If you choose to pick up Redick , keep him on a short leash as he has been streaky all season .
Jared Jeffries , NY
Jeffries is an intriguing option in that he can provide a rare combination of blocks , threes , steals , and boards .
In his last 3 games , he has logged big minutes and averaged 1.7 threes , 6 boards , and 2.6 steals plus blocks .
His inconsistency at the foul line might be a cause for concern , but if your team can handle it , he 's a solid pickup .
Ben Wallace , DET
Big Ben has always been a questionable fantasy pickup , but when he 's producing he can help your team out a lot in the harder to earn categories .
You should never expect double digit points with Wallace , but he has proven in his last 3 that his defense alone is worth giving him a look .
1.3 steals , 2 blocks , and a season average of 9.2 boards should merit a pickup in deeper league .
Ryan Hollins , MIN
Hollins has started the last two games in favor of Kevin Love , and has had two great nights .
Over the last 2 games he 's averaging 17.5 points along with 2.0 blocks and a stellar 68 % from the field .
If Halons keeps getting minutes , he would definitely be worth picking up .
I 'll surely be monitoring Minnesota 's next game closely to see if Hollins keeps up his string of good games .

And it is unclear if the new powers or the rate board would have much long - term impact .
The Democrats ’ legislation ultimately seeks to sharply curtail the existing individual insurance market in which companies like Anthem Blue Cross now sell their policies .
Instead , such policies would be heavily regulated by the federal government and sold through new insurance exchanges , where consumers could compare prices and benefits packages and choose policies that best fit their needs .
The president ’s bill , like the measures adopted by the House and Senate , is expected to require most Americans to obtain insurance , and would provide new federal subsidies to help moderate - income people afford to buy private coverage .
And though Americans have heard officials in both parties talk for nearly a year about “ President Obama ’s health care plan , ” the legislation unveiled on Monday will actually be the first comprehensive proposal put forward by the White House .
Senator Feinstein , in an interview , pointed to the $ 12.2 billion in profits reaped by the five biggest private insurers in 2009 .
“ When you look at the profits in ’09 , up 56 percent over the year before , ” she said , “ you begin to understand that something is going on that is not in the interests of the American people . ”
Ms. Feinstein said that only 25 states allowed their insurance commissioners to regulate rates and that California was not one of them .
“ For the life of me , I am not sure why not , ” she said .
“ The time has come for the secretary of health and human services to step into this . ”
Mr. Obama has portrayed Thursday ’s meeting as a chance to break the partisan gridlock that has stalled any progress on health care this year .
He has called on the Republicans to come forward with proposals of their own .
But absent some dramatic turnabout by Republicans , Democratic leaders will have only one other possible path  approving changes to the Senate bill by attaching them to an expedited budget measure , precluding a Republican filibuster in the Senate .
Even many Democratic lawmakers are skeptical that the complex health care legislation can be moved through using that parliamentary maneuver .
BANGKOK , Thailand —
Asia ’s most venerated beast , the tiger , is being wiped out by those most obsessed with its folky mystique .
Despite prohibitions throughout Asia , businessmen still bestow bushy tiger pelts as auspicious gifts .
Apothecaries still treat leprosy with a dab of tiger fat .
Wine is spiked with pureed tiger bones in hopes of boosting of strength .
Conservationists fear that 2010 , the Year of the Tiger , will stir even more interest in the black market for tiger parts .
But with the world ’s wild tiger population dwindling fast — to roughly 3,200 from last century ’s 100,000 — global interests are mobilizing a tiger bail - out plan .
If Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , the World Bank and more than 30 NGOs succeed with their “ Global Tiger Initiative , ” the wild tiger population will double by 2022 — the next Year of the Tiger .
If they fail and trends continue ?
“ We could see the extinction of the wild tiger , ” said Mike Baltzer , heading the initiative for the World Wildlife Fund .
“ It ’s unlikely we ’ll lose the last individual tiger ... but could see tigers to the point where they ca n’t survive in the wild . ”
A “ poaching epidemic ” is largely to blame for slashing the tiger population more than 95 percent in the past century , Baltzer said .
But tigers are also losing their habitats to human development .
As more forests become farms or neighborhoods , both tigers and their prey — typically hoofed beasts — have less land to cling to .
On Jan. 27 - 29 forestry ministers from 13 tiger - inhabited countries met in Thailand ’s seaside Hua Hin resort to hammer out conservation promises .
Attended by delegates from India , Thailand , China and 10 other nations , the gathering was a warm - up for a larger pact - making meeting in Vladivostok , Russia .
That September summit will showcase various heads of state , World Bank President Robert Zoellick and Putin , the face of the initiative and a known tiger lover .
In 2008 , Putin subdued a Siberian tiger with a tranquilizer dart and pulled back its thick jowls to the delight of film crews , who later broadcast the footage around the world .
Still , conservationists are much more interested in support from officials in China .
Though the domestic trade of tiger parts is outlawed there , Chinese customers drive much of the demand for skin , wine , powder and talismans made from tigers .
China ’s State Forestry Administration has called for a crackdown on smugglers of tiger parts and better monitoring of tiger farms , which profit from tourism .
According to a recent report by Xinhua , China ’s state - owned news agency , only 50 wild tigers remain in all of China .
Its farms hold about 5,000 .
Traffic International , a wildlife monitoring network that tracks the Chinese trade , believes the tiger market has diminished but still persists .
Xu Hongfa , head of the group ’s China office , welcomed promises of enforcement .
“ 2010 will determine if the tiger ’s future burns bright or continues to fade away , ” he said in a statement .
Still , many contributors to the Global Tiger Initiative are wary of China ’s commitment .
“ There have been notable cases of enforcement , ” said William Schaedla , director of World Wildlife Fund Thailand .
“ But at the moment , we ’re not seeing many indications that the Chinese government is closing down the tiger market . ”
The fur trade in China is large , he said .
But demand for medicinals — scientifically dubious wines , powders , creams and tonics — is much larger .
“ I wo n’t say it ’s traditional Chinese medicine , ” Schaedla said .
“ We ’ve taken to calling it Chinese folk medicine . ”
The American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine , a Global Tiger Initiative participant , condemns the use of tiger parts for medical purposes .
Reviving the tiger population will require more armed anti-poaching squads to chase down poachers and destroy tiger traps .
The World Bank has already promised $ 1.5 million to train conservation officers in various countries .
India ’s government has even created an online “ Tigernet ” database , which tracks poaching arrests and discoveries of tiger remains .
The initiative will also beef up reactive measures , such as training port - of - entry baggage handlers to spot smuggled wildlife products — an effort partially funded , in Thailand at least , by the U.S. government .
Far more difficult , however , is convincing bureaucrats to say no — to bridges , roads and housing developments that recklessly eat into tiger country .
Conservation agencies have secured commitments from India and Thailand .
But success is less promising in junta - run Burma , which shares a 82,200 square - mile swath of tiger - friendly habitat with Thailand .
Burma ’s supply of tigers and weakly governed border with China is already known as a tiger trafficking corridor .
“ We believe that tigers are now very close to extinction , ” Baltzer said .
“ They ’re really clinging to the last places they can survive . ”
An extremely small RNA molecule created by a University of Colorado at Boulder team can catalyze a key reaction needed to synthesize proteins , the building blocks of life .
The findings could be a substantial step toward understanding " the very origin of Earthly life , " the lead researcher contends .
The smallest RNA enzyme ever known to perform a cellular chemical reaction is described in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The paper was written by CU graduate student Rebecca Turk , research associate Nataliya Chumachenko and Professor Michael Yarus of the molecular , cellular and developmental biology department .
Cellular RNA can have hundreds or thousands of its basic structural units , called nucleotides .
Yarus ' team focused on a ribozyme -- a form of RNA that can catalyze chemical reactions -- with only five nucleotides .
Tom Blumenthal , a professor and chair of the MCDB department , noted that Tom Cech , a Nobel laureate and distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry at CU , and Professor Norman Pace of MCDB , independently discovered that RNA can act as an enzyme , carrying out chemical reactions .
That " pioneering work " has been carried on further by Yarus , Blumenthal said .
Because proteins are complex , one vexing question is where the first proteins came from , Blumenthal said .
" It now appears that the first catalytic macromolecules could have been RNA molecules , since they are somewhat simpler , were likely to exist early in the formation of the first life forms , and are capable of catalyzing chemical reactions without proteins being present , " he said .
" In this paper the Yarus group has made the amazing discovery that even an extremely tiny RNA can by itself catalyze a key reaction that would be needed to synthesize proteins , " Blumenthal said .
" Nobody expected an RNA molecule this small and simple to be able to do such a complicated thing as that . "
The finding adds weight to the " RNA World " hypothesis , which proposes that life on Earth evolved from early forms of RNA .
" Mike Yarus has been one of the strongest proponents of this idea , and his lab has provided some of the strongest evidence for it over the past two decades , " Blumenthal said .

Yarus noted that the RNA World hypothesis was complicated by the fact that RNA molecules are hard to make .
" This work shows that RNA enzymes could have been far smaller , and therefore far easier to make under primitive conditions , than anyone has expected . "
If very simple RNA molecules such as the product of the Yarus lab could have accelerated chemical reactions in Earth 's primordial stew , the chances are much greater that RNA could direct and accelerate biochemical reactions under primitive conditions .
Before the advent of RNA , most biologists believe , there was a simpler world of chemical replicators that could only make more of themselves , given the raw materials of the time , Yarus said .
" If there exists that kind of mini- catalyst , a ' sister ' to the one we describe , the world of the replicators would also jump a long step closer and we could really feel we were closing in on the first things on Earth that could undergo Darwinian evolution , " Yarus said .
" In other words , we may have taken a substantial step toward the very origin of Earthly life , " he said .
" However , keep well in mind that the tiny replicator has not been found , and that its existence will be decided by experiments not yet done , perhaps not yet imagined . "
" Dr. Yarus has brought an innovative approach to bear on the key question of how complex processes originated , " said Michael Bender , a biologist who oversees protein synthesis grants at the National Institutes of Health 's National Institute of General Medical Sciences .
" By showing that a tiny segment of RNA can perform a key step of protein synthesis , this study has provided evidence that fundamental , protein - mediated cellular processes may have arisen from RNA - based mechanisms . "
Yarus ' work is supported by a $ 415,610 grant from the NIH .
In 2008 he was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science for " meritorious efforts to advance science or its applications . "
Time For Anti Freedom Brady Campaign To Act Stupid… Again
With 4 million new guns last year and violent crime now at historic lows the Brady Campaign still insists more guns equal more crime … LOL
FAIRFAX , VA –-( AmmoLand.com ) -
Since its inception as the National Council to Control Handguns over 30 years ago , the Brady Campaign has premised its entire agenda on the notion that having more gun control laws and , therefore , fewer guns , means that crime must necessarily decrease .
History has not been kind to the group ’s delusion , however .
In recent decades , the severity of gun control laws has been diminished at the federal , state and local levels , the number of guns has increased by over four million a year on average , and today , the nation ’s murder and total violent crime rates are at 45 - year and 35 - year lows , respectively .
If you ’re a gun control group , this is n’t the kind of thing you want to put in your press releases to the Washington Post , of course .
So , every year the Brady Campaign instead runs a little gimmick where it assigns arbitrary school - grade values to whatever gun control laws the group happens to be pushing at the moment .
And since most states do n’t have the laws Brady advocates , Brady gives most states very low grades .
Naturally , gun control supporters plaster Brady ’s school - grade nonsense on the pages of newspapers around the country , hoping people will take it seriously .
Brady came out with its 2010 “ grades ” this week , and once again we ’ll take them as seriously as they deserve .
With the nation ’s murder rate having been cut in half since 1991 , as Brady ’s agenda has been dismantled or rejected by Congress and one state legislature after another , and the numbers of guns , gun owners , Right - to - Carry states , and carry permit holders have risen to all - time highs with no end in sight .
Here are the “ highlights ” of Brady ’s annual exercise in school - grade silliness :
Out of a possible 100 points and four “ stars , ” if a state had all of the gun control laws Brady wants , our nation ’s 50 states received an average score of only 17 points and only eight - tenths of a star .
Brady gave only two states “ passing ” scores for having some of the gun laws it wants , California with a C+ and New Jersey with a C .
There were no “ Ds . ” The other 48 states received “ Fs. ” Yes , we are talking about states with restrictive laws , such as Massachusetts , Maryland , New York , Hawaii and Illinois–all of which got “ Fs . ”
Brady gave California its best grade , for having the most gun control , even though California ’s murder and total violent crime rates are 10 percent and 13 percent higher , respectively , than the rates for the rest of the country .
its best grade , for having the most gun control , even though California ’s murder and total violent crime rates are , respectively , than the rates for the rest of the country .
Utah got Brady ’s lowest grade because it has the fewest gun control laws , a fact lamented with all the feigned sorrow and indignation that gun control supporters in the Beehive State can muster .
Fortunately , every cloud has a silver lining .
Though certainly disillusioned with their low standing among the nation ’s anti-gun fringe , the good people of Utah can take at least some comfort in the fact that their murder and violent crime rates are 76 percent and 56 percent lower , respectively , than California’s .
Is it our imagination , or are Brady ’s state grades getting worse as the nation ’s crime rates go down ?
About :
Established in 1871 , the National Rifle Association is America ’s oldest civil rights and sportsmen ’s group .
Four million members strong , NRA continues its mission to uphold Second Amendment rights and to advocate enforcement of existing laws against violent offenders to reduce crime .
The Association remains the nation ’s leader in firearm education and training for law - abiding gun owners , law enforcement and the military .
After his dismal performance at this weekend 's CPAC conference , Minnesota Governor and 2012 White House hopeful Tim Pawlenty might want to ask for a mulligan .
Before finishing a distant fourth in the CPAC straw poll , Pawlenty 's speech was panned by the conservative faithful he sought to impress .
Worse still , his painful Tiger Woods " 9 iron " joke about " big government " not only fell flat , but served to highlight Governor Pawlenty 's dependence on the very federal stimulus funds he continued to denounce on Meet the Press Sunday .
In a red meat moment served up to feed frenzied Tea Baggers inside and outside the hall , the man who calls himself T - Paw casually endorsed their rage ( and worse ) by suggesting conservatives emulate the troubled Woods family :
" Not from Tiger , but from his wife .
So , she said , ' I 've had enough . '
She said , ' No more . '
I think we should take a page out of her playbook and take a nine iron and smash the window out of big government in this country . "
But back in Minnesota , Tim Pawlenty is only too happy to receive handouts from the big government he decries .
Facing a $ 1.2 billion budget deficit , Pawlenty has proposed slashing health care coverage , education funding and aid to municipalities .
Still , to fully close the gap , Pawlenty 's proposal relies on $ 387 million in stimulus funds from Washington .
As the Minnesota Star Tribune reported :
Nearly one - third of the governor 's budget fix would rely on $ 387 million in federal stimulus money .
That money is n't yet in the bank and , if it does n't come through , the cuts could be far deeper .
Ironically , this episode comes just days after Governor Pawlenty exhumed the stinking corpse of the balanced budget amendment in a Politico op - ed titled , " Ponzi Scheme on the Potomac . "
Without ever detailing how a President T - Paw would cut spending , Pawlenty nevertheless argued :
That 's why we need an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to require a balanced budget with limited exceptions for war , natural disasters and other emergencies .
Every state but one has a balanced budget requirement , and while such requirements make for difficult decisions , they work .
Pawlenty 's dependence on the Obama stimulus program he ridiculed as " ludicrous " , " misdirected " and " largely wasted " hardly ends with plugging holes in the Minnesota budget .
As ThinkProgress documented , in August , Pawlenty 's economic development chief vouched for the Recovery Act 's success in producing jobs in the Land of the 10,000 Lakes :
Pawlenty 's criticisms of the stimulus are at odds with both economists and the statements of Pawlenty 's own economic development director , Dan McElroy .
McElroy , Pawlenty 's " point man on jobs and economic development , " leads the Department of Employment and Economic Development .
He recently went on a 10 city road show titled " Advancing Economic Prosperity " touting the benefits of the stimulus .
Speaking about the positive effects of the stimulus , McElroy said :
" Our goal was to put this money to work as quickly as possible .
Communities and job - seekers throughout Minnesota are seeing tangible results from this funding . "
Tom Hanson , Pawlenty 's top financial advisor , concurred .
He told legislators that cash from that big government back in DC would make " all of our lives just a little bit easier , " adding :
" The federal money will give us the opportunity to accept federal assistance and push it out into our state , to help as many people as possible . "
But on Meet the Press Sunday , Pawlenty resumed both the anti-stimulus drumbeat and his unique brand of voodoo economics .
Asked by host David Gregory about the $ 787 billion ARRA which created thousands of jobs in his home state of Minnesota and up to two million nationwide , T - Paw said the Obama administration " did it the wrong way . "
Instead , the man who would constitutionally mandate a balanced federal budget offered up more of the same snake oil that led to a tripling of the national debt under Ronald Reagan and a doubling under George W. Bush :
" David , I do n't disagree that we need to do things to stimulate and grow the economy .
But the way to do that is to take the tax code and extend the Bush tax cuts , cut the payroll tax , encourage growth in the private economy by reducing capital gains burdens . "
And so it goes .
In one of his first chances to tee off on the national stage , Tim Pawlenty 's shot landed squarely in a sand trap .
After his CPAC debacle , Pawlenty needs to put the club down or , at least , stop hitting himself .

Michelle Berman , an associate curator of vertebrate zoology at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History in California , is wary of whale organs in general , but blue - whale kidneys top the list .
" They fill the entire bucket of an excavator and weigh hundreds of pounds , " she explains .
" You have to make sure it does n't fall on you when you cut it free . "
When a whale or dolphin washes ashore nearby , Berman and her colleagues study the remains .
Smaller animals can be taken back to the lab , but whales — like a huge blue whale that washed up dead in 2007 — have to be processed on - site .
The crew , wearing yellow rain slickers and using long - handled knives , cuts the blubber off in yards - long strips before diving into the thoracic cavity .
Berman then systematically cuts through the innards organ by organ , collecting samples before the organs are lifted carefully out of the way — sometimes using heavy machinery — to reveal the next layer .
Besides researchers wading knee - deep in blood , the whale 's fatty oils stick to skin and hair , and the smell can last for years .
" [ A fresh corpse ] has a metallic smell to it , because the myoglobin has lots of iron in it , " Berman says .
" As the whale decomposes , it gets that rotting smell . "
Gases in a decomposing whale can build up and launch guts all over the beach if you make a wrong cut .
( Luckily , Berman has only had a dolphin explode on her . )
Her samples have helped determine that a killer whale had died of salmonella and that parasites were causing mass beachings of pilot whales .
The more she cuts , the more she learns .
" If I 'm stinking up the place , that 's how you know I 'm working , " she says .
" Once we get enough samples , it benefits the species as a whole . "

The Abel Prize 2010 has been awarded to John T. Tate from the University of Texas at Austin " for his vast and lasting impact on the theory of numbers " .
The honour puts Tate on a par with a Nobel Prize winner .
In fact , the Abel Prize was established to make up for the fact that there is no Nobel Prize in mathematics .
Number theory lies right at the heart of maths , its history stretching back all the way to ancient Greece .
It 's concerned with the whole numbers , the patterns you can find within them and the interactions between them .
To many mathematicians the study of these numbers captures the very essence of maths and reveals all of its beauty .
As Carl Friedrich Gauss put it , " mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics . "
But while most number theorists have been drawn to the field for its own sake , important applications have emerged over the last few decades .
It is number theory that provides the essential tools for encrypting the information we send over the Internet , from credit card details to private email messages .
Tate 's contributions to number theory are wide - ranging .
His career has spanned six decades and a whole zoo of mathematical objects carry his name .
Some of the questions he has worked on are almost as old as our ability to count .
Take , for example , the prime numbers .
Every whole number is a product of a unique set of prime numbers , so the primes are in effect the atoms of number theory .
We have known since the time of Euclid that there are infinitely many primes , but finding out just how they are distributed amongst the other numbers has proved much more difficult : if you 're given one prime , there is no sure - fire of telling what the next one is .
The efforts to reveal the secrets of the prime numbers have led to some extremely sophisticated mathematics , and have posed one of the most important , and the most difficult , question of maths , known as the Riemann hypothesis .
Tate 's work has been central to developing this part of mathematics , edging us ever closer to a solution .
Another favourite problem of number theorists is to find whole number solutions to simple - looking equations .
An example is the equation x2+y2=z2 ( which you might recognise from Pythagoras ' theorem ) .
Are there whole numbers x , y and z , which satisfy this equation ?
In this case , the answer is yes , in fact there are infinitely many triples of numbers that do .
For other similar equations though , the answer is far from straight - forward .
Fermat 's last theorem , which involves equations xn+yn=zn for a whole number n> 2 , is a case in point , as it took almost 400 years and extremely sophisticated maths to prove .
Tate 's work has provided high - powered mathematical machinery to attack problems of this nature .
And while his primary interest lies in the beauty of the mathematics for its own sake , the insight provided by this area of study has important applications in the design of mobile phones , smart cards and even air traffic control systems .
The mathematician Marcus du Sautoy has written an excellent and accessible explanation of some of Tate 's work , which you can find on the Abel Prize website .
As Du Sautoy puts it , " Just as the telescope allowed astronomers to see new worlds , Tate 's mathematics has provided tools and insights which have allowed the mathematicians of this generation to see further into the universe of numbers than ever before .
He truly deserves the title of the Galileo of number theory . "

This guy again .
You know , the one who told Virginia universities it was okay to discriminate against gay students ?
Or how he told Virginia residents that he thought he could challenge Obama 's presidency based on his birth place ?
Or how he said he was n't getting a Social Security number for his kid because it 's being " used to track you " ?
That 's the guy , freakishly right wing , birther numbskull Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli .
He 's talking big again :
Virginia will file suit against the federal government if the Democrats ' health care reform bill is approved , said a spokesman for Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II ( R ) this afternoon .
Cuccinelli has suggested previously he would likely file suit , but spokesman Brian Gottstein said that Virginia 's lawsuit over government health care is now certain .
Although Gottstein gave no details of the legal basis for this kind of lawsuit , he indicated that the process is " still being worked out . "
In a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , Cuccinelli warns Democrats of using the " deem and pass " approach , which would not permit a freestanding vote on the Senate - passed health care reform bill .
It is owned by its employees – or partners – who have a say in how it is run , and receive a share of the profits .
Surely this the way every organisation should be run . . .
It 's just before opening time on bonus day at John Lewis and , boy , are we excited .
Up and down the country , the 69,000 people who work for the nation 's favourite retailer are gathered , impatient .
At head office in London 's Victoria , in 28 John Lewis department stores from Southampton to Aberdeen , 223 Waitrose supermarkets from Plymouth to Norwich , the ritual 's the same : a specially chosen staff member ( " partner " in JL - speak ) opens an envelope , and reads out a number .
The number will be a percentage .
Over the last decade or so , it has ranged from 9 % to 22 % .
It 's the percentage of their salary that each John Lewis employee , from executive chairman to checkout operative , takes home as that year 's bonus .
If the number is 8 % , they 're looking at an extra month 's pay ; 16 % is two months .
So what 's in the envelope is pretty important , and in the partnership 's flagship Oxford Street store , partners , nearly 2,500 of them , are everywhere : crowded dozens - deep in beauty on the ground floor , lined up on the escalators , hanging over the balconies in the atrium .
" This is the moment , " says Adrian Wenn from pictures , lights and mirrors .
" This is the moment when all you 've done , the contribution you 've made , when it all comes home .
Hope it 's a good one .
I 've got a wedding to pay for . "
A good one it is .
Frank d'Souza from furniture ( picked because he closed the store 's largest single sale of last year , at £ 50,000 ) tears open the envelope as the assembled throng counts down .
He holds the card triumphantly high : 15 % .
" Magic , " cries Lee Bowra from childrenswear .
" Absolutely brilliant .
That 's our deposit complete .
We can buy a house . "
In the depths of what everyone keeps telling us is the deepest financial and economic crisis since the second world war , John Lewis plainly has not done badly ( operating profit up 20 % , if you did n't read the business pages last week ) .
That 's partly because it stacks its shelves with goods of a certain quality , and sells them to a certain kind of customer with a certain standard of service .
After all , Middle England loves John Lewis : if a product is on sale in one of its stores , you know you can trust it .
Plus you can be sure you 'll be served by someone who really knows what they 're talking about and , most unusually of all , is eager to help .
Partly , it 's down to that splendidly arcane Edwardian slogan : Never Knowingly Undersold .
It also has something to do with the reason everyone was cheering so loudly last Thursday : unlike other high - street names ( unlike most companies , in fact ) , John Lewis is owned by a trust on behalf of its employees , each of whom has a say in its running and a share in its profits .
This is Britain 's largest and most venerable example of worker co-ownership .
Its avowed purpose is not the making of shedloads of short - term profit to placate a bunch of remote and greedy shareholders , but " the happiness of all its members , through their worthwhile and satisfying employment in a successful business " ( that 's from the partnership 's constitution .
It bears re-reading ) .
And at a time when the limits of the more traditional capitalist model of shareholder ownership stand cruelly exposed , John Lewis 's ongoing success is increasingly prompting all three main political parties to point to it as a possible template – for other companies , for schools , hospitals , even local councils .
But what 's it like to work for an outfit run like this ?
Well , it 's worth noting that there are some partners who were n't at work last week to hear the 2010 bonus announced .
They were off staying at one of the five holiday centres the partnership owns and runs for the benefit of its employees .
These include a 16th - century castle with private beach on Brownsea island in Poole harbour , an imposing Victorian pile on the shores of Lake Windermere , a 24 - room outdoor and watersports club on Lake Bala in north Wales , and a country house hotel in 4,000 rolling acres of Hampshire .
Nicola McRoberts and her partner , Pedro Pereira , are staying in one of the 12 modern wooden lodges on the Leckford Estate , near Stockbridge .
The self - catering cabins , popular with young families , have two or three bedrooms and are smartly furnished with leather sofas and bedlinen that a John Lewis shopper might recognise .
Nicola works in the stationery department in Welwyn , and Pedro is a Waitrose chef .
They 're here for five nights , at a cost of £ 176 .
" It 's a good company to work for , " says Pedro .
" I did n't realise how good until I joined . "
Employer - employee relations at John Lewis , says Nicola , " are completely different .
They want you to be happy . "
The estate is a working farm which , says its managing director Malcolm Crabtree , sitting at the wheel of his Land Rover , supplies Waitrose with flour for bread , barley , oats for cereal , free - range chickens and eggs , organic milk , apples , pears and a lot of mushrooms .
It also supplies partners with two nine - hole golf courses , a cricket pitch , bowling green , tennis courts , two swimming pools and some of the finest fly - fishing in the country , on the fabled river Test .
Just down from the lodges , in the heart of the estate and a stroll from the river , is Leckford Abbas , an appealing ivy - clad manor house now run as a hotel for partners .
There 's an oak - panelled library , an elegant lounge , a billiard room and a well - stocked bar , and the food in the dining room is fresh from the Leckford estate .
The most noticeable difference between this and some chic home counties hostelry is the price .
B&B here is £ 20.25 per person per night , and the three - course dinner costs £ 11.25 .
The other significant difference is that the bedroom doors lack keys .
" There are privacy locks on the inside , " says manager Chris Marston , " but you can't lock the rooms from the outside .
There 's a feeling it would n't be . . . right .
It 's partners and their guests who stay . "
In the lounge is Anna Clark , who worked for John Lewis for 27 years before retiring last year – retired partners , providing they completed 10 years service , get the same benefits as working ones .
" I can't tell you what that means to me , " she says .
" But I 've always used my benefits – I 've been in the gliding club , the sailing club , the photographic club .
It 's not just the bonus at John Lewis , you know . "
Too right it is n't .
Besides the bonus , John Lewis partners also have a rare and near - priceless non-contributory final salary pension scheme .
They and a named other ( husband , girlfriend , mother , whoever ) get 25 % off most John Lewis products , and 15 % in Waitrose .
There are half - price theatre and concert tickets ; subsidies for whatever educational or leisure course they want to follow ; plus a raft of sabbatical and extended leave possibilities .
What matters to Ann King , who is on a Leckford art course with Clark , is that " you still belong .
I 'm retired , and single now , and it 's precious to know there 's all this to do , and that everywhere you go you 'll meet people you feel you have a connection to . "
It 's not easy to find an unhappy John Lewis partner , despite the fact that they stay with the company twice as long as the industry average .
That 's partly , says Wenn at the Oxford Street store , " because if you 're unhappy about something , you have a responsibility to do something about it . "
Which brings us to the man who invented the John Lewis model .
Long before it became a hotel for staff of the two retailers Britain loves best ( see the last few Which ? and Verdict consumer satisfaction surveys ) , Leckford Abbas was his country home .
Born in 1885 , John Spedan Lewis was a radical with the means to do something about it .
There were plenty in the early 20th century ( and , for that matter , now ) who believed , like him , that " the present state of affairs is a perversion of the proper workings of capitalism " ; that it is " all wrong to have millionaires before you have ceased to have slums " ; that " the dividends paid to some shareholders " for doing essentially nothing were obscene when " workers earn hardly more than a bare living " ; and that co-ownership and partnership , rather than exploitative employment , might be " the new source of working energy of which our country is in such grave need " .
Spedan Lewis was the elder of two sons whose father had founded the John Lewis department store in Oxford Street , so by the age of 21 he not only had a quarter share in that but was also on his way to becoming director of Peter Jones , his father 's other shop .
It was at about this time that he came to the realisation that between them , he , his brother and his father were raking in a sum equal to the combined salaries of everyone else who worked for them .
He was determined things should change .
Spedan Lewis swapped his stake in the Oxford Street store for total control over Peter Jones , where he instituted shorter hours , longer holidays , and a dose of democracy .
Within five years , the Sloane Square store had turned an annual loss of £ 8,000 into a profit of £ 20,000 .
Heartened , he added a partial profit - sharing scheme , then , in 1928 , a constitution , and finally the John Lewis Partnership Limited ( he ran the business , but shared the profits ) .
The ultimate step was an irrevocable trust settlement that turned ownership of the partnership – and a responsibility in the running of it – over to the people employed within it .
What does that responsibility mean ?
" We ask not only that you do your day job , but that you play an active role as an owner , " says Patrick Lewis a member of the partnership board and of the family .
" That you engage with your colleagues and work with them in thinking through what will make the business successful .
Our shareholders are n't passive and distant . . . they have lots of opinions . "
Those opinions are voiced through democratic channels .
The chairman and board run the company 's commercial activities , but an 82 - member partnership council elects nearly half the board ( and in theory , can sack the chairman ) .
And the Partnership council itself is largely elected through a network of forums representing every department of every JL branch and Waitrose supermarket .
" It works , " says a chirpy Ashley Davis in menswear at the spectacular marble - and - glass Cardiff store , new last September ( 9,000 applicants for 750 jobs ; queues round the block the day it threw open its doors ) .
" It was branch forum week last week and each department had its say – on local branch issues mainly .
Opening hours , the canteen , that kind of thing . "
For Sallie Beech , also a newbie , " there is a feeling of equality .
You belong to the business , but it belongs to you too . "
A veteran of five years , Kirsty Reilly in womenswear , speaks of the " passion and commitment " that come from " being engaged , because you have a vested interest in making sure it works , for you and for the people you work with . "
In floor - coverings and furnishings , Beth Smith says co-ownership ensures you " make that extra effort .
And because you 're all partners , there 's no backstabbing .
Motivation 's different . "
She also likes working for a company where " the thinking 's long - term .
It 's not about making a quick profit at the expense of bigger values .
The partners ' voices really do carry weight .
It 's not just window - dressing : we decided we did n't want to work on Boxing Day , and we did n't . "
Smith reckons another company would have to double her salary to get her away from John Lewis , " and even then I would n't be happy " .
( I should say at this point that everyone I speak to in the John Lewis Partnership , is astonishingly , almost relentlessly nice .
It 's a word the very nice Cardiff managing director , Liz Mihell , hates : " Ca n't you say decent ? " she says .
" Caring ?
Warm ?
Nice is horrible .
It 's shared values , really . "
Whatever , it 's plainly another factor in the firm 's success : good service can only come from people who like people , who are happy discussing their needs , who want to help .
Half the new Cardiff employees had no retail experience : what counts in recruitment , says Beth , is behaviour .
" You can train anyone to do things , " she says .
" But nobody can teach someone how to be . "
It 's known as having " green blood " . )
In any event , the net result of these rights and responsibilities is employees who think and feel rather differently about their work than most .
That feeling extends to the 30 - odd nationalities represented among the 200 or so partners at Waitrose 's new supermarket in Westfield , the huge upmarket London mall in downmarket Shepherd 's Bush .
Since the complex opened at the end of 2008 , says department manager Ceira Thom , one rival retailer has had to fire 42 staff , mostly for stealing .
Waitrose has sacked one .
" The level of emotion she aroused was astonishing , " Thom says .
" It was like : how dare she ?
That 's my bonus .
This is my company ! "
The point , though , is how this different way of thinking and feeling about work translates .
John Lewis , we 've seen , does more than all right .
Employee - owned companies currently contribute some £ 25 bn to the British economy .
According to an annual index compiled by a leading law firm , they outperform the FTSE by roughly 10 % each year .
Research by the Cass Business School indicates that employee - owned businesses also create jobs faster ; are significantly more resilient in an economic downturn ; deliver far better customer satisfaction ; boast substantially higher value added per employee ; and , depending on the sector and size of the business , can deliver markedly higher profits ( co- owned businesses seem to work best when they 've got fewer than 75 staff and operate in knowledge - or skill - intensive sectors ) .
So why is n't every company organised this way ?
Partly , as Lewis points out , because it 's not easy .
" We 're a commercial organisation , " he says .
" We have to make a ' sufficient profit ' to sustain and develop the business .
That sets the bar quite high for the commercial success we need .
On top of that , we distribute a share of the profits in the form of a bonus , and also in other ways , that will benefit our members collectively . "
( The constitution says a share of profits must be spent " undertaking other activities consistent with its ultimate purpose " – which is , remember , " the happiness of all its members " . )
What constitutes " sufficient profit " is , obviously , a tricky one .
The total amount the partnership redistributes to members , in bonuses and all those benefits , is more than a regular PLC might pay out in dividends , Lewis reckons .
But what 's best for individuals is n't always best for the business , and achieving a good balance is both hard work and a source of discord between executives and partners ( opening hours and pensions are two notable recurring headaches ) .
" Running a business this way is n't an easy option , " says Lewis .
" In many ways it 's simpler to have one boss who just says : right , we 're doing this . "
But mainly , as Will Davies of the Demos thinktank points out in Reinventing the Firm , the received wisdom for years now has been that shareholder value – " the belief that a company 's primary purpose is to maximise its value for the benefit of external shareholders " – is the only way to judge a business .
In fact , as Davies says , a company is about far more than the price of its shares .
It 's about " people , relationships , knowledge , reputation , all of which have enormous impact on long - term value .
Firms are social and political , not just economic and financial . "
That 's not , though , the way many people see things – at least until the recent banking crisis showed just how bad the shareholder value model was " as a mechanism for accountability , and for creating value " .
Post - crisis , and in the run-up to a general election , politicians from all parties have made much of the " John Lewis Model " being transferable to public services : giving local providers ownership of their own ( public or private ) budgets , and of the services they deliver .
In theory , public services are fertile terrain for co-ownership , a great way to harness the strong vocational commitment in the sector .
In practice , reckons Nigel Mason , policy director of the Employee Ownership Association , " it raises a multitude of questions about how it could really be made to work " .
Politicians like the sound of employee ownership , Mason says , because despite increased expenditure , public service productivity continues to fall , " and they really need to increase engagement , motivation and innovation , and provide a better service to the user " .
Westminster also likes the notion that with public service spending cuts inevitable , " co-ownership would be a nice sweetener " .
Employee ownership , though , is " not a panacea .
It wo n't work if the conditions are such that any independent business would fail .
It needs careful thought and planning about ownership and governance structures , and the precise terms of contracts .
It can certainly work in some sectors – small - scale community care provision , for example .
Big , complex enterprises running on fine margins may be more problematic . "
Of course , as Patrick Lewis notes , John Lewis has had 80 years to get its " virtuous circle " working : look after the partners and the partners look after the customers , who look after the profit .
" It 's a culture and a way of working , " he says .
" You can't do it overnight , and it wo n't be right for everyone .

Overview
( to be completed ... )
The pump
I initially built the pump out of CPVC .
With the correct o-rings and some duct tape I managed to make it work with a wooden stick .
Unfortunately , even if the pump shaft was more than one feet long , it only had a volume between 30 mL and 40 mL , which is n't much for a homemade .
At least it was on par with regular CPS Super Soakers .
I bought two O - rings of different sizes that I thought they would fit the best ( having a piece of CPVC at the store to compare ) and fortunately one of the two rings was the right size to use .
Actually , I do n't remember the size ...
^ The handle came from a fake CPS 1000 ; at least cheap copies can be useful for something .
^ The O -rings were pretty thin so I used two for the best seal possible .
The duct tape improved stability and acted as a stopper .
The orange handle snapped off so I built a tracked , properly positioned handle as a replacement .
The original handle was a little bit too far from the grip , resulting in an unbalanced feel when combining pumping and shooting .
I 'm not worried anymore about the pump volume .
Even if it is only about 40 mL , pumping is easy and smooth , allowing me to pump it faster without too much force .
Any change to the gun 's pump diameter would have forced me to change the trigger as well anyway , so I decided to keep it like it is .
The bladder
The balloons are attached just like LRT :
Mid-way update
Well , here is what it looks like so far :
Using test bladders such as balloons and even a Hydro Blitz bladder , I was been able to improve the pump and the trigger a lot .
The trigger actuates the ball valve perfectly now .
Yep , the wire travels trough the ABS , I 've drilled holes in the casing for that purpose .
I 've took several pictures of the building process of the trigger so I should detail its construction soon .
Final update
The result was pretty much what I expected .
Major changes :
The trigger is now pulled by all four fingers , as the previous hook type trigger was too hard to pull with only one finger
Most of the gun is now painted black
The pump handle is now vertical instead of horizontal
Note that all grips are improved with bike tubing
The ball valve and its mechanism has now its own casing held by the laminator ( ABS test cap over a 4 " PVC sleeve )
The ABS pipe I 'm using is labeled Schedule 40 but has no sign of pressure rating .
The reason why I choose ABS pipe is because where I buy my parts large PVC is not available in short lengths .
I 've just added a strap to the gun so that it is easier to use .
These are the parts that can be detached from the current design .
The magic between the reservoir and the pressure chamber is just a 3 " PVC endcap surrounded by a one inch long part cut out of a 3 " ABS coupler .
The PVC endcap fits perfectly within the ABS coupler piece , and the coupler piece fits perfectly within the 4 " drain pipe as well .
So I just had to epoxy / cement everything inside and that 's it , the reservoir is separated from the PC .
( I apologize for not having a picture of this as I 'm too lazy to disassemble it again . )
Here are some stats :
Length : Between 22 " and 32 " ( depending on what nozzle and reservoir is used )
Weight when empty : 7 pounds
Weight when full : heavy !
( it needs a shoulder strap )
Pressure chamber type : Spherical ( 75 9 " helium quality balloons )
PC capacity : 1200 mL
Reservoir Type : Onboard ( can be detached and replaced by a backpack )
Reservoir capacity : 3600 mL
Shots per tank : 3
Pumps to pressurize : 33
Shot pictures
( no pictures of the standard nozzle yet )
Nozzle laminator + endcap drilled to 7/32 " :
Maximum range : 41 ft
Shot time : 4 sec
Output : 350 mL/sec
Nozzle laminator + endcap drilled to 3/8 " :
Maximum range : 50 ft
Shot time : 2 sec
Output : 850 mL/sec
This one is on par with my CPS 2000 , but has more shot time .
Nozzle laminator without endcap :
Maximum range : 27 ft
Shot time : 1.3 sec
Output : 950 mL/sec
This one is n't very practical as the water has trouble getting very far , but a concentrated stream that thick is always heavy - hitting and fun to watch .
Riot blast :
Maximum range : 45 ft
Shot time : 1 sec
Output : 1200 mL/sec
The riot blast is amazing .
Actually it is the best riot blast I 've used yet , as its effective range get past 40 feet .
It has also the most kickback .
In the end , this gun is great , but its weight can be annoying .
Especially when compared to my CPS 2000 .
My homemade has some more power , capacity and versatility , but weights a lot more .
All its drawbacks make me want to build another one .
Air pressure this time .
A 3D concept is on the way .

Forty - one Iraqis were killed in bombings today in the city of Karbala as Shia pilgrims gathered for the last day of a religious festival in the holy city .
The mode of the attack is still unclear .
Some reports indicate that two car bombs were detonated outside one of three entrances to the city , but the governor of Karbala province claimed that a mortar struck a crowd of Iraqis outside the city .
“ A mortar round was launched from fields northeast of the city , ” Governor Amalheddin al Hir told AFP .
“ I accuse al Qaeda who are being supported by the Baath party . ”
Another 144 Iraqis were wounded in the blasts , including 60 women and four children , according to Voices of Iraq .
Today ’s strike is the fourth major terrorist attack in Iraq this week and the seventh since Jan. 25 .
Three of the bombings have occurred in Baghdad , and four in Karbala .
The last four attacks have targeted Shia pilgrims traveling to Karbala .
The attacks have taken place since US and Iraqi security forces killed al Qaeda ’s top suicide bomber facilitator in Iraq during a raid in Mosul on Jan. 22 .
Abu Khalaf , who managed al Qaeda ’s facilitation network from Syria , entered Iraq sometime last fall to direct al Qaeda ’s suicide bombing campaign .
Al Qaeda has targeted Shia religious processions in Iraq over the past three years in an effort to reignite sectarian tensions that nearly led to a civil war in 2006 and 2007 .
The Iraqi government and the US military have said that the face of al Qaeda in Iraq has changed as the group has incorporated more Iraqis into its leadership ranks .
Major attacks in Baghdad and Karbala since Jan. 25 , 2010 :
Feb .
5 , 2010 : Thirty - one Iraqi pilgrims were killed in bombings in Karbala .
Feb . 3 , 2010 : Twenty - three Iraqi pilgrims were killed in a bombing in Karbala .
Feb. 2 , 2010 : A suicide bomber killed six Iraqis in an attack east of Karbala .
Feb . 1 , 2010 : A female suicide bomber killed 54 Shia pilgrims in Baghdad .
Jan. 26 , 2010 : A suicide bomber killed 18 Iraqis in an attack on a police forensics lab in Baghdad .
Jan. 25 , 2010 : Thirty - six Iraqis were killed in three suicide attacks that targeted hotels in Baghdad .

The walls of the largest underwater volcano in Europe could collapse , releasing thousands of tons of magma , which would trigger a tsunami that would likely inundate southern Italy , experts at the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology told CNN .
The Marsili volcano , which has an active magma chamber , also has areas losing magnetism and a large amount of weak and permeable rocks supporting it , which researchers said means that the walls could essentially crumble at any time with the right seismic activity .
And if that happens – the result could be catastrophic .
“ Collapses of large portions of submarine volcanic rocks represent a major risk for tsunami generation producing some of the most destructive events , ” according to an article co-written by Cosmo Carmisciano , who works with the he National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology ( INGV ) .
Researchers have discovered that portions of the Marsili volcano have already collapsed - and history has shown that the Tyrrhenian Sea , where Marsili is located , has a past evidence of tsunamis .
“ Similar large collapses may well take place in the future of Marsali , ” Carmisciano said .
When it happens is anyone ’s guess – the Marsili volcano has n’t erupted since researchers began watching it .
But below the surface , researchers say the Marsili is definitely active and an eruption could come at anytime .
If a tsunami was triggered , it could impact the areas of Sicily and Sardinia , researchers said .
“ It could even happen tomorrow , " Enzo Bosch Boschi , president INGV told Italy ’s Corriere della Sera .
" A rupture of the walls would let loose millions of cubic meters of material capable of generating a very powerful wave . "
Black robe disease ( also known as black robe syndrome ) is a condition which is not widely known to the general public , but which every trial lawyer in the country could describe in great detail if they were not too afraid to speak out against judges suffering from it .
It afflicts those lawyers who have reached the pinnacle of professional status by achieving the position of judge , infecting all levels of the American judicial system .
Black robe disease is characterized by exhibiting three or more ( though frequently all ) of the following symptoms :
Inflated ego and an excessive sense of self - importance
Lack of empathy
Sudden outbursts of rage ( whether genuine or exhibited for show )
Refusal to effectively manage scheduling issues
Belief in a double standard when it comes to the judge ’s own conduct
Lack of patience with inexperienced lawyers
Hostility towards lawyers more knowledgeable than the judge
Inability to work efficiently
A compulsion to waste the time of others
Imperious attitude
The belief that his or her words are dogma
An obsessive desire to be kissed on the ass
Most lawyers who become judges are able to stave off the symptoms of this illness from somewhere between 6 to 18 months , depending on their prior moral character and their experience as a litigator .
However , studies indicate approximately 96.2 % of all judges ultimately succumb to this disease ( according to a random double - blind study fabricated for this article ) .
The small percentage who are able to avoid black robe syndrome do so only by a strict regimen of prayer , meditation , and vodka .
What can be done about black robe disease ?
Unfortunately , there is no known cure .
Removing one judge from office requires putting another one in his place who will likely fall victim to the same condition , so that method of treatment has been found ineffective .
Due to the absurd level of power granted to judges by our judicial system ( created , conveniently enough , by judges ) , there is little that can be done other than raise public awareness of the issue .
Raising public awareness does absolutely nothing to solve the problem , but at least people may be more understanding when they see a lawyer walking out of a courthouse shouting obscenities and making a beeline to the nearest bar .
Do you have a favorite story about a judge afflicted with black robe disease ?
If so , please post it in the Comments section at the bottom of this article .
If you can include a link to your story , that will be even better .

Recovery ' roadmap ' would see large herds roaming free over thousands of hectares but hinges on an overhaul of government regulations and a rethink of public attitudes to the animal
This article is more than 10 years old

Bison , the iconic animal of the American west , could once more roam wild across the great plains under a recovery roadmap prepared by international scientists .
A report by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) ( pdf ) , prepared by dozens of scientists and bison experts from Mexico , America , and Canada , says there is a chance of a second recovery , nearly a century after the animals were rescued from the brink of extinction .
But success depends on allowing large herds to roam free over thousands or perhaps millions of hectares , an overhaul of government regulations , and a rethink of public attitudes to the animal .
Currently , there is only one population of plains bison , in Yellowstone national park .
" The next 10 - 20 years present opportunities for conserving American bison as a wild species and restoring it as an important ecological presence in many North American ecosystems , " the study says .
It says the animals are critical to the restoration of the prairie grasslands .
But Americans , especially ranchers in the west who view the animals as competition for grazing lands or a potential source of disease in their cattle , need to accept its presence on the plains .
" The greatest challenge is to overcome the common perception that the bison , which has had a profound influence on the human history of North America , socially , culturally and ecologically , no longer belongs on the landscape , " the study says .
Tens of millions of bison once grazed the rolling hills and prairies of North America , from Alaska to northern Mexico .
But by the beginning of the 20th century , the great herds had almost completely wiped out by hunters trying to satisfy the European fur trade .
Early efforts managed to save the bison from the brink of extinction , and about 31,000 now roam free .
But conservationists say more needs to be done to protect the genetic diversity of such herds to assure their long - term survival .
Aside from harsh winters , bison in the wild face a range of diseases from anthrax to BSE , or mad cow disease .
The study says the new conservation strategy should aim to recreate the traditional range of the bison .
" While substantial progress in saving bison from extinction was made in the 20th century , much work remains to restore conservation herds throughout their vast geographical range , " said Cormack Gates , a University of Calgary conservationist who co-edited the study .
Several states continue to view bison as livestock rather than wild animals and about 400,000 bison are being raised in commercial herds .
Some 55,000 of those belong to Ted Turner , the media magnate and CNN founder , who has ranches in seven states .
" The key is recognition that the bison is a wildlife species and to be conserved as wildlife , it needs land and supportive government policies , " Gates said .
But persuading the public the bison should be free and not food may not be easy .
In 2002 , Turner 's ranches were so successful in raising bison that he opened up a chain of bison burger restaurants that now stretches from Montana to Florida .
… At least according to YouTube ’s new transcription service .
On it ’s own , this is a fine interview with Steven Moffat , the new show runner for Doctor Who .
The BBC will be starting a new season with a new Doctor in a couple of weeks and yadda , yadda because everybody knows THAT already .
But if you go to the YouTube page proper , click the little “ CC ” button at the bottom of the frame and activate the “ Transcribe Audio ” feature , you will find yourself privy to a whole mess of previously unknown info about the Timelord ’s upcoming travels .
It ’s amazing the stuff this software can dig up .
YouTube should just take the Transcribe function out of Beta right now and inflict it upon the unsuspecting world !
I ’ve got the whole transcript after the break , but here are a few of my favorite quotes .
As the transcript warns us , please be advised that this report does contain some touched the phone .
Matt Smith talks to a reporter about his new responsibilities : Reporter :
That , of course , means that the new man in the Taiwanese men ’s expectations are high and that he ’s got some pretty big shoes to fill in the series goes on there .
So how does he feel about falling on from someone like and the tenants ?
So it ’s apparently a new day at the BBC .
They ’re considering the world market and the expectations of Taiwanese men .
Moffat : I think that one of the things we have n’t seen that the on that my home of many months , but it ’s at the Yale way when dust storms and absolutely nothing was a really really exciting .
This year , the program will be influenced by Ivy League colleges and will be dull as dirt .
A challenging approach !
And there ’s this telling nugget about Matt Smith ’s unusual performance as the Doctor :
Moffat :
Well , I was n’t was not going to be like ?
Gorgeous .
That ’s the .
I ’ve seen so many at this is not on the matter what you want but I right now am not a commodity that needs to be amazing .
What ’s he like ?
These are some of the evidence shall know ID is that is the best way to describe not .
Use that he ’s both clumsy and garlic and at the same time .
And we maintain a gripping story lines ?
Just you wait and see !
And dying to get back down to that dumb things we could I ’ve just seen , but the dollar is up to them I ’m worried !
Female Anchor :
On toward substance police , can you give us about what max make these gangs the night , and how do you maintain add that is the current King story lines in the wake of a fifty day that ?
You would n’t have expected the Dow Jones to have much impact on a new series of Doctor Who , but you ’d be wrong , apparently .
Moffat is worried about the dollar and does n’t consider himself to be an amazing commodity .
Anyway , there ’s lots of gems like this buried in the transcript below .
This is a direct copy of YouTube ’s automatic transcription of the BBC clip .
I took a little liberty with the punctuation and capitalization , but otherwise , I kept it intact .
Enjoy !
Female Anchor :
And more excitement now , the EU with serious doubts it is starring , that Smith had its wealth friend and confidant last night .
Male Anchor :
His , I think that ’s one reason is in the wind , do n’t see how the youngest and adults in his companion they getting along .
His report does contain some touched the phone .*
Reporter : Yeah , Mexican counted and I think little , with a fist , he says will be shown to dozens of journalists .
No question , you know , but soon the comedians will be sitting down to make that mind up about the new bill .
Reporter ( interviewing Matt Smith ) :
That , of course , means that the new man in the Taiwanese men ’s expectations are high and that he ’s got some pretty big shoes to fill in the series goes on there .

Matt Smith :
That is very prudent thing .

From kind of very good morning , Steve .
When I must admit that I had recommended last night saying the trendy act , and how did you feel and the audience that fair is stated that I can’t ?
Steven Moffat : I ’ve they seem to know that .
I think that one of the things we have n’t seen that the on that my home of many months , but it ’s at the yale way when dust storms and absolutely nothing was a really really exciting .

The economy is vital to the reason , you must know this , is it kind of the fall although to is unveiled the needle to .
You know what I stand for people so that night , only companies that is lost when it would be in a , in my view , would be that .
And then when you help anyone on , I was just thinking that what , in this brief cuts , I was thinking if he is actually write again .
Did you get that the , you know what I ’m talking about ?
Steven Moffat :
The hostility , and the one you should be worried when they got to change .
In addition to these are problems that and easy for you , because this is what does that mean .
That the back and go through the you know .
The fact that he becomes a stranger than half a million , nothing has been no movement , yet I think really on the stand reviewing all my did n’t come out .

Of the 439 astronauts that entered space up to the end of November 2004 , 11 have died in training incidents and 18 have died in in - flight accidents .
Of those 18 , only the crew of Soyuz 11 in 1971 actually died in space .
The USA sets the space - boundary at 50 miles high while the FAI defines space as starting at a height of 100 km .
Challenger 's last flight in 1986 never reached this height .
Columbia broke apart on re-entry .
The crew of Soyuz 11 , Georgi Dobrovolski , Viktor Patsayev and Vladislav Volkov , were killed after undocking from space station Salyut 1 after a three - week stay .
A valve on their spacecraft had accidentally opened when the service module separated , which was only discovered when the module was opened by the recovery team .
Technically the only fatalities in space ( above 100 km ) .
Here ’s my take on a recent story of apparent plagiarism at the New York Times .
Some are probably conjuring up memories of Jayson Blair .
However , I see something different , namely a battle regarding the credibility of independent financial blogs like mine as a news source .
The fact is most American newspapers and television stations are owned by media empires that depend , not on subscribers , but upon big business and advertising for revenue .
This creates a certain conflict of interest for them .
I believe the natural inclination for American media therefore is cognitive capture by the business , government and financial elites that injects a bias into their reporting .
This apparent bias was on full display in the run-up to the War in Iraq as outlets like the New York Times were used by the Bush Administration as tools for propaganda .
During that time , media watchers in America learned to use the British media in particular to get a more balanced view of the goings on in Iraq .
This was a boon for the likes of the Guardian , the BBC and the Times of London and a net loss for the Washington Post and the New York Times as credible news sources .
This was also the genesis of the netroots and the political blogosphere as a credible alternative news source .
I should also point out that the Washington Post was caught red - handed in a dubious pay - for - play - type deal involving healthcare lobbyists and access to government officials in the run-up to votes on the Health Care overhaul proposed by the Obama Administration .
See WaPo cancels paid White House - Congress - lobbyist hook up from last July .
This particular story is emblematic of the media - lobbyist - government official - business leader nexus which thrives due to the mainstream media ’s need for ‘ access ’ to both government officials and business leaders in order to produce their product .
Looking at the recent subprime meltdown and subsequent credit crisis , I see the financial blogosphere as playing the same role in this crisis that the netroots played during the Bush Administration ’s prosecution of the War on Terror , namely as a credible alternative source of news when the mainstream media was largely silent on the housing bubble ( again in my opinion , because of the cognitive capture that is part and parcel of the access upon which the MSM ’s product depends ) .
So , this was the background for me when I heard of the allegations of the New York Times ripping off the Implode - O - Meter sites ’ content .
Yes , there is the Jayson Blair precedent at the Times , but I see this as incident as more a case of the New York Times seeing the independent financial blogosphere as a threat and actively diminishing the credibility of the blogosphere as a credible news source .
That more than anything is what led to the Times lack of attribution .
I have written about the Implode - O - Meter sites in the past .
See Government coercion in the financial blogosphere for how the American courts are used in this ‘ business - friendly ’ atmosphere of American jurisprudence to intimidate journalism not affiliated with big business , as most of the mainstream media ( MSM ) now is .
However , now the Implode - O - Meter sites and another independent blog , Dealbreaker , appear to be the victims in a case of plagiarism .
Here is the unfolding story as reported in the Connecticut Post :
The business media was shocked to see the New York Times issue a quasi apology to the Wall Street Journal yesterday over one of its Dealbook reporters , Zach Kouwe , copying story lines and not sourcing original reporting to other news publications .
There was also mention that ‘ other publications ’ had fallen victim to story lifts by Kouwe and a note that the New York Times was investigating the situation .
The New York Observer printed a copy of the letter from the WSJ editors to the NYT editors detailing the specific infractions …
On Dec. 26 , 2008 , an online publication covering the housing market , Mortgage Implode - O - Meter , published an exclusive news report that a group of financial services firms , led by Steven Mnuchin of Dune Capital , would be buying failed IndyMac Bank from the FDIC .
IndyMac was one of the first large thrift banks to be seized by the FDIC at the start of the financial crisis .
A day later , Kouwe reported for the NYT ’s Dealbook that Dune Capital was expected to buy IndyMac and added two other names of buyers , JC Flowers and John Paulson , to the story .
Kouwe ’s report did not credit Mortgage Implode - O - Meter for first breaking the fact that 1 ) a private equity group was buying IndyMac 2 ) Dune Capital was involved .
Wire services picked up the NYT ’s story and the rest of the business press ended up sourcing Kouwe for breaking the news on the sale of IndyMac to a private equity group .
Aaron Krowne , founder of the implode - o - meter sites , noted that an NYT follow could have added significant viewership to his niche business publication , and said that when the NY Times had followed previous exclusive news stories traffic increased to 300,000 viewers …
Kouwe also wrote :
For instance Dealbreaker and other blogs report on a lot of stories , but I do n’t think anybody has ever cited them as being first with a particular scoop .
I ’ve had it happen to me a bunch of times at The Post and it really did n’t bother me because most readers just do n’t care .
They do n’t read bylines and they do n’t care about whether one paper cited a website or another paper in their stories .
A few weeks later on January 12th , 2008 Dealbook followed a news report that had previously been reported first by online Wall Street publication Dealbreaker , but did not credit Dealbreaker for reporting the story or the memo first .
The story centered on an internal memo talking about Citibank ’s Smith Barney being merged with Morgan Stanley .
According to people familiar with the situation , Dealbook was claiming the memo came from their sources , but after being presented with proof of the plagiarism , Dealbook backtracked and admitted the original report should be credited to Dealbreaker …
I guarantee you that Kouwe would have attributed anything he saw in the Wall Street Journal or the Financial Times .
These are credible and well recognized news sources – with some very good blogs of their own I might add .
However , Kouwe thought he could get away with copying news from Dealbreaker and Implode - O - Meter because they were just independent blogs – and hence not credible sources .
His comment in the section above says as much .
The source does n’t matter : LA Times or National Inquirer .
It is plagiarism any way you look at it – and now he has been caught .
How long did New York Times editors know of Kouwe ’s story copying ?

We 've been waiting for months to see what 's in the DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility but the Obama administration 's point - blank refusal to investigate , let alone prosecute , the war crimes of its predecessors has stalled it for more than a year .
We are now told by Newsweek that the establishment - surprise !
- will let itself off :
While the probe is sharply critical of the legal reasoning used to justify waterboarding and other “ enhanced ” interrogation techniques , NEWSWEEK has learned that a senior Justice official who did the final review of the report softened an earlier OPR finding .
Previously , the report concluded that two key authorsJay Bybee , now a federal appellate court judge , and John Yoo , now a law professorviolated their professional obligations as lawyers when they crafted a crucial 2002 memo approving the use of harsh tactics , say two Justice sources who asked for anonymity discussing an internal matter .
But the reviewer , career veteran David Margolis , downgraded that assessment to say they showed “ poor judgment , ” say the sources .
( Under department rules , poor judgment does not constitute professional misconduct . )
The shift is significant : the original finding would have triggered a referral to state bar associations for potential disciplinary actionwhich , in Bybee ’s case , could have led to an impeachment inquiry .
Just as the CIA will never allow its staffers to be held accountable for anything ; just as the DHS and the intelligence services would never hold anyone in their ranks accountable for the undie - bomber plot ; so the DOJ will never allow its past members be held accountable even for war crimes .
Some wonder why the public distrusts Washington .
But over the last few years , the rank stench coming from its self - serving elites should be enough to disturb anyone with a sense of smell .

NBC and representatives of the network ’s disaffected “ Tonight Show ” host , Conan O’Brien , have continued negotiations to settle his contract , but no outcome was expected Friday , according to one participant in the talks .
A meeting was scheduled between the two sides for Saturday morning , another executive with knowledge of the talks said on Friday evening .
The executive , who like the participant in the negotiations spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal was not final , said a settlement was getting close , with many of the basic details agreed upon .
Mr. O’Brien , who had a guaranteed contract for another two and a half years at a salary that has been reported to be $ 10 million to $ 20 million a year , is expected to get a settlement that will pay him more than $ 30 million .
In addition , under the terms now on the table , he would win the right to start a new show at some other network , probably as early as September .
In the wake of a growing child abuse scandal in the Roman Catholic church , and last October 's historic rally outside the Vatican to remember the victims of church crimes , members of The Friends and Relatives of the Disappeared ( FRD ) will return to Europe next week to help convene an international Tribunal into crimes against humanity in which Pope Joseph Ratzinger is personally implicated .
Rev. Kevin Annett , who has spear headed a movement to bring to justice the churches that caused the death of thousands of aboriginal children in Christian residential schools in Canada , will lead a delegation of the FRD to Italy on March 29 that will include Cree nation elder Lillian Shirt and Ojibway nation elder Charles Cook , both of whom survived incarceration and torture in Catholic residential schools .
The FRD delegation will make a formal presentation to a human rights committee of the Italian parliament and will seek its endorsement for an international inquiry into the death of more than 50,000 children in the predominantly Catholic - run Indian residential school system in Canada .
The delegation will also conduct a sacred ceremony and memorial service for all victims of the Roman Catholic church outside the Vatican in St. Peter 's Square on Easter Sunday , April 4 , at 11 am
After speaking to audiences in a half dozen Italian cities between March 29 and April 8 , the FRD delegation will travel to England and Ireland to unite with other survivors of Catholic church abuse , and hold public protests and rallies at government and church facilities in both countries .
In England , the delegation will hold memorial rallies outside Westminster ( Catholic ) Cathedral and Westminster ( Anglican ) Abbey on Sunday , April 11 between 10 AM and 12 noon , to remember children who died in residential schools run by these two churches .
That same evening , Rev. Annett will speak at a public meeting at 7 pm at Passing Clouds Centre in Dalston , London , 1 Richmond Road , E 8 , concerning the genocide of native people in Canada , and the complicity of the Queen of England in this crime .
On Monday , April 12 at 12 noon , Annett and the delegation will hold a protest rally and press conference outside the Canadian Embassy , Canada House , at 5 Trafalgar Square , to indict the government and churches of Canada with charges of crimes against humanity .
In Ireland , on Thursday , April 15 , Rev. Annett and the delegation will unite with survivors of Catholic Church abuse at a protest rally outside the Irish Dail ( Parliament ) in downtown Dublin at 12 noon .
The next day , on Friday , April 16 , Rev. Annett will speak at a public meeting at the Happy Pear in Greystones , Co. Wicklow at 7.30 pm .

Kenneth Cole ’s Awearness Blog .
The video also has it ’s own homepage , with a counter reading over 325,000 hits .
They accept donations and sell T - shirts “ to deal with a ridiculous bandwidth bill . ”
Now , obviously , I would never even think of presuming to dispute the details contained in what is now our nation ’s definitive account of the credit crisis .
But I do have a few little comments .
Keyed to the video timer :
1:19 : The Fed does buy and sell Treasuries to control the money supply , but the outfit that investors usually buy them from is called the US Treasury , hence the name .
And Treasury Bills , which are what yielded 1 % , were never a way for investors to make more money .
They are what is colloquially called “ cash . ” Gotta love the King Alan graphic .
2:05 : That brief period of 1 % interest rates ( it lasted a year from June ‘ 03 to June ‘ 04 ) certainly made leverage cheaper and made a lot of otherwise marginal deals profitable , but it has not been demonstrated that it caused a quantum leap in the risk taken by Wall Street .
Leverage is not “ a major way banks make their money ” it is , in fact , the very essence and definition of banking .
All banks have always been leveraged ; it ’s what they do for a living .
That said , the 100 - 1 leverage ratio given as an example is extreme and unlikely .
3:43 : This strongly implies that mortgage bonds , and the slicing up of pools of mortgages into CDOs , was dreamed up around 2004 .
On the contrary , the bankers who dreamed this up are long retired now .
It became standard practice in the 1980s , as described in Michael Lewis ’s entertaining first book Liar ’s Poker .
5:03 : This is a brilliant graphical representation of how a CDO works , but three slices , or tranches , is fewer than typical .
Some pools had as many as ten .
Moreover , as good as the graphic is , the viewer is left wondering why it is important , other than as a demonstration of how those wacky bankers make everything too complicated .
There are two nasty side - effects of packaging mortgages into CDOs that are causing problems today .
The first is that there is no simple answer to the question “ who owns this mortgage ? ”
A homeowner who needs to renegotiate terms has nobody with whom to talk .
The other problem is that the mortgage market is very fragmented .
There are tens of thousands of mortgage bonds out there , and because each is a particular claim on a particular pool of mortgages , no two are exactly alike .
This is a huge problem if , like many Wall Street banks recently , you need to sell a lot of bonds in a hurry .
7:23 : As much as I love the sub - prime family graphic , it ’s not a fair representation .
As the housing bubble inflated , the FICO scores of sub - prime borrowers actually improved substantially .
At the peak , the sub - prime borrowers were not irresponsible smokers with four kids , they were relatively trustworthy types who were merely buying more house than they could afford .
8:57 : Blaming the bursting of the housing bubble on the mortgage crisis is pretty obviously putting the cart before the horse .
There are some nasty vicious cycle effects , but the fuse was lit in the summer of 2006 when house prices started to soften .
It took a year for stress in the mortgage market to appear and two years for everything to go boom .
10:18 : This gives the impression that what sank the Wall Street banks was that they got stuck with inventory in process when the system halted .
That did happen , but it was not their role as manufacturer of mortgage bonds that did them in , so much as their roles as mortgage bond investors and insurers that spelled the end .
Other than that , it really is a very clever video .

Did you know ???
Every time you lick a stamp , you are consuming 1/10 of a calorie .
— Paula Abdul ( @PaulaAbdul ) February 5 , 2010
As the resident celeb fact checker , I went to work trying to figure out the source of this spurious - sounding philatelic claim .
In an attempt to find the science to back it up , I went through a Snopes message board and an old ' oddly enough - style ' query in The Guardian ; I consulted the Q&A at the Just for Kids section of the American Philatelic Society and was thumbing through Wikipedia trying unsuccessfully to find a legitimate confirmation of 1/10 calorie , when it hit me .
Who licks stamps anymore ?
Stamps issued by the USPS have been self - adhesive since 2002 .
Then I thought , " And when do you think Paula Abdul last consumed a factually unproven number of calories by licking a stamp ? "
It was in that moment that Paula Abdul Fact Check was born .
usa44.jpg
I 'm going to guess that she has assistants that take care of her personal errands .
Pay the bills .
Answer fan mail .
I suppose she should ask one of them when is the last time they used a stamp .
Then ask when 's the last time they licked a stamp .
See what I 'm getting at here ?
In fact , if you navigate through the USPS site , and click through the five pages of current 44 - cent first class stamps , there is currently only one " water - activated " option available .
( See right . )
So , it is not impossible , but merely unlikely that you have even encountered a stamp in the last decade that required a licking .
A caveat :
If you 'd like to order the water - activated version of the U.S.
Flag definitive stamp , you must order it in bulk -- a coil of 3,000 stamps , which retails for the low - low price of $ 1,320 ( and is intended for vending and affixing machines ) .
If you licked the whole thing , that 's 300 calories right there -- and a pretty expensive meal that would very likely be your last .
I 'm still a little stumped about the cause for alarm that overtook Ms. Abdul on Friday -- a call that was retweeted by a hundred other panic - stricken folks .
Today , I did the only thing there was left to do :

This petition was launched by a group of concerned activists who are deeply disturbed to see the militarization of what should be an urgent emergency and humanitarian relief effort in the wake of Haiti's 12 January earthquake .
To see the full text , please click on the word " Letter " seen below and to the right .
Haiti needs emergency relief , not military intervention !
21 January 2010
We , the undersigned , are outraged by the scandalous delays in distributing essential aid to victims of the earthquake in Haiti .
Since the US Air Force seized unilateral control of the airport in Port - au - Prince , it has privileged military over civilian humanitarian flights .
As a result , untold numbers of people have died needlessly in the rubble of Port - au - Prince , Leogane and other abandoned towns .
If aid continues to be withheld , many more preventable deaths will follow .
We demand that US commanders immediately restore executive control of the relief effort to Haiti 's leaders , and to help rather than replace the local officials they claim to support .
We note that obsessive foreign concerns with ' security ' and ' looting ' are largely refuted by actual levels of patience and solidarity on the streets of Port - au - Prince .
The decision to avoid what US commanders have called " another Somalia - type situation " by prioritizing security and military control is likely to succeed only in provoking the very kinds of unrest they condemn .
In keeping with a longstanding pattern , US and UN officials continue to treat the Haitian people and their representatives with wholly misplaced fear and suspicion .
We call on the de facto rulers of Haiti to facilitate , as the reconstruction begins , the renewal of popular participation in the determination of collective priorities and decisions .
We demand that they do everything possible to strengthen the capacity of the Haitian people to respond to this crisis .
We demand , consequently , that they allow Haiti 's most popular and most inspiring political leader , Jean - Bertrand Aristide ( whose party won 90 % of the parliamentary seats in the country 's last round of democratic elections ) , to return immediately and safely from the unconstitutional exile to which he has been confined since the US , Canada and France helped depose him in 2004 .
If reconstruction proceeds under the supervision of foreign troops and international development agencies it will not serve the interests of the vast majority of Haiti 's population .
Neoliberal forms of international " aid " have already directly contributed to the systematic impoverishment of Haiti 's people and the undermining of their government , and in both 1991 and 2004 the US intervened to overthrow the elected government and attack its supporters , with devastating effects .
This is why we urgently call on the countries that dominate Haiti and the region to respect Haitian sovereignty and to initiate an immediate reorientation of international aid , away from neo-liberal adjustment , sweatshop exploitation and non-governmental charity , and towards systematic investment in Haiti 's own people and government .
We demand a much greater international role for Haiti 's genuine allies and supporters , including Cuba , South Africa , Venezuela , the Bahamas and other members of CARICOM .
We demand that all reconstruction aid take the form of grants not loans .
We demand that Haiti 's remaining foreign debt be immediately forgiven , and that the money that foreign governments still owe to Haiti - notably the massive sums extorted by the French government from 1825 through to 1947 as compensation for the slaves and property France lost when Haiti won its independence - be paid in full and at once .
Above all , we demand that the reconstruction of Haiti be pursued under the guidance of one overarching objective : the political and economic empowerment of the Haitian people .

Exorcism is no fantasy according to the church , with the Sydney archdiocese last month appointing an as - yet unnamed priest , suitably '' endowed with piety , knowledge , prudence and integrity of life '' to conduct exorcisms , as required by Catholic canon law .
In Rome , the Vatican is preparing its first official English translation of the rite of exorcism , which was promulgated in 1614 and reissued in 1999 .
Its chief exorcist , Father Gabriele Amorth , claimed this month to have carried out 70,000 exorcisms .
Bishop Porteous - who has stood in as exorcist for the Sydney archdiocese over the past five years - warns that yoga , reiki massages and tai chi can lead to people being in the grip of '' demonic forces ' ' .
' 'A person can move from the use of a simple practice to de-stress to embracing the underlining theory and religious beliefs because these all come out of religious traditions of the East and people can then find themselves in the grip of demonic forces , '' he said .
'' People can be naive in that regard . ''
But David Tacey , associate professor of English at La Trobe University , said demonic possession was an archaism long discredited by science , psychology and modern theology .
Any suggestion that reiki massage , yoga and tai chi could have evil influence were '' expressions of Western ignorance about Eastern practices ' ' , he said .
'' This is an example of how certain voices in the church have no idea about other cultures and religions , '' Professor Tacey said .

If you have anchor tags with href attributes external to your own website , you have no log of when those links are clicked .
Example :
< a href= " http://external.site.example.com/ " >
Click to go to " external.site.example.com " </ a >
It has become very common for people to use the JavaScript onclick event and ajax to report back to the server when a click has happened , but this is no good if the user does n’t have JavaScript enabled , or if the HTML is on an external site such as an RSS aggregator .
For those cases , it has become common to change the href to link back to a script on your own site which performs a HTTP redirect .
Example :
< a href= " http://my.site.example.com/redirect.cgi?url=http://external.site.example.com/ " >
Click to go to " external.site.example.com " </ a >
If you just allow any old “ url ” parameter to your redirect script , this is what is called an “ Open Redirect . ”
Open redirects have been abused heavily by scammers and spammers and should not exist .
One option is to maintain a whitelist of URLs that are allowed to be redirected to .
This is cumbersome to maintain .
Another option is to add an additional parameter which authenticates the URL .
For example , you could take a hash of the URL , along with a private Salt , and then provide that as a parameter too .
For my examples I will use a simple short salt , “ ABCDEFGHIJKLM ” .
Here is an example of how I would generate and use such a URL :
Generate the authentication token :
mike @haven :~ $ echo " ABCDEFGHIJKLM_http://external.site.example.com/ "
|md5sum a54de5ffcb50cead775cac0b254af46 0 - mike @haven :~ $
Build the URL :
< a href= " http://my.site.example.com/redirect.cgi?url=http://external.site.example.com/&auth=a54de5ffcb50cead775cac0b254af460 " >
Click to go to " external.site.example.com " </ a >
The redirect.cgi is only doing two things .
It checks that the MD5 of “ ABCDEFGHIJKLM_http://external.site.example.com/ " matches a54de5ffcb50cead775cac0b254af460 , and if so it redirects .
We do n’t even need to write a script to do that , it can all be done inside the Apache configuration or a htaccess file .
Here follows the mod_rewrite configuration :
RewriteEngine On RewriteMap unescape int:unescape RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(?:.*\&) ?url= ([ ^\& ] * % 3 [ f F ] [ ^\& ] * )
RewriteRule ^/bounce $ $ {unescape : %1 } RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(?:.*\&) ?url= ( [ ^\& ] + )
RewriteRule ^/bounce$ $ {unescape : %1 } ?
On its own , the above would create an open redirector .
The next step is to add some mod_security configuration to check the auth parameter :
## Enable ModSecurity and allow HTTP request parsing SecRuleEngine On SecRequestBodyAccess
On ## Allow redirects if there is a valid auth parameter matching the url parameter SecRule REQUEST_URI ^/+bounce ( \?.*) ?$ " chain , phase : 1 , nolog , allow " SecRule ARGS : auth ^[ a - f0 - 9 ] { 32 }$ " chain , setvar:tx.auth= % {MATCHED_VAR} " SecRule ARGS:url ^(?i)https ?://.+$ " chain , setvar:tx.urlnsalt=**ABCDEFGHIJKLM**_%{MATCHED_VAR} "
SecRule TX:urlnsalt " @streq %{ TX.auth} " " t:md5, t:hexEncode " ##
Block all other requests for / bounce with a 403 FORBIDDEN error SecRule REQUEST_URI ^/+bounce (\?.*) ?$ " phase : 1, log , deny , status :403 "
It ’s pretty amazing what you can do with mod_security .
You might still consider it a pain to convert :
http://external.site.example.com/
To :
http://my.site.example.com/bounce?url=http://external.site.example.com/&auth=a54de5ffcb50cead775cac0b254af460
But for dynamically generated websites especially , it can be done completely transparently .
This website its self is generated using server side XSLT , with a self built framework utilising Perls XML :: LibXML and XML :: LibXSLT modules .
So with a little Perl , XPath and XML trickery , I ’ve been able to update the framework to convert all external anchor tags to use my redirector dynamically .
Here ’s the code :
my $ doc = $ stylesheet -> transform ( $ xml , ) ; if ( $ stylesheet -> media_type eq ' text / html ' ) { foreach my $ node ( $ doc->findnodes ( ' html/ body //a' ) ) { my $ href = $ node -> getAttribute ( ' href ' ) || '' ; if ( $ href =~ / ^https ?:\/\/([-a-z0 - 9\. ]+ ) / i && lc ( $ 1 ) ne lc ( $ENV {HTTP_HOST} ) ) { $ node->setAttribute ( ' href ' , sprintf ( '/bounce?auth=%s&url=%s ' , Digest :: MD5::md5_hex ( " ABCDEFGHIJKLM_$href " ) , URI :: Escape::uri_escape( $ href ) , ) ) ; } } }
Now if I use :
< a href = " http://example.com/ " >
Click me </ a >
in a blog post , my framework automatically converts it to the redirect version , and if someone then clicks the link when reading my RSS feed , even though it was an external link and they were n’t viewing the blog post from my website , I still know the link was clicked .

1 Rooftop Bees in Brooklyn Yeshwant Chitalkar Yeshwant writes : " Several years ago , I saw a hive at a community garden in midtown Manhattan .
I sat mesmerized seeing the bees enter and leave the hive one after the other in an endless stream .
A hive , for me , was a force of flying insects that would bring me free produce : one of the very few ways I could be a farmer in this city .
There was also an urban farm in Red Hook , Brooklyn where I lived , that I hoped my bees would help pollinate .
" Last winter , I joined the New York City Beekeeping Meetup Group and took the beekeeping classes they ran jointly with the Gotham City Honey Co-op .
In the spring , I started with one hive on the roof of my row house .
( The ' meadow ' you see in some of the photos is the sedums and wild grasses growing on my home - made green roof . )
In July , someone gave me a swarm they had caught , so now I have two colonies .
This year was really rough for the bees because of all the rain in New York , but we 're catching up in the fall . "

5 Small Lot Beekeeping Karla Eisen Karla writes : " I have beeen keeping bees for 4 years now on 0.8 of an acre , surrounded by new development ( thousands of houses ) in Gainesville , Virginia .
I currently have 3 hives and 9 nucs in the back yard .
Due to the efforts of our beekeeping club , recently , our county ( Prince William County , Virginia ) passed new zoning rules allowing the keeping of bees on lots as small as 10,000 square feet . "
6 Small Lot Beekeeping Stefani Leto Stefani writes : " When people find out that a 40x40 - foot yard in my little Bay Area city holds three beehives , they 're surprised .
I do n't know how much room they expect bees to take -- it 's not as though I 'm running beef cattle or alpaca in Alameda .
Everyone 's happy to visit at harvest time , though .
The photo is of my daughter Caterina Angstadt - Leto ' helping ' hive a swarm . "
7 Urban Beach Beekeepers Janet and Kelly Kelly writes : " My partner Janet and I have had some incredible bee adventures .
It started when a reporter from the OC Weekly ( Orange County , CA ) wanted to follow us ( two renegade urban bee rescuers and keepers ) and do a story about what we do .... "
8 Urban Bee Rescuers Janet and Kelly Kelly continues : " We were just beekeeping as a hobby , as gardeners and nature lovers , and soon we could not keep up with the amount of emails from people who wanted us to rescue their bees .
So now we are the founders of backyardbees .
net . "
9 Beekeeping in Strange Locations Janet and Kelly Kelly continues : " We have over 40 hives that are kept in backyard gardens , small local farms or orchards .
One of our bee locations is the City of Laguna Woods -- resuced 4 hives from their city building and now manage them on the rooftop ! "
10 Selling Honey janet and kelly Kelly continues : " We sell local honey and rescue hives as an alternative to chemical extermination .
Our other goal is to provide public awareness by giving beekeeping lectures and help people who want to get started in beekeeping . "
11 A Combined Hive in Denver for a New Marriage Kathleen and Dallas Kathleen writes : " We started recently backyard beekeeping in Denver Colorado .
My interest in beekeeping started several years ago while helping a friend with her honey harvest out in Strasburg Colorado .
After setting up our two hives in late May , we waited for swarm calls .
The first came from Greenwood Mountain and the swarm was miniscule but we were thrilled .
We collected the swarm by hand , which took quite a long time , but we were excited and awed by the process .
Our second swarm came to us boxed and I made many newbie mistakes while introducing them to the hive , but somehow they ended up claiming it as home .
Towards the end of summer , we did a hive combine .
Although we were n't able to gather any honey this season , we hope that our hive combine was successful enough for the bees to survive through winter for " robbing " next season !
" Dallas and I recently married and we included our hives in the half - moon cake topper I compiled from photographs of us and our ' menagerie . ' "

I became a beekeeper because I felt called to help perpetuate the species and pollinate my garden .
The Eastern Missouri Beekeepers Association has been a great resource .
This picture was taken last summer , when there was only one hive .
Now there are two .
13 Family Beekeeping T.J. and Tracey Hansen T.J. writes : " My family of seven began keeping 3 - 4 hives in 2005 on a little over an acre in a neighborhood in Tullahoma , Tenn. , after a little bit of discussion with our immediate neighbors and city zoning officials .
The only obstacles we have encountered in the past five seasons have been the occasional observations from neighbors about bees visiting swimming pools , birdbaths and hummingbird feeders .
A few times through the years we have had the occasional sting on a child 's bare foot or a cloud of robbing bees roaming the yard after a mistake by the beekeeper .
Through beekeeping , gardening and tending for friend 's farm animals we have decided to put our home in the city up for sale and look for a hobby farm in the country to expand our operation and become more self sufficient . "
14 A Family Tradition of Beekeeping John Petro IV
John writes : " One winter my dad surprised my wife and I with an eight - frame starter kit and all the tools we would need .
We painted the boxes and I set out to build an enclosure for the hives in order to protect them from curious hounds from venturing too close .
Our yard gets full sun all day so I have faced the hive opening to the southeast and constructed a trellis of morning glories that protects them from the mid day heat .
It all turned out just as I had hoped except that I was still very apprehensive of keeping bees in urban Fairfax County , Virginia , which is a close suburb of Washington , D.C. I was afraid of what my neighbors would think and envisioned complaints of bees stinging everyone in our subdivision .
Thankfully most of our closest neighbors are gardeners and welcomed the honey bees with enthusiasm .
To this date no one has been stung ( except me , like all the time ) and our conversations often start with the question , ' How are the girls doing ? '
Their caring and encouragement has been a great inspiration to me . "

15 Fairfax County , Va. Beekeeping John Petro IV
John continues : " In our rookie season we have made a few mistakes -- a swarm and an all - to - curious skunk ( which has now sprayed our bloodhound twice ) ... but we are learning .
Thankfully , not at the cost of the bees who seem to be doing just fine as they are headed into their first winter here .
Even my Brooklyn - bred wife , Patricia , has fallen in love with them .
Her first stop after arriving home from work is usually out to see the bees . "
" My wife and I have already begun planning for another hive next year .
After some research with my dad we have decided to try some " Kenyan Top Bar Hives " which we have began to construct ourselves .
I am expanding my bee friendly gardens also .
We installed a sunflower garden as well as a 1,500 - square foot vegetable garden this past spring .
All of which turned out very well .
Ca n't wait for the girls to see what is in store for them next year ! "

16 Full Frontal Illegal Bees in Denver Amy Hobbs
Amy writes : " I live in North City Park section of Denver , about three miles from the center of downtown .
Bees just recently became legal here .
I have two hidden behind sunflowers are at my house ( still illegal ; they are supposed to be in the rear third of my lot ) .
Denver City Park and Zoo are 1/2 mile from my house , and the Denver Botanic Gardens are two miles away .
My yard is fully xeric , not one blade of grass ...
Bee heaven !
17 Rooftop Beekeeping in Washington , D.C. Toni Burnham
Toni writes : " I keep bees in three locations within Washington D.C. , as well as one in the Virginia suburbs .
My first two packages of bees arrived and were installed on my roof .
My Virginia apiary was started the following year .
I now look after seven hives within DC , one of which actually belongs to the DC Parks and Rec Department .
I have two hives on my roof , and the picture comes from there .
" The picture shows me with my roof hives at mid-year last year .
Every year they grow up stronger than the last , which results in me pressing all sorts of gear into service ahead of swarming -- which I believe must be avoided in an urban context .
The electrical cords attach to Bee-Cool units , which make me feel better because roof temps top 110 degrees F at least once every summer here .
My bees are really productive , so perhaps it helps them , too . "
18 San Jose Beekeeping Brenda Hobbs Brenda writes : " We began beekeeping ( in Cambrian Park , San Jose , Calif . ) on a whim in April 2009 because we never saw honeybees in our garden .
Our first hive swarmed in June , then it was varroa mites and moths .
We now have two very healthy hives going into Fall strong with honey stores .
We have added bamboo to our grape - stake fence to shield the sidewalk and plain view .
Our neighbors are so far in strong support and it's been a hit with most of the passers by . "
19 Native Bee Houses in McLean , Va. Denise Shreeve Denise writes : " Well — surely you guys did n't mean to discriminate against our native bees , just because they do n't make honey !
These little girls and guys are fabulous pollinators , and they need our love and support , too .
That 's why I started raising Orchard Mason Bees about seven years ago , and why I donate the bee houses I designed for them to local schools , native plant nurseries , historical sites , County parks and anyone who wants to help increase their populations .
I live about seven miles outside of Washington , D.C. on 1/8 acre that I 've jam - packed with all the plants that bees and butterflies adore .
So do n't forget to count me in , because I 'm a dedicated urban beekeeper , too — and I do n't even need a bee suit ;-) "
Did you know that it takes only 250 orchard mason bees to pollinate one acre of commercial apple orchards , whereas it would take 25,000 honeybees to accomplish the same task ?

20 Illegal Beekeeping Craig Stitt I am an illegal urban beekeeper .
In my small Midwest town bees are classified as " pests . "
Pest indeed !
In the first 16 years I lived in my house I never saw a honeybee .
As a way to honor and remember my late father who kept 10 hives I decided to get a hive to release some swarms back into the wild .
I live toward the end of a tree - lined dead end street , surrounded by neighbors who do n't use chemicals and are understanding about my mission .
I live about a block from a clover - and flower - filled park with many dead and hollow trees ideal for a beehive ....
It has been a good 16 months .
When I take my grandson for a walk and see a golden bee ( which happens with increasingly more frequency ) I feel pretty good that at least one of my swarms is doing well .
Finally this summer I saw a bee I had never seen before .
Research has led me to conclude it is a leaf cutter bee .
I take this as a sign that , at least in my micro-ecosystem , things may be improving .
I hope to send off many more swarms and get a bit more honey before the local authorities catch me and slap me in leg irons .
The Obamas can keep bees but not me ?
21 Charitable Honeybees in San Francisco Rev. Jacqueline Cherry Jacqueline writes : " I am a Deacon in the Episcopal Church in the Diocese of California and I have a beehive in my backyard on Potrero Hill in San Francisco .
We run a food pantry – The Julian Pantry — out of our church St. John the Evangelist in San Francisco 's Mission District on Saturday mornings .
The honey that is harvested from my backyard hive is sold to benefit the food pantry .
I received a grant from The Church Divinity School of the Pacific to fund this project . "
22 Backyard Bee Hive in San Francisco Rev. Jacqueline Cherry Jacqueline writes : " The Julian Hive is an attractive feature in our backyard garden . "
23 " Firefly " with the Hive Rev. Jacqueline Cherry Jacqueline writes : " Our 3 1 / 2 year - old daughter is fearless and she loves the bees .
( She renamed herself Firefly when she was 18 months old and that is the only name she will answer to . ) "
24 Country / City Beekeeping Nancy Essid Nancy writes : " I am an urban / country beekeeper from central Virginia .
I started about 6 years ago with a few hives at my parent 's home in the country .
I really wanted a hive that I could visit every day .
It is so relaxing to watch the girls come and go from their hive .
I love being able to go out my back door to visit them . "
25 Bees at a Maine Industrial Park Erin MacGregor - Forbes Erin writes : " I get a lot of swarm calls as I put my information out there as someone who will ' rescue ' honeybees .
I am one of only four Master Beekeepers in Maine .
I have two top bar hives that I am experimenting with .
The best way to populate a top bar hive is with a swarm , so I 'd been waiting to use it until I caught a swarm for it .
I manage about 80 colonies including quite a few at my home in Portland ( that 's where the top bar hive is ) .
I sell my honey through local grocery stores and at the farmer 's market .
" Like most beekeepers , beekeeping is my second job .
My first job is as controller for a manufacturing company here in Maine , Sterling Rope .
I keep bees on the company 's property in the industrial park .
Last year I had five of my own colonies there .
This year I got a grant from SARE to explore / demonstrate the differences between locally raised bees and commercial Italian bees .
I set my SARE apiary up at the office to make it easier for me to feed them when they first started , also it is a great place to have people come and see them ( lots of parking , etc. ) .
And I can run out and tend to them at lunchtime , which is great .
The forage in the industrial park is excellent — lots of wildflowers and weeds that bees love .
Plus , the bees are right under the eye of myself and our employees all the time ( so safe from vandals / predators ) , and the company loves the marketing aspects of the fact that we keep bees on our property ; there is even a picture of them in our catalog , and the company purchases honey from me and gives it away at trade shows .

26 Tacoma , Wash .
Beekeeping Joan Joan writes : " I am an urban beekeeper in Tacoma , Wash .
I have been keeping bees for two years and have one hive .
I have been a gardener for over 24 years and it seemed like the most natural progression for me .
I wanted the pollination for my vegetable garden but have become enamored with them and their amazing habits .
Even though I find more of them in my neighbor 's gardens than mine ( sigh ) , they are a delight .
All the neighbors are very positive about my bees and understand the plight of honeybees worldwide .
My dad is responsible for introducing me to the world of bees ( he kept bees over 30 years ago and does to this day ) and is still my mentor . "
27 Pittsburgh " Burgh " Bees Meredith Meyer Grelli Meredith writes : " In 2008 , a group of five backyard beekeepers with more than 60 years of combined beekeeping experience established the nonprofit organization , Burgh Bees , to promote honeybees , beekeeping and the creative reuse of neglected urban land . "
28 Pittsburgh Zoo Meredith Meyer Grelli Meredith writes : " Since 2008 Burgh Bees has established four demonstration apiaries in urban neighborhoods throughout the city in partnership with local urban farming organizations as well as the Pittsburgh Zoo . "
( This polar bear is a neighbor to the bees . )
29 Intensive Beekeeper Training Program Meredith Meyer Grelli Meredith writes : " In addition Burgh Bees also is in the midst of our ' intensive beekeeper training program , ' by which we are training 35 aspiring urban and suburban beekeepers . "
30 Yinzer Bees Meredith Meyer Grelli Meredith writes : " We also host monthly beekeeper meetups at local watering holes each month and bring city residents to all of our hives around town for tours !
Beekeeping is quite a phenomenon in the Burgh !
As we say , Honeybees are Yinzer Bees ! "
31 Ontario Neighborhood Beekeeping Mark and Shelley McAlpine Mark writes : " My wife and I live in Guelph , Ontario , Canada , in an older Italian neighbourhood filled with vegetable gardens , fruit trees and wild flowers , and our girls produce a wonderfully flavourful honey that reflects the diversity of plants they visit all summer .
We have a large , private yard with very supportive neighbors living beside us . "
32 Oklahoma City Beekeeping Mike Forbes
Mike writes : " I live and keep my bees on the southwest side of Oklahoma City .
I have been both a rural and urban beek and enjoy keeping them in the city much better .
There is always something blooming . "
33 Front Yard Bees in St. Louis Phil Ewing
Phil writes : " I 've been interested in bees since I was a kid , but it was n't until this year that my neighbor and I both got hives -- to do what we could to help guard against Colony Collapse Disorder , etc .
We found comfort in our own inexperience and have been greatly helped by the Eastern Missouri Beekeepers Association -- a fantastic organization .
I 've even started a blog , Honey Honey ... Do n't Stop .
My girls are in the front yard under a tree next to my neighbours driveway ( in Kirkwood , St. Louis ) .
They are the cause of great interest , never alarm , to all the neighbors , and my bees go largely about their business without interference .
The electricity meter reader had no idea I even had a hive , despite having walked in front of it once a month for the past five months !
It 's been fascinating and fun . "
34 Bronx Community Garden Bees Roger Repohl Roger writes : " Genesis Park Community Garden , the South Bronx , New York : I have kept 3 - 4 hives of bees here for 10 years .
Amazing as it may sound , the Bronx is ideal for an apiary .
The flowering trees and plants in its acres of parkland and on its streets make the Bronx a bee - paradise !
The hives are very productive , and the honeys are delightful ! "
35 Alex's Garage - Top Bees in Seattle Alexander Templeton Alex Templeton writes : " My hives sit atop our garage in Seattle 's Magnolia neighborhood , with well - tended gardens and landscaping nearby .
I built my hives from scratch , choosing the 8 - top bar , vertical design invented by French pastor Émile Warré .
My Carniolan bees are sweet - tempered , and I expect to take about 80 pounds of honey this autumn . "
36 A Moneymaking Hobby in Woodland , Calif .
Amber Kawelmacher
Amber writes of her hive : " I knew very little about bees when I got the hive .
I worked for Mann Lake LTD for almost a year and I learned enough to keep my hive alive .
This is the second season .
My first season I made approximately $ 500 selling honey at $ 5 per pound .
It started out as just something for my 15 - year - old son and I to do and turned in to an awesome hobby . "
37 Abundant Gardens in Seattle Bob Redmond Bob writes : " I 'm a first - year beekeeper in Seattle , WA .
I live in an apartment building so got my friend 's neighbor to let me put them in her backyard .
I do n't have a car but ride my bike over to Diane 's place in the Central District .
The CD is a pretty dense , urban neighborhood but close to Lake Washington with lots of backyard gardens and fruit trees nearby .
Due to rookie mistakes I had to combine my two hives into one ....
So far , so good with that one .
All the neighbors are very happy about the production of the local produce this year ; we are pretty sure it's the presence of the bees . "
38 A Hilltop Hive with a River View Chris Asmann Chris writes : " I live in a dense urban area where beekeeping is not illegal ( though most other types of livestock are specifically prohibited ) and I have a large lot that provides a good buffer between the bees and my neighbors .
A sharp drop to the sidewalk means that bees fly well over the heads of any passers - by .
The roof you see in the background is part of the low - income housing that 's in front of my home on the hill .
Beyond that is the Hudson River .
I prefer not to precisely identify my location as my hive uses bars without frames .
While they can be carefully removed , a draconian inspector could declare them ' fixed comb ' which does not conform to the requirements .
" The hive is considered a modified Warré hive , as it includes glass viewing windows with insulated covers .
I can satisfy my curiosity without opening the hive or disturbing the bees .
While it 's not really an observation hive and the queen is rarely visible , it does allow a satisfying view of activity inside without causing any disruption .
I use this hive design because I believe it provides the best environment for the bees of any I have investigated when it 's used according to the instructions of its creator Abbe Emil Warré .
Thür and Christ both developed similar designs , apparently all three without the benefit of the other two 's experiences . "
39 Backyard Bees in Maine Christy Hemenway Christy writes : " Here are several shots of Gold Star top bar hives -- the kit we manufacture for sale .
Not as ' surreptitious ' as say , a New York City rooftop beekeeper has to be , I mean , hey -- my landlord wrote my bees right into my lease , and even let me grow the lawn into a meadow this year !
But it 's a lovely little apiary at 5:30 on a summer morning in Bath , Maine ... with the sunrise shining on the sides of the hives . "
" Gold Star Honeybees runs a Beekeeping Service , where I place the hives , populate 'em with bees , and then maintain them all season -- sort of like the ' pool guy ' would take care of your swimming pool ( only different ) . "
40 St. Louis Garden Bees Craig Reinert Craig writes : " I 'm an avid gardener in the city of St. Louis .
When my neighbor mentioned she was getting bees I said , ' I 've wanted to do that for years , ' so she helped me get started with Russians .
We compare notes and have learned a lot .
Aside from some queen problems , my untreated bees seem fine and the neighbors have no complaints . "
41 Downtown Fargo Bees Dana Dana writes : " This hive sits in my backyard .
The bees have a small urban landscape ( in downtown Fargo , N.D. ) to forage , which supplies an uninterrupted flow of nectar .
The city 's plantings throughout downtown , neighbor 's gardens , rooftop patios ... they all supply the nectar that is making what I feel is the best honey . "
42 " Darn Good Honey , Straight from My Backyard " Donald Koppy Donald writes : " Better known as Koppy 's Bee Ranch , these hives may appear to be out in the woods but they are actually in a typical old subdivision of St. Louis .
I 've had them here for nine years and every four years must get a special animal permit from the City of Crestwood , Missouri .
Fortunately , my neighbors are OK with me keeping bees , and an annual jar of honey keeps them that way .
I sell my extra honey at the local grocery store and call it ' Darn Good Honey , Straight from My Backyard . ' "
43 An Observation Hive in Fairfax , Va. Frank Linton
Frank writes : " An observation hive is a glass - walled hive that one keeps to see what bees are doing and how they are doing it .
Honey bees are a social insect ; they engage in many complex behaviors ( and , unlike with ants and termites , these behaviors are easily observed ) .
The tube allows the bees to come and go as they wish .
I live in a cul - de-sac and the neighbors are familiar with my bees -- and their honey .
The individual in the house visible through the window allows the bees to drink from her birdbath .
I live , with my bees , in Fairfax , VA . "
44 Backyard Bees in St. Louis Gigi Flynn Gigi writes : " I 'm a first - year beekeeper whose untreated bees appear to be thriving ; ' purebred ' Russians in two 8 - frame hives started from nucs .
They sit facing my kitchen window in Dogtown , a working - class neighborhood of St. Louis .
My neighbors do n't mind and ask how they 're doing .
One neighbor even started his own hive as a result , so we share tools and information . "
45 Milwaukee Honey Bees Greg Molzahn
Greg writes : " I 'm in my second season of backyard beekeeping .
I keep this hive in my backyard in South Milwaukee , WI .
No laws prohibit it , and the neighbors , for the most part , are interested .
In fact , I just harvested 40 pounds of basswood honey despite a June swarm and unusually cool and dry summer weather . "
46 Family Bees in Silver Springs , Md. Ido Dubrawsky
Ido writes : " I 'm part of the Montgomery County Beekeepers Association in Silver Spring , Md. , and I currently keep two hives in my backyard .
I 've had the hives since May and I live in a suburb of Washington , D.C. ( approximately 15 miles from the hive known as Congress ) .
My wife and I are organic gardeners and I took up beekeeping because we noticed the loss of pollinators in our garden and around our plants .
I love my little girls very much and feel that they are more a part of my family than they are bees .
I have attached a picture of the hives taken in July of this year . "
47 Peaceful Russian Immigrants in Groveland , Fla . Pastor James Benware James writes : " Here are three photos of my Apis sub - division in the city of Groveland , Fl .
The three ' town - houses ' are habitated by Russian immigrants .
They seem to take to city living quite well , they gave a good honey crop this year .
They also have cut down the number of poachers in the orange grove they dwell in . "
48 A Bee Tree in the Bronx James Fischer James writes : " The Gotham City Honey Co- Op formed around free weekly beekeeping course held in Manhattan from January to May .
We are a formal nonprofit agricultural co-op hoping that beekeeping will soon be legalized in New York City .
The photo is of a 8 - foot long 3 - foot diameter bee tree felled by a thunderstorm at the Bronx Zoo .
It took eight Co - Op beekeepers most of a day to hive the colony . "
49 Urban Bees in Oakland , Calif .
Kait Singley
Kait writes : " I keep a single hive in my backyard in Oakland , Ca .
It 's wedged between the casita ( my bedroom ) and the neighbors ' fences .
The hive is nested in among raspberries , bluberries , goldenberries , kiwi vines , a peach tree , roses and medicinal herbs .
Still , the bees fly out of the hive , up and to the north — straight for the neighbor 's bottlebrush tree !
50 Newly Legal Cleveland Bees Karin Wishner Karin says : " I 've been keeping bees for four years .
The city of Cleveland recently passed an ordinance allowing chickens and bees on residential city lots .
I feel that my bees help to restore balance in the city by improving pollination of the flora of urban gardens , community gardens and vegetation for wildlife .
In addition , the honey is wonderful and has won several awards in competitions against honey from rural areas ! "

52 Adventures in Atlanta Beekeeping Linda Tillman Linda writes : " I 'm an urban beekeeper in Atlanta where my bees are on my deck behind my house .
They have been there for four years .
I also keep a hive at a community garden , the Blue Heron Nature Preserve , which is inside Atlanta 's city limits .
It 's within the law in Atlanta and all over Georgia to keep bees .
I'm a member of the Metro Atlanta Beekeepers Association and we conduct inspections of our hives to help new beekeepers learn what to do and this photo shows me with other beekeepers on an inspection at the Blue Heron Nature Preserve community garden .
" This spring I got a call at work to go get a swarm from someone 's house .
I had an hour and a half break at work ( I'm a psychologist ) , so I drove past my house and grabbed my beesuit , a ladder , a cardboard box and a sheet .
I drove to the woman 's house , captured the swarm in the cardboard box .
I put the cardboard box , complete with swarm , into the back of my car .
The box was somewhat open because I did n't want to seal the bees into it .
I knew with Atlanta traffic that I did n't have time to take off my beesuit before driving the swarm to my backyard hives .
Wearing my beesuit , I jumped in the car with the bees in the back .
Some of them were flying against the back window trying to leave .
I got all kinds of stares on my way home — me driving in the beesuit with a car with bees hitting the back window one after another !
I got the swarm to my house , installed them in a hive on my deck with the rest of my hives , tore off my beesuit , jumped back in the car and got to work in time for my next patient ! "
53 Neighborhood Pollinators Melissa O'Grady Melissa writes : " I 'm a first - year beekeeper and love every minute of it !
My girls live in Cleveland Heights , which has no ordinance for or against keeping hives , but there is a ' nuisance ' law that requires hive ( or dog or rusty car ) removal if someone complains .
Luckily , all my neighbors are thrilled to have bees buzzing around their gardens ! "
54 Front Yard Beekeeping Nicole Wulff Nicole writes : " I 'm a first - year beekeeper in Gainesville , Fla. , a mid-size city of approximately 114,000 people .
I have one hive in my front yard along a suburban street .
Fortunately , my yard has a good number of trees so the neighbors have n't noticed the hive yet !
I 'm proud to say that I will harvest honey very soon !
" Thanks for spreading the word about the value of bees and the joys of beekeeping !
Also pictured is my friend Rob Horsburgh , a long - time beekeeper who has been helping me with hive inspections , teaching me about bees , their ways and tricks of the trade . "
55 Rooftop Hive in Hudson , Ohio Steve C. writes : " I do n't know if my hive counts as ' urban ' but I have a few hundred neighbors within a few blocks , so I guess that counts .
The bees are 15 - feet - plus off the ground .
I would imagine they are happy to be at that height . "
56 Hobby Beekeeping in Oregon Dave Creasey writes : " These hives are on a rural setting 6 miles northwest of Elmira , Ore .
Four is a good amount of hives to go into the winter with .
No chems are used .
Hobby only .
No honey is sold ... only given away as gifts and gratuities . "
57 Aspirations of a Kindergarten Beekeeper Chris Pampo writes : " When my son Julian was in kindergarten , he came home from school after learning about honeybees one day and announced that he wanted to be a beekeeper .
He was in luck , because unbeknownst to him , I had been a beekeeper in the Peace Corps many years ago .
It was just the excuse I needed to jump back in !
We live in a residential neighborhood in Gainesville , Fla. , and keep our hive in our backyard with our swimming pool , swingset , and 3 dogs .
We plan on adding 2 more hives in February .
My son is now 7 , and we love our bees !
My 2 year old is fascinated , too ! "

CHARLESTON , S.C. -- Scientists at the same lab where the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley is being restored announced Friday they have finished conserving two guns from the famed Confederate naval raider CSS Alabama .
One of the 5 - ton guns was shipped to Mobile , Ala. , on Thursday , where it will be displayed at the Museum of Mobile .
The second remains in Charleston where there are plans to display it at a museum that will one day display the Hunley , said Paul Mardikian , the head conservator on the Hunley project .
The Hunley , the first submarine to sink an enemy warship , was raised off the South Carolina coast in August 2000 , and brought to the lab .
The next day one of the Alabama guns arrived as well .
The second gun arrived some months later .
Initially , scientists had their hands full with the Hunley , the hand - cranked sub that contained the remains of its eight - man crew , so conservation work on the guns did n't begin until about six years ago .
" It 's a relief for me to see them done , " Mardikian said Friday .
" Cannon are inherently difficult to conserve and stabilize .
I would think these are the last cannon I treat with conventional techniques .
It takes less time to build a bridge than to treat a cannon . "
The conventional method leaves the cannon in a bath of solutions such as sodium hydroxide or sodium bicarbonate to remove salts left by salt water .
Clemson University researchers at the lab have been experimenting with a new subcritical fluid method .
In such technology , fluids take on the characteristics of both a gas and a liquid under intense heat and pressure and have unique dissolving characteristics .
Mardikian said that once the technique is perfected , conserving a similar cannon in subcritical fluids could be done in six months rather than six years .
The Alabama , built in Liverpool , England and launched in 1862 , was one of the most successful raiders in naval history .
The CSS Alabama Association says that during the 22 months it sailed , her crew boarded 447 ships taking 2,000 prisoners .
The cannon have inscriptions showing they were made in Liverpool , Mardikian said .
The Alabama sank in about 200 feet of water off Cherbourg , France after an engagement with the Union 's USS Kearsage on June 11 , 1864 , just a few months after the Hunley sank .
The wreck of the Alabama was discovered in 1984 by a French navy mine sweeper .
The cannon were raised in 2000 , a few months before the Hunley .
The 40 - foot Hunley rammed a spar with a black powder charge into the Union blockade ship Housatonic on Feb. 17 , 1864 off Charleston Harbor .
Though it was the first sub to sink an enemy warship , the Hunley sank as well .

Realtime Worlds has released a few screenshots and a new video detailing what to expect from their upcoming MMO Action game , All Points Bulletin ( APB ) .
By the look of things it seems Realtime Worlds is giving a lot of attention to customization for players , vehicles and even billboards .
All Points Bulletin is an upcoming action MMO game for Windows PCs based on urban sprawls which draws a lot of inspiration from GTA and Crackdown and why not , since the game design is led by David Jones , creator of the original Grand Theft Auto and Crackdown .
Players may join either the “ Enforcers ” or the “ Criminals ” and form sub - groups within these .
Staying true to the MMO genre , players can explore the massive San Paro ubran center comprising of two districts ( Financial District & Waterfront District ) .
Each district can hold up to 100 players with around thousand NPCs .
But Mr. Obama has to be careful how he proceeds because he has been critical of both Mr. Clinton ’s penchant for expending presidential capital on small - bore initiatives , like school uniforms , and Mr. Bush ’s expansive assertions of executive authority , like the secret program of wiretapping without warrants .

The president may focus on energy and the environment .
Credit ... Luke Sharrett / The New York Times
Already , Mr. Obama has had to reconcile his campaign - trail criticism of Mr. Bush for excessive use of so - called signing statements to bypass parts of legislation with his own use of such tactics .
After a bipartisan furor in Congress last year , Mr. Obama stopped issuing such signing statements , but aides said last month that he still reserves the right to ignore sections of bills he considers unconstitutional if objections have been lodged previously by the executive branch .
Another drawback of the executive power strategy is that actions taken unilaterally by the executive branch may not be as enduring as decisions made through acts of Congress signed into law by a president .
For instance , while the E.P.A. has been determined to have the authority to regulate carbon emissions , the administration would rather have a market - based system of pollution permits , called cap and trade , that requires legislation .
Still , presidents have logged significant accomplishments through the stroke of a pen .
In 1996 , on his own authority , Mr. Clinton turned a 2,600 - square - mile section of southern Utah into the Grand Staircase - Escalante National Monument , in what was called at the time his boldest environmental move .
Mr. Bush followed suit in 2006 by designating a 140,000 - square - mile stretch of islands and ocean near Hawaii as the largest protected marine reserve in the world , in what some see as his most lasting environmental achievement .
The use of executive power came to a head this week when Mr. Obama confronted Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Republican leader , about nominations held up in the Senate .
In a meeting with Congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday , Mr. Obama turned to Mr. McConnell and vowed to use his power to appoint officials during Senate recesses if his nominations were not cleared .
By Thursday , the Senate had voted to confirm 27 of 63 nominations that had been held up , and the White House declared victory .
Two administration officials , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said Friday that the White House had drafted a list of about a dozen nominees for the president to appoint during the recess that just began , but most were among those cleared .
Israeli authorities are distributing new gas masks to every citizen in an effort to guard against the possibility of chemical or biological attacks .
For many Israelis , gas masks and bomb shelters have been essential protections against possible rocket attacks from Gaza or militant groups in Lebanon .
Today Israel 's biggest fear is the threat of attack from Iran - if not with a nuclear bomb , then with missiles possibly carrying chemical or biological weapons .
Over the next three years every one of Israel 's 8 million citizens will receive a new gas mask for free .
Nearly 20 years ago Iraq fired scores of Scud missiles at Israel 's two biggest cities - Tel Aviv and Haifa .
Four years ago , Hezbollah militants in Lebanon launched thousands of Katyusha rockets into the country 's north .
Lieutenant Colonel Avital Leibovich from the Israeli Defence Force says it is ordinary citizens who are most at risk .
" There 's a shift in focus of terrorists .
The shift is towards the population , " she said .
Israel recently simulated a biological and chemical attack as part of a military exercise to practice how authorities would respond in the event of the real thing .
“ May I ask you a question ? ” “ Yes . ” “ It ’s a philosophical question .
Is that ok ? ” “ Sure . ” “ There ’s a boy I fancy .
Should I text him or e-mail him ? ”
“ What do you do ? ” “ I ’m a philosopher . ”
“ What are some of your sayings , then ? ”
From INTELLIGENT
LIFE Magazine , Spring 2010
There was once a website on which academic philosophers listed the curious things that strangers had said to them upon learning that they were in the presence of a philosopher .
The following conversation allegedly took place on an aeroplane :
In a similar vein , also from the skies : This exchange makes professional philosophers titter , because their daily work is far removed from the production of sage utterances .
But the request for “ sayings ” was not an unreasonable one .
The great philosophers of old are remembered largely by their posthumous contributions to dictionaries of quotations .
How is an ordinary person to know what today ’s professional philosophers think ?
One answer – a novel one , it seems – comes from a new survey of philosophers ’ views .
A preliminary analysis of the results has been published in an electronic journal , PhilPapers .
Unfortunately , however , the survey was written for philosophy nerds .
So here is a translation for airline passengers .
First , some background .
The questions are geared to what ’s known as the “ analytical ” type of philosophy , which now dominates university philosophy departments in the West and almost monopolises those in English - speaking countries .
The pioneers of this movement , which first took root in Britain in the first half of the 20th century , include Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein .
It is a broad church nowadays , but on the whole , analytical philosophy models its approach on the natural sciences .
Researchers , sometimes working more or less in teams , divide problems into small pieces and try out different solutions to them one by one .
The writings of the analytical school combine plain - speaking with technical terms that are precisely defined in the style of scientific terminology ( or at least , they are supposed to be ) .
This movement is often contrasted with “ Continental ” philosophy , which is more expansive and synoptic , tends to see itself as allied to literary , cultural and social studies , and is more likely to draw on subjective experience .
The big names of “ Continental ” philosophy are mostly French ( Sartre , Derrida , Foucault ) or German ( Heidegger ) , but the term is doubly misleading .
Many of the founders of analytical philosophy came from continental Europe , too ; and the stronghold of “ Continental ” philosophy nowadays is in fact in literary and cultural studies departments in Britain and America .
The PhilPapers study , by David Chalmers of the Australian National University and David Bourget of London University , surveyed academics at 99 leading philosophy departments around the globe , over 90 % of them in the English - speaking world and nearly two - thirds in America .
Some 91 % of the respondents thought they belonged to the analytic tradition and 4 % the “ Continental ” one .
When asked which dead philosopher they most identified with , a clear winner emerged , with 21 % of the votes : David Hume , the 18th - century thinker , historian , sceptic and agnostic who was a close friend of the economist Adam Smith .
Aristotle , Kant and Wittgenstein took second , third and fourth places .
The next six spots went to philosophers from the 20th century , most recently Donald Davidson , an American who died in 2003 .
Plato made 13th place and Socrates limped in at 21st .
Of the three topics that Immanuel Kant once said were the proper subjects of metaphysics – namely God , freedom and immortality – the survey covers only the first two , perhaps because these days life is too short to bother with immortality .
Free will gets a thumbs - up : only 12 % of philosophers think that people ’s lives are predestined .
But God gets the thumbs - down : nearly three - quarters accept or lean towards atheism .
This is only to be expected .
Even in America , which is unusually religious for a rich country , the top echelons of those who think for a living tend to be unbelievers .
A survey of the members of America ’s elite National Academy of Sciences in 1998 found that only 7 % believed in God .
A quarter of a century ago , such a survey would have had plenty of questions about language , but now there are only three ( out of 30 ) .
Analytical philosophy has shifted its attention from language to the mind , which is why there is a question about zombies – though nothing about ghouls , demons or vampires .
By a “ zombie ” , today ’s philosophers mean a hypothetical being who is physically indistinguishable from a normal person but is not conscious .
Philosophers argue about whether or not such a creature could exist in theory , and on the whole they are pretty undecided about it .
A small majority endorse “ physicalism ” about the mind , which is the theory that all mental states are in fact physical states .
Many of the pioneers of the 20th - century version of this view hailed from Australia , which led one philosophical wag to surmise that Australia is the only country in which it is true .
Contrary to a widespread caricature , it emerges that most philosophers do not go around doubting the existence of physical objects ( and thus colliding with them ) .
Some 82 % of the respondents accept or are inclined towards “ non-sceptical realism ” about the external world , which means they believe both that physical objects exist independently of the minds that perceive them , and that we can be said to know of their existence .
Some 4.8 % , though , are inclined to deny that we have certain knowledge of the existence of physical objects , and 4.2 % accept or lean towards “ idealism ” , which is the theory that matter somehow depends on mind .
As for the status of so - called “ abstract ” objects , such as numbers , the most popular view ( scoring 39 % , narrowly ahead of its closest rival ) is “ Platonism ” , according to which abstract objects have a real existence independently of our minds .
By a fairly narrow margin , today ’s philosophers believe that judgments of artistic value are not merely matters of individual taste : 41 % said aesthetic values are objective , 34 % say subjective , and a quarter gave some other answer .
They were not asked directly whether moral values are objective , but the responses to related questions suggest that most philosophers believe they are .
Some 56 % incline towards “ moral realism ” , which has no precise definition but implies that ethical questions have objectively right ( and wrong ) answers , and nearly two - thirds endorsed moral “ cognitivism ” , which suggests that they believe there are moral facts or truths .
The results reveal little about political views , as the one question about politics is unhelpfully phrased .
Respondents were asked to choose between egalitarianism ( 34.7 % ) , communitarianism ( 14.2 % ) and libertarianism ( 9.8 % ) ; over 40 % were unwilling to choose for one reason or another .
In five other questions 15 % or more of the philosophers said they were too unfamiliar with the issue to give an opinion .
Philosophy is now a highly specialised discipline .
A don working on , say , ethics , may not even know the terminology used by logicians , and vice versa .
This will be grist to the mill of those who feel that analytical philosophy has given up dealing with the big questions of life and is now mired in technical minutiae .
But not so fast .
Even Plato was attacked in his own time for treating philosophy as if it were all mathematics .
And 1,800 years ago the great doctor Galen moaned about “ the over - refined linguistic quibbling of some philosophers ” .
People have always wanted philosophers to provide digestible wisdom , yet it is as true now as it was in Plato ’s time that disciplined thinking is hard .
So next time you sit next to a philosopher on a plane , talk about the movie , not the meaning of life .

The base chief is a covert employee of the CIA ; her identity is protected by law .
I 'll call her Kathy .
She was 45 years old and a divorced mother of three .
She 'd spent the vast majority of her career at a desk in Northern Virginia , where she studied Al Qaeda for more than a decade .
Michael Scheuer , her first boss in Alec Station , the CIA unit that tracked bin Laden , told me she had attended the operative 's basic training course at the Farm , the agency 's training facility , and that he considered her a good , smart officer .
Another officer who knew her told me that despite her training at the Farm , she was always slotted to be a reports officer , someone who edits reports coming in from the field .
She was never intended to meet and debrief informants .
Kathy knew that there was a time when only seasoned field operatives were put in charge of places like Khost .
Not only would an operative need to have distinguished himself at the Farm ; he would 've run informants in the field for five years or more before earning such a post .
He probably would have done at least one previous tour in a war zone , too .
And he would have known the local language , in this case Pashto .
Kathy skipped all of this .
Imagine a Marine going straight from Parris Island to taking command of a combat battalion in the middle of a war .
In the late '90s , when Kathy was first put on the bin Laden account , it was the Siberia of the CIA , located in a bleak office building in Tysons Corner , Virginia .
If you needed someone important to pay attention to you , you had to drive down Route 123 to the main building in Langley .
And even then you'd be lucky to get fifteen minutes of anyone 's time .
Truth is that until September 11 , not everyone in the agency was all that worried about bin Laden .
The spoiled son of a Saudi construction magnate , he had n't done any real fighting in the Afghan war .
Yes , he 'd been behind a truck bombing in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in 1998 .
But neither truck got inside the building , and American casualties were relatively light .
Was this the best bin Laden could do ?
To the old guard at the CIA , he looked like a wannabe , not in the same league as Hezbollah .
That all changed on September 11 , of course , when every CIA station and base in the world turned their attention to " penetrating " Al Qaeda — recruiting a mole next to Osama bin Laden .
In the span of a few years , the CIA 's counterterrorism center went from a couple of hundred officers to 4,000 .
If you wanted to rise in the CIA , you needed to prove you were doing your part to get bin Laden .
As an Al Qaeda expert , Kathy did more than her part .
But Khost was her first field command , her first real chance to run informants .
She lived in a trailer , ate in a common mess , experienced the isolation of life behind blast walls and razor wire , surrounded by the dun countryside of eastern Afghanistan .
Like every other American serving in this part of the world , trapped on base for fear of the Taliban , she must have felt like a prisoner .
But from what I 've be able to glean about her , this hardship would 've made her all the more determined to show her bosses that she could do the job .
to understand the CIA , you need to know that from its beginning in 1947 , it was divided by a class system , as rigid and acrimonious as any .
Everyone in the agency , wherever he or she stood , knew about it and either benefited or suffered from it .
How badly does NBC just want to put this Whole Conan Thing behind them ?
Via Peter Kafka at All Things Digital , so badly , they 're trying to eradicate all history of it ever having existed from The Internet .
What history ?
Exactly .
But come on , Peter Kafka .
NBC would n't be so stupid and brazen as to remove the archives of their first serious cause célèbre to come to the network in a while , would they ?
If you said " yes " outloud just now , well , you 're right .
Per Peter :
A little odd , given that a couple of days ago , the network was offering every single " Tonight Show " episode O'Brien had taped on NBC.com .
But then again , everything about this story has been odd .
I 've asked NBC for comment .
NBC - at least , I 'm assuming it 's NBC - has also been aggressive about taking down Conan episodes from Google 's YouTube ( GOOG ) .
A look at NBC 's site shows , well , nothing .
The NBC - partnered Hulu shows nothing , either !
Nothing here , either
That said , you can still watch other great NBC programming , like ... Lipstick Jungle !
Which was canceled last May .
Or Kings !
Which , like Conan 's show , was a fan - favorite NBC canceled because they were too incompetent to figure out how to make money off of it .
Or the NBC reboot of Knight Rider , which was just as stupid of an idea as it sounded !
You can even buy old Tonight Show gear !
But you know what you can't do ?
Watch Conan O'Brien's The Tonight Show .
Probably because it reminds NBC of nothing but their tremendous failure to do anything correctly , ever .
A pattern they manage to move forward with by erasing Conan from their memories .
Thankfully , for you , dear customer : Conan Lives
On , in our hearts , minds , and at Gawker .
TV , where we 're apparently servicing NBC 's customer base better than that network will ever — ever — be able to be .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration on Friday sought to limit fallout from a resolution branding the World War One- era massacre of Armenians by Turkish forces as “ genocide , ” and vowed to stop it from going further in Congress .
Riot police block the entrance of the U.S. Embassy during a demonstration in Ankara March 5 , 2010 .
The sign affixed to the black wreath reads " We did n't do genocide .
We defended our country . "
REUTERS / Umit Bektas
Turkey was infuriated and recalled its ambassador after a House of Representatives committee on Thursday approved the nonbinding measure condemning killings that took place nearly 100 years ago , in the last days of the Ottoman Empire .
A Democratic leadership aide told Reuters there were no plans “ at this point ” to schedule a vote of the full House on the measure , and a State Department official said this was the administration ’s understanding as well .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , facing questions about the issue while traveling in Latin America , declared Congress should drop the matter now .
“ The Obama administration strongly opposes the resolution that was passed by only one vote in the House committee and will work very hard to make sure it does not go to the House floor , ” she said in Guatemala City .
The resolution squeaked through the House Foreign Affairs Committee 23 - 22 on Thursday despite a last - minute appeal against it from the Obama administration , which feared damage to ties with Turkey .
The NATO ally is crucial to U.S. interests in Iraq , Iran , Afghanistan and the Middle East .
The issue puts President Barack Obama between Turkey , a secular Muslim democracy that looks toward the West , and Armenian - Americans , an important constituency in some states like California and New Jersey , ahead of the November congressional elections .
Similar resolutions have been introduced in past sessions of Congress , but never passed both the House and the Senate .
In 2007 , the same House committee passed such a resolution but it never came up on the floor after then - President George W. Bush weighed in strongly against it .
DAMAGED TIES
After the committee ’s vote on Thursday , Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan warned of possible damage to ties with the United States .
On Friday , Turkey ’s Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said chances of Turkey ’s parliament ratifying peace protocols with Christian Armenia were jeopardized by the vote on the 1915 massacres .
One U.S. analyst said the normalization accords were mired even before the U.S. resolution upset Turkey .
“ The protocols were already in trouble and ... what happened yesterday makes much life much more difficult , ” said Henri Barkey , a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former State Department official .
Muslim Turkey accepts that many Christian Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks but denies that up to 1.5 million died and that it amounted to genocide -- a term employed by many Western historians and some foreign parliaments .
The U.S. envoy in Ankara , James Jeffrey , distanced the Obama administration from the resolution after being invited for talks by Turkish officials .
“ We believe that Congress should not make a decision on the issue , ” he said .
There was also anger in Baku , Azerbaijan , a close Muslim and Turkic - speaking ally of Turkey .
Its parliament warned that the U.S. resolution could “ reduce to zero all previous efforts ” to resolve a long - standing conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the territory of Nagorno - Karabakh .
Kenneth Hachikian , chairman of the Armenian National Committee of America , said supporters would gather next week to do a “ whip count ” of House backers of the genocide resolution .
The resolution has 137 co-sponsors in the House , which is one measure of support and not close to the majority of 217 needed to pass .
Advocates need to show they have enough votes to pass the measure for it to be brought to the House floor , Democratic congressional aides said .
The resolution urges Obama to use the term “ genocide ” when he delivers his annual message on the Armenian massacres in April .
He avoided using the term last year although as a presidential candidate he said the killings were genocide .
Ronald Reagan was the only U.S. president to publicly call the killings genocide .
Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
A trendy California sushi restaurant says it 's closing after being accused of serving illegal whale meat .
The company that owns Santa Monica 's The Hump restaurant had already apologized for the whale meat accusation earlier in the week .
The restaurant 's Web site said : " After 12 years doing business in Santa Monica , The Hump will be closing its doors effective March 20 , 2010 .
The Hump hopes that by closing its doors , it will help bring awareness to the detrimental effect that illegal whaling has on the preservation of our ocean ecosystems and species . "
The investigation into the eatery began in October when two members of the team that made the documentary , " The Cove " visited The Hump , officials said .
" The Cove , " which exposes the annual killing of dolphins at a Japanese fishing village , won the Academy Award for Best Documentary earlier in March .
Armed with a hidden camera , two women from the documentary captured the waitress serving them whale and horse meat and identifying them as such , a federal criminal complaint said .
A receipt from the restaurant at the end of the meal identified their selection as " whale " and " horse " with a cost of $ 85 written next to them .
The women snuck pieces of the meat into a napkin and later sent them for examination to a researcher at Oregon State University .
He identified the whale sample to be that of sei whale , prosecutors said .
The meat from whales , considered an endangered species , cannot be sold legally in the United States .
The restaurant , located at the Santa Monica Airport , is known for its exotic fare .
Its Web site asks diners to surrender themselves to its chefs for " a culinary adventure ... unlike any that you have previously experienced . "
Prosecutors have also charged Typhoon Restaurant Inc. , the parent company of the restaurant , and one of its chefs -- Kiyoshiro Yamamoto , 45 -- with the illegal sale of a marine mammal product for an unauthorized purpose .
The misdemeanor charge carries a federal prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of up to $ 200,000 for the company , federal authorities said .
The Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection
Act make it illegal , except under very limited circumstances , to hunt , kill or capture whales and also prohibit trade in the animals or any part of them .

Only God Can Fire Pope Benedict After Scandals Canon Law : Pope Benedict is " untouchable , " despite Vatican cover-ups of abuse .
March 26 , 2010  --
As outrage mounted over the latest Catholic Church sex scandal , writer Christopher Hitchens called for the arrest of Pope Benedict XVI , and singer Sinead O'Connor said the pope should face a criminal investigation .
Protesters rallied outside the Vatican , angry that an office under his command had stopped the prosecution in 1996 of Wisconsin priest Lawrence Murphy , who admitted molesting 200 boys at a school for the deaf where he worked for 20 years .
The secret church trial was halted after Murphy made a personal appeal to the future pope asking for mercy .
The Murphy case emerged as Catholic anger was already building over growing sex scandals in Ireland and in the pope 's native Germany where his level of trust has fallen to 24 percent , according to a recent Stern magazine poll .
The Vatican continued to be rocked almost daily about new revelations .
The New York Times reported today that the pope when he was archbishop of Munich was included on a memo about a priest he had sent to therapy for pedophilia was returning to pastoral work .
The priest was later convicted of molesting boys .
French bishops have sent the pope a letter saying they are ashamed of priests who committed " abominable acts " by molesting and raping children .
And the conservative group Legionaries of Christ issued a statement today apologizing for the behavior of the group 's founder , Marcial Maciel , who was determined by a church investigation to have molested seminarians and fathered a child by a woman with whom he had a long affair .
Those would be devastating scenarios for most world leaders , but not for the pope .
Experts in canon law say only a heavenly bolt of lightning can take the former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger from power as the supreme leader of the Roman Catholic Church .
" The only person who can fire him is God , " said the Rev. Thomas Doyle , who worked at the Vatican embassy in Washington , D.C. , and was one of the first whistle blowers when the sex scandals broke in 1984 .
" A pope is never forced to resign , not under the current canon law , " said Robert Mickens , the Vatican correspondent for the Tablet weekly .
" A pope can voluntarily resign , but it 's interesting ...
Who would take his resignation ? "
The number of popes who may have resigned has been estimated as high as 10 , according to Thomas Reese , senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University .
Pope Defenders Call Charges ' Ignoble ' Attack
" Pope Celestine V's resignation in 1294 is the most famous because Dante placed him in hell for it , " said Reese .
" Most modern popes have felt that resignation is unacceptable . "
Pope Paul VI expressed that view when he said , " Paternity can not be resigned . "
Others feel that any discussion of a resignation is ridiculous , according to the pope 's defenders .
On Wednesday , one of Benedict 's top aides , Cardinal Jose Saraiva Martins , called the sex scandal accusations " a pretext for attacking the church . "
The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano chided the pope 's critics , saying the charges are " clearly an ignoble attempt to strike at Pope Benedict and his closest aides at any cost . "
Mickens thinks the recent scandals come very close to the pope and the pontiff has demonstrated some shortcomings in handling the issue .
" But I do n't want to demonize the pope ....
I think that , like all people , he is very concerned about anyone who has been hurt by sexual abuse at the hands of a priest .
I think he is horrified , " Mickens said .
Much of the criticism of the church 's handling of the sex scandals has been that offending priests were simply moved to other parishes or dioceses by bishops eager to protect the church .
And from 1981 to the day he became pope , Ratzinger headed the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith , the church 's disciplinary arm .
" He is really accountable to no one , and that is the history , " said former priest Richard Sipe , author of the 1990 book , " A Secret World " about the priesthood .
" There have been a pope or two who have resigned , several hundred have been murdered , but it 's a very stable organization from the top down .
What other monarchy do you know that 's lasted for 2,000 years ? "
" He is untouchable , there is no question about that , " Sipe said .
Sex Abuse Victim Wants Pope Held Accountable
He added , however , " There have to be some kind of consequences .
He could use his power to remove these incompetent heads and it would change the church dramatically .
That 's what the church needs . "
Hitchens argues that if Benedict , a former cardinal and one - time archbishop of Munich , Germany , were to hold his archbishops and cardinals accountable for the priests they reassigned , he would " move toward the impeachment of himself . "
" He would be calling for his own head , " said Hitchens .
" But , we 'll do it for him . "
Hitchens said the pope should not be allowed to escape scrutiny in other parts of the world where sex crimes have been committed by priests under his watch and said there should be an " international warrant " for his arrest .
" He 's supposed to be going to London and there is going to be a row about it , " said Hitchens .
" If another head of state was being pursued by people with questions about rape of children , would they meet them at the airport , shake their hands and meet the queen ? " he asked .
" Would they let them fly away again ? "
Irish singer Sinead O'Connor ripped into a letter the pope wrote to the people of Ireland apologizing for the years of sexual abuse of young boys , calling it " a study in the fine art of lying . "
" There should be a full criminal investigation of the pope .
The pope should stand down for the fact that he did not act in a Christian fashion to protect children , " she told the Los Angeles Times .
" The pope has to be held accountable , " said David Clohessy , who sued the Missouri parish priest who molested him when he was 11 .
" He is at the top , " said Clohessy , who is now national director of the Chicago - based Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests .
" It is totally irresponsible for him to only talk about the abuse , " said Clohessy .
" He is the decider . "

A new federal credit - card law that takes effect Monday could erase billions of dollars a year in fees and interest charges paid by consumers .
But card issuers are already deploying new tactics that could prove costly for even the most cautious cardholder .
The law made some important changes .
Card companies must now tell customers how long it would take to pay off the balance if they only make the minimum monthly payment .
Customers can only exceed their credit limit if they agree ahead of time to pay a penalty fee .
And unless a cardholder misses payments for more than 60 days , interest - rate increases will affect only new purchases , not existing balances .
Banning these and other profitable tactics is expected to cost the card industry at least $ 12 billion a year in lost revenue , according to law firm Morrison & Foerster .
This has sent the industry scrambling to find new sources of revenue .
So get ready for higher annual fees , higher balance - transfer charges , and growing charges for overseas transactions .
" There are countless fees that can be introduced and rates can go through the roof , " says Curtis Arnold , founder of U.S. Citizens for Fair Credit Card Terms Inc. , a consumer - advocacy group .
Consider the new offer from Citigroup Inc .
The bank will give cardholders a credit of 10 % on their total interest charge if they pay on time .
That sounds enticing , except that if you do n't pay on time , your interest rate is 29 % .
Apple 's retail plan for China , its massive stockpile of cash , and the environment were all topics of discussion during the company 's annual shareholder meeting on Thursday .
Though it was a fairly average shareholder meeting , these tidbits helped reassure investors that China 's plan for Asia is as serious as the company says and that Apple 's plan for its money is to keep investing in talent .
One of the biggest tidbits of news out of the meeting was that Apple plans to open " up to " 25 retail stores in China in the near future .
The company 's first store was opened in Beijing in 2008 , not long before the 2008 Olympic Games took place there .
Apple has always said that it has big plans for the Chinese market , so the news is n't so much a surprise as it is a commitment to expanding Apple 's presence in a huge market .
According to CNBC , the time frame for these stores to open is within the next 24 months .
On top of the China news , Steve Jobs defended Apple 's $ 40 billion cash hoard by saying that it gives the company " tremendous security and flexibility , " according to the Associated Press .
By flexibility , he means it lets Apple strategically buy companies like Lala and Quattro in order to acquire talent and expand its business operations .
" Who knows what 's around the next corner ? "
Jobs reportedly said .
Apple 's board also discussed a recent sustainability proposal with shareholders .
Jobs told investors that the company had taken numerous steps with suppliers to use nontoxic materials and reduce waste , though environmentalists still wanted more out of the company .
Extra measures might have included a detailed report out of Apple or even a sustainability committee , but those proposals were voted down by shareholders .
A few jabs at Apple board member and environmental frontman Apple Gore took place , as well as numerous observations about the health and appearance of Steve Jobs , but otherwise it was largely a run-of - the - mill meeting .
In the past , Jobs has speculated about possible successors ( COO Tim Cook and CFO Peter Oppenheimer , of course ) , but it seems this time around that no one is wondering whether Jobs is here to stay — at least for a while longer .

WHAT is it like being a climate scientist at the moment ?
Not much fun .
It ’s a bit like your next - door neighbour being accused of a crime and everyone in the city you live in , including yourself , being told they are under suspicion as well .
Accusations about lack of integrity , deceit and bias are flying thick and fast .
To most climate scientists , these accusations seem deeply unfair : mistakes may have been made , but it is wrong to condemn the whole of climate science as incompetent , corrupt or worse .

Today ’s idea : Advances in neuroscience put it increasingly in conflict with criminal law :
If all our mental states can ultimately be reduced to neurophysiological conditions , and there is really no such thing as free will , how can people be held accountable for crimes ?
Neuroscience |
In Miller - McCune magazine , Michael Haederle writes that new theories of brain function and “ neuroimaging ” techniques are challenging the law ’s view of people “ essentially as rational actors , capable of forming intentions , weighing the consequences of their actions and controlling their behavior ” :
Seventh Art Releasing
A core tenet of the new neuroscience is that there is no single place inside our brain where free will is exercised and a kernel of “ self ” resides .
Instead , the science suggests , the mental states we experience are like a mirage , arising from highly complex interactions of myriad brain systems involving electrical signals that are governed by the laws of physics .
It is a highly mechanistic model that many believe ultimately denies that free will is truly free .
Yet this might be only one way the science could affect the law , he writes :
Science Photo Library
Suppose a neural scan could determine whether someone was in a vegetative or minimally conscious state ?
What if an fMRI [ functional magnetic resonance imaging scan ] could objectively measure the degree of pain and suffering someone was experiencing in a personal injury case ?
Neuroimaging might even be used to measure a criminal ’s risk of recidivism or , conversely , the extent of his rehabilitation .
And the time may not be far off when a neural scan will substitute for conventional lie detectors .

The article paints this as the next Industrial Revolution , which is troubling for me personally because the first one was complicated enough ( steam ? what ? ) and nanotechnology is way too much for my feeble brain to handle , but I can totally understand tiny robots .
And I approve , as long as they 're as adorable as their tiny size demands .

One - horse towns such as Ravenswood , whose downtown is seen here , are " one plant shutdown from oblivion , " says Tom Juravich , who co-wrote a history of the 1990 lockout at the local aluminum plant .
Enlarge By Jeff Gentner , USA TODAY Tim Shumaker , 49 , stands in front of the shuttered plant where he worked before being laid off a year ago .
These days , he 's scrambling to pay the mortgage and other bills .
New ghost towns : Industrial communities teeter on the edge RAVENSWOOD , W.Va . 
When Henry Kaiser arrived 55 years ago , this place was no place — " a rural problem area , " the government called it , so poor and isolated that the population had dropped 15 % since 1940 .
That all changed after Kaiser , the industrialist who'd turned out ships and planes at a record pace in World War II , built the nation 's largest consolidated aluminum works here on the banks of the Ohio River .
The plant paid Tim Shumaker his first living wage , and he won the right to keep it two decades ago after his union was locked out for 19 months .
Today , that victory seems hollow .
Shumaker , 49 , has been laid off .
Part of the vast aluminum complex is closed , and the rest is for sale — its orders down , its workforce reduced , its future uncertain .
Shumaker stands at the locked plant gate and , after a year without work , worries what 's next for him and his community .
" The way things are going , " he says , " there 's not going to be anything here . "
PHOTOS : Will Ravenswood , W.Va , be a ghost town ?
JOBS FORECAST : 384 metro areas , 50 states Ravenswood , with 4,000 people and one big factory , is like many towns in the USA where things still are made : caught in a winter between recession and recovery , hoping the latter will arrive before the former kills the last decent blue - collar job .
If the rest of the aluminum works closed , " would this become a ghost town ? " muses Jim Frazier , principal of the Henry J. Kaiser Elementary School .
Whether it's textiles in the Carolinas , paper in New England or steel in the Midwest , most industrial cities and mill towns " are on pins and needles , " says Donald Schunk , an economist at Coastal Carolina University .
" Day to day , week to week , any manufacturing facility seems vulnerable .
People do n't know if they 'll be there . "
That 's true in : • Georgetown , S.C. ( pop. 9,000 ) , where the closing of the local steel mill last year left International Paper as the last major private employer .
• Madawaska , Maine ( pop. 4,000 ) , where workers voted last month to take an 8.5 % wage cut to keep the financially strapped paper mill going .
• Glenwood , Wash . ( pop. 500 ) , where flat lumber prices and rising land prices are crippling the forest products industry .
Anxiety over possible layoffs or closings can disturb workers as much as the real thing , experts say .
Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert says it 's uncertainty that really bothers people :
They feel worse when they think something bad might happen than they do when they know it will happen .
Ravenswood knows the feeling .
It 's waiting for the other shoe to drop .
The aluminum works south of town has two parts : a reduction plant ( or smelter ) , where ore is heated to 1,800 degrees to make aluminum ; and a fabrication plant , where aluminum is rolled or stretched into sheets or plates .
Since 1999 , the plants have been separately owned .
A year ago last month , Century Aluminum closed the reduction plant , laying off Shumaker and about 650 other workers .
The fabrication plant , owned by Rio Tinto Alcan , still employs more than 1,000 .
What if the Alcan plant , which bought its raw aluminum from Century , also were to close ?
That worries almost everyone , including Frazier at Kaiser Elementary .
Of the school 's 160 families , 37 have parents who worked at Century ; many others have breadwinners at Alcan .
Kate Bronfenbrenner , a Cornell labor relations professor who studied the 1990 Ravenswood lockout , says that if the second plant closes " that town would die . "
Other communities sustained by manufacturing face a similar fate , she adds : " We had ghost towns in the past .
We could have them again . "
The difference is that people could leave a ghost town — miners to work new veins , farmers to till fresh land , merchants to move closer to road or rail .
Today , Tim Shumaker sees no such options .
In past layoffs , he always found work somewhere ; now there seems to be none anywhere .
So , like almost everyone else here , he 's staying put , wondering whether Ravenswood could become a new kind of ghost town : a place where people stay , because they have nowhere else to go .
Rise and fall Kaiser 's Ravenswood plant created a middle class where there was none .
When the United Steelworkers Union was voted in after the plant opened in 1957 , the hourly wage jumped from $ 1.78 to $ 3.25 .
Three decades later , the aluminum works was sold to a group that secretly included Marc Rich , an American commodities trader who was living in Switzerland to avoid charges of violating the U.S. trade ban with Iran .
According to a history by Bronfenbrenner and Tom Juravich , working conditions at the plant deteriorated .
The company forced workers into double shifts — sometimes for several days in a row — in the 100 - degree heat of the " pot rooms , " where molten aluminum is made .
When the union contract expired , the company locked the workers out .
Organized labor had been losing such battles , but at Ravenswood the Steelworkers launched an innovative " corporate campaign " that went beyond the picket line .
The union mobilized pressure from foreign unions and governments , persuaded beer companies to stop buying Ravenswood aluminum and lobbied the state Legislature to investigate the company .
In 1992 , the company settled , agreeing to a new contract with higher pay and limits on mandatory overtime .
By the end of 2008 , though , energy prices had risen , foreign competition had increased , and the price of aluminum had dropped 50 % in a few months .
On Feb. 4 , 2009 , the smelter closed .
Workers gathered in the high school gym .
Gov. Joe Manchin , a pro-union Democrat , came up from Charleston .
" The world 's changing , " he said .
In the America where things are made , the recession has been a depression .
According to a new Northeastern University study , one in every six blue - collar industrial jobs have disappeared since 2007 , matching the drop in overall employment in the Great Depression .
Last year , about 1.3 million factory jobs vanished , including Shumaker's .
For the first time , the government announced in January , most union members are government employees , not private - sector workers .
One - horse towns such as Ravenswood risk losing their reason for being , says Juravich , who teaches about labor at the University of Massachusetts .
Without a hospital or university campus or county seat , " they 're one plant shutdown from oblivion . "
Sometimes oblivion is a ghost town with tumbleweed blowing down Main Street and the doors of the Last Chance Saloon swinging in the desert wind .
But most 21st - century ghost towns will not be deserted .
People , many unemployed or underemployed , will fill the bars , stoops , corners , clinics , jails and social welfare offices .
An industrial town makes products that bring wealth into a community ; a post - industrial ghost town has a zero - sum economy — people in marginal jobs , " serving and paying each other , " Bronfenbrenner says .
At best , the new industrial ghost towns become places for low - rent homes for long - distance commuters .
At worst , they slowly empty out .
Uncertainty and anxiety
At first , some Century workers — who as a group averaged $ 51,000 in pay per year — regarded the layoff as a vacation .
Besides unemployment compensation , 20 - year veterans such as Shumaker got two years of layoff pay ( about $ 400 a month ) and continued health coverage ( no premiums , no deductible and a $ 10 co-pay for office visits ) .
A year later , some benefits are expiring , savings are running low , and people are beginning to hurt .
The local food bank 's caseload has tripled .
The pawn shop 's business has doubled .
" I 'm warm and dry , " Shumaker says , " but I do n't have a dime to my name . "
He 's behind in the payments on the three - bedroom house he shares with his wife and teenage son .
He has pawned some tools .
Instead of stopping for a burger at lunchtime , he goes home and fixes a peanut butter - and - jelly sandwich .
He drinks less milk , eats less meat , buys less gasoline .
He drives a dented Ford pickup with 150,000 miles on it .
What 's most striking about Ravenswood , however , is not the material deprivation but the psychological distress , an anxiety about the future that tests faith itself .
" I try to explain that God has not abandoned us , " says Scott Mapes , pastor of the Church of the Nazarene , where yearly giving has dropped from $ 180,000 to $ 150,000 .
Shumaker does not lack daily sustenance ; he lacks a future and a purpose .
" I 'm not depressed or anything , but I can't seem to get started in the morning , " he says .
" I did n't get out of bed today until 9 a.m . "
He 's wearing a black T - shirt with pictures of a U.S. flag and a buffalo and the words " Roam Free . "
Problem is , he can't .
The old rule — go where the work is — no longer applies , unless maybe you 're a nurse or a teacher .
There 's constant speculation that Century might reopen .
Shumaker 's not optimistic .
Others are n't waiting for a call back to work .
Hundreds are taking advantage of a federal program that pays $ 20,000 for education or training for workers who lose jobs because of foreign competition .
Dave Guthrie , 51 , says he 's glad he was laid off because now he has the time , money and motivation to go to college .
He wants to be a traveling nurse , working short - term contracts around the country , far from what he calls the plant 's " us-vs. - them " labor - management dynamic .
He sees Ravenswood as a nascent ghost town : " Industrial workers are dinosaurs .
In the future , it 's going to be service jobs and electronics .
…
Eventually , people will start leaving here .
It 's that or a minimum - wage job at Wal - Mart . "
Tim Shumaker is not going anywhere .
On another slow , jobless day , he sits in the union hall , which is a sort of shrine to the great lockout .
There 's a picture of a worker who died on the job in 1990 ; a union - issued Marc Rich " wanted " poster ; a photo collage of members ' children , under the words " Why We Fight " and " Labor 's Future . "
There 's also an aerial photo of the sprawling colossus that sucked up more power than a city and pumped out 500 tons of metal a day .
For a half - century , the hottest place in West Virginia ; now , stone cold .
" It 's disheartening , " he says .
" I enjoyed working there — even the pot rooms .
I miss it . "

Ms Chernovetskaya said she had 4.5 m euros - worth ( £ 4 m ) of jewels stolen
The daughter of the mayor of Kiev has been the victim of a robbery in Paris .
Kristina Chernovetskaya said she had 4.5 m euros - worth ( £ 4 m ) of jewels stolen as she drove into the city from Charles de Gaulle airport .
She was being driven along the motorway in a luxury hire car when the thief struck , she told police .
They were stuck in traffic in the northern suburbs when a man wrenched open a car door and made off with her handbag , said Ms Chernovetskaya .
She said the bag contained jewels , rings and earrings with a value of more than $ 6 m .
Her chauffeur gave chase but the thief got away , says the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris .
The only consolation for the daughter of the mayor of Ukraine 's capital - who is also a banker , adds our correspondent - was that the thief left behind some 8,000 euros in cash .
It does n't seem as though the soldier smashing the windows expected the explosion .
Oil and politics have always been a volatile mix in Mexico , dating from the nationalization of the country 's oil industry in 1938 .
The idea behind that revolutionary move was to wrest control of this rich national patrimony from foreign oil companies in order to better preserve it for the benefit of the Mexican people .
Since then , any talk of involving foreign companies in Mexico 's oil business has been political hemlock .
For many years , oil production has reliably served as the country 's major source of revenue , and Pemex , the national oil monopoly , has been both a major employer and a major source of political patronage .
Over the years , too , there has been vigorous debate about how — and how equitably —
Mexico 's petrodollars have been distributed ; but the prominent place of oil in Mexico 's national asset base has been a given .
For an intelligent , confident and not unattractive 35 - year - old , I have a disastrous relationship history .
I 've dived into passionate long - distance flings , forced friendships into more , with terrible results , and rebuffed perfectly lovely men for no reason at all .
I never wanted to be on my own , but spent my 20s more single than not .
My last relationship – at two - and - a - half years , the longest and most important of my life so far – ended messily about 15 months ago .
I felt battered , exhausted and desperately sad .
I broke off all contact with my ex , left the street on which we lived and curled up in my friend 's apartment for the summer .
Had I known how transformative this break - up would prove to be , I would have felt a lot less troubled .
But those weeks marked the start of my recovery : my sunny side – submerged during my relationship – began to pull my other self , the one who wanted to sob every night , out of her hole .
A year , a fling , a backpacking trip and a lot of self - discovery later , I am happier than I 've ever been .
It shows in my face , my work , my social life , even my health .
But I 'm single .
I 'm not alone : the number of single households is rising and predicted to reach 40 % this year .
A recent survey reveals seven out of 10 Londoners have dated in the past year – underlining how few of us are in long - term relationships .
We have too much choice , the experts say , which counterintuitively makes it harder to meet people .
So we 're single – and stuck that way .
For me , until recently , this was a choice : I was recovering from the end of a serious relationship .
But in the past months , my lack of boyfriend has loomed larger .
So I 've agreed to talk to Andrew G Marshall , a therapist who specialises in relationship and singles ' counselling .
Marshall , author of The Single Trap , has been helping single people since he started counselling 25 years ago , but in the past five years has noticed an increase in their numbers , and in their despair .
" Most prefer to plunge into the next date , rather than understand why they keep meeting the wrong people , or find it hard to meet the right ones , " he says .
" And online dating has made things worse .
The biggest problem is not enough knowledge about relationships , or skills to handle them : compromise , the ability to argue constructively , trust . "
He sees people , on average , for around eight weeks – and sees four times as many women as men .
" The men I see are normally trying to come to terms with a failed relationship – they tend to be older , and totally at sea because they do n't understand what went wrong and have no one to talk to .
Women are more likely to be looking for love , and come into counselling as a last resort – often after what they felt was their last hope relationship ended .
Women are socialised to be interested in relationships , which makes them better equipped for them , but they feel more of a failure if they are not a success . "
Older people are more likely to approach him , he says .
" It 's easier to settle in your 20s as you 're more flexible .
In their 30s , people think : ' I 've put up with so many losers – this [ relationship ] had better be brilliant , ' and that 's not a good attitude . "
I 'm not sure which category of single I fall into .
I 'm intrigued to see what Marshall makes of me and my dating record , but if I 'm honest , I want to learn something useful that will help me find a good boyfriend .
After asking my age , he gets straight to the subject that is , surprisingly , at the core of his thinking : my family .
Are my parents still together ?
Describe their relationship .
What is it like having a twin brother ?
Do we get along ?
" What we learn from our parents about relationships informs the way we think about them , " Marshall says .
He then asks me to name my significant boyfriends , and writes them down in a tree - shaped timeline .
It 's a bit unsettling seeing them gathered there .
When he 's finished , we peer at the diagram .
" So , between 20 and 35 , you 've probably not been in a relationship for more time than you have , " he says delicately .
" Have you any thoughts as to why that might be ? "
Sure , I say : insecurity , lack of confidence , inexperience .
" But I have a picture here of you being quite a confident girl , " he says .
I suddenly feel emotion engulf me .
" Do you want to tell me about that ? " he asks .
So we head back to my school days : me , tall and skinny with braces on my teeth , hating my looks and harbouring secret crushes – a pattern that would continue throughout my 20s .
" So you did n't fear boys because you thought they would take you over and run your life ? "
Marshall asks .
Quite the opposite , I say : I wanted to go out with them , I just did n't know how to .
We then talk boyfriends : what were they like ?
How did I meet them ?
How was the sex ?
What sort of person do I think I 'm suited to ?
He laughs along with me , nodding , smiling , scribbling and asking pertinent questions .
Then we stop .
I sip on my water while Marshall looks thoughtful .
" What do you think when you look at your family , and those people you 've been out with ? " he asks .
" Does anything spring to mind ? "
And for the first time in our session , I 'm silenced .
A blank .
He continues : " I have hopefully made you think about your family and your relationships .
I just wonder if , when you look at them , you see anything that strikes you . "
I stare at the chart : I had n't realised how many boyfriends had three - letter names .
But I do n't think this is the sort of insight Marshall is after , so instead , I mutter something about it all being a bit of a disaster .
" Disaster ? " he says .
" No , I would n't say it looks like a disaster by any stretch of the imagination . "
But my inability to draw conclusions from my own history does n't matter – Marshall has his own , and they are so unexpected I can't believe I never made the connection before .
It is , it seems , all about my brother .
" It 's considered quite a hard legacy to be an opposite sex twin , " he says .
" On one level , you 're incredibly relaxed with boys : they 're terribly familiar , because you 've been with a boy your whole life .
But being different from them is really rather difficult .
Sexually , they 're incredibly ... well , where do you start ? "
I find this wonderfully comforting , as if someone has just thrown a warm blanket around my shoulders .
It all makes sense : the fact I find men so easy to get on with , the fact I find flirting so uncomfortable .
There 's more .
My parents – same age , background , career , together since school , happily married – compound this feeling of familiarity .
" For attraction , we need difference , otherwise there 's no grit , no passion , " says Marshall .
This is why the men I 'm attracted to are so different from me , he says , and why the ones just like me , from similar backgrounds , do n't work out .
There is such a thing as too much difference , however , and that 's why my last relationship foundered : we wanted different things – I , commitment , he , freedom – and those are insurmountable challenges , says Marshall .
" You mus n't go back to that level of complexity , but you have to look for difference , allow it and not get panicked by it .
What you do n't need is nice and sensible , because there 's no passion there . "
I feel an enormous sense of relief .
What about my legacy , I ask .
Can I change that ?
" You ca n't be something you 're not , " he says .
" You 're honest , and I think men might find it appealing to have a woman who 's not trying to be deeply mysterious .
But men are frightened of rejection too – they only pounce if you are a dead certainty , so you need to let them know . "
Our session ends .
I feel light ‑headed and giggly , as if someone has just made sense of me .
Am I typical of most clients , I want to know .
" I was expecting something more complicated : divorced parents , multiple relationships that have left you bruised , " he says .
" Most people who have n't found love over - date . "
Can you under‑date ?
" I did n't think you could until I met you .
But you have a sunny outlook : 18 months is a good time to get over someone important .
I do n't think there 's much to be worried about . "
I wish I 'd seen a therapist like Marshall in my 20s .
Back then , I thought therapy was for over - analytical New Yorkers in Woody Allen films , not normal people .
No one else I knew had trouble meeting men , so I would have felt embarrassed having counselling .
Does this attitude still exist ?
" There is still a taboo about asking for help , " says Marshall .
" People wait about five years too long .
But therapists have been slow to publicise what a profound difference we can make to single people , so most people do n't even think of asking for our help – which is a pity . "
I do n't believe we should blame therapists : in my experience , we are slow to talk to professionals about our love lives because we have no precedent – from school onwards .
But I also believe a cultural shift is taking place : therapy is openly discussed and depicted in the media , and as a nation we are , good or bad , becoming more emotional .
In the days following my session , I turn everything over , ex-boyfriends invading my dreams .
A week later , I have two encounters .
First , I meet an old friend for a drink and look at him in a new light .
Different from me , he 's someone I would never have considered boyfriend material – but now ?
Then I meet an attractive guy at a party and – inwardly cringing – flirt with him .
It is surprisingly fun and I leave with a skip in my stride .
To an outsider , these are small steps , but for me , they 're giant leaps into , I hope , a happier relationship future .
The Single Trap by Andrew G Marshall is published by Bloomsbury
To Sherlock Holmes , she is always the woman .
I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name .
In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex .
It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler .
All emotions , and that one particularly , were abhorrent to his cold , precise but admirably balanced mind .
He was , I take it , the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen , but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position .
He never spoke of the softer passions , save with a gibe and a sneer .
They were admirable things for the observer — excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions .
But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results .
— Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , “ A Scandal In Bohemia ”
Advertisement
Though Jake Kasdan ’s undervalued 1998 debut feature Zero Effect is loosely based on the Doyle short story quoted above , the inspiration really came from just that first paragraph .
Re-imagining Sherlock Holmes as a pompadoured weirdo in modern - day Los Angeles , Kasdan takes what appears to be a frivolous fish - out - of - water comedy into deeper , more unexpected places .
Beyond the surface quirkiness — which there ’s plenty of , and it ’s awesome — the film has a surprising amount of insight into the savant mind and the way one person ’s unique genius is not only linked to his dysfunction , but completely reliant on it .
You can learn a lot about human beings when you consider yourself removed from the species ; in every other respect , it ’s something of a liability .
Meet Daryl Zero , a sort of Holmes in extremis .
The last name suggests a lot about his character .
He ’s uncompromising in his methods , to the point where he refuses to meet or speak to his clients , for fear of clouding his judgment .
Instead , he sends his Watson , Steve Arlo ( Ben Stiller ) , who serves as a trusty liaison and pitchman who ’s skilled at explaining why clients need Zero ’s services ( “ he can tell you where you were born , how old your mother was at the time , and what you had for breakfast , all within 30 seconds of meeting you ” ) while demanding an extravagant , non-negotiable fee .
While Arlo , the audience ’s surrogate , is suitably awed by his boss ’ insights into the human mind , his exasperation gets a good venting , too .
Zero ’s list of quirks is never - ending , from the harmless ( a fridge packed with cans of Tab ) to the paranoid ( an apartment protected by a bank vault , six heavy deadbolts , and a 10 - digit security code ) to the embarrassingly naïve ( he ’s never kissed a girl ) .
He ’s mastered the art of detachment , but as Arlo notes , the self - proclaimed “ greatest observer the world has ever known ” is too afraid to go the dry cleaners .

As played by Bill Pullman , Zero is both a cool , serenely confident logician and a certified nutcase — contradictions well - suited to an actor square - jawed enough to be the president in Independence Day , yet right at home in David Lynch ’s Lost Highway .
His one tic has always been a tendency to squint through performances , not as if he does n’t understand things , or he ’s dubious about what someone else is saying , but more as if he ’s lost in some bizarre train of thought .
In one of my favorite moments in Zero Effect , Zero drags Arlo away from his girlfriend in Los Angeles , puts him on a flight to Portland , and winds up communicating with him via two payphones about 10 feet apart from each other .
When Arlo asks him why they ’re on payphones , the mysteriously bearded Zero replies , with that trademark Pullman squint , “ We ca n’t be too careful .
Two guys in an airport … talking …
It ’s a little fishy . ”
At a mere 23 years old , Kasdan not only knows his Holmes , he crafts a seemingly simple yet maddeningly dense plot that ’s in line with Raymond Chandler detective fiction .
( As precociously gifted sons of once - reputed but since faded Hollywood directors go — his father is Lawrence Kasdan , whose career is currently bookended by Body Heat and Dreamcatcher — I ’d take him over Jason Reitman in a second .
Especially since Jake Kasdan also directed The TV Set , Walk Hard : The Dewey Cox Story , and various episodes of Freaks And Geeks and Undeclared . )
Put succinctly , Zero Effect tackles the case of a tycoon who lost his keys .
( Spoiler alert :
They turn up in the place where most lost keys are found . )
From there , it opens up into a tale of blackmail , family secrets , a decades - old murder , and obligatory twists and double - crosses .
Ryan O’Neal plays the mysterious client , Gregory Stark , who wants Zero to figure out who ’s blackmailing him while being discreet about why .
Here , Zero reveals his amazing powers of deduction by noting what he ’d learned simply by watching Stark on the treadmill :

The twin pillars of Zero ’s detective work , objectivity and observations ( “ the two obs , as I call them ” ) , start to crumble a little when he meets his Irene Adler in the exceedingly crafty Gloria Sullivan ( Kim Dickens ) .
Zero quickly pegs Gloria as the blackmailer , but in the process of figuring out her motives , he becomes smitten .
Save maybe for Zero ’s sleuthing scenes , their spiky relationship is the best thing about Zero Effect , and it falls under a small but grand movie tradition I call “ the cat - and - mouse romance . ”
Ernst Lubitsch ’s 1932 screwball comedy Trouble In Paradise , about the interplay between thieves , is the classic example ; in a key scene , they fall for each other by picking each other ’s pockets over dinner .
And it surfaced again recently in the underrated Duplicity , about opposing corporate - espionage agents who are turned on by deception .
Cat - and - mouse romances are built on mutual respect and professional admiration , yet they ’re inherently unstable , because each person is naturally trying to put one over on the other .
There ’s great chemistry to found at the intersection of attraction and distrust , and it transforms Zero from an antisocial misfit with a brilliant analytical mind to a ( relatively ) smooth operator who ca n’t see the case as clearly as he ’d like .
At nearly two hours flat , Zero Effect could stand some tightening , and it tends to fall slack whenever it leaves Zero ’s immediate orbit .
In contrast to the uneasy back - and - forth between Zero and Sullivan , there ’s no mystery to Arlo ’s relationship with his henpecking would - be fiancée ( Angela Featherstone ) ; she wants Arlo to end his peculiar dedication to a boss who exasperates him , and pay more attention to her .
Pretty straightforward .
Kasdan tries to give
Arlo some dimension by exploring why , say , he would abandon his girlfriend at a moment ’s notice just to fly to Portland for a pay - phone conversation .
But that ’s only interesting insofar as it relates to Zero and the lure of being close to such a singular personality .
How it affects
Arlo ’s dull domestic life does n’t mean anything .
Advertisement
Fortunately , Zero Effect gets jolted back to life whenever Kasdan brings the focus back to that Doyle quote , and digs into the genius of Zero ’s unconventional methods and all the problems that go along with them .
In one great ironic moment , Zero gets up in arms about his clients being “ victims of schemes , ” yet his current client is most likely a murderer .
He ’s like the perfect private investigator : blind to any moral considerations , devoted to the ins- and - outs of cracking cases .
To that end , Kasdan writes one of the most ingenious gumshoes in movie history , a man capable of discerning a woman ’s occupation through a whiff of iodine , reading stress levels through shaving nicks , and in the film ’s signature sequence , gleaning clues from the mattress dimensions at a 30 - year - old crime scene .
In a just world , Daryl Zero would be appearing in his eighth sequel by now .

Under the hypothetical scenario cooked up by Cyber ShockWave 's planners , the attack was launched through smartphones , which are becoming increasingly plausible as a potential threat .
Cyber ShockWave simulated a devastating cyberattack on the U.S. Thursday that shut down telecom networks , electrical grids and gas lines -- all within the participants ' imaginations , of course .
It all began with a virus infecting smartphones .
The virus was then transmitted to users '
PCs when they synced their computers with their smartphones .
It took down wireless and wired networks through a distributed denial of service attack , sending large video files out until they flooded the networks .
Meanwhile , the Eastern U.S. saw its electrical grid go down as a heat wave struck , and pipe bombs forced the shutdown of a major gas pipeline .
Large parts of the Northeast and several major cities in the Midwest were hit by blackouts .
Participants debated whether or not the President should order the shutdown of wireless and landline carriers ' networks to stop the virus , and whether or not he had the right to do so .
They also discussed calling up the National Guard and military to protect physical infrastructure and for crowd control .
The participants included former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff , former Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte and former director of Central Intelligence John McLaughlin .
Their general consensus :
The U.S. is woefully unprepared to deal with a cybercrisis .
About the Attacks
" We wanted to focus on three important aspects of cybersecurity -- infection of computing devices ; the convergence of multiple computing functions onto single devices such as smartphones giving spyware and malware the potential to have an ever - greater impact on our lives ; and the increased networking of devices and access to the Internet multiplying the effect of the infection of any single smartphone , " Blaise Misztal , senior policy analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center ( BPC ) , told TechNewsWorld .
The use of smartphones as a vector of attack reflects real life .
" You have so many people walking around with smartphones now that it's a good way to get people thinking about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure , " Cris Paden , a spokesperson for Cyber ShockWave cosponsor Symantec , told TechNewsWorld .
" This scenario is a how - to for bringing the U.S. to its knees , " said Rob Enderle , principal analyst at the Enderle Group .
" The reality is worse than the test identified because network traffic is n't properly monitored at the moment .
Anything that uses a common network , from smart traffic lights to newer power distribution systems , would cease to function properly or fail outright , " he told TechNewsWorld .
" You do n't have to send out large video files ; you can just send thousands and thousands of tiny packets , " Randy Abrams , director of technical education at ESET , pointed out .
" And with apps like Google Buzz , which by default broadcasts users ' locations to everyone , you just send out notices to people giving them misinformation about an attack or where it 's occurring and spread panic and confusion . "
Pulling in Every Direction
By the end of the Cyber ShockWave simulation , air traffic , the stock market and most financial and commercial transactions had ground to a halt , BPC's Misztal said .
There 's no doubt that our cybersecurity infrastructure is inadequate .
The U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair recently told Congress that the public and private sectors need to cooperate to protect the nation 's cyberinfrastructure and that the country is highly vulnerable to attacks .
Other security experts have warned about this weakness .
Such weaknesses add another level of uncertainty to other political decisions .
For instance , the Obama administration has made it a goal to build out the nation 's cyberinfrastructure and bring faster Web access to more people .
Meanwhile , the FCC wants 100 Mbps broadband access for every household within 10 years , and the private sector is pushing for faster Web access as well .
Google recently announced it will offer 1 Gpbs access to select communities .
[* Correction - Feb. 17 , 2010 ]
Faster connections in more places sounds nice , but could such a build - out exacerbate the problem should an attack occur ?
Should n't the U.S. ensure its cybersecurity infrastructure is adequate before jacking up access rates ?
Taking a Multi - Pronged Approach
Taking a linear approach , by ensuring security is solid first , wo n't work , Symantec 's Paden said .
" You do n't have any choice but to operate on concurrent tracks , " he explained .
" There 's an economic and educational need to roll out broadband to keep America competitive in a global , wired , Internet age . "
The two have to go hand in hand .
" There needs to be greater balance between new technology and mitigating the risks that come with it than exists today , " Enderle said .
The BPC will present a version of Cyber ShockWave to Congress to kick off a bipartisan discussion on what sort of authority and policies can be created before a real cyberthreat strikes America .
* ECT News Network editor 's note - Feb. 17 , 2010 : The original publication of this story stated that Google recently announced it will offer 100 Mbps access to select communities .
Google 's plans actually call for rolling out 1 Gbps connection speeds to select communities .
Looks like someone at Google should fast forward those Nexus One videos to the radio integration portion and figure out what went wrong , because it seems like the 3G coverage problem still has n't been fixed , even after that last big OTA update .
What 's more , many in Google 's support forums are noting that the phone will drop a weaker 3G signal merely when held by the bottom , as the video below clearly shows .
Oops .
We 're not at all sure what 's going on here , but we 're hoping this issue can yet be solved with a software patch -- things are going to get messy if this is purely a hardware issue .

Ryan Newman is the rare NASCAR driver who has a college degree , having earned a B.S. from Purdue in vehicle structure engineering in 2001 .
But perhaps he had a radical history teacher at that institution , because Newman does n't believe Neil Armstrong ever stepped foot on the Moon .
Said Newman of the original Moon landing , to the Greensboro News - Record :
" I 'm pretty sure it was fake .
I watched the documentary on it , and it 's pretty easy to believe .
The flag was standing straight out when there 's no wind up there .
When they step on the surface , there should have been a big cloud because there 's no atmosphere . "
In fairness to Newman , there are many people who agree with him .

When I was " circumcised " I was five or six , but it happens to girls as young as four .
It starts as a ceremony – the girl is bought clothes , gold earrings and bangles .
She has henna put on her hands and feet : the preliminaries are regarded as a celebration where she is the centre of attention .
But later they take her and put her in a gadha , which is shaped like a deep dish .
They lay her across it and hold her legs open ; there are often three people holding her very tight when she 's on the gadha , two holding her legs and hands , and one holding her chest and head .
The equipment is handmade : a sharp curved knife which is not sterilised .
And the girl is given no anaesthetic .
It is usually mostly women in attendance .
They leave a little hole for urination .
There are no stitches ; they treat the wound with herbs , salt and water .
It bleeds a lot and the victim is in great pain .
I was horribly frightened and crying .
The " ceremony " takes as little as 20 minutes or as long as an hour , depending on how much the girl struggles .
In Sudan and in neighbouring countries , female genital mutilation ( FGM ) is a cultural issue .
If you do n't undergo " circumcision " , people think you are dirty and no man will marry you .
You could say it is about ownership or protection – if someone tries to rape you , they can not do it easily .
I came to the UK to study and about the same time suffered a great deal of bleeding and pain , so I went to hospital .
The nurses and doctors did n't know about FGM .
They looked at me as though I was a freak and I had to explain I was " circumcised " .
It turned out that when they carried out the procedure they left part of one of my labia inside me , so the UK doctors operated to get rid of it .
I am ashamed to say that I attended a ceremony at a private hospital in Harley Street in London while a student here .
The girl , who was about eight , was anaesthetised .
I feel so guilty about it now and today , with the education I have had about FGM , I would report them to the police – but at the time it did n't cross my mind .
Many families in Britain take girls to their country of origin to have it done .
It is a holiday , they see family and the countryside and are then " circumcised " .
When they return , they tell the girl not to talk about it .
They say the government will take her away from her family , and that she will lose all she has in the UK .
We need education that is respectful and sensitive .
It ca n't be a cultural confrontation , a judgment .
People have been practising this for centuries and see it as embedded in their culture .
You cannot approach them aggressively – you have to invite them to talk , to show them the consequences of FGM later on , during menstruation , childbirth and so on .
We must educate grandmothers and mothers and young children , and campaign against it .
Many in my generation are fighting it .
These days people are more aware , and I know many educated women who will not practise it .
People see it as a form of murder , paralysing a part of your body .
They say : " We have had enough ! "

C has always permitted comparisons between any integer type , and C++ follows its lead .
Comparing signed types to signed types is straightforward : you sign extend the smaller type .
Likewise , when comparing unsigned types to unsigned types , you zero extend .
When comparing signed and unsigned types , the rules are less clear .
The C standard specifies a type ordering : long long > long > int > short > char .
If the unsigned type appears in that ordering before the signed type , then the signed value is converted to the unsigned type .
Note that this happens even if the types are the same size ( e.g. , either long long and long or long and int are often the same size ) .
Otherwise , if the signed type is larger than the unsigned type , in the sense of having more bits , then the unsigned value is converted to the signed type .
Otherwise both values are converted to the unsigned type which corresponds to the signed type .
Pre-standard K&R C used a different rule , but that is old enough now that we no longer have to worry about it .
What this rule means is that if you write portable code , such that you do n’t know the sizes of types , you can not predict whether the comparison will be done as a signed comparison or an unsigned comparison .
Therefore , the gcc compiler has an option - Wsign - compare .
However , this option is sufficiently awkward to avoid that it is not part of - Wall , though it is part of - Wextra ( the difference between - Wall and - Wextra is that the former gives warnings for which false positives are easy to avoid through simple code changes ; the latter gives warnings which are generally useful but for which false positives are harder to avoid ) .
There are good reasons to use signed types : they do n’t have odd behaviour around zero , so you can write i < limit - 1 without worrying about the case limit == 0 .
There are good reasons to use unsigned types for things like the number of elements in a container : you get the full range of sizes , rather than limiting yourself to only the positive half .
In particular , the C++ standard containers use unsigned types as their size .
Combining these two rules gets you in trouble with portable code .
The only reasonable answer I can see for portable code is to use - Wsign - compare and work around the many false positive warnings .
Go avoids these problems in two ways .
First , there are no implicit conversions , so you can never be surprised by having a comparison become unsigned when you expected signed .
You have to explicitly say which type of conversion you mean .
Second ,
Go intentionally discards half of memory , and takes the philosophy that if you want a container which can hold more values than fit in a signed int , you should write a special purpose large container .
Yesterday 's press conference heralded the end of Tim Geithner 's influence in Washington , DC .
He 's been rendered inert when it comes to policy - making .
Unless something changes , he will find himself in the frustrating position of holding high office but being unable to influence bureaucrats or lawmakers .
At least until November .
When he 'll be fired .
This afternoon , we stopped by CNBC's " The Call " to explain all of this to Melissa Francis , Larry Kudlow , and the gang .

RealtyTrac has released their monthly US Foreclosure Market Report today and its a mixed bag of results .
In other words , its like unemployment .
Its at a high level but the pace of increase seems to be abating .
In other words , with 3.9 million notices sent to homeowners in default , it is going to take a while for this inventory to clear out .
Here are the foreclosure metrics by state .
And a news recap :
foreclosure filings — default notices , scheduled foreclosure auctions and bank repossessions — were reported on 306,627 U.S. properties during the month , a decrease of nearly 8 percent from the previous month but still up 18 percent from November 2008 .
The report also shows one in every 417 U.S. housing units received a foreclosure filing in November .
Phyllis Furman over at The Daily News does a nice NYC - centric analysis of the results .
While foreclosure activity is rising , the percentage of homes at risk here – one in every 1,706 – is small relative to the rest of the country .
In November , 306,627 U.S. homes – one in every 417 – received a foreclosure filing .
That was up 18.4 % from last year , but down 7.7 % from October .
And Dan Levy at Bloomberg does a nice US foreclosure recap
Dec. 10 ( Bloomberg ) —
Foreclosure filings in the U.S. will reach a record for the second consecutive year with 3.9 million notices sent to homeowners in default , RealtyTrac Inc. said .
This year ’s filings will surpass 2008 ’s total of 3.2 million as record unemployment and price erosion batter the housing market , the Irvine , California - based company said .
“ We are a long way from a recovery , ” John Quigley , economics professor at the University of California , Berkeley , said in an interview .
“ You ca n’t start to see improvement in the housing market until after unemployment peaks . ” :
Statistical nirvana by default ( sorry for the pun )
ATHENS ( Reuters ) - A bomb exploded on Tuesday outside the Athens offices of JP Morgan , the second largest U.S. bank by assets , causing minor damage and no injuries , police and the company said .
Police cordon off a street after a bomb went off in the Kolonaki district in central Athens February 16 , 2010 .

The explosion is the latest in a series of blasts that have rocked the country since the police killing of a teenager in December 2008 sparked the country ’s worst riots in decades .
“ It was a time - bomb outside JP Morgan ’s offices at the second floor of an Athens building , ” said a police official who declined to be named .
“ The explosion damaged the door , furniture , computers and smashed some windows , ” the official added .
Police had cordoned off the area after a local newspaper received a warning call .
Ambulances and fire engines blocked streets in the upmarket central district of Kolonaki , where JP Morgan ’s Greek offices are situated , a Reuters witness said .
JP Morgan confirmed the incident and said there were no injuries .
“ No one was hurt , ” said a JP Morgan spokesman in New York .
“ The company is still gathering details about the situation . ”
In 2007 , the New - York based firm came under scrutiny by Greek investigators ’ after underwriting 280 million euros ( $ 382.2 million ) of structured government bonds which ended up with state pension funds at inflated prices .
JP Morgan , which denied any wrongdoing , agreed to buy back the bonds and reverse the deal .
Banks , foreign companies and police are a frequent target of leftist groups in Greece .
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack , the official said .
Urban guerrillas exploded a makeshift bomb outside Greece ’s parliament in January , causing no injuries and minor damage .
In other attacks since the teenager shooting , guerrilla groups killed a Greek antiterrorism officer and bombed the Athens Stock Exchange .
" I got released and the first stop I made was the three crosses in Gatesville .
I would always see them while on the rec yard and would pray and tell God that when I was released that would be my first stop .
I 'll send pics of that if I can figure it out or maybe I can just send them from my phone .
I got home to my family and have never looked back .
I went to Texas Workforce and got into some classes because I got on foodstamps and they are required .
Met some really nice people who thought very highly of me .
We activated my resume on a Tuesday and Wednesday I got a call to go take a weld test on Thursday .
I failed that test but prayed God if this is meant to be please give me the strength courage and wisdom to pass this test tomorrow because I did ask to retake it .
They let me retake it the next day and I 've been working 48 - 52 hrs every week since then .
I was shopping with my daughter a couple weeks back and I got a phone call from my case worker at the workforce asking me if she could use my life story and nominate for an award through the state and I said yes of course .
She called last week and told me I had won the nomination .
My mother and daughter will be joining me this Friday at the banquet to see me be formally presented with the award .
I also have a chance to win a new car and that would be nice ... whoop whoop !!
I go to church and take my family because we all know that God has his hands in this .
I could not have done this on my own .
I do n't have a desire to get high and that is something I prayed for the whole time I was locked up .
I 'm high on life and today I 'm grateful for the little things in life .
So that 's where I 'm at today and I thank you and Mark for believing that I was worth it !! "
Approach
From Conrad Kain
Hut , ascend the moraine to the right side of the Crescent Glacier , then walk the glacier ( It 's almost flat . ) to its head under the Bugaboo - Crescent saddle .
This part of the glacier is so flat , it 's almost devoid of crevasses .
Almost .
I have n't seen climbers rope up for glacier travel on this approach , but accidents have happened .
Climb class 3 to the saddle , turn left and walk and climb easy rock to the large , rubbly ledge that crosses the ridge .
Enjoy the views of the Vowell Group to the north while you dig the rock gear out of your pack .
Route Description
Begin on steep , clean flakes just left of the crest , and climb to the top of the flake / pedestal to belay .
Descend left to flakes that take you up and out onto the E. face for the second pitch .
From the top of the flake system , catch a fat , white quartz sill that takes you up and right around the ridge crest , then climb up to belay at a roomy ledge .
The fourth pitch starts up a clean finger crack that 50 Classic Climbs calls the crux .
( I thought the quartz sill just passed was trickier . )
Pitches 5 & 6 are actually in a blocky gully right in the crest .
Straightforward and enjoyable .
As the ridge levels off it 's still sharp , so there 's no routefinding involved until near the summit .
The distracting views are the main difficult .
Green and Benson say you 've climbed 10 pitches when you reach the boulder that blocks the ridge .
Find the anchor at your feet and rappel the left ( E ) side about 20 feet ( 6 m ) to a rubbly ledge .
Carefully follow the ledge to just below the summit and tunnel up between blocks .
Descnd by downclimbing to the slabs that take you to the South summit , then descend the Kain route .
Essential Gear
Miscellaneous Info
Carry a full rack for sustained free technical climbing on clean , solid rock .
Include longer slings to reduce rope drag .
In June you can probably get to the start of the route without an ice axe , but you 'll need it descending from the Bugaboo - Snowpatch col .
Later in Summer you 'll need crampons .
You 've probably figured out by now that you 're not caching any gear the the start of the route .
If you climb well in lightweight trail boots you may be able to wear them the whole way and not have to carry boots in your pack .
The Kain route has some solid rock , but much of it will be hiking down steep rubbly slopes .
Wear a helmet .
Bring clothes for storms .
I 've been hit by snow below 9,500 ' ( 2,900 m ) in high summer .
When descending the Crescent Glacier after your climb , stay away from Snowpatch unless you 're roped and prepared for crevasse rescue .
Thirty - one years ago this week , Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran after 15 years in exile .
The anniversary is usually marked by triumphant rallies .
Not this time : protesters are planning mass demonstrations against a regime they say has betrayed Islamic ideals .
For three decades , the image of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini arriving on Iranian soil to a tumultuous homecoming after 15 years in exile has been a centrepiece of Iran 's revolutionary iconography .
It is an event best captured in a famous picture of the late spiritual leader being gently led down the steps of an Air France jet by a man dressed as a pilot or an air steward .
The picture embodies the heady mixture of pride , compassion and religious hero - worship the revolution is supposed to evoke among Iranians .
Khomeini was returning to be hailed as a saviour by his fellow countrymen after a wave of popular uprisings that had toppled the regime of the western - backed shah , Mohammad Reza Pahlavi .
His guide was playing a mere walk - on part in the historic drama that engulfed Iran that day in February 1979 .
But last week , at the start of the annual Fajr festivities marking the revolution 's anniversary , that image was the subject of a strange story that seemed symptomatic of the increasing uncertainty surrounding the country 's revolutionary legacy , amid the continuing turmoil over President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's disputed re-election .
The Islamic Revolution Documentation Centre , a state body linked to a pro-government MP , claimed on its website to have traced Khomeini 's chaperone as one Gerard Jean Fabian - Bataouche , who it said was living almost destitute in Tehran .
The report , based on an interview with Fabian - Bataouche , described him as a former French policeman of Algerian origin who had been Khomeini 's personal bodyguard while he was living in the village of Neauphle - le - Château , outside Paris , waiting for the shah to fall in the months before the revolution .
Having taken a liking to the man after learning that he had an Iranian wife and spoke Farsi , Khomeini had invited him to be on board his triumphant flight to Tehran .
Fabian - Bataouche had remained in Iran afterwards but had fallen on hard times .
He was said to be homeless and forced to flit from one friend to another in an endless quest for a place to sleep .
It seemed an improbably shabby postscript to an association with the ­revolution 's founding father .
Predictably , the story was immediately denounced as a hoax and within a day , the Islamic Revolution Documentation Centre removed it , citing " serious doubts " about Fabian - Bataouche 's authenticity .
True or false , the fact such a tale even saw the light of day betrayed an uncharacteristic lack of official sure - footedness as the revolution approaches its 31st anniversary .
The prospect of revolutionary festivities is usually a cause for triumphalism among the Islamic republic 's establishment .
Instead , with the storm over Ahmadinejad 's hotly disputed poll victory last June refusing to abate , it appears to be making them jumpy .
That was evident last Sunday when Iran 's ambassador to France , Mehdi Mir Abu Talebi , was involved in an unseemly scuffle with French police as he arrived on an annual pilgrimage to Neauphle - le - Château .
Angered by the presence of anti-government demonstrators , Abu Talebi had to be restrained by police officers , after allegedly punching one of them in the chest , according to one account .
He was said to have been released only after a colleague told police that he had diplomatic immunity .
Such nervousness will be even more apparent this Thursday when the country 's leaders gather to mark the revolution 's final triumph , when the shah 's armed forces declared themselves neutral and allowed Khomeini 's followers to take control .
Previous anniversaries have been marked by triumphant mass rallies in front of Tehran 's Azadi monument .
By contrast , this year 's event threatens to be a bloody battleground witnessing a re-enactment of the extreme violence between security forces and opposition supporters that has marked several state - sanctioned public gatherings since Ahmadinejad 's allegedly fraudulent election victory , which has been the trigger for a cycle of anti-regime protest .
At least eight people – and possibly more – were killed when government forces fired on protesters in Tehran and other cities during the Shia Ashura ceremony in December .
The scene for renewed confrontation was set last week when the two leaders of the opposition Green Movement , Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , urged their followers to turn out in force on Thursday to protest against the brutal crackdown that has seen at least 80 people killed , thousands arrested and two executed for being part of what regime hardliners describe as " sedition " .
Another nine have been given death sentences after being convicted of moharebeh ( " fighting against God " ) .
The government has vowed to suppress further protests with even greater force than before , while a hardline cleric , Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati , secretary of the powerful guardian council , has called for more executions to deter further protests .
" There is no room for Islamic mercy , " Jannati told a recent Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University .
At the heart of such confrontational rhetoric is a battle for the very soul of the revolution and what it was designed to achieve .
While supporters of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , swear loyalty to the concept of velayat -e faqih ( leadership by an Islamic jurisprudence ) devised by him , Mousavi and Karroubi have been suggesting with increasing boldness that the revolution has failed to free Iranians from tyranny .
In fact , they claim , " leadership " by an Islamic jurisprudence has merely instituted a new form of political bondage .
Last week , in an unusually hard - hitting interview on his website , Kalemeh , Mousavi – who served as prime minister under Khomeini in the 1980s – accused the authorities of filling the prisons with " the most sincere and devoted sons of this nation " and warned that the Islamic regime was in danger of becoming a worse dictatorship than the shah 's regime .
" Dictatorships in the name of religion are the worst kind of dictatorships , " he said .
" In the first years of the revolution , people were convinced the revolution had completely destroyed all those structures through which despotism and dictatorships could be recreated , " Mousavi went on .
" I was one of the people who believed this .
But today , I do not believe it any more .
Today , we can identify those very structures that have led to despotism …
Therefore I do n't believe that the Islamic revolution has achieved its goals . "
To Khamenei , who succeeded Khomeini as leader on the latter 's death in 1989 , such talk is tantamount to heresy .
Having publicly endorsed Ahmadinejad 's tainted election victory , Khamenei has committed himself to a course of depicting the Green Movement as puppets of a western - backed conspiracy bent on toppling the Islamic system in a " velvet revolution " .
In recent weeks , Mousavi and Karroubi had tried to bridge the schism between them and Khamenei by hinting at a compromise that would head off a final cataclysmic confrontation .
They had called for changes guaranteeing free elections , a free press and the freedom to demonstrate , while demanding the unconditional release of all political prisoners .
Crucially , in a step that implies acceptance of Ahmadinejad 's tenure as president – at least for now – they had also demanded that the government be held " accountable " for its actions .
But these olive branches were offered before Mousavi 's latest statement , which further sharpened the divisions .
In this battle of wills , each side presents itself as the heir to Khomeini 's legacy .
The " imam " , as he is called in Iran 's revolutionary lexicon , is revered for basing his movement on five pillars : people 's sovereignty , freedom , independence , social justice for the weak and deprived , and Islam .
Mousavi and Karroubi – protesting fealty to the Islamic republic formed in Khomeini 's name and anxious not to be associated with more radical calls for a secular state – insist that their demands would have met with the revolutionary leader 's approval .
But others who were present at the Islamic republic 's creation take a less sanguine view .
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr , the Islamic republic 's first president , who fled Iran in 1981 after Khomeini ordered parliament to impeach him , says the late ayatollah would have approved of Khamenei 's confrontational approach to the would - be reformers .
" He would have said 100 times well done to Mr Khamenei because the very regime he established is being continued , " Bani -Sadr told the Observer from Versailles , where he lives in exile , under 24 - hour police protection .
" Khomeini 's aim was to establish and hold despotic power in Iran and this has come true .
Such a regime is now ruling and its official language is lying and violence , its mission is creating crisis and it considers the economy as something for donkeys .
Mr Khomeini considered things that way . "
The pre-revolutionary ideals expressed by Khomeini during his exile in France were , according to Bani - Sadr – who observed him at close quarters both then and after his return to Iran – mere window - dressing for public consumption , which he always intended to dump as soon as he acquired power .
He said : " [ Khomeini ] said several times : ' I said some things in France due to ­expediency but I do n't consider myself bound by them at all .
If required , I say one thing today and something opposite the day after . '
He had made a commitment in front of the world that he later very easily disregarded . "
None of the goals publicly set by Khomeini have been achieved , said Bani -Sadr , who vividly recalls the revolutionary leader being greeted by " a sea of happy , hopeful people full of trust " on his arrival from France .
Instead of transferring sovereignty to the people , as promised , power was invested in Khomeini 's brainchild of velayet - e faqih , whose survival depended solely on the support of clerics .
Another former insider , Mohsen Sazegara , believes the regime 's current hardline character was an inevitable outcome of the radical Islamist ideology that drove the revolution .
" The pillar slogans of the revolution were freedom , independence and Islamic republic , " said Sazegara , a one - time deputy prime minister and founder of the revolutionary guards .
" But the applied result of that revolutionary ideological brand of Islam was religious despotism .
As student activists under the shah , we all hoped to have an independent country that was modernised and free .
We did n't understand in those days that this could not come out of that revolutionary ideology .
The religious jurisprudence leadership in Iran set up under velayet - e faqih is a system that gives all authority to one man without any accountability , so very simply the result will be a dictator . "
Sazegara , who has been issuing nightly videos from Washington calling for non-violent protest in support of Mousavi , said another brutal crackdown against protesters at Thursday 's anniversary events could presage the regime 's collapse .
It would be the culmination of a four - pronged Green movement strategy aimed at delegitimising Ahmadinejad 's government , strengthening popular resistance , creating splits in the regime and paralysing the government through civil disobedience .
" If the people show on Thursday that they are n't afraid and come on to the streets , then we can definitely say that all these four targets have been met , " Sazegara said .
" If they start beating people again , it will lead to the final stage , when the regime can be overthrown .
" Nobody can foresee when the final collapse might happen , but it could take just an accident or a demonstration , and maybe the same thing will happen to Ahmadinejad as happened to [ overthrown Romanian ] President Ceaucescu . "
For Bani-Sadr , the regime 's demise is only a matter of time – and no new revolution is required to replace it .
" This regime does n't need a revolution to collapse , " he said .
" It is only left with one pillar , the clergy , and part of that is already broken , since many clerics have distanced themselves from it .
There 's no further revolution needed because we have n't yet given up the one of 1979 . "

THANK YOU , GOVERNOR

Former Navy SEAL , professional wrestler , and Minnesota governor , Jesse Ventura , recently launched a new television show on the truTV ( formerly known as Court TV ) cable channel .
The first episode debuted on Wednesday , December 2 , 2009 .
And the final episode of this season aired this past Wednesday , January 13 , 2010 .
Here is the official web site for truTV's Conspiracy Theory :
According to press reports , 1.6 million viewers watched the premiere episode on December 2 , which set a record for the network .
I was one of those viewers .
And I 've seen each of this first season 's 7 episodes .
Predictably , mainstream critics have universally condemned the series .
Linda Stasi of The Washington Times said the show is " Mindless , good fun and a hoot to watch aging action stars still taking action . "
Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times said , " Whatever truth is out there , it 's filtered here through what is arranged more as an adventure series than a documentary . "
First of all , let me state up front that I typically disdain " reality " shows .
The only ones that are any good are Les Stroud 's Survivorman and Bear Grylls ' Man vs. Wild ( and I really enjoy both of those programs ) .
The rest of the so - called " reality " shows are junk , as far as I 'm concerned ( okay , I did enjoy watching a few episodes of Ice Road Truckers ) .
Contrary to the rants of modern critics , however , Ventura 's Conspiracy Theory is not " reality " television or " mindless , good fun . "
It is better investigative reporting than anything I 've seen on ABC , CBS , NBC , CNN or FOX NEWS in a long , long time .
For the most part , the mainstream media have become lackeys and lap dogs for the established political order and the powerful potentates that control it .
Yes , I 'm saying it : we have a tightly controlled mainstream media in America today ( especially at the national level ) .
Reporters are told what to report ( or more fittingly , what NOT to report ) and how to report it ; and any reporter or journalist who dares to step outside the box will quickly be unemployed .
And for those of you journalists and reporters who are reading this right now , if you smirk at what I just said , why do n't you try it and see what happens ?
Anything that challenges the establishment 's order is totally off - limits .
Every reporter and journalist working for the establishment media knows where the " third rail " is -- and they avoid it at all costs .
And the cost is TRUTH .
No wonder the critics hate Ventura 's show : here was the first season episode lineup ( taken from its web site ) :
Week One : HAARP
Is it a communications research project or a doomsday weapon that can change the weather , shoot satellites out of orbit -- and trigger mind control across the globe ?
Jesse Ventura and his team head north to a remote region of Alaska to confront the military installation called HAARP .
Week Two : 9/11
Jesse Ventura steps into America 's most controversial conspiracy by challenging the 9/11 Commission Report and searching for evidence that the September 11th attacks may have been an inside job .
At the urging of victims ' families , he finds witnesses who claim the towers were brought down by explosives , the missing black box flight recorders were actually recovered and ground control knew the hijackers were in the cockpits before the jets took off .
Week Three : Global Warming
Whether global warming is real or not , it 's believed some people are using the issue to make billions of dollars , start a one - world government and control our lives , from the cars we drive to the foods we eat .
Jesse Ventura starts with Al Gore and goes far beyond as he uncovers the evidence that leads to one man thought to be behind the global warming conspiracy .
Week Four : Big Brother
Big Brother is watching and it's not who you think .
Jesse Ventura 's investigation of government surveillance on its citizens tears the lid off a nationwide program that is thought to turn local businessmen and office workers into spies , snooping on their neighbors and ratting on their friends in exchange for information and special privileges from the FBI - - including , some charge , a " license to kill . "
Week Five : Secret Societies
They 're thought to be a group of the world 's elite who meet once a year at a luxury hotel and decide how they will run the world .
It 's believed they plan to thin out the population through disease -- and vaccines .
Jesse Ventura infiltrates the Bilderberg Group .

Week Six : Manchurian Candidate
Authors and experts warn that forces within the government have revived a program that uses mind control techniques to turn ordinary citizens into programmed assassins .
This real - life Manchurian Candidate seems outlandish -- until Jesse Ventura searches for the evidence and goes face - to - face with a man who claims he 's one of the killers .
Week Seven : Apocalypse 2012
It 's believed that the world is heading for disaster in 2012 and the government is preparing to save and protect the elite -- while leaving the rest of us to fend for ourselves .
Jesse Ventura investigates claims of top secret underground bunkers being built in places ranging from the Nevada desert to the White House , including the largest , now under construction beneath a major metropolitan airport .
As one can easily see , each of these topics is a " third rail " to the vast majority of the mainstream media -- especially at the national level .
Yet , Ventura ( and truTV ) had the guts to tackle these topics head - on .
And he broached each investigation with a deliberate professionalism and dogged determination befitting a Navy SEAL .
As far as I am concerned , anyone who believes that there is no concerted effort -- no conspiracy , if you please -- by wealthy and powerful individuals to steal our liberties and turn us into slaves and serfs is totally not paying attention , or is in a psychotic dream world of denial , or is a compliant partner with the conspiracy .
How Christians , especially , can doubt the existence of a devilish conspiracy to trample not only our freedom , but also our faith , is doubly disconcerting .
Does not Scripture plainly warn , " Why do the heathen rage , and the people imagine a vain thing ?
The kings of the earth set themselves , and the rulers take counsel together , against the LORD , and against his anointed , saying , Let us break their bands asunder , and cast away their cords from us . "
( Psalms 2:1-3 KJV )
Christians , of all people , should be the first ones to join in fighting against the promoters and purveyors of this devilish New World Order that is wreaking havoc upon our country .
That so many of them are not is a stain against the Church - - of gargantuan proportions !
Did Ventura get every jot and tittle perfect ?
Probably not .
Given the depth of the corruption and cover up that has gone into the promotion and implementation of the matters discussed -- not to mention the limited time and resources available to Ventura and his small staff -- that he was able to dig up the amount of testimony and material that he did was absolutely amazing .
I anxiously await the arrival of the entire first season on DVD .
I suggest you obtain a copy as soon as they are available , as well , because this program will probably face the same fate as the CBS program JERICHO : swift cancellation .
The powers that be are adamantly opposed to the light of truth shining on their dark desires and draconian designs .
If you doubt that , get this :
" In a lenthy academic paper , President Obama 's regulatory czar , Cass Sunstein , argued the U.S. government should ban ' conspiracy theorizing . '
" Among the beliefs Sunstein would ban is advocating that the theory of global warming is a deliberate fraud .
" Sunstein also recommended the government send agents to infiltrate [ I 'm sure they already do ] ' extremists who supply conspiracy theories ' to disrupt the efforts of the ' extremists ' to propagate their theories . "
See the whole report here .
In the coming Brave New World currently being manufactured by today 's globalists , even believing " conspiracy theories " might soon be illegal .
Do you really think they will let patriots such as Jesse Ventura continue to awaken people to what 's going on ?
So , you 'd better get the DVDs while you can ( and if you can ) .

In Canada , we do tend to be a bit more liberal than our neighbours to the south .
But , while watching Discovery HD Canada , I was completely caught off guard by Hyundai ’s new advertisement for the Elantra .
Is it too hot for daytime TV ?
Are we finally getting with the times ?
Or is this just an attempt to stroke the stereotypical male ’s fantasies ?
Watch the ad below the jump and let us know what you think !
Over the years , Hyundai and other companies have made other homosexually themed ads – some successful and others total gaffs – but , it is refreshing to see some equality in automotive marketing .
At least , that is my own opinion .

A very fine essay by Metropolitan Jonah of the OCA on essential practices of the spiritual life can be found among the abbatial essays on the website of the Monastery of St. John of Shanghai and San Francisco .
It is worth the read – even worth printing out and saving …
An excerpt …
… One of the things which is so difficult to come to terms with is the reality that when we bear anger and resentment and bitterness in our hearts , we erect barriers to God ’s grace within ourselves .
It ’s not that God stops giving us His grace .
It ’s that we say , “ No . I do n’t want it . ”
What is His grace ?
It is His love , His mercy , His compassion , His activity in our lives .
The holy Fathers tell us that each and every human person who has ever beenborn on this earth bears the image of God undistorted within themselves .
In our Tradition there is no such thing as fallen nature .
There are fallen persons , but not fallen nature .
The implication of this truth is that we have no excuses for our sins .
We are responsible for our sins , for the choices we make .
We are responsible for our actions , and our reactions .
“ The devil made me do it ” is no excuse , because the devil has no more power over us than we give him .
This is hard to accept , because it is really convenient to blame the devil .
It is also really convenient to blame the other person , or our past .
But , it is also a lie .
Our choices are our own .
On an even deeper level , this spiritual principle – do not react – teaches us that we need to learn to not react to thoughts .
One of the fundamental aspects of this is inner watchfulness .
This might seem like a daunting task , considering how many thoughts we have .
However , our watchfulness does not need to be focused on our thoughts .
Our watchfulness needs to be focused on God .
We need to maintain the conscious awareness of God ’s presence .
If we can maintain the conscious awareness of His presence , our thoughts will have no power over us .
We can , to paraphrase St. Benedict , dash our thoughts against the presence of God .
This is a very ancient patristic teaching .
We focus our attention on the remembrance of God .
If we can do that , we will begin to control our troubling thoughts .
Our reactions are about our thoughts .
After all , if someone says something nasty to us , how are we reacting ?
We react first through our thinking , our thoughts .
Perhaps we ’re habitually accustomed to just lashing out after taking offense with some kind of nasty response of our own .
But keeping watch over our minds so that we maintain that living communion with God leaves no room for distracting thoughts .
It leaves plenty of room if we decide we need to think something through intentionally in the presence of God .
But as soon as we engage in something hateful , we close God out .
And the converse is true – as long as we maintain our connection to God , we wo n’t be capable of engaging in something hateful .
We wo n’t react …

The Creature that Runs So Fast it Goes Blind !
Posted by Steven Goodheart on March 26 , 2010 · 11 Comments
Beetles rule !
At least , beetles rule when it comes to the number of species .
Species of beetles constitute about 25 % of all known life - forms on Earth .
In the insect realm , 40 % of all insect species are beetles , numbering about 350,000 .
Every year , dozens of new species are discovered , and some believe the number of unclassified beetle species could be into the millions .
Beetles are classified in the order , Coleoptera .
This term , first coined by Aristotle , means “ sheathed wing , ” as this beautiful Maybug beetle illustrates :
Beetles comes in a staggering variety of forms :
But of all the beetles , my favorite is the ferocious and well - named tiger beetle .
Meet the Amazing Tiger Beetle
The tiger beetles is just as ferocious as it looks , and got it ’s name from how it hunts like a tiger .
It uses its huge eyes to locate and stalk its prey .
Once prey is spotted , the tiger beetle runs it down , pounces on it , and tears it to shreds with its huge sword - like mandibles .
Tiger beetles eat other beetles , flies , caterpillars , ants , grasshoppers , spiders and additional invertebrates .
And be warned : if you try to catch one with your hands , it will give you a very painful bite that draws blood !
( I speak from experience on this ! )
As fearsome as they are , these miniature monsters are some of the most beautiful beetles in the world , and often come in brilliant colors :
On Land , the Fastest Insect in the World
There are many bigger and stronger beetles than the tiger beetle .
What really sets the tiger beetle apart from other beetles is its speed .
In the insect world , nothing runs faster on the ground .
I can remember many a fruitless chase as a young boy in the Mojave Desert trying to catch one of these little speed demons .
The only thing faster on the dunes was the Zerbra - tailed lizard , probably the fastest lizard in the world .
So , just how fast do these little monsters run ?
Cole Gilbert , a professor of entomology at Cornel , worked with some American tiger beetles that ran about 1.2 mph or .53 meters per second .
That may not sound very fast , until you take into account the scale of the insect .
Let ’s compare the tiger beetle ’s relative speed to that of the fastest human in the world .
The Fastest Human in the World
For our comparison , let ’s use the fastest man in the word : Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt .
During the 100 meter dash , he has reached the astonishing top speed of 12.27 m/s or 44.17 km / hr ( 27.3 mph ) .
Since Bolt is 1.96 metres ( 6 ft 5 in ) tall , at top speed he is covering over 6 times his body length every second !
In other words , Bolt can run 6 bl / s. Pretty impressive !
But now let ’s compare Bolt ’s relative speed to that of Dr. Gilbert ’s tiger beetle .
The Tiger Beetle ’s Astonishing Speed Relative to Its Size
The species of tiger beetle that Gilbert ’s studied is 10 millimeters long , not quite half an inch .
At top speed , the beetle is moving 1.2 mph or .53 meters a second .
That means the little beetle is ripping along at 53 body lengths a second , almost 9 times as fast as Bolt in relative terms .
In other words , the relative speed of a human - sized tiger beetle running at 53 bl/s would over 240 mph !
Imagine a 200 - pound tiger chasing you that could run faster than Dale Earnhardt ’s race car !
But Dr. Gilbert ’s tiger beetle is far from being the relative speed champ .
That title belongs to Australian tiger beetle , Cicindela eburneola ( subgenus Rivacindela ) .
This amazing insect runs 1.86 m/s ( 4.16 mph ) or an incredible 171 bl/s !
To convert this tiger beetle ’s astonishing relative speed into human terms : a Usain Bolt - sized tiger beetle moving at 171 body lengths per second would be moving at about 1097 feet per second or approximately 748 mph !
This speed would break sound barrier at sea level ( 732 mph ) !
And it would only be a little slower than the Thrust SSC ( SuperSonic Car ) which went 1,228 km/h ( 763 mph ) breaking the sound barrier at a higher altitude .
[ Qualification – Yes , there is another Australian tiger beetle that ’s even faster in terms of absolute speed .
The species Cicindela hudsoni can reach a top speed of 2.5 m/s or 5.6 mph .
However , being a larger insect , C. hudsoni ’s relative speed is “ only ” 120 bl/s , which translates to a relative speed of “ only ” 520 mph , merely the cruising speed of a passenger jet ! ]
Of course , the land animal holding the absolute speed record is the amazing cheetah .
As I explained in a previous post , it ’s can explode to 65 mph in just 3 seconds , faster than a 660 horsepower Ferrari !
See : Drag Race — Cheetah Takes on a Ferrari !
The Tiger Beetle — So Fast It Goes Blind !
Clearly , whether you consider absolute or relative speed , the tiger beetle is one fast insect .
If you ’re a small insect and the tiger beetle spots you , and you ca n’t fly away or hide , you are doomed .
You are n’t going to outrun those ferocious jaws of death .
Unless … . the tiger beetle is running so fast he does n’t even see you , because it ’s virtually blind !
As Dr. Gilbert explains , “ If the tiger beetles move too quickly , they do n’t gather enough photons ( illumination into the beetle ’s eyes ) to form an image of their prey .
Now , it does n’t mean they are not receptive .
It just means that at their speed during the chase , they ’re not getting enough photons reflected from the prey to make an image and locate the prey .
That is why they have to stop , look around and go .
Although it is temporary , they go blind . ”
Imagine being able to run so fast that things go dark at top speed , because your eyes are n’t getting enough light and the visual info is coming in faster than your brain can process !
That , my friends , is fast !
When you consider the relative speed of tiger beetles , it makes sense .
If we could sprint to near the speed of sound in seconds , no doubt our eyes and brains would be unable to process what we saw too !
When I watched tiger beetles hunt on sand dunes in the Mojave desert , I was always amazed and puzzled by their stop and start behavior .
In a blink of an eye , they ’d take off , become a blur , stop in an instant , and then zoom off again .
It was n’t until decades later that I learned the science behind this interesting herky - jerky behavior .
The Summer , Look for Tiger Beetles !
Tigers beetles are found throughout the world , and there are more than a hundred species in the United States .
They typically live along sea and lake shores , on sand dunes , around dried lakebeds , and on woodland paths .
They are particularly fond of sandy surfaces .
This summer , keep an eye open for these amazing speed - demon predators .
Tiger beetles are n’t huge , but there ’s no mistaking their beautiful coloration , their bulging eyes , and those incredible jaws .
No beetle or insect on the ground will be moving as fast .
And when you see them stop and start in bursts of speed , you ’ll know why : these amazing beetles run so fast , they go blind and have to stop to see where they are !
If you ’re an insect being chased by a tiger beetle , you ’d better hope you can hide or fly away during that very brief blind period , because you ’ll never outrun this speed king of insects !

The government 's plan to reduce Britain 's £ 178bn budget deficit is not ambitious enough , the European Commission has said .
In a blow to Labour 's economic strategy , a report by the Commission warned that the UK was set to miss the 2014 - 15 deadline for reducing the deficit to below 3 per cent of national output .
The deficit is expected to hit 12.6 per cent this year .
" A credible time frame for restoring public finances to a sustainable position requires additional fiscal tightening measures beyond those currently planned , " said a draft report .
It added : " The overall conclusion is that the fiscal strategy in the convergence programme is not sufficiently ambitious and needs to be significantly reinforced . "
The government 's proposals envisage the deficit being reduced to 4.7 per cent of gross domestic product , but the commission warned that weaker - than - expected growth meant even this target might be missed .
The Conservatives seized on the findings to claim that their call for the deficit to be reduced more quickly had been vindicated .
The shadow chancellor , George Osborne , said : " The Conservatives have been arguing that we need to reduce our record budget deficit more quickly to support the recovery .
Our argument is backed by credit rating agencies , business leaders , international investors and now the European commission .
That is why we need a change of government to restore confidence in our economy at home and abroad . "
But ahead of next week 's Budget , the Chancellor Alistair Darling , defended the government 's deficit reduction plan and warned that cutting spending too early could halt the economic recovery .
" The chancellor 's judgement on the pace of this adjustment takes into account the need to support the economy through the early stages of the recovery , " a Treasury spokesman said .
" To withdraw support earlier and at the wrong pace risks wrecking the recovery - a judgement supported by the Commission . "
Ministers have pledged to halve the deficit by 2013 - 14 .
The small town of Longyearbyen is situated high in the Svalbard Archipelago - making it one of the most northerly human settlements on the planet .
It is , metaphorically , almost at the end of the world - a harsh environment that only the hardiest can survive in .
Polar bears outnumber its 2,000 citizens , and no roads connect it to any other community .
The only means of transport is by boat or plane .
One of Longyearbyen 's number is Kazem Ariaiwand , a 48 - year - old man from Iran .
He has set up business here selling kebabs to an appreciative clientele of locals and the occasional tourist - in temperatures that regularly plummet to - 30 degrees Celcius and where the sun vanishes entirely for three long months each year .
It is the most northerly kebab shop in the world .
This inhospitable location , some 300 miles above the northernmost tip of Norway , is Ariaiwand 's home because of an open - door immigration policy .
The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 states that citizens from all treaty nations shall enjoy the same right of access to and residence in Svalbard .
As a consequence the Immigration Act does not apply .

Ariaiwand left Teheran 12 years ago , leaving a job in a government - run publishing house because of personal circumstances which led him to believe his life was endangered .
After fleeing to Sweden and then moving on to Norway , he moved to Longyearbyen in 2003 after his application for asylum in Norway failed - although his son and ex-wife were granted permission to stay .
But Svalbard is not a utopian polar paradise .
Finding work and making a living here is difficult .
Because it is remote , virtually everything is imported , and the cost of living is expensive .
For Ariaiwand to stay , he needed a job .
After working in a grocery store , he hit upon the idea of selling kebabs as an alternative to local delicacies like seal and whale meat .
Ariaiwand bought a decommissioned US military field kitchen truck from Germany , which he painted bright red and opened for custom .
He calls it the Red Polar Bear or Roede Isbjoern .
During the summer months he is to be found most nights in the centre of town , but limits his business to weekends in the winter because of extreme weather .
The hope of seeing his son again sustains him through these hardships .
But intriguingly , he is not the only foreign national to live here .
Thirty - five other nationalities have also come to the end of the world to make Svalbard their home , including a community of 60 Thais .
In Polar Bear Kebabs , travel journalist Nick Maes follows Ariaiwand through a typical day .
We hear him recount his flight from Teheran to setting up shop near the North Pole and explore his hopes of seeing his son once more .
We contrast this vivid narrative with remarkable stories from some of Ariaiwand 's immigrant friends who have also sought to live in this frozen and all but secret society .

Using advanced tools to see the human brain at work , a new generation of marketing experts may be able to test a product 's appeal while it is still being designed , according to a new analysis by two researchers at Duke University and Emory University .
So - called " neuromarketing " takes the tools of modern brain science , like the functional MRI , and applies them to the somewhat abstract likes and dislikes of customer decision - making .
Though this raises the specter of marketers being able to read people 's minds ( more than they already do ) , neuromarketing may prove to be an affordable way for marketers to gather information that was previously unobtainable , or that consumers themselves may not even be fully aware of , says Dan Ariely , the James B. Duke professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke .
In a perspective piece appearing online in the journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience , Ariely and Gregory S. Berns of Emory 's departments of psychiatry , economics and neuropolicy , offer tips on what to look for when hiring a neuromarketing firm , and what ethical considerations there might be for the new field .
They also point to some words of caution in interpreting such data to form marketing decisions .
Neuromarketing may never be cheap enough to replace focus groups and other methods used to assess existing products and advertising , but it could have real promise in gauging the conscious and unconscious reactions of consumers in the design phase of such varied products as " food , entertainment , buildings and political candidates , " Ariely says .
What does a leading voice in America ’s fundamentalist Christian movement have in common with a leading voice in Jamaica ’s fundamentalist Muslim community ?
Calling for the imprisonment of homosexuals .
And sometimes their death !
Bryan Fischer , the director of issues analysis for the American Family Association , told his radio audience about why the state should force homosexuals to enter therapy , for the same reason it pushes drug users toward rehab : because they must be cured .
Now Fischer may not call this imprisonment , but he is turning the Bible for rationalization .
And in Jamaica , it ’s Mustafa Muhammad , head of the Islamic Council of Jamaica , who ’s been making the case for the execution of gays : Because Sharia calls for it .
Not that he wants Jamaica ’s gays rounded up and stoned to death ; that would only be the right thing to do in an Islamic state , not one like Jamaica , where reasonable people have decided anal sex should be punished with a 10 - year prison sentence .
But while these two men are calling for some radical “ solutions ” to the homosexual problem , they may not see eye - to - eye on all measures : Fischer has called for the outright ban of any Muslims serving in the American military .
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Connecticut lawmakers are considering a way to keep young people off the state ’s sex offender registry if convicted of “ sexting . ”

Sexting -- a contraction of “ sex ” and “ texting ” -- is the act of sending sexually explicit messages or photographs electronically , often between mobile phones .
Under existing law in Connecticut , sending or receiving messages that include nude or sexual images falls under the state ’s child pornography statutes .
Those convicted are put on a state sex - offender registry .
The proposed bill , which was being debated Monday by the state legislature ’s joint judiciary committee in Hartford , would reduce the charge from a felony to a misdemeanor when the sexting is between minors of 13 to 18 years of age who are in some sort of relationship .
“ At times , minor children do foolish acts without appreciating the consequences of their actions , ” said Rosa Remimbas , a Republican state representative .
Paul Vance , spokesman for the Connecticut state police , said no teens have yet been arrested in the state for sexting .
A 2009 survey conducted for the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children found that 19 percent of teens had sent , received or forwarded nude or nearly nude photos through text message or e-mail .
At least 15 states have introduced or are considering bills or resolutions regarding sexting , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
John Danaher , commissioner with Connecticut ’s Department of Public Safety , said the bill “ strikes a good balance between asserting the illegality of the activity while , at the same time , removing the age population from the serious consequences of being required to register as a sex offender . ”
The judiciary committee will next consider whether to send the bill on to the state ’s House of Representatives .

A Python programmer discovering the magic of itertools is three months from looking for a new language that better supports the functional style .
There is an observable trend in Python programmers that results in a reasonable section of them moving to functional programming languages .
This trend is encouraged by the Python language , and has a couple of temporal considerations .
Firstly the language .
Python has strong support for describing operations over aggregates .
Most programmers coming to Python are coming from other procedural and OO languages , and these languages at best may support a for each style loop1 .
The iterations of understanding ( and understanding of iterations ) follow a familiar path :
The new Python programmer will begin by writing programs that use the familiar for loop to process collections .
At some point the syntax for List Comprehensions will be discovered .
He will begin to write more and more code in this form .
Following List Comprehensions are Generator Comprehensions , and perhaps Generator functions and the yield keyword .
Eventually he will stumble across itertools .
This module becomes many Python programmers ' favorite standard library component .
This is the beginning of the end for his interest in Python .
Why ?
Two key reasons :
Python 's design and leadership prefer procedural and OO to the functional programming style .
While the language can facilitate it , the library and syntax do n't support it naturally .
Generators are a poor substitute for real lazy data structures .
You can do a lot with them , but you hit the pain points fairly quickly .
Secondly the temporal considerations .
Python is currently going through a major version change .
This fixes many warts and problems in the language , but requires projects to be ported to the newer , cleaner Python 3 .
Concurrently , Functional Programming has come to the fore in geekdom as an answer to difficulties with concurrency and expression .
Two languages in particular are well positioned to be an easy jump for an experienced Python programmer : Clojure , and F#. Haskell is also a popular choice with more academically minded over F#. Scala may be preferred by those who still have a strong attachment to mixing OO and Functional styles .
F# provides the familiar whitespaced based syntax .
It has syntax blocks for statement based - procedurally oriented programming , and a class syntax that feels very familiar to expat Pythonista .
Clojure is the other contender .
As a modern lisp for the JVM it provides a familiar development enviroment .

Dan Houser sends me a link to this paper , by Christer Gerdes and Patrik Gränsmark :
This paper aims to measure differences in risk behavior among expert chess players .
The study employs a panel data set on international chess with 1.4 million games recorded over a period of 11 years .
The structure of the data set allows us to use individual fixed - effect estimations to control for aspects such as innate ability as well as other characteristics of the players .
Most notably , the data contains an objective measure of individual playing strength , the so - called Elo rating .
In line with previous research , we find that women are more risk - averse than men .
A novel finding is that males choose more aggressive strategies when playing against female opponents even though such strategies reduce their winning probability .
I am pleased to see that studying chess data is suddenly a " trendy " way to do behavioral economics .
Admittedly one is dealing with an unusual group of subjects .
Yet the quality of the data is high and the stakes are usually high too .
Computers can be used to judge the quality of moves .

A cruise ship returned to Charleston , South Carolina , on Friday after more than 400 passengers got sick during a trip to the Caribbean .
The Celebrity Cruises ' ship Mercury ended a voyage marked by an outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness that sickened 435 of 1,838 passengers , said Cynthia Martinez , a company spokeswoman .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , Georgia , said the outbreak was the result of norovirus , which can spread from contact with contaminated food or drink , by touching objects infected by people who are already sick , or through close contact with people who are infected , the agency says .
Norovirus is a common cause of viral gastrointestinal illness outbreaks on cruise ships , the CDC says .
So far this year , three such outbreaks have occurred on cruise ships that docked at U.S. ports , according to the CDC .
And in 2009 , norovirus was the cause of two outbreaks on the Mercury , the CDC reported .
The outbreaks reported and investigated by the CDC infected at least 3 percent of the people aboard cruise ships carrying at least 100 passengers on cruises lasting between three days and three weeks .
The Mercury left Charleston last week for the eastern Caribbean .
In addition to sick passengers , at least 32 crew members became ill , Celebrity Cruises has said .
Symptoms included upset stomach , vomiting and diarrhea , the cruise company said this week .
The sickened passengers and crew responded well to over - the - counter medicine , it said .
A doctor and two nurses joined the cruise medical staff Monday to help deal with the outbreak when the ship stopped in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands , the cruise company said .
Guests who were in isolation during the cruise received compensation in the form of a credit to their onboard account , Martinez said Friday .
March 22 , 2010  --
The Secret Service is investigating two Twitter users who , apparently angered by the passage of the health care reform bill , took to the Internet Sunday to call for the assassination of President Obama .
" ASSASSINATION !
America , we survived the Assassinations and Lincoln & Kennedy .
We 'll surely get over a bullet to Barrack Obama 's head , " wrote one Twitter user , who goes by the handle Solly Forell , and identifies himself as a conservative blogger and " ' authentic ' African American . "
Soon after the first post , Forell tweeted another message actively encouraging someone with a " clear shot " to kill the president .
" The next American with a Clear Shot should drop Obama like a bad habit .
4 get Blacks or his claims to b[e ]
Black .
Turn on Barack Obama , " he wrote on the messaging Web site .
The Secret Service investigates any perceived threats to the president or calls for his assassination .
" We are aware of the comments and are taking the appropriate investigative action .
We respect the right of free speech , but in such instances we have a right and an obligation to ask questions and determine intent , " the Secret Service told ABC News .
' I'd Shoot Him Myself '
Another Twitter user who called himself THHEE_JAY and was identified as Jay Martin , tweeted " You Should be Assassinated !! @ Barack Obama . "
Martin , who is black , followed his tweet , writing " If I lived in DC .
I 'd shoot him myself .
Dead f***ing serious . "
As of Monday morning Martin had 1,575 subscribers to his feed and Forrell had just 321 -- both modest by Twitter 's standards .
Forell 's name is attached to several makeshift conservative blogs , Anybody But Barack Obama2012 and the Audacity of Hype .
Health Care Bill Prompts Assassination Threats on Twitter
According to a Google profile , Forell is also author of the blog Barack Obama Was an American Electorate Mistake , as well an upcoming " golf self - help book " and a work of fiction to be titled " The Organization . "
Both books ,
Forell said on his profile , will be published under his given name .
Forrel did not respond to email messages from ABCNews.com .
Soon after their posts went viral and were picked up by blogs and received messages alerting them that they would likely be the subjects of federal investigations , both men attempted to retract their statements .
" Let us all renounce the harsh rhetoric about POTUS , " said a tweet on the Forell feed .
" Several including myself have used inappropriate language .
Let 's remain civil ! "
" For the record , " said a tweet on Martin 's feed , " I NEVER said I would do harm to the president .
I simply expressed my anger . "
Twitter removed the offending posts from the Solly_Forell feed , but despite a statement from the company to the blog jezebel.com that the account would be dismantled , it continued to operate on Monday .
" We have removed this profile due to violation of Twitter 's Rules , specifically listed under " Content Boundaries and Use of Twitter " : * Unlawful Use :
You may not use the service for any unlawful purposes or for promotion of illegal activities , " Twitter said in the statement .
" It is against the Twitter Terms of Service to use the service to commit illegal acts .
Threatening the life of the president ( or president - elect ) is a federal offense under Title 18 , USC , section 871 .
All accounts in violation of our Terms of Service are permanently suspended and we report to legal authorities accordingly . "
Twitter did not immediately return messages for comment by ABC News.com .
The tweeted threats come on the heels of increasingly - heated rhetoric by some conservatives aimed at Democratic lawmakers working on health care reform , even as the Secret Service says threats against the president are declining .
On their way into the House over the weekend , protesters yelled racial and homophobic epithets at entering Congressmen .
Health Care Bill : Threats Against Obama
Earlier this month Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan told a House committee that assassination threats against the president had declined sharply since their peak during the 2008 election .
" We have a program area that is just dedicated to protective intelligence I believe we are very aggressive with it , " Sullivan said .
" Every day there is somebody out there that is looking to harm those people that we protect , and you 're right it could be a lone gunman it could be an organized group and we have to look at every single one of those possibilities . "

bet365 Bonus Code : Step by Step Guide
The whole procedure of signing up and using the bet365 bonus code is really simple and easy .
I completed the registration form within just a few minutes .
First of all , I needed to provide accurate information regarding some personal details like name , surname , date of birth , etc .
Once that was over I needed to provide some contact information like email address and telephone number .
I chose how to receive the offers , either through notifications , text messages or email .
I also had to provide my physical address , town , state , and postcode .
When I filled in all the required fields regarding my personal data , I got to the part where I had to choose my username and password .
In the last part of the registration , I needed to enter the four - digit security number .
The last step was to enter the bet365 bonus code .
Once the registration procedure was over , I made my first deposit in order to start placing bets .
Bonus Details
With every single promotional offer , there ’s a list of terms and conditions that must be met in order to claim the bonus .
Of course , these terms depend on the bookmaker and on the special offer .
The most important thing when it comes to opening a new account is the age and location limit .
Using any section of the bet365 website means that I accept the terms and conditions of use .
So I really read them carefully in order to see what are my obligations and how to play according to the rules .
Before registering with bet365 bonus code ( optional ) I read the terms and conditions of the bonus .
They are probably quite different and vary from offer to offer , but all these terms and conditions have one thing in common – they must be met .
For me , it was crucial to get to know the conditions because I ’ve heard so many times different stories .
For example , often you are able to find enticing promotions at some online bookmaker , and people start playing without even paying attention to the details .
But then they realize that these conditions are highly demanding and that it is basically impossible to unlock the bonus .
Fortunately for me , the terms and conditions for claiming the welcome bonus when I was registering , were rather reasonable , so I did n’t have any difficulties unlocking the bonus .
What ’s more , it ’s totally understandable that online gambling operators have these kinds of requirements .
It ’s their way of protecting themselves from money - laundry .

I had a bunch of MKV files .
These were ANIME episodes ( 24 in all ) .
The video was H.264 but was set to Level 5.1 whereas Level 4.1 is the highest setting that the Sony PS3 will play ( same for the XboX 360 ) .
These MKV files had 2 sets of audio ( both 2.0 AAC - LC with one in English and one in Japanese ) as well as English subtitles .
GOTSent was able to demux the MKV and create a MP4 file with just the English audio ( which is what I wanted ) and it changed the H.264 header to read Level 4.1 for PS3 compatibility .
It did this very easily with very little input from me thus making an otherwise manual process very quick and easy .
In fact after I did the first file and tested it on my PS3 ( to ensure that everything worked as it should ) I then did the rest of the files in batch mode ( folder mode instead of file mode ) and damn it did it all with almost no input from me ... amazing !
Please note that in this case I was " lucky " in that the neither the video nor the audio had to be re-encoded so really it was just a demux from MKV and a mux to MP4 but like I said it made the process easy and very quick without much input .
So in short this program saved me a bundle of time !
Now if re-encoding had to be done ... well I have n't done that with GOTSent and I 'm not sure I " trust " it for all that .
If I have to do any re-encoding I use XVID4PSP which is simply an amazing program for H.264 encoding ( and it supports MP4 and M2TS both of which are PS3 friendly ) .
Anyway a big thank you to the person or persons behind GOTSent !

Health Insurers Post Record Profits
Insurance firms rake in profits as they cut patients , an advocacy group says .
Feb. 12 , 2010  --
In the midst of a deep economic recession , America 's health insurance companies increased their profits by 56 percent in 2009 , a year that saw 2.7 million people lose their private coverage .
The nation 's five largest for - profit insurers closed 2009 with a combined profit of $ 12.2 billion , according to a report by the advocacy group Health Care for American Now ( HCAN ) .
" The outsized earnings are a vivid reminder that without comprehensive national health care reform , the gatekeepers of our broken health insurance system always will put the short - term interests of Wall Street before the needs of millions of patients and a national economy plagued by joblessness , " the report said .
A spokesman for the nation 's health insurers said their profits are reasonable and represent only a small part overall increase in health insurance costs .
The HCAN report attributed this year 's profits largely to insurers ' dropping coverage of 2.7 million people , who then moved onto public insurance plans such as Medicaid .
Under questioning from reporters , Richard Kirsch , national campaign manager for HCAN , conceded that insurance companies do n't bear all the blame for eliminating people from their rolls .
He said the recession induced many employers to cut back on benefits , including health plans .
Also , many who were laid off lost their insurance coverage and were forced to enroll in Medicaid .
Even so , insurance companies have also offloaded their most expensive patients by cancelling their policies and raising premiums drastically , Kirsch asserted in a Thursday press call .
Among the report 's findings on specific insurance companies :
Wellpoint increased profits 91 percent from 2008 while it chopped 3.9 percent of its total enrollment .
United Health 's profit increased 28 percent from 2008 , while enrollment dropped by 3.4 percent .
Cigna 's profit increased 346 percent and enrollment dropped 5.5 percent .
Humana 's profit increased by 61 percent while enrollment decreased by 1.7 percent .
Aetna was the only company with a drop in profit and a gain in enrollment .
The company 's profit declined by 8 percent from 2008 , and enrollment grew by 7 percent .
Lawmakers and critics who took part in the HCAN call said they were disgusted by the notion of insurance companies profiting while unemployment rates soar and more than 40 million people lack health insurance .
" How did they accomplish this feat in the midst of a sharp economic downturn that reduced wealth across the board ? " asked Rep. Rosa DeLauro ( D - Conn . ) .
" Easy .
They delayed payments to doctors , hospitals , patients .
They raised premiums , increased co-pays and deductibles . "
California 's largest insurer , Blue Cross , announced last week that it will raise premiums 30 percent to 39 percent for many of its 800,000 customers .
" Without reform , we 're going to continue to see double - digit rate increases , " Kirsch said .
" Without requiring that everyone 's covered , without regulating insurance companies , and without subsidies for people to make it more affordable , the data this year will continue unabated , " Kirsch said .
The health care bills being considered in Congress would impose regulations on insurance companies , prohibiting them from denying insurance or cancelling policies based on a pre-existing health condition .
Both bills would also require insurance companies to spend money from premiums on health care , not on administrative costs .
Insurance companies agreed to the deal because of a provision that would require most Americans to buy health insurance , which would increase their customer base .
Some say the health care reform movement stalled with the election of Republican Scott Brown to Sen.
Edward Kennedy 's old Massachusetts Senate seat , and President Barack Obama is holding a televised health care summit on Feb. 25 in hopes of bringing Republicans and Democrats together on some kind of agreement .
A spokesman for the insurance industry said health insurance profits " are well below other industries in the health care sector . "
" For every dollar spent on health care in America , less than one penny goes towards health plan profits , " said Robert Zirkelbach , spokesman for America 's Health Insurance Plans ( AHIP ) .
He argued that in 2009 , it was spending on hospitals , physicians and prescription drugs that " continued to soar . "
Indeed , a recent report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service ( CMS ) found that health spending grew 5.7 percent , reaching $ 2.5 trillion in 2009 , even though the overall economy declined by 1 percent .
The report pointed to increased spending on hospitals , doctors , and medications as major drivers in the rising cost of health care .
A sheriff in rural Tennessee has been accused of threatening a husband and wife by “ blowing their f—ing heads off ” and “ inappropriately ” touching the wife during an unwarranted traffic stop .
In a lawsuit filed in a federal court in Chattanooga , Shawn and Michelle Graham allege that a group of police deputies , wearing camouflage and not identifying themselves as law enforcement officers , stopped the Grahams ’ car in January , 2009 , pushed a gun through the window of the Grahams ’
Nissan and pointed it at the husband , “ sometimes tapping his head with the barrel . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The officers ordered the couple out of the car , and frisked them while yelling “ death threats and angry curses at the Grahams . ”
The Grahams say Sheriff Ronnie Hitchock of the Sequatchie County Sheriff Department personally carried out a pat - down of Michelle Graham , during which he “ reached inside the pockets of her clothing , making inappropriate contact with her breasts and groin areas .
Handcuffed in the back of Sheriff Hitchcock ’s cruiser , Mr. Graham was forced to watch this unconstitutional spectacle . ”
The lawsuit states that , even though the officers ’ search turned up “ no weapons , no drugs and no contraband , ” the couple were taken to a police station and strip - searched .
The couple were never charged with any crime .
The lawsuit further argues that the sheriff “ did not investigate or review ” the January 29 , 2009 , incident , even after it became apparent there were no grounds for arrest .
“ In fact , the Sheriff made sure his department maintained little or no paperwork about Shawn and Michelle Graham , referring to them only by the number given the jail cell he or she occupied , ” the lawsuit states .

“ Sheriff Hitchock failed to intercede and stop any in his armed crew to kill the Grahams by ‘ blowing their f — — heads off ’ , pointing rifles at them , cursing them , frisking them , jailing them and then stripping them , ” the lawsuit states .

The Grahams are suing under the federal Civil Rights Act for “ wrongful arrest , false imprisonment ” and “ gross invasion of privacy , ” among other things .
The defendants are the Sequatchie County government , Sheriff Hitchcock , and a number of deputies from nearby Van Buren County .

None of the Grahams ’ allegations have been proven in court .
Unlike his neighbors ' homes , Craig Cunningham 's house in Northeast Dallas looks abandoned .
The grass is dried out .
The concrete slab under the front door is lopsided and cracked .
The green exterior has faded to a toxic - looking shade .
Yellow Pages pile up near the front door , and the black mailbox is stuffed full .
Maybe the home has been foreclosed on .
That would n't be a surprise in this economy .
But no , that 's not the case .
Inside , the 29 - year - old Cunningham hunkers his 6 - foot - 2 - inch frame on a dumpy couch .
His heavy arms extend from his sides , palms up , so two Chihuahuas , Angel and Chuay , can curl under them .
Although it 's 10 a.m. on a weekday , he 's wearing slippers .
He leans forward to lift some paperwork out of a plastic tub on the coffee table .
The phone rings , and he answers with a soft voice .
It 's just a friend , and soon he hangs up .
He 's waiting for a particular type of phone call — one from a representative of a debt collection agency or a credit card company , whom he 'll try to ensnare like a Venus fly trap .
It 's not unlikely that Cunningham 's next call will be from a bill collector , since he 's between jobs — except for being in the Army Reserve — and owes $ 100,000 in debts .
While most Americans with unpaid bills dread the collector 's call , Cunningham sees them as lucrative opportunities .
Many collection and credit card companies , intentionally or not , violate little - known consumer rights laws , and Cunningham 's favorite pastime is catching them doing so and then suing them .
In fact , it 's a profitable side job .
Call it ironic , but the only house on the block that appears to be the foreclosed end to some sad financial story is in fact the home of one of the debt collection industry 's emerging and persistent threats .
Cunningham calls himself a private attorney general — someone who files private lawsuits in the public interest .
Debt collectors call him a credit terrorist .
Patrick Lunsford , who edits InsideARM , a trade magazine for the debt collection industry , knows the term .
" There is a sub - group out there that does actually advise people on how to bait [ collectors ] , " he says .
" That 's something that really gets under the skin of , well , obviously , collectors . "
Cunningham beats the debt collectors at their own game .
He turns their money - making practice into a financial liability .
He is a regular guy who has become a radical enemy of the banking system .
In 2005 , two foreclosures pushed Cunningham near financial ruin .
Like many Americans , he fell enchanted by the siren 's song of easy credit and borrowed more than $ 100,000 to bet on risky , high - yielding investments , such as stock in the now vilified sub - prime mortgage industry .
Then , while stationed with the Army in El Paso , he attempted to become an absentee landlord and got zero - percent - down sub - prime mortgages to buy low - income four - plexes in Houston and Dallas .
With the interest earned on his high - yielding stocks he was paying back his low - interest credit card debt ; now , he was using the mortgages to borrow even more .
Then , the bottom fell out .
Investors like Cunningham fell the fastest .
He sold his Houston homes , but his Dallas properties were foreclosed on .
The collection calls started .
He was running scared .
Desperation took him online in a search of anything that could save him from his own $ 100,000 in bad choices .
One afternoon while sitting on his couch in his El Paso home , he found a way to fight back .
He stumbled across hundreds of other distraught consumers like himself on credit message boards , each with some different version of the same story of bad choices and greed .
And , he found a new way to deal with his debt :
He could hide behind the law .
His new online friends pointed him to a number of federal and state statutes protecting consumers like him against overly aggressive and abusive debt collectors and a credit system stacked against the little guy .
If you knew your rights , he learned on the message boards , you were very likely to catch a collector violating them .
Then you could sue .
Cunningham armed himself with this knowledge , and the next time a debt collector called , the trap was set .
It did n't take long .
Cunningham had canceled a home alarm service with ADT Security after two months , and the company had billed him a $ 450 early termination fee , which he disputed .
ADT sent his account to Equinox Financial Management Solutions , a third - party debt collector .
The collection agency sent him a letter asking that he call back immediately .
He dialed , armed with a voice recorder .
" Can you garnish my wages if I do n't pay ? " he asked .
" Yes , " the voice on the other end of the line said .
" Can you put a lien on my house ? "
" Yes . "
Wrong answers .
Turns out ,
Texas consumer rights laws are some of the most consumer - friendly in the country .
And according to a federal consumer protection law , the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) , debt collectors are prohibited from threatening legal action that would violate state laws .
In this case , garnishing wages or putting a lien on Cunningham 's house would violate the Texas Debt Collection Act .
Cunningham knew he had a good enough case to file a lawsuit against the debt collection agency , and for his first lawsuit , he decided to enlist the help of a lawyer .
Two months later , he had a check in his hand for $ 1,000 .
" It 's like discovering fire , " says Cunningham , thumbing through the stack of lawsuit papers on his table .
He immediately started devouring as much information as he could about the three chief federal laws that protect consumers from collectors : the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act , the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ( TCPA ) .
In the next four years , Cunningham accused debt collectors of misrepresenting the amount he owed ( an FDCPA violation that entitles a consumer to collect up to $ 1,000 ) .
He sued over prerecorded and auto - dialed calls to his cellular phone ( a TCPA violation worth up to $ 1,500 per call ) .
He also filed complaints that agencies failed to investigate his claims that his credit file contains inaccurate information , a breach of the Fair Credit Reporting Act worth up to $ 1,000 per violation .
All told , he filed 15 other lawsuits in federal court without the help of a lawyer , earning himself settlements totaling more than $ 20,000 .
" Most people hear about the abuses that debt collectors do , but you just did n't hear about the second part of it , where people sue the collectors , " he says .
Cunningham is one of thousands of hounded debtors who are trading in their paralyzing fears and learning to stand up for themselves .
Americans as a whole owe some $ 2.5 trillion in consumer debt , according to the Federal Reserve , a figure that does n't include home mortgages .
Nearly four in five Americans have credit cards and half carry a balance , according to the Obama administration .
In 2008 , the Federal Trade Commission , the nation 's consumer protection agency , received more than 78,000 complaints against third - party debt collectors , 8,000 more than in 2007 , and early numbers for 2009 indicate the growth will double .
While the FTC gets the bulk of consumer complaints , today more consumers are fighting back with their own lawsuits than ever before .
In 2009 , nearly 10,000 cases under FDCPA , FCRA or TCPA statutes were filed around the country , mostly in federal courts .
That 's a 50 percent increase from 2008 , and an 83 percent growth from 2007 .
A cottage industry has sprung up to counter the flood of cases .
Two new companies now offer the credit and collection industries databases of repeat plaintiffs filing under the FDCPA .
The companies , FDCPA Case Listing Service LLC and WebRecon , offer something akin to a background check for collection agencies .
For example , if an agency received a delinquent account belonging to Cunningham , it could run his name through a database and learn he 's a repeat litigant ; then the agency could either close his account or sue him first .
Back in his dim living room , Cunningham returns to the pile of paperwork on the table .
His soft voice gets bolder when he recounts his war stories with the collection industry .
His 15 lawsuits include one filed in federal court against Alliance One , a third - party agency collecting on behalf of Verizon .
Alliance
One added a $ 50 collection fee and misrepresented the debt he owed Verizon , he says , which is an unfair practice under FDCPA .
Another lawsuit was over the collection of an outstanding bill from Time Warner .
The collection agency , Advantage Cable Services , failed to post a surety bond required by the state of Texas in order to collect debts here .
Plus , after telling them to stop calling his cellular phone with automated calls , they continued , so he sued and won around $ 3,500 , the industry standard for many consumer rights violations .
( Collection agencies frequently settle such lawsuits because that 's cheaper than taking them to trial . )
His debt with Time Warner has n't gone away , and he's in the middle of his biggest FDCPA violation lawsuit ever , demanding upward of $ 200,000 from the current collection agency .
Debtors , either because they feel morally obligated or because they do n't know their options , get backed into a corner by their creditors and believe they have to repay their debts , he says .
Not so with Cunningham .
" I do n't have to do anything but stay black and die , " he says , a small , smug smile on his lips .
Cunningham was n't always such a stickler .
As a kid growing up in Detroit , family time meant gathering around the living room table to play stock market board games .
His mother was a registered nurse , and his father worked for 25 years as a computer engineer for Ford .
When he was 15 , Cunningham met his " first millionaire , " as he tells it , still wide - eyed .
This high school teacher grew wealthy off the then - booming real estate market of the mid-'90s .
" He accomplished it through business and not sports , " he says .
" For me , that was where the light first went on . "
Cunningham , a high school athlete , dreamed of making millions playing pro football , but he was accepted to U.S. Military Academy at West Point , where a degree would give him a more grounded back - up plan .
The economics major also sought out an additional perk unique to West Point : stipends and absurdly low - interest loans .
In his junior year , in 2002 , Cunningham took out the maximum amount for a loan and dumped the $ 25,000 into the booming stock market .
" Everybody was making easy money , " he recalls , and the young cadet wanted a shot at making even more .
He spent hours on his dial - up Internet connection learning money - making strategies that capitalized on the cheap and easy credit of the times .
By Googling " credit help " or " increase credit score , " he landed on message boards on which posters shared how - to tips to boost his credit score and dupe major banks and credit card companies into giving him cards with credit limits around $ 10,000 and $ 20,000 at low interest rates .
He 'd borrow from the cards , invest the money in stocks with payouts higher than his interest rate and pay back the debt with the profits .
Cunningham learned on these boards that the credit card companies , banks and the credit bureaus worked together to determine not only your credit score but how much credit to extend you and at what interest rate .
Cunningham had no problem spending all the money anyone would loan him , but he needed to pay off some of the accrued debt to maintain his credit score .
He knew his military loan did not get reported to any of the three major credit bureaus , Equifax , Experian and TransUnion .
So , by paying off his credit card debt with money from that loan , he artificially maintained his credit score and continued to be approved for high credit .
Sounds fishy , but Cunningham did n't feel that he was taking advantage of the system , at least not anymore than the next guy or the brokers and bankers at the time .
" It 's their system , " says Cunningham .
" I did n't make the rules .
I 'm just learning what the rules are . "
Cunningham now had more than $ 100,000 in credit card debt , but he had a lot of money coming in as well .
He was a big - time shareholder in one sub - prime lending company , Nova Star Financial , and for three years in a row he saw dividends as high as 20 percent for his investment .
Any money he was making went right back into the system .
Those good times , of course , would n't last .
Not wanting to miss out on the easy money in real estate buying and selling , he bought two low - income four - plexes in Dallas in 2005 , using a mortgage company for the loan .
He put no money down , but the interest rate was high .
Then he got burned .
The four - plex 's seller was n't completely honest about the occupancy of the properties .
Cunningham 's scheme disintegrated within six months .
He was scrambling to make the mortgage payments at the high interest rate without any tenants .
He knew it would n't be long until he could n't make the payments and he would be foreclosed on .
Somehow , he did n't despair .
" I remember one day I just got pissed , " Cunningham says .
" I 'm running around trying to keep the ship afloat , and the banks do n't care . "
Cunningham had called the bank as well as the FBI to report the mortgage fraud committed by the seller , but nobody pursued his case .
" The regulators , the FBI , they do n't care .
So , why should I care ? " he says .
The Dallas properties were foreclosed , and his obsessively maintained credit score seemed wrecked .
Cunningham returned to the online credit board for help .
This time , however , he was n't looking to add an artificial shine to his credit score , he was looking for a way out of the ashes .
Cunningham discovered a whole other world of consumer - generated knowledge .
This was a rogue group of disgruntled consumers who were trying to save themselves and their credit by filing lawsuits when the collection industry screwed up the mechanics of debt reporting and collection .
What he found was an instrument not of repair or reconciliation , but of vengeance .
" All the conventional wisdom , all the right people say , ' Pay your bills on time and work with your creditors , ' " Cunningham says , recalling his thoughts at the time .
Yet he had discovered a new set of people who posted their credit reports on line and their successful lawsuits , showing how much money they won in settlements that simultaneously removed a bad debt from their credit report .
" I said , ' Maybe there 's another way . '
Again , just revolution .
I never even thought about it . "
The knowledge on these boards originated from consumers testing the boundaries of the credit system through their own experiences .
The nature of this information , from the beginning , was a mixture of anarchistic tendencies , vengeance and greed .
Now the wisdom of the boards has been distilled into an e-book published in January .
Debtsmanship was written by Steven Katz , a former New York debt collector turned consumer advocate , who now lives in Phoenix .
In 2005 , Katz founded a message board called " Debtorboards , " with the slogan " Sue your creditor and win ! "
Katz does n't believe that people are morally obligated to pay back their debts .
That notion was invented by debt collectors as a way to beat people into submission , he says .
" Bill collectors would love for you to send them a check and then explain to your kids because you have the moral obligation to pay your debt they 're not eating this week , " he says .
" But they do n't see the moral obligation to feed your children or yourself .
" People are brainwashed to think that paying a credit card is more important than paying for the necessities of life , " Katz says .
" If you 're in a position where you have to make a choice , my argument is food , clothing and shelter come first ...
Nobody ever went to hell for not paying a debt . "
" Fight back " is the take - away message from a visit to Debtorboards , which is intended to help consumers who wish to file lawsuits without the help of lawyers .
Debtorboards outlines steps consumers can take to deal with bothersome debt collectors .
For example , if a debt collector is only bothering you , you could send them a letter or sue them .
However , if you 're so far in debt that you see no way out but bankruptcy , then you can check out the board 's " frustrating the skip tracer " technique .
There , you 'll find tips on how to run and hide from a collector .
Another Debtorboards user is 29 - year - old Daniel Smith , who lives with his fiancé outside of Seattle , Washington .
Early in 2009 , he tried to obtain financing for a home , but was turned down by Bank of America .
He soon discovered that an old girlfriend had put his name on her bank account before she fell into massive debt .
He wrote angry letters to the bank , but nothing changed .
He sat down at his computer and typed in " Bank of America " and " Fair Debt Collection Act " and soon landed on Debtorboards .
" I spent hours upon hours upon hours on there , " Smith says .
" The big epiphany is I 'm a little guy but I 've got a voice and I 'm going to use it . "
Like Cunningham , Smith now armed himself with voice recorders and began keeping meticulous financial files .
His file cabinet grew quickly .
" I mean there 's nothing I do n't document now and that 's probably the best thing a consumer can do . "
Smith is an Army vet , an EMT , and a project manager for a construction company .
He does n't advocate stiffing the original creditor on the bill .
In fact , Smith will often pay the original creditor , but still go after the violating collection agency .
" The standard line from collection agencies is always , ' Oh , gosh , no , we never violate .'... For the most part , the reality of it is you can sit down and find violation in almost every collection attempt made in America . "
Cunningham insists that the court system ignores lawsuits over frivolous violations .
His cases , he claims , are built on true screw - ups .
Cunningham won his first lawsuit , after all , after a collection company threatened to garnish his wages and put a lien on his house , both violations of Texas law .
Although that first lawsuit was filed with the help of a consumer rights lawyer , Cunningham has been filing on his own since then .
Once he saw that the entire amount of the original settlement was upward of $ 3,500 , and he only got $ 1,000 , while his lawyer pocketed the rest as payment , Cunningham was motivated to go pro se .
" I remember seeing the $ 3,500 and thinking shoot that 's a lot of money , and I 'm only getting a grand , so maybe I can do a little better than that if there is a next time . "
Cunningham made sure there 'd be a next time .
A company was trying to collect on an outstanding utility bill .
They threatened to send this debt to the credit bureaus and wreck his credit score .
He ended up paying the utility company the money he owed , but sued the collection company because of how they threatened and harassed him for the debt .
The case earned him close to $ 3,500 .
He was fast becoming one of the most hated debtors in Dallas , and part of an especially loathed minority of debtors in the country .
Cunningham returned to Texas from a year of active duty with the Army in late 2007 , and moved to Dallas .
He continued filing lawsuits against debt collection agencies , and he became ever more active on the message boards , holding long conversations about the state of the country with his online pals .
In the meantime , he noticed that Debtorboards founder Steven Katz had created a new thread titled " The list you want to be on . "
Here , Katz reported that a new company had appeared that was dedicated to aiding collection companies scrub their database against repeat FDCPA litigants , like Cunningham .
Cunningham toyed with the idea of suing them .
After all , he thought , if they were working with the collection industry and the credit bureaus ( FDCPA Case Listing Service partnered with TransUnion in 2009 ) , then the companies sounded like credit reporting agencies to Cunningham , which would mean they would have to abide by certain credit reporting laws .
Cunningham wrote to FDCPA Case Listing Service asking for a copy of his credit report ( by law , a credit reporting agency must provide a consumer report if asked for one ) .
Instead of a report , however , Cunningham found a lawsuit against him in his mailbox filed in May 2008 in Atlanta federal court .
It alleged : " The defendant subscribes to and makes postings to a Web site in which consumers share information and promote litigation against the collection industry ...
The defendant has now conspired with others on the internet to incite civil litigation against plaintiff for the exclusive purpose of extorting money from the plaintiff . "
FDCPA Case Listing Service asked the court to declare that they are not a consumer reporting agency and not subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act .
To Cunningham , this was a clear attempt to silence him .
Cunningham filed a motion to dismiss the case .
For one thing , filing the suit in Atlanta was improper venue , Cunningham wrote .
They should have sued him in Texas .
Furthermore , since Cunningham had n't actually sued the company , the company had no valid reason to sue him .
The court sided with Cunningham .
WebRecon offers a similar but expanded service to FDCPA Case Listing Service .
Rather than only track FDCPA cases , WebRecon makes an effort to track FCRA , TCPA , and state and local cases , as well .
WebRecon is headed by Jack Gordon out of Michigan .
Gordon ran his own third - party collection agency for years until a spate of FDCPA lawsuits in 2008 forced him out of business .
He is familiar with Cunningham 's type .
" This is definitely , if I can use a really strong word , a cesspool , " Gordon says .
" The overwhelming majority of these suits are not pro se .
Now when you 're focusing exclusively on pro se , I think you 're getting into a little bit of a different area .
I 've spent time personally on some of the Web sites that a lot of pro se litigants frequent ... I would have to say they are far more radicalized element of society , and there 's certainly I think reason for concern .
" You 're dealing with somebody who 's looking for an opportunity .
They revel in either getting opportunities or making opportunities to try out everything they 're learning online .
That 's hardly an exaggeration , " he says , laughing .
" It 's really an experience spending time there ! "
Gordon may have a personal vendetta against Cunningham types , but so do others who represent the collection industry .
ACA International is the largest trade group representing third - party debt collection agencies .
Tom Morgan is the Texas executive director for ACA International and he believes that FDCPA lawsuits will continue to rise as more and more people in this economy can't pay their debts .
He views the agencies as a kind of indirect victim in the rising tide of consumer fury and desperation .
" While our members do get filed on from time to time , the FDCPA is so highly technical there are quote , technical , violations that can occur , " Morgan says .
" You know , somebody makes a mistake .
But there 's no intent , OK , to defraud people or to violate the law .
" Usually it 's settled because the agency says , Uh , we did n't intend to do that .
Our collector said the wrong thing and we fess up and say , ' I did n't mean to do it but I did it ...
" And this is where some of our members feel aggrieved in that because there 's a hyper - technical opportunity for a plaintiff 's attorney to come in , it is cheaper to settle than to fight it .
And sometimes they 'd really like to fight it because they do n't believe they are guilty , but it 's so costly , so they settle it . "
Thomas Stockton is on the executive committee of ACA International and also the founder and chief executive of a local collection agency , CMI .
( Cunningham is in the midst of an ongoing legal dispute with CMI , which picked up his outstanding Time Warner debt . )
" In my opinion there are two reasons why there are more suits being filed today , " Stockton says .
" You 've got the Internet sites ... And , it 's easy to file suit .
You can do it on your own .
You do n't have to have an attorney . "
Stockton says , however , that the better question is how many of the suits are successful .
The answer depends on how you define success .
Debt collectors point to all the settlements they are forced to make because it 's cheaper than fighting a frivolous suit .
To Cunningham and other pro se litigants , any payment is a victory .
" Does if make sense to spend $ 10,000 to win this suit or pay the litigant $ 500 to settle ? " says Stockton .
" Depending on the situation , it becomes a business decision at some point . "
Cunningham filed his lawsuit against Credit Management , L.P. ( CMI ) in August 2009 , claiming violations in the amount of around $ 200,000 — by far his gutsiest lawsuit yet .
The original bill for Time Warner was for $ 79.84 back while he was living in El Paso .
Cunningham admits he may have missed the last payment for the Time Warner bill .
Time Warner , rather than validate the bill , sent his account to a collection agency .
That was ACS , which Cunningham sued for violating his Texas rights , as well as federal law .
ACS closed his account , but the debt was n't forgiven .
Instead , CMI picked it up .
CMI started calling Cunningham 's cell phone with an auto - dialer , leaving prerecorded messages to please call them immediately regarding an outstanding bill .
Cunningham told them to stop calling his cell phone on the auto - dialer , but they continued , each call a violation of TCPA .
As Cunningham disputed the bill , CMI by law is also expected to cease collection efforts .
So every call was another violation of FDCPA .
Plus , to this day , CMI has not provided Cunningham with anything from Time Warner , he says , either a bill or a letter , verifying that he in fact owes anything , another violation of the law .
" I do n't really know if I owe it , " Cunningham says .
" If I do , send me a bill .
If they do n't want to send me a bill , I do n't think I need to pay 'em . "
CMI has countersued Cunningham , and even asked the court for a protective order from Cunningham : " Plaintiff Craig Cunningham ( herein " Plaintiff " ) has filed suit against a business , Credit Management , LP ( herein " CMI " ) , and twenty - seven ( 27 ) of its employees in their individual capacities , " reads the motion for a protective order filed in Northern District of Texas in December 2009 .
" Defendants move for a protective order to protect Defendants from the annoyance , oppression , undue burden and expense of objecting and responding to improper , repetitive and irrelevant discovery requests . "
In December , Cunningham was called in for a six - hour deposition , the longest he 's ever sat through , at which the lawyers printed out pages of his online comments to accuse him of acting like a lawyer .
Plus , CMI insists that they did n't violate any laws and that Cunningham is acting in bad faith .
Although the company already offered Cunningham money to settle the case , Cunningham refused , asking for much more than the " industry standard , " as Cunningham calls it , of $ 3,500 .
" If they do n't pay a bunch of money , if they do n't feel pain , they will not change , " he says .
A big win in his case against CMI could go a long way toward clearing Cunningham 's debts — if he ever chose to pay them , that is .
" I took outsize risks , and I got burned , " he says .
" When myself and some other fellow small investors were losing their assets , nobody cared . "
Up until now , everything was about making easy money for Cunningham .
Now , it 's about justice — or at least what he sees as justice .
" When you or I make a mistake , they say , ' Hey , tough nuts , be smarter next time , you know , bad luck , did n't work out for ya , " he says .
" When the fat cats on Wall Street make a mistake , they say , ' Oh , national emergency !
We 've got to bail these guys out . "
Since nobody has showed up to bail Cunningham out , he 's decided some of the $ 100,000 debt he once amassed will never get paid back .
" I already paid them off , " he says .
" The government took my money without asking me and gave it to the banks .
And since I owe the banks money , but they already got my money from the government , I say we 're even . "

The conservatives and republicans need to all abandon efforts to push their non-existent values / morals onto others because there are a lot of hypocrites within their ranks .
I feel pretty certain that Fuchs Noose and other conservatives in the media will not have one word to say on this matter .
They 're experts when it comes to acting as if something that happened did not happen .

Thanks , AGAIN , for pointing out what ought to be obvious .

I am so sorry for his wife .
I hope she 's getting some support .
Of course , funding for social support and shelters and such is WAY DOWN .
They are destroying what we 've built for the last 30 years .

Yeah , right .
Take your moolah out of the banksters hands , clear out your 401Ks and put the money somewhere safe , or invest in something real .

According to Greenwich Time , when his wife , Mary Margaret Farren , also an attorney , tried to serve John Michael Farren with divorce papers :
He tackled her and began pulling out " gobs of hair , " she said in the report .
He then began beating her with a metal flashlight and drove her to the floor under the blows ....
Bleeding heavily , she passed out and , when she came to , he began strangling her .
With his hands around her neck , she lost her sight and began searching for the panic alarm with her hands ...
Farren said , " do n't hit the alarm button , " but eventually she pushed it and the alarm began to sound ...
Hearing the alarm , " he went nuts , " and began to hit her again with the flashlight ...
As a result , Mary " sustained a broken jaw , facial fractures , lacerations to the back of her head and after being beaten into unconsciousness . "
Yeah , there 's your family values guy --- not live Rove .
No divorce for him .
He takes " till death do you part " real serious .
Of course , his lawyer has already come up with the " spin " we'd hear from the hard - right echo chamber , if we heard from them at all on this --- just " a tragic situation . "
Yeah , I suppose God made him do it to protect the sanctity of " opposite marriage . "

Furthermore , we hope they do n't try to disbar Farren over this policy difference between him and his wife .
Politicizing his belief that she should no longer be alive would just be wrong , set a very bad precedent for future administration attorneys , and put our nation at even greater danger from terrorism .
Well not only that but you'd be emboldening the crap out of all of Americas enemies all around the world as well .
Hopefully when this blows over Fannin can get a job at Cal Berkley .

Iraq Body Count : Documented civilian deaths from violence

Not to nit pick , Mitch Trachtenberg , but the " documented " death count of 94,939 to 103,588 is extraordinarily low .
A 2006 study estimated the number of Iraqi deaths at 655,000 .
A study performed at the end of 2007 estimated that Iraqi deaths exceeded one million .

Amen , Mr Canning !
I find it utterly impossible to believe " statistics " such as this , and I see red when I see the MSM mindlessly repeating such tripe ( lately and egregiously , all this utter manure about Guantanamo recidivism , but worst of all the 9/11 catechism : " On 9/11 19 Arabs hijacked four planes ... " and so on , a veritable catapultation of propaganda ) .
I imagine Zionists would squawk about Hitler killing 6 million , but they 're only telling part of the truth , as per usual .
He killed 15 million in his Death camps , never mind all the soldiers and civilians who dies elsewhere , it 's just that the 9 million " others " in the camps somehow did n't count - just as we get precise ( if jiggered ) numbers of American casualties but not even a vague estimate of Iraqis .
Disgusting .

LONDON —
The head of Britain ’s domestic spy service Friday defended his organisation ’s work amid an escalating row over claims it tried to cover up its involvement in torture .
Writing in the Daily Telegraph , MI5 director - general Jonathan Evans hit out at the allegation from one of Britain ’s most senior judges that the agency had a “ culture of suppression . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
In rare public comments , he said the accusation — which came in a draft court ruling relating to the case of a Guantanamo Bay inmate — was the “ precise opposite of the truth . ”
He admitted that British intelligence was “ slow to detect ” US mistreatment of detainees after the September 11 attacks in the United States .
But he added : “ We in the ( British ) agencies did not practise mistreatment or torture then and do not do so now , nor do we collude or encourage others to torture on our behalf . ”
In his harsh critcism of MI5 , which was removed from the final published court judgement but leaked out , Judge Lord Neuberger also accused the service of failing to respect human rights and misleading parliament .
Judges handed down the ruling Wednesday as they ordered the release of once - secret information about the case of former detainee Binyam Mohamed , which showed he had been subject to abuse at the hands of US authorities .
ADVERTISEMENT
The CIA had passed the information to British intelligence , and judges released it after Foreign Secretary David Miliband lost an appeal court bid .
The publication of the seven - paragraph summary showing Britain was aware of the US authorities ’ abuse , combined with the judge ’s criticism , has intensified a row here about MI5 ’s alleged attempts to conceal its collusion in torture .
Evans also warned that Britain ’s enemies could use the escalating row as “ propaganda to undermine our will and ability to confront them . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Ethiopian - born Mohamed — who came to Britain in 1994 seeking asylum — claims that in Morocco in 2002 he was questioned by people using information that could only have come from the British intelligence service .
Miliband disclosed Wednesday that police were investigating allegations of criminal actions by a British official linked to the case .
ADVERTISEMENT
Mohamed was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 while trying to return to Britain and spent nearly seven years in US custody or in countries taking part in the US - run rendition programme of terror suspects .
After a lengthy campaign by his supporters , he became the first prisoner to be released from Guantanamo under the Obama presidency and returned to Britain in February last year .
Further excerpts from Evans editorial :
As head of the security service , I know that the reason the Government appealed against the Divisional Court judgment in the Binyam Mohammed case was not to cover up supposed British collusion in mistreatment , but in order to protect the vital intelligence relationship with America and , by extension , with other countries .
We cannot protect the UK without the help and co-operation of other countries .
The US , in particular , has been generous in sharing intelligence with us on terrorist threats ; that has saved British lives and must be protected . ….
The United States does not have to share intelligence with us .
Nor do other countries .
The US government has expressed its deep disappointment at the publication of the paragraphs and has said that the judgment will be factored into its decision - making in future .
We must hope , for our safety and security , that this does not make it less ready to share intelligence with us .
There have also been a series of allegations that MI5 has been trying to “ cover up ” its activities .
That is the opposite of the truth .
People who choose to work in the service do so because they want to protect the UK and its liberties .
We are an accountable public organisation and take our legal and oversight responsibilities seriously .
The material our critics are drawing on to attack us is taken from our own records , not prised from us by some external process but willingly provided by us to the court , in the normal way .
No cover - up there .
Likewise , we co-operate willingly with the Intelligence and Security Committee so that it can fulfil its oversight role , which we support and which benefits the service .
Sometimes the ISC draws attention in its reports to aspects of our work that it believes fall short of what it , and through it the public , might expect .
That is right and proper in a democratic system .
One shortfall it highlighted in 2005 and again in 2007 was that the British intelligence community was slow to detect the emerging pattern of US mistreatment of detainees after September 11 , a criticism that I accept .

With little fanfare , an earthquake has rippled through the United States Climate Action Partnership ( USCAP ) .
Three significant members , two of them being integrated oil majors , are no longer planning the cap - and - trade ( aka , cap - and - tax ) game .
And if energy affordability and reliability is a metric , expect more companies to bolt .
Social corporate responsibility , anyone ?
After all , there is no climate gain from a unilateral U.S. cap by the alarmists ’ own math .
Here is the background .
According to its website , USCAP is “ a group of businesses and leading environmental organizations that have come together to call on the federal government to quickly enact strong national legislation to require significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions . ”
Others of a less charitable bent would characterize them as central headquarters of the U.S. Climate - Industrial Complex , a group of corporate rent - seekers ( the bootleggers ) , made whole by the environmental scaremongers ( the Baptists ) hell - bent on slapping the United States into a carbon rationing scheme .
Members of USCAP include AES , Alcoa , Alstom , Boston Scientific Corporation , Chrysler , Deere & Company , The Dow Chemical Company , Duke Energy , DuPont , Environmental Defense Fund ( EDF ) , Exelon Corporation , Ford Motor Company , FPL Group , General Electric ( GE ) , General Motors Corporation , Honeywell , Johnson & Johnson , Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , The Nature Conservancy , NRG Energy , PepsiCo , Pew Center on Global Climate Change , PG&E Corporation , PNM Resources , Rio Tinto , Shell , Siemens Corporation , and the World Resources Institute ( WRI ) .
It does n’t take a great deal of analysis to see who hopes to get what from cap - and - trade .
The environmental posse– EDF , NRDC , Nature Conservancy , Pew Center , and WRI – get their ultimate dream : control of the U.S. economy by environmental bureaucrats who can determine who gets to buy carbon permits , who gets to sell them , how many can be bought overseas , who gets to slurp from the giant trough of government permit sales , and so on .
It ’s not much harder to figure out what the corporations get , whether it ’s simply “ green ” bragging rights to use in commercials ( PepsiCo ) , or the hope to sell subsidized hybrid cars ( Ford and GM ) , or the chance to sell new thermostats to millions of houses and businesses ( Honeywell ) , to build nuclear plants , windmills , or solar farms ( GE , Exelon ) , or to get in early in the hopes of getting free permits from the government ( coal , oil , and other high GHG emitters ) .
Again , a sober comparison of social costs and benefits should get these ‘ greenwashers ’ to bolt .
Three groups that used to be on that list which you wo n’t find mentioned at USCAP ’s website are Caterpillar Inc. , BP America , and ConocoPhillips which have made a relatively quiet exit , stage left .
While the media is n’t covering this with the mad intensity that it covered Apple ’s departure from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ( Google : “ Apple leaves Chamber , ” 1.8 million hits ) , it is no less a ground - shaking event .
When you have major companies like BP America and Caterpillar bailing on the idea of cap - and - trade , you can assume that the writing is on the wall for the concept .
Despite the bravado of Senators Lindsey Graham , Joe Lieberman , and John Kerry , prevailing wisdom suggests that Nancy Pelosi could n’t get the votes to pass Waxman - Markey again , much less anything comparable .
And with Scott Brown in the Senate , and the 2010 elections looking something like a nightmare for Democrats , the probabilities of seeing an aggressive climate bill with a cap - and - trade element before the mid-term elections are slim to none .
Depending on how those midterms go , the probability could easily drop to zero .
Inevitably NOT ?
So much for the argument that all of us have heard for many , many years .
Get out in front of the issue … .
Get your seat at the table … .
It ’s coming ….
It ’s inevitable … .
The choice is cap - and - trade or a carbon tax … .
Well , that has not happened even with Democratic political control .
And pragmatic corporate America–even BP , which started the intra-industry civil war on the carbon question back in May 1997 – is having second thoughts .
But the Obama Administration sees PR value is promoting the mirage .
Reported E&E News ( sub. req . ) :
In comments to reporters at a State Department press briefing , Todd Stern , the chief U.S. international climate envoy , said businesses are together on the idea of addressing the climate issue .
“ Whatever the ups and downs of this process at any particular moment , there is only one direction that this process can go , which is in the direction of action to reduce emissions , ” Stern said .
“ Whether it ’s sooner or later , it ’s coming .
Businesses get that . ”
Really ?
Still , opponents of bad climate policy are hardly out of the woods .
EPA is still plugging ahead on its own plan to take control of the commanding heights of the economy , while various plotters in Congress are looking for a backdoor into greenhouse gas control through energy legislation .
But emboldened by the scientific controversies that have fortuitouosly spilled into the public domain and the political death of global CO2 mitigation in Copenhagen , new voices and institutions are coming forth to right the wrongs of a futile , ignoble crusade .
Even Al
Gore is n’t talking about climate change much any more : the newest commercials from his “ Repower America ” initiative talk all about clean energy and jobs , but climate change is n’t seen on the main page of the site , and solving “ the climate crisis ” has dropped to the third reason why we should switch to clean energy .
Let ’s hope that BP and ConocoPhillips donate enough fuel to Caterpillar to bury cap - and - trade so deeply it ca n’t re-emerge .
But , stay ready .
Like a vampire , cap - and - trade wo n’t really be dead until it ’s been staked through the heart , decapitated , cremated , and had its ashes scattered over running water .
That a good start on that may be the fracturing and fraying of the unholly business alliance that in the U.S. can be traced back to ….
Ken Lay and Enron .
UPDATE : 2/18/10
Add another two companies to the exodus roll : Xerox has copied BP America , ConocoPhillips , and Caterpillar Inc. in bailing out on the Climate Action Partnership .
So has Marsh , an “ insurance broker ” according to Investor ’s Business Daily .
The US Chamber of Commerce , undoubtedly still peevish over the massive fuss that the mainstream media made over Apple ’s high - profile defection over the Chamber ’s climate change stance , observes that “ USCAP ’s Tuesday press release “ misled the public by failing to disclose ” that Xerox and Marsh had left too . ”
None of this is surprising , of course .
As E&E reporter Joel Kirkland observed ( subs. required ) , “ The decisions by BP , Conoco and Caterpillar [ and now Xerox and Marsh , ed. ] underscore the difficulty in keeping broad business coalitions together in such a turbulent political and economic environment .
The direction of energy and climate policy is in flux in the Senate .
The Democrats ’ loss of a 60 - vote , filibuster - proof Senate majority , a 10 percent unemployment rate across much of the nation and the unclear path for climate legislation all could factor into shifting positions in the weeks and months ahead , sources said yesterday . ”
“ It ’s the natural consequence of evolving strategies , ” said Adele Morris , the policy director for climate and energy economics at the Brookings Institution . ”
Adele ’s right , but there are also more prosaic reasons , as the E&E article points out :
For ConocoPhillips and BP , the reason for leaving U.S. CAP has to do with natural gas and the extent to which oil refineries get the short end of the stick in the House climate bill passed in June .
Conoco said in a statement that by not renewing its membership , it can “ better focus its efforts on ensuring fair and equitable treatment of the transportation sector ” and concentrate on securing natural gas ’s role in any future energy and climate policy .
“ House climate legislation and Senate proposals to date have disadvantaged the transportation sector and its consumers , left domestic refineries unfairly penalized versus international competition , and ignored the critical role that natural gas can play in reducing GHG emissions , ” said Conoco Chairman and CEO Jim Mulva .
No matter how you look at it , the trend is obvious .
CAPs declining corporate membership is leaving behind little more than environmental groups and corporations engaged in blatant rent - seeking , perhaps because their businesses are not sustainable without federal largess and mandates to force some of their non-market - worthy goods onto the market .
The cost of the Iraq and Afghan wars is the budgetary " elephant in the room . "
It 's enormous and it's right in front of us , yet we do n't talk about it as we face our economic woes .
We do n't need to get into arguments about the wars to consider the burden war places on our economy .
President Dwight Eisenhower , one of our nation 's greatest military leaders , late in life , expressed deep concern about what he called " the military industrial complex . "
Eisenhower stated , " Every gun that is made , every warship launched , every rocket fired , signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed , those who are cold and are not clothed . "
During World War II , people were told that the war would require blood , toil , tears , and sweat -- real sacrifice , not just for soldiers overseas , but also for the people back home .
In contrast , for the current Iraq and Afghan wars , people were told they would n't have to sacrifice at all ; taxes would be cut , not raised .
President Bush told people after 9/11 that the patriotic thing to do was to " go shopping . "
Perhaps that was due to delusional ideology , or perhaps it was a trigger - happy leader who recognized that if people understood the true cost , the war would be unjustifiable .
What this means for Minnesota 's economy is clear .
In addition to the incredible sacrifices made by so many military families , Minnesota 's share of the cost of the wars now exceeds $ 5 billion for every two - year state budget cycle .
Think of the investments that could be made in our communities if the federal government invested that money in the states instead of in the war .
We could have avoided the layoffs of teachers and police and firefighters and health care workers .
Think of the investments in living wage jobs , the investments in nursing homes for seniors , the investments in early childhood and helping at - risk kids succeed , the investments in public infrastructure .
Minnesotans working to build a better future face growing setbacks :
Young people on the " six year plan " to get a two year college degree because they work two jobs to pay tuition .
Parents struggle to find a safe place for their young kids during the workday because of cuts in sliding - fee child care .
Employers unable to hire older workers because their pre-existing conditions would send the employer 's insurance premiums through the roof .
People with disabilities face shrinking state programs that once covered them .
Those setbacks occur because states are unable to help people get a fair shake due to budget problems .
It is time to press Washington to change its priorities away from war and into facing human needs in our communities .
The military budgets of all other nations of the world combined , barely exceeds the $ 693 billion the U.S. will spend on the military this year .
And the $ 693 billion does n't include the $ 42 billion for Homeland Security , nor the undisclosed budget for the National Intelligence Program .
Based on population , Minnesota 's share of total military spending , including the two wars , is almost $ 12 billion every year .
That 's two - thirds as large as our entire state general fund budget of roughly $ 17 billion / year .
Imagine what we could accomplish if we cut our military spending by half .
The savings would balance the state budget and make huge investments in education and community development .
President Eisenhower said , " I hate war , as only a soldier who has lived it can , as one who has seen its brutality , its futility , its stupidity . "
He was clear in his message : " This world in arms is not spending money alone .
It is spending the sweat of its laborers , the genius of its scientists , the hope of its children . "
Sixty years later , we can see that the endless war has a real cost here at home .
For the first time in our history , we are losing ground :
High school students today have a lower graduation rate than their parents ' generation .
Fewer young adults have access to health care than their parents have .
Today 's workers will be less likely to have a decent pension than their parents enjoy .
Eisenhower warned us .
In spending money on war , we are truly taking away the hope of our children .
If we care about our future , ignoring the economic cost of war is just as foolish as ignoring the human cost .

Labor groups furious at Democrats such as Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) are threatening to stay home during this fall 's midterm elections .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Unions bash Dems , warn of fallout
Labor groups are furious with the Democrats they helped put in office — and are threatening to stay home this fall when Democratic incumbents will need their help fending off Republican challengers .
The Senate ’s failure to confirm labor lawyer Craig Becker to the National Labor Relations Board was just the latest blow , but the frustrations have been building for months .
Advertisement
" Here 's labor getting thrown under the bus again , " said John Gage , the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees , which represents 600,000 workers .
" It 's really frustrating for labor , and a lot of union people are thinking :
We put out big time in money and volunteers and support .
And it seems like the little things that could have been are n't being done . "
The 52 -33 vote on Becker — who needed 60 to be confirmed — really set labor unions on edge , but the list of setbacks is growing .
The so - called “ card check ” bill that would make it easier to unionize employees has gone nowhere .
A pro-union Transportation Security Administration nominee quit before he even got a confirmation vote .
And even though unions got a sweetheart deal to keep their health plans tax - free under the Senate health care bill , that bill has collapsed , leaving unions exposed again .
Union leaders warn that the Democrats ' lackluster performance in power is sapping the morale of activists going into the midterm elections .
" Right now if we do n’t get positive changes to the agenda , we ’re going to have a hard time getting members out to work , " said United Steelworkers International President Leo W. Gerard , in an interview .
“ There ’s no use pretending any longer . ”
The biggest threat , of course , is apathy from a Democratic constituency that has a history of mobilizing for elections .
" You 're just not going to be able to go to our membership in the November elections and say , ' Come on , let 's do it again .
Look at what the Democratic administration has done for us ! ' "
Gage said .
" People are going to say , ' Huh ?
What have the Democrats done for us ? ' "
Kim Freeman Brown , the executive director of a D.C. - based nonprofit called American Rights at Work , acknowledged " frustration " with the lack of movement .
" I implore Congress to listen to the voice of their constituents who want change , and so far we have n't delivered good enough on that promise , " she said .
" To the degree that we do n't address these real bread - and - butter issues , we will have failed America 's workers . "
Gage warned that Democrats will struggle to energize blue - collar voters if they do n't score a few victories soon .
Union leaders say they will closely watch as a new " jobs bill " emerges to see if it includes more labor - friendly provisions or tax cuts for small businesses .
When you talk to labor officials these days , much of their animus is directed at Sen.
Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) , who helped filibuster Becker 's confirmation .
" Ben Nelson has got principles until you buy him off , " Gerard said .
A group affiliated with the Service Employees International Union , called Change That Works , had defended Nelson 's support for an unpopular health care reform bill in his home state .
But the Nebraska director of that group , Jane Kleeb , now criticizes Nelson for not allowing the Becker nomination to come to the floor for an up - or - down vote .
And Bill Samuel , legislative director for the AFL - CIO , accused Nelson of following a " double standard " since he had argued that the nominees of then - President George W. Bush should get up - or - down votes .
Another AFL - CIO spokesman , Eddie Vale , pinpointed Nelson , saying he had " let down " working families .
Nelson said Becker ’s stance on labor issues made him worry whether he would be " impartial " in making NLRB decisions .
But labor unions can’t pin all their blame on Nelson .
The failure of a wide range of union priorities has been deflating for the labor movement , which seemed destined to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Barack Obama ’s presidency .
And with unemployment hovering around 10 percent , special treatment for unions has only served to harm the movement .
On health care , unions found themselves in a defensive posture .
They worked in early January to carve out an exception from an excise tax on so - called Cadillac insurance policies , only to see the package fall apart , with recriminations about just the kind of back - room deal making they had engaged in .
Obama said he would push for greater unionization at the Transportation Security Administration , but it has n't happened .
Obama has pushed for education programs that have long been unpopular with teachers ' unions .
And then , in his State of the Union address , the president called for Congress to strengthen trade relationships with South Korea , Panama and Columbia .
The support for those trade agreements irked Gerard , the leader of the steelworkers union , who praises Speaker Nancy Pelosi but blames the upper chamber .
" Our problem is the Senate , " Gerard said .
" The only thing they can pass is the washroom .
I do n't want to tar Democrats .
Not all Democrats in the Senate are problems . "
The situation in the Senate became more frustrating when Democrats lost their 60 - seat supermajority with the election of Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown .
Brown ’s first significant vote was a “ no ” on Becker .
" I think you see how working people feel by how they voted in Massachusetts , " Gerard said .
" In Massachusetts , it was n't an anger that the government had done too much .
It was an anger that there had n't been enough change . "
Democrats are now scrambling to shore up support for labor unions , but they do n’t seem to have a game plan for more union - friendly legislation in advance of the midterm elections .
But Katie Packer , executive director of the anti-card - check Workforce Fairness Institute , said labor groups would have achieved a lot more if they had n't overreached .
" I 'm from Detroit , so the concept of labor overreach is not lost on me , " she said .
" What we 've seen more than anything is an attempt by big labor is to be especially greedy and grab for things that were n't achievable . "

TOKYO —
In the West , a somewhat condescending verdict on Japanese women has long been that they are too submissive and doll - like .
For close to a decade , the Japanese media have exhorted women to fight against this image by toughening up and coming into their own .
In the past year , however , that kind of talk has been increasingly fallen on deaf ears among some young women who actually aspire to look like dolls .
They are divided into two distinct genres : the increasingly popular “ Mori , ” or forest , girls , and the “ Ageha , ” or swallowtail butterfly , girls .
The forest girls wear layers of thin cottony dresses , thick tights and boots , unpretentious makeup and cloth tote bags , the intention being to resemble a handmade doll from some romantic , Black Forest setting .
Forest girls unobtrusively made their debut in the Tokyo pop culture scene last spring , although at first it was hard to distinguish them from the similarly clad eco girls .
But as the months went by the differences became clearer .
Forest girls want to be discreet and to obliterate sexuality altogether , while eco girls are natural , sporty types who back solid environmental policies and a healthy dose of sensuality .
An update pushed out on Saturday for the BitDefender anti-virus software will break 64 - bit installations of Windows XP , Windows Vista , and Windows 7 .
The update results in false positive detection of both Windows system files and parts of BitDefender itself .
Hundreds of users have been left with non-booting systems as a result .
A new signature update has been published that resolves the problem ; anyone still using the signatures from Saturday , March 20 should disable the virus scanning module until the new signatures are installed .
For affected users , however , the situation is grim ; every file on the system will end up being quarantined , leaving machines unable to boot .
To fix affected machines , the preferred solution is to download BitDefender 's rescue CD and move the files out of quarantine .
If this does n't work , there are further instructions for BitDefender 2009 and BitDefender 2010 users that should solve the problem .
BitDefender 2008 , however , has no solution available yet .
We ’ve all spent so much time and effort being worried about formal surveillance – all those street and lobby cameras – that we ’re in danger of forgetting how much we cooperate in surveilling and being surveilled online
New research suggests that 25 % of people in the UK suffer from some form of paranoia ( 1 ) , probably because of a combination of urbanisation , globalisation , migration , wealth disparity and the media .
So would it be right to assume that paranoia will worsen as we move towards complex personal surveillance , the result of the heavy use of social networking sites such as Facebook ?
While these sites are collecting data on their users , as my own research in Sweden illustrates , many of us are taking part in this on a seemingly voluntary basis , often unaware of its extent .
Formal surveillance means one CCTV camera per 14 citizens in the UK , or 200,000 such cameras in the city of Shenzhen in China .
But parallel to the traditional forms of surveillance , there is a new voyeurism , rooted in an appetite for peer - to - peer surveillance .
Watching friends , neighbours and colleagues for security purposes – and sometimes just for fun – seems to be getting common .
Take Adam ’s Block .
This was an open - access site webcasting a live video feed from the intersection of Ellis Street and Taylor Street in San Francisco for entertainment purposes .
But some in the neighbourhood did not approve and the owner of the camera and site were threatened .
“ Adam ” had to shut down the service for his own safety .
In solidarity , others from the neighbourhood installed their own cameras , meaning eventually to network the cameras and live - cast at www.adamsblock.com under the name OurBlock.tv , as an example of citizen surveillance .
The site , which says , it is “ empowering citizens to fight crime and save lives ” and called itself the “ a global network of webcams ” intended “ to make a difference in your community ” , aimed to have thousands of people and homes around the globe visually accessible via the web – voluntarily .
This is not a unique example .
Google Street View , launched in 2007 , provides images from countries such the US , France , UK , Japan and New Zealand and means to expand further .
Although Google claims that those who thought it a breach of privacy can request that images be blurred , most people remain unaware that their houses or cars might be on display .
On the internet , surveillance is commerce .
The number of Facebook users has soared , followed by MySpace and Twitter , much to the joy of marketers .
Online industries look for new trends , and respond by incorporating social networking features , such as personal profiles , into sites such as YouTube .
Perhaps the current social networking hype reveals a latent desire for a brother - to - brother fraternal gaze , or innocent “ friendly encounters of the voyeuristic kind ” .
We could see it as “ complicit surveillance ” ( 2 ) mundanely committed by the individual , but sinisterly co-opted .
With about 300 million Facebook users , a speculative value of $ 15bn and advertisers eavesdropping on every move of members , Facebook deserves special attention for surveillance in the net - watched society .
People use it for serious political campaigning and to post what they ate for dinner .
Many may object to Facebook ’s right to exploit user content for commercial purposes , but they go on using it for personal or practical reasons .
A generation welcomed into the world by fathers holding digital video recorders might not question so much whether others should have access to personal details , only who they are and how many of them .
Personal data outlives a Facebook persona .
According to the updated terms of use , you acknowledge that “ even after removal , copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Content ” .
Facebook ’s questionable use of user information did not go unnoticed .
The Electronic Privacy Information Centre ( EPIC ) announced this year it would file a formal complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission about Facebook ’s updated licences .
More than 40,000 Facebook users joined forces with bloggers and consumer rights groups to protest a change in the terms of use that Facebook had secretly implemented , especially its decision to grant itself broader rights to users ’ information , even after users cancelled accounts .
EPIC ’s complaint was supported by consumer and privacy organisations , and shortly before the official complaint was filed , Facebook announced that it would restore the original terms of use .
Currently , the terms include the clause : “ Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be available to others . ”
Although Facebook seems low - key over advertising , it tracks user behaviour , making note of which fan sites are visited or how long is spent on a shopping site .
In a heavily mediated social environment , what is private , what is public , and what is publicly permissible ( on the basis of consent ) are elusive and contested ideas .
But lines can be drawn quickly , and Facebook is the laboratory environment in which to test the limits of tolerance .
In 2007 it launched Facebook Beacon , which enabled members to see the net activities ( even online purchases ) of their friends .
Many users considered the application to be “ off - limits ” and the political civic action group MoveOn.org launched a campaign against Facebook ; it then switched the application to an “ opt - in ” programme and apologised to users .
Young users
Yet , the actual extent of commercial surveillance on Facebook remains murky .
According to their privacy policy , Facebook retains the right to collect information about their members from other sources such as newspapers , instant messaging services and blogs “ to provide you with more useful information and a more personalised experience ” .
By using Facebook , you also consent to have your personal data transferred to , and processed in , the US .
Users are not notified when and how their data is used .
In 2008 the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic , a privacy group , filed a complaint against Facebook for violating 22 ∞counts of Canadian privacy laws ( 3 ) .
The group also addressed vulnerability as many users in Canada are between 14 and 25 .
Most users , of course , accept Facebook ’s default settings without considering what this means in privacy and data storage .
While Facebook rejected the validity of concerns on the grounds that the sharing of user information is on a consensual basis , the report suggests that even if the users select the strongest privacy settings available , their information may still be shared more widely if their Facebook friends have lower privacy settings .
A survey suggests that 45 % of employers in the US admit to checking the social networking site profiles of prospective employees ( 4 ) .
The actual number might be higher .
The popularity of Facebook and the availability of personal demographic data have legal implications .
In Australia in December 2008 , Canberra area lawyers won the right to serve binding court notices to defendants via Facebook .
In the US , some schools and colleges now try to control content on their students ’ personal blogs or Facebook pages – some students have been expelled – raising serious questions about free speech .
We do n’t know if abandoning online social networking territory will be an option .
Because of global mobility and hectic lives , connecting with friends in a left - behind homeland or exchanging a few words with the next - door neighbour without leaving our sofa has advantages .
Even more so , as my current research in Sweden illustrates , for many second and third generation migrants who enjoy meeting family and friends online .
Much of the responsibility for raising awareness seems to fall on civil society and citizen groups ; web - savvy users have to continue a public negotiation process to control how we engage with technology and who uses what online , and to what ends .
In the absence of effective regulatory mechanisms to limit the data - surveilling activities of companies , using online social media can be risky .
The EU Commission warned this year that data - collection from such sites might lead to consumers being inundated with unsolicited advertising or their data being used by the governments in ways that compromise civil liberties .
With surveillance embedded in most aspects of everyday life from supermarket cards to website cookies , what matters now is not “ us ” being watched , but the information we “ leak ” ( 5 ) .
There is a complex , multi- layered interplay between the surveillant gaze – embedded in communication technologies – and in everyday personal communication routines at an individual level ; this is giving way to a new surveillance , where the act is consensual and guilt ( of convenience and pleasure with a cost ) shared .
Newer media technologies are restructuring the nature of information - sharing and communications on a day - to - day basis , with long - term influences we have yet to see .

Lawsuits from 14 states challenging the constitutionality of the new national healthcare law face an uphill battle , largely due to a far - reaching Supreme Court ruling in 2005 that upheld federal restrictions on home - grown marijuana in California .
At issue in that case -- just like in the upcoming challenges to the healthcare overhaul -- was the reach of the federal government ’s power .
Conservative Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy joined a 6 - 3 ruling that said Congress could regulate marijuana that was neither bought nor sold on the market but rather grown at home legally for sick patients .
They said the Constitution gave Congress nearly unlimited power to regulate the marketplace as part of its authority “ to regulate commerce . ”
Even “ noneconomic local activity ” can come under federal regulation if it is “ a necessary part of a more general regulation of interstate commerce , ” Scalia wrote .
The decision throws up a significant hurdle for the lawsuit filed last week in federal court by 13 state attorneys -- all but one a Republican .
The Virginia attorney general filed a similar , but separate suit .
The suits claim that the federal government has no right to force individuals to have health insurance -- a central provision of the new healthcare law .
“ By imposing such a mandate , the act exceeds the powers of the United States under Article I of the Constitution , ” according to the suit from the 13 states .
But this week , Obama administration lawyers pointed to Scalia ’s opinion as supporting the constitutionality of broad federal regulation of health insurance , and most legal experts agreed .
In the healthcare legislation , signed by the president Tuesday , Congress required virtually all Americans to have health insurance beginning in 2014 .
Those who fail to do so could be assessed a tax penalty of up to $ 750 per year .
Legislators argued that the “ individual mandate ” was necessary because it would undercut the insurance market if individuals could just opt out of having health insurance .
Freeloaders could wait until they were hurt in an accident or contracted a disease and then demand insurance coverage for their “ preexisting condition . ”
The court ’s ruling in the 2005 case , Gonzales vs. Raich , “ is an enormous problem ” for those who contend that the healthcare mandate is unconstitutional , said Simon Lazarus , a lawyer for the Washington , D.C. - based National Senior Citizens Law Center .
“ It clearly says Congress has vast regulatory authority over interstate commerce , ” he said .
David B. Rivkin , a Washington lawyer who is representing the 13 states , said the legal challenge rests on the principle that the federal government has limited powers .
“ It is a matter of fundamental principle in the Constitution , ” he said .
“ Ours is a government of limited and enumerated powers .
And there has to be a limit . ”
He also argued that the Constitution did not permit Congress to regulate health insurance , which has been traditionally under state control .
While the Bill of Rights put clear limits on the government ’s power to interfere with an individual ’s freedom of speech or free exercise of religion , the Constitution does not put clear limits on Congress ’ power .
Article I says , “ Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes . . . [ to ] provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States . . . [ and ] to regulate commerce . ”
Since the New Deal era of the 1930s , the Supreme Court has repeatedly said that the federal government can regulate almost anything that involves economic or commercial activity .
Several constitutional law experts said this week that it is somewhere between unlikely and hard - to - imagine that the Supreme Court would strike down the new healthcare law .
“ In my view , there is a less than 1 % chance that the courts will invalidate the individual mandate , ” said George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr , a former clerk to Justice Kennedy .
But some said the high court ’s conservatives could decide that the Obama administration and congressional Democrats had gone too far .
“ When it comes to the hot - button , partisan issues that divide Americans , precedent rarely dictates how the court will rule , ” said Adam Winkler , who teaches constitutional law at UCLA .
The “ court has already shown itself to be willing to break from long - standing precedent in major cases , and it wo n’t likely be deterred by such case law in a challenge to healthcare reform , ” he said .
Critics of the new health insurance mandate often claim the Founding Fathers could never have envisioned the federal government telling individuals that they must take an action or buy a private product .
That , however , is not quite correct , experts said .
As one of its earliest actions , Congress passed the Militia Act of 1792 , which was signed by President George Washington .
It mandated that “ each and every able - bodied white male citizen ” must “ be enrolled in the militia . ”
Hardly shy about imposing federal regulations on private citizens , the militia law said that each new recruit must show up within six months carrying “ a good musket or firelock , a sufficient bayonet and belt , two spare flints , a knapsack [ and ] a pouch to contain not less than 24 cartridges suited to the bore of his musket or firelock . ”
Winkler also dismissed the argument that Congress cannot penalize someone for “ doing nothing , ” such as not buying health insurance .
“ If you do n’t believe me , just ‘ do nothing ’ this April 15 when your tax bill is due , ” he said .

I made my first Blade Runner pistol when I was 18 , while living in Hell 's Kitchen , NYC .
I stared at the VHS version on pause and made sketches .
Put it together from toys and model kit parts .
It 's lovely and terrible .
( Years later the internet would teach me that the six dollar plastic gun I bought on Canal Street in NYC and cannibalized for the grip was created by Edison Giacattoli , a legendary toy gun designer . )

On a fall afternoon in 2008 , a 12 - year - old girl arrived home from school and discovered her father and 9 - year - old sister shot to death inside the family ’s Hollywood apartment .
Eighteen months later , the girl , now 14 , came home to an empty apartment Friday night .
She got worried when her mother did n’t come home from work , so the girl walked down to the carport looking for her .
There , she found the body of Karine Hakobyan , 38 , slumped in her Honda CRV , with a gunshot wound to the back of the head .
On Monday , a team of Los Angeles police detectives were trying to piece together the three killings , which occurred a few blocks from each other in Hollywood ’s Little Armenia district .
Detectives believe the killings are connected but declined to provide more details .
Det. Michael
Whelan stressed that police have no evidence that the victims were involved in criminal activities either in the United States or in Armenia , which they left in 2003 .
The father , Khachik Safaryan , had worked as a butcher in Hollywood , and the mother worked as a patient care service aid at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles .
Sitting in the family living room Monday next to a shrine of roses and framed family pictures , the girl tried to make sense of what has happened to her family .
She told The Times that Friday was a typical day – she and her mother exchanged cellphone calls throughout the day , and she expected her mother home by 8 p.m .
What the girl saw when she got to the carport horrified her .
“ I just saw blood , ” she said .
“ That ’s when I knew something was seriously wrong . ”

Now Miley Cyrus 's nine - year - old sister launches risqué clothing line for pre-teens
Miley Cyrus 's nine - year - old sister is set to raise eyebrows again with news she is launching a clothing line for children .
Noah , who is not even high school age yet , is teaming up with best friend Emily Grace Reaves , eight , and Ooh !
La , La !
Couture designers for the project .
The two youngsters will release the ' trendy , sweet , yet edgy ' designs in time for Valentine 's Day .
However , parents may raise an eyebrow or two at the grown - up nature of the slightly risqué designs .
Controversy : Miley Cyrus and little sister Noah spotted arriving at a recording studio together last week
They are creating ' versatile styles ' which can be worn with ballerina slippers or trainers , or paired with lace stockings and boots for a more rock and roll look .
The Emily Grace Collection will appeal not just to little girls - the line also has an exclusive Teen Collection available to a size 14 .
But whatever spin is put on it , some will see the venture as a little perverse .
Double act :
The youngster is set to launch a clothing line with actress Emily Grace Reaves , left , who starred with Miley in Hannah Montana : The Movie
Back in October , Noah caused controversy when she attended a Halloween party dressed in a black lace - up mini dress with PVC knee - high boots .
She completed her overly grown - up look with a face full of make - up and lashings of red lipstick .
According to CocoPerez.com , Reaves , who played Cindy Lou in Hannah Montana :
The Movie , wore one of her creations - a leopard - print mini-dress , lace tights and fingerless black gloves - in a promotional video with Noah .
Where to buy : LCBO
Price : $ 5.95/341 - millilitre bottle
Food pairings : Dark chocolate , wild game , mole sauce
The verdict : Drink a few and store some
Good things come to those who wait – even beer lovers .
While the adage obviously applies to people who enjoy fine Bordeaux vintages or single malt scotch , it might seem less evident that good beer can improve with time .
In a lot of cases , to be fair , it does n't .
In some cases , however , a year or two in the bottle can do wonders for a beer 's flavour ( the oldest brew I 've ever had was an 11 - year - old barley wine from Oregon , and it was stunning ) .
Just as you would n't stick a bottle of a lightweight wine such as a $ 10 sauvignon blanc into your cellar and get much improvement , you should n't expect much positive change from aging lighter beer styles such as pilsners .
Instead , again as in the wine world , it 's the biggest beers – those which are high in alcohol or heavily hopped – that tend to benefit the most .
Peering into a suds - tinged crystal ball , it seems likely that St. Ambroise Russian Imperial Stout is one of those beers that could benefit from some aging .
This potent , thick brew comes from one of the oldest craft breweries in the country , Montreal 's McAuslan Brewing , founded in 1989 .
It 's got a heady aroma of molasses , espresso and vanilla – the latter from the broken - down bourbon barrels which were put into the aging tanks with the beer .
The flavours live up to the aromas in the brew .
There 's also a bit of a burn from the alcohol ( this checks in at 9.1 per cent ) .
Unlike some high - alcohol beers , this is n't particularly sweet .
It also has an extremely bitter , almost acrid finish .
Some of that bitterness is from the dark roasted malts used in the brew , but much of it comes from the mostly - American hops used .
The beer is a tribute to the strong English stouts favoured by Russian empress Catherine the Great in the 1700s .
Those beers were also highly hopped and high in alcohol to withstand the voyage from England to Russia .
Brewery president Peter McAuslan , who came up with the recipe for the brew along with his wife and brewer , Ellen Bounsall , believes it will age well – not that he'd mind at all if people drank it now .
" I think it will become more subtle over time .
All the elements will come together into one package a little more , " McAuslan predicts .
In many aged beers , time softens the burn from higher alcohol , bitterness and aroma from hops can fade and the beer becomes a more well - integrated whole .
Given that this one is already a pleasure to drink , patient drinkers should be amply rewarded .
And , speaking of patience , it 's a brew McAuslan and Bounsall waited 20 years to make .
" We originally thought about making an imperial stout just after we opened the brewery , but we thought it might be a little radical for the market , so we did an oatmeal stout instead .
Now , things have changed . "

CAUGHT !
A NEW 9/11 GAME OUTED
By Gordon Duff / STAFF WRITER / Senior Editor
Today , John Avalon wrote a piece for the Daily Beast describing those who are asking for a new 9/11 investigation as “ wingnuts . ”
What he fails to tell us is that , as “ propaganda chief ” for Rudy Guliani , a man whose former chief of staff is now doing time as a Mafia “ bag man ” Bernie Kerik , burying the truth has long been a part of his job .
The prisoner in question , Bernie Kerik , was supposed to head Homeland Security .
Think about a character from the movie Goodfellas as the nation ’s chief law enforcement official and you have an idea where John Avalon comes from .
The only way of going further would have been to put the ghost of the “ dapper don , ” John Gotti himself into the Whitehouse .
Is Avalon another Kerik or just a “ Kerik / Guliani associate ? ”
Much of the 9/11 controversy centers around the mysterious collapse of Building 7 , never hit by a plane , a building Guliani is said to have been warned to leave before it was brought down by controlled demolition .
Larry Silverstein , the controller of the destroyed WTC complex , stated plainly in a PBS documentary that he and the FDNY decided jointly to demolish WTC 7 late in the afternoon of 9/11 .
In the documentary “ America Rebuilds “ , aired September 2002 , Silverstein makes the following statement ; “ I remember getting a call from the , er , fire department commander , telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire , and I said , ‘ We ’ve had such terrible loss of life , maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it . ’
And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse . ”
The problem with this story is that , according to literally thousands of engineers and architects , it would take weeks to engineer the collapse of a building like this .
Did Silverstein have a crystal ball or are all buildings in New York wired to explode , “ just in case ? ”
The 9/11 Commission was never allowed to look into Building 7 .
Guliani and Silverstein are people John Avalon worked with on a daily basis .
Avalon is a tool , an “ asset , ” but whose ?
Who profits from his story ?
When the 9/11 Commission itself asked for prosecutions of those who perjured themselves and presented false documents and have , quite frankly , stepped away from their own findings , a massive movement to reopen the investigation has grown worldwide .
Top intelligence officials , military officers , scientists and engineers , in numbers far exceeding any of opposing opinion , are clamouring for a new investigation .
It has become so powerful that the “ assets ” are coming out of their holes .
Avalon ’s approach is classic :
“ It is appropriate that Ahmadinejad used the phrase the “ big lie , ” first coined by Adolph Hitler in Mein Kampf to explain the psychology behind propaganda campaigns of misinformation .
“ In the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility , ” Hitler wrote , because “ It would never come into [ most people ’s ] heads to fabricate colossal untruths , and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously . ”
Avalon does n’t tell us what “ truth ” is being distorted but he drags out Hitler , Mein Kampf and the very suspect Ahmandinejad of Iran , a veritable “ kitchen sink ” of unrelated references in what is unavoidably part of a misinformation campaign almost exactly as he himself is describing .
Avalon is describing a conspiracy .
Who is the “ wingnut ” here ?
Exactly what group is conspiring together ?
Who is financing the “ 9/11 truth ” propaganda campaign that is part of the massive conspiracy that Avalon is referring to ?
What is their goal ?
So far , the “ 9/11 truth ” movement is what it looks like , people unsatisfied with the explanation they got , scientists , scholars , politicians , world leaders and a few crazy people , all loosely tied to one idea , finding the truth , a truth that key members of the 9/11 Commission have said is not in their report because of a “ criminal conspiracy ” to mislead them .
If anything , the “ 9/11 truth “ movement is the victim , a victim of smear campaigns and it is increasingly reported that their organizations , which number in the hundreds , have come under investigation by security agencies and their membership has been heavily infiltrated much as with the militia movements of the 80s and 90s .
After the Oklahoma City bombing , the militias disappeared .
It is claimed they had one last meeting .
It went like this :
“ We ’ve been putting this off for awhile but its time we faced up .
OK , I have a question for the membership .
Will all FBI informants please step forward .
OK , will all of you please step back where you were .
Meeting adjourned . ”
Avalon ’s article appears to be a small and very stupid part of the “ truth debunking ” movement , clearly tied to “ insiders , ” and there is no more of an “ insider ” than Rudy Guliani .
Is someone figuring that if we are drowned with enough baseless charges of conspiracy , the real conspiracies can go unchallenged ?
This is a very common “ psy- ops ” deception ploy meant , frankly , to be wielded by a greater intellect and with greater skill .
Do the terms “ truth debunking ” and “ obstruction of justice ” mean the same thing ?
We should think about this .
“ 9/11 truthers ” are n’t armed radicals and nothing is being threatened other than a “ cover story ” that fell apart years ago .
If the “ 9/11 truth ” movement is being investigated as a criminal conspiracy , as seems to be the case , using extraordinary means , even to the point of applying Patriot Act “ counter - terrorism ” provisions , what does this mean ?
Informants are being discovered in nearly every 9/11 group , some spouting insane theories , others advocating violence .
We call people like this “ agent provocateurs . ”
This is also a classic “ counter - intelligence ” practice .
Why is this being done and who is ordering it , financing it ?
It ’s happening , and on an ever growing scale .
Do we have two conspiracies now or is it three ?
Can anyone keep track ?
We certainly know Avalon ’s story is part of something , the smell is outrageous .
Is it a conspiracy ?
Does working for Rudy Guliani , now rumored to represent many of the world ’s most vicious dictators as a lobbyist , make people simply “ go bad ? ”
After dragging out Hitler , Avalon then went after poor and long dead Osama bin Laden .
While in Pakistan last week , meeting with Lt. General Hamid Gul , former head of the Pakistani intelligence agency , the ISI , and General Aslem Beg , former Chief of Staff , Army of Pakistan , along with Col “ Imam , ” coordinator of military activities against the Soviets , I was able to verify the December 2001 death of Osama bin Laden .
This was also confirmed at the highest governmental levels , the same folks that regularly brief our own government .
If you are looking for suspects , you are now safe to start looking at anyone presenting video , audio or other “ evidence ” of bin Laden or statements about bin Laden , 9/11 or terror attacks after bin Laden ’s death .
Anyone originating such information can easily be assumed to have been involved in the planning and execution of the acts being put off on bin Laden .
Thankfully , we know who these people are and can arrest and prosecute them as soon as we come to our senses .
Not only has bin Laden been dead for years but the CIA ’s own translation of bin Laden ’s tapes shows him denying all involvement in 9/11 .
What does Avalon do ?
He brings out the transcript of a long discredited “ phony bin Laden ” tape received from former Israeli Defense Force member , Rita Katz and her organization Site Intelligence , a group that downloads things from conspiracy sites on the internet , something Avalon must know alot about .
Here is what Avalon had to say :
“ Alternately , you can just take Osama bin Laden ’s word for it .
He ’s repeatedly taken credit for the attacks , including on a videotape where he recounts the planning process and his wish for maximum damage :
“ We calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy , who would be killed based on the position of the tower .
We calculated that the floors that would be hit would be three or four floors .
I was the most optimistic of them all .
…
Due to my experience in this field , I was thinking that the fire from the gas in the plane would melt the iron structure of the building and collapse the area where the plane hit and all the floors above it only .
This is all that we hoped for . ”
Of course , bin Laden never said any of this .
This is a fabrication .
Why would someone write something like this unless there was something to hide ?
Who teaches people to write like this ?
Did writing speeches for Rudy Guliani suddenly make a political propagandist into a journalists ?
Let ’s check Avalon ’s sources against the official record .
This is the CIA ’s version of the only verified bin Laden statements on 9/11 .
How does Mr. Avalon ’ story hold up ?
DECLASSIFIED TRANSCRIPT PROVIDED BY THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY FOREIGN BROADCASTING INTERNATIONAL
SERVICE : FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Usama :
In the name of Allah , the most beneficent , the most merciful .
Praise be to Allah ,
Who is the creator of the whole universe and Who made the earth as an abode for peace , FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 179 for the whole mankind .
Allah is the Sustainer , who sent Prophet Muhammad for our guidance .
I am thankful to the Ummat Group of Publications , which gave me the opportunity to convey my viewpoint to the people , particularly the valiant and Momin [ true Muslim ] people of Pakistan who refused to believe in lie of the demon .
I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States .
As a Muslim , I try my best to avoid telling a lie .
Neither I had any knowledge of these attacks nor I consider the killing of innocent women , children , and other humans as an appreciable act .
Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women , children , and other people .
Such a practice is forbidden ever in the course of a battle .
It is the United States , which is perpetrating every maltreatment on women , children , and common people of other faiths , particularly the followers of Islam .
Is the CIA now involved in a plot to discredit , well , exactly who ?
Are they plotting against John Avalon ?
If you wondered why Osama bin Laden had never been charged with any 9/11 related crimes , this statement and a rather telling lack of evidence might help you with your conclusions , unless , of course , you think that the FBI is involved in a plot against Avalon and Guliani also .
We , long ago , had written off journalism as an honest profession .
Were I to make a living out of accusing others of being “ wingnuts , ” I might , first of all , learn to write .
Beyond that , I would learn to get one or two facts straight and , if I were to try using cheap propaganda tricks , I would be alot better at it .
This is lame .
BRINGING SUSPICION ON THEMSELVES
After billions have been spent and 9 years have past , no proof of Osama bin Laden ’s involvement in 9/11 has been presented .
However , we have had attempts to lie to the 9/11 Commission and more than a few stories like this one , inaccurate , cheap propaganda that emit this kind of stench .
What ?
Always ask , why would someone write something this blatant unless they were serving some purpose ?
Are articles like this proof of a conspiracy in themselves ?
The “ 9/11 truth ” movement is only asking for an investigation .
It is n’t making statements of having proof of “ false flag ” operations against the United States by the Bush administration or Israel .
Would an investigation head that way ?
What would be found ?
Why try to stop an investigation when , obviously , a new one is required , even demanded ?
With the original 9/11 Commission ’s work falling apart with continual scandals and new evidence , our path is obvious .
What is being hidden ?
What agenda does Avalon ’s article serve and who is he tied to ?
How much money have so many made off 9/11 ?
Names like Chertoff , Silverstein , Guiliani , Ridge , Haliburton , Blackwater and dozens more , all friends , political allies , always come up .
I do n’t know if all the coincidences make up a massive conspiracy against the United States , a conspiracy that killed thousands and put us into two wrongful wars .
Can I prove this article is part of a conspiracy or just dumb ?
The dumb part is obvious .
The ties to Guliani , who sits at the heard of any conspiracy theory , is , if anything , a demand for an investigation .
There would n’t be articles like this , not so many , unless there is a conspiracy , like the one Avalon accuses others of , but one he is serving himself , knowingly or not .
Is it a conspiracy to save Americans from learning something unpleasant about the nature of their own government and what kinds of things it is capable of ?
This is what most Americans think .
Are they right ?
Do they have the right to know ?
These are the questions and articles like John Avalon ’s make the point for asking those questions and perhaps using some of those Patriot Act powers , the waterboarding , the detentions , the renditions and the special tribunals for something other than silencing dissent .

MIDDLETOWN , Conn . --
Investigators are focusing on a welder 's torch as the possible cause of Sunday 's deadly blast at the Kleen Energy Power Plant , sources said .
The explosion that killed five and injured more than a dozen occurred immediately after the purging , or cleaning , of the underground , natural - gas pipeline that runs about 800 to 1,000 feet through the Kleen Energy plant .
Sources familiar with the investigation and with the purging operation said that welding work was n't entirely halted during or immediately after the purging Sunday morning .
This operation can result in an accumulation of natural gas that must be vented from rooms and enclosures before other ignition sources , such as a welder 's blow torch , can be safely introduced , experts said .
Fran Walters , of Florissant , Mo. , wife of Chris Walters , a safety manager who died in the blast , said that a police officer told her , " ' The building was full of gas and before they could do anything , it was too late . ' "
Several sources said a purge was conducted Saturday without incident .
The plant was 96 percent complete and was being readied for a summer opening .
The blast Sunday blew a construction trailer 40 feet into the air and was heard and felt for miles .
Several sources said there were also industrial space heaters inside the otherwise heatless building .
" Why have people inside the building when doing this test ? " U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney , D - Conn. , said Monday .
" You 're just asking for trouble . "
Courtney visited the blast scene Monday , just as state personnel were preparing to remove some of the bodies from the area .
He said members of trade unions who had gathered at the site were allowed to escort their fallen brothers out of a ravaged power - plant building for the last time .
" They moved in while we were getting briefed .
It was such a moving scene .
It hurt literally just seeing it , " Courtney said .
State and Middletown police have control of the site and have a warrant to search the area and seize evidence .
Courtney said officials were treating the plant as a crime scene for the purpose of limiting access to the blast area as the search for the cause and origin of the blast proceeds .
" The big thing is to be able to tell the families what the hell happened out there , " said one official .
Lawyers representing the Kleen Energy plant had told state regulators in a Jan. 15 letter that the official opening of the plant , or the " commercial operation date , " was Nov. 30 , 2010 .
But the letter , by lawyers from Pullman & Comley to the Connecticut Siting Council , went on to say that project officials were estimating that the plant would be open by this summer .
New London , Conn. , attorney Robert Reardon , who is representing one of the injured pipe - fitters , said subcontractors had been working seven days a week recently to meet a late spring , early summer deadline .
" They were under tremendous pressure to get the plant finished , " Reardon said Monday .
" There was a rush to finish , and they were told , ' We have to get this done . ' "
A separate state inquiry will focus on worker safety and other labor , training , permitting , and supervision issues at the site , Gov. M. Jodi Rell announced Monday .
Deputy Middletown Fire Marshal Al Santostefano said the main investigation -- being conducted by multiple city , state , and federal agencies , including the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives -- will explore whether other ignition sources were present during and after the purging .
" It 's going to try to determine whether all electricity was shut down as a precaution , workers moved from the area -- all of those issues , " Santostefano said .
Inspectors with the U.S. Chemical Safety Board will be looking closely at whether the purging of natural gas contributed to the explosion .
The inspectors , who are civilians , were initially barred from the scene , but Santostefano said Tuesday evening that they are now part of the investigation .
" Reports indicate that this may have involved gas purging , " said spokesman Daniel Horowitz said .
" This is an issue the board is very concerned about . "
The board , an independent federal agency , recently issued safety recommendations concerning purging after investigating the natural - gas explosion in June 2009 at the ConAgra Slim Jim production facility in Garner , N.C. , which caused four deaths , three critical life - threatening burn injuries , and other injuries that sent a total of 67 people to the hospital .
One key recommendation was that purging operations should be conducted in a way that avoids a buildup of natural gas , and that the gas must be vented and be fully dissipated before the area is safe , according to a Feb.
4 news release from the chemical safety board .
O&G Industries of Torrington , Conn. , is the general contractor building the plant , and principal David Oneglia is also a partner in the ownership of the plant .
In November , O&G paid a $ 1,000 fine for not meeting standards for recording and reporting occupational injuries and illnesses , according to OSHA records .
The violation is in the least serious category of violations , an OSHA spokesman said .
The Middletown explosion is the most serious incident of its type in the United States in at least a year , Horowitz said .
William Corvo , a principal partner in the Kleen Energy project , declined Tuesday to answer questions about safety protocols or provide details of the purging operation .
" We 're focused now on the human side , " said Corvo , who was the face of the project in Middletown and in Connecticut during the seven - year process to win permits , capacity contracts , and about $ 1 billion in financing .
" We have people who were hurt , people who were killed .
We 're worried about the families . "
Kleen Energy 's natural - gas line connects to the Algonquin pipeline 's meter station at the base of the power - plant site .
The Algonquin line is part of a national gas - transmission system .
The utility extended its local line about 1.5 miles and constructed the meter station to accommodate the project , said Algonquin spokeswoman Toni Beck .
" We introduced natural gas to the lateral and to the meter station in November , " said Beck .
" Since then , Kleen Energy was taking flows as they commissioned the plant . "
She declined to say how much natural gas the plant was using .
Meanwhile , Congress plans to hold a hearing on the Kleen Energy explosion .
U.S. Reps Courtney , Rosa DeLauro , and John Larson , all Connecticut Democrats , said in a statement Monday afternoon that they have received a commitment for a hearing from House Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller , D - Calif .
They made the request after surveying the blast scene .
Courtney said it was " imperative that we review what went wrong and to make sure that all appropriate measures are put in place to prevent this type of catastrophe from happening again . "
Rell on Tuesday said she is assembling a panel of state agencies -- to be chaired by Senior U.S. District Judge Alan H. Nevas -- " to identify the cause and origin of the Kleen Energy power plant explosion in Middletown on Sunday , including any potential contributing factors " such as construction problems , worker - safety issues , the adequacy of the on - site supervision , and issues of training , licensing , and permitting . "
Rell said a second group of state agencies , local officials and experts will review the disaster and the findings of the Nevas - led panel and other investigations .
The second panel will determine whether any changes should be made to Connecticut laws , state and local regulations or building and fire codes to protect both workers and residents living in the areas surrounding construction projects .
" Our response to the Middletown explosion must follow two distinct but critical paths , " Rell said in a statement .
" We must first identify what went wrong and then determine every measure we can take to prevent future catastrophes .
The reviews must be thorough , impartial and swift .
And if there are concrete steps we can take in the meantime , we must be equally swift in putting those new measures into place . "

TALK is cheap , but money speaks the truth .
That might be the credo behind the recent , rapid rise in the use of novel markets to forecast everything from political events to business successes and failures .
During America 's recent presidential election , bets on the Iowa Electronic Market , based at the University of Iowa , and on online exchanges such as www.tradesports.com and www.betfair.com were watched almost as keenly as opinion polls .
These and other markets have in recent years been used to forecast almost everything from the fate of Saddam Hussein to the outcome of celebrity trials and the box - office takings of films on their opening weekends .
Markets like these , which are intended to elicit punters ' best collective guess about the outcome of some future event , are known as information , prediction or decision markets .
Take the presidential election : people could bet on George Bush by buying a contract that paid a dollar if he won and nothing if he lost .
Anyone certain of a Bush victory should have been willing to pay up to a dollar for the contract .
Anyone confident that Mr Bush would lose could have sold such a contract , expecting to pay nothing when the result came .
With many participants buying and selling in this way , the market discovered a price for the contract — in effect , its best guess of the probability of a Bush win .
The theory is that the aggregated hunches of many people with money at stake are likely to be more accurate than the opinion of disinterested experts or of whoever happens to be at home when a pollster calls .
Indeed , it is easier to put your money where your mouth is in information markets than in many “ proper ” markets .
Because you can “ sell ” without first “ buying ” , short - selling , which is limited in many financial markets , is essentially unconstrained .
And because the bets are smaller than in financial markets , participants are unlikely to be prevented from backing their opinions by restrictions on borrowing .
Most anecdotal evidence seems to bear this theory out .
A recent paper * surveying the academic literature , by Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz , both of Stanford University 's Graduate School of Business , reaches a similar conclusion .
For instance , one study found that the Iowa Electronic Market , which started life in the late 1980s , predicted the vote shares of candidates in several elections between 1988 and 2001 with an average margin of error of 1.5 percentage points , compared with the polls ' average error of 2.1 percentage points .
This year the Iowa market and other exchanges predicted a narrow win for Mr Bush .
Businesses have also made good use of information markets .
Siemens , a German conglomerate , used an internal market to forecast ( correctly ) that the firm would fail to deliver a software project on time , even though internal planning methods purportedly showed that the deadline could be met .
At Hewlett - Packard , a market did a better job than traditional methods in forecasting printer sales .
A joint - venture by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank that uses markets to predict economic indicators has been at least as accurate as economists ' median forecasts .
This is reassuring , but information markets are also prone to imperfections .
One is that they can exaggerate traders ' misperceptions of risks .
Punters tend to put too much weight on the most likely events and on very unlikely ones , and too little on those of intermediate probability .
According to the authors , one contract recently traded on Tradesports ' exchange showed that gamblers were assigning much more optimistic odds to extreme stockmarket outcomes than were traders on Chicago 's derivatives exchanges , where liquidity is much higher .
Participants in information markets also get swept away by their personal tastes : in much the same way that some people bet on their favourite team regardless of the odds , people are likelier to back the political party they belong to .
This should matter less in more liquid markets , because cooler participants will spot that partisanship has pushed prices out of line with probabilities , buy or sell to take advantage , and shift prices back .
But smaller , illiquid markets might not be corrected in this way .
Better informed policies
There have been some efforts to use prediction markets to improve public policy .
Last year , an American government body , the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency , tried to create an exchange to trade contracts on the likelihood of a terrorist attack .
( The Economist Intelligence Unit , a sister company of The Economist , provided data for this venture . )
After protest — someone pointed out , among other things , that terrorists might profit from insider trading before striking — the project was shelved .
Cheekily , one betting exchange created a contract on whether the project 's boss , John Poindexter , would still be in his job on a certain date .
It predicted , accurately , that he would not be .
Despite this debacle , Robert Hahn , director of the American Enterprise Institute - Brookings Joint Centre for Regulatory Studies , argues in a new paper† that information markets could be of great help in forming policy , especially when combined with performance - related contracts .
Suppose that a foundation is thinking of paying $ 5 for every child vaccinated against a certain disease .
Information markets can be used to estimate the number of children who will suffer from the disease both with and without the bounty .
That gives a market - based estimate of the benefit to be had from paying the bounty .
The foundation might then auction the rights to the bounty to ensure that the vaccinations are performed at the lowest cost .
That sounds far - fetched now , but such schemes may one day be common , given the ability of well - designed , liquid markets to reveal information .
