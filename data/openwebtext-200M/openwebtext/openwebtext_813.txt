Making sure your offspring know how to clean their teeth appears to be as important to monkeys as to humans .
Female monkeys in Thailand have been observed showing their young how to floss their teeth - using human hair .
Researchers from Japan said they watched seven long - tailed macaques cleaning the spaces between their teeth in the same manner as humans .
They spent double the amount of time flossing when they were being watched by their infants , the team said .
This suggests the mothers were deliberately teaching their young how to floss , Professor Nobuo Masataka of Kyoto University 's Primate Research Institute said .
" I was surprised because teaching techniques on using tools properly to a third party are said to be an activity carried out only by humans , " he told the AFP news agency .
He said the study , carried out in Lopburi , north of Bangkok , is still in the hypothesis stage .
" We would like to shift our focus to the baby monkeys to check whether the mothers ' actions are effectively helping them learn how to clean their teeth , " he added .
“ When I look back at my life , ” one of these high rollers explained , “ I like remembering myself happy .
So if it makes me happy , it ’s worth it . ”

Aesop told a fable of two types of people : the virtuous
Ant who saves for the winter and the improvident Grasshopper who ’s punished with starvation .
But even the most conscientious
Ants sometimes recognize the need to lighten up  and , with typical Ant discipline , will find ways to “ precommit to indulgence , ” as Dr. Kivetz discovered in a lottery experiment he conducted with Itamar Simonson of Stanford University .
The experimental participants , who were all women , were given a ticket for a lottery drawing to be held three months later , and asked to choose in advance which prize they ’d prefer if they won : $ 85 in cash , or a voucher for an $ 80 massage or facial at a spa .
They were reminded that they could simply use the $ 85 in cash to buy the spa treatment ( and have $ 5 left over ) , but even so , more than a third of the women chose the voucher for the spa .
Similar results turned up when the researchers asked men and women to pick other kind of prizes or to redeem points earned in frequent - buyer programs .
When choosing between cash and “ hedonic luxuries ” like bottles of wine , dinners or vacations , a substantial minority chose the luxuries even though the cash was a better deal .
“ If I took the cash , ” one person explained , “ it would end up going into the rent . ”
Another wrote of her decision : “ That way I ’d have to pamper myself and not spend the $ on something like groceries . ”
Other experiments showed that people will work harder for luxuries than for more practical prizes  and the more effort that ’s required , the more they feel entitled to a self - indulgent reward .
That ’s a motivation strategy for managers and marketers to keep in mind , Dr. Kivetz said .
During the current recession , hyperopic
Ants are presumably having a harder time than ever parting with their own cash , no matter how often President Obama and his economists urge them to do some stimulative shopping .
But would these Ants  and the economy  be better off if they relaxed a little ?
( You can provide an answer at TierneyLab , nytimes.com/tierneylab . )
I asked Dr. Kivetz for his advice to shoppers .
Last month , biologists warned killer whales ’ existence is being threatened by California water issues that negatively affect salmon populations .
Specifically endangered are the southern resident orcas that live in Puget Sound but have been seen as far south as Monterey Bay since 2000 . Â
There are 83 southern resident killer whales .

At blame is water diversion from the Delta . Â According to the Silicon Valley Mercury News :
In a draft scientific report , biologists conclude the damage that water operations are doing to California ’s salmon populations is enough to threaten the orcas ’ existence since they depend on salmon for food …
The findings , contained in a draft report by the agency ’s scientists , could elevate public support for environmental protection in the Delta , where the conflict between environmental advocates and water users has centered on Delta smelt , a nondescript fish that grows a couple of inches long and smells like cucumbers …
Biologists last month reported tentatively that pumping water out of the Delta threatens to drive spring - run chinook salmon and winter - run chinook salmon extinct .
Last year , the collapse of Sacramento River chinook salmon fall - run not only closed commercial fishing season off the coast of California and Oregon , but it also caused the orcas to turn around .
Â
Southern resident orcas ’ diet consists mostly of salmon eating about 500,000 pounds a year ( 80 % chinook ) .
Â
In the winter , the whales move up and down the coast looking for food .
For the last seven years , California salmon have provided an important food source for the whales .
Â Â
This winter , the orcas swam about halfway down the coast of Oregon , then turned around due to lack of salmon to nourish the population .
You might remember a post I did last year that had a link to Ichiro pitching in the 1996 NPB All - Star Game .
Ichiro came out and immediately hit 90 on the TV gun on his first warm - up pitch , and then induced a soft grounder from pinch - hitter Shingo Takatsu .
Nearly 13 years later , Japan WBC manager Tatsunori Hara has , perhaps unintentionally , prompted Ichiro to return to the mound by suggesting that using him in emergency situations is a possibility in this year ’s tournament .
In his workout on the 7th , he skipped batting practice and worked out as a pitcher .
He threw 56 pitches off the mound at Skymark Stadium , throwing fastballs and forkballs .
Word is that he hit 147 kmph ( 92 mph ) with his fastest pitch .
Ichiro said he wants to throw a little bit harder .
Sanspo has a series of photos of his work out : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 .
Hara is n’t used to managing games that go beyond 12 innings , which might explain the idea of using a position player as a pitcher .
Ichiro would probably be the most credible pitching candidate among the fielders in this year ’s WBC .
However far - fetched it might be , we might see Ichiro pitch in a competitive game this year .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has urged leniency for a German student who lobbed a shoe at him during a speech at Cambridge University , the Foreign Ministry said .
The shoe - throwing interrupted a speech Wen gave on Feb 2 on the last day of a tour of Europe , echoing the hurling of shoes by an Iraqi journalist at U.S. President George W. Bush on his farewell visit to Iraq in December .
Martin Jahnke , 27 , will appear before magistrates in Cambridge this week .
“ Education is best for a young student , and I hope he will have the opportunity to continue his education .
The return of a prodigal is worth more than gold , ” said the message from Wen , posted on the Foreign Ministry website over the weekend .
“ I hope the student recognises his mistake and uses his developing eyesight to recognise the real China . ”
The gesture “ aroused the strong indignation of the audience and the entire Chinese people , and hurt the image and reputation of Cambridge in China , ” read the message , which was conveyed through Fu Ying , the Chinese ambassador to Britain .
“ We note that the student has openly apologised , Cambridge also quickly made its position known and will deal with the situation seriously ...
The student ’s actions show that he lacks even basic understanding of China . ”
China had originally condemned the protest as “ despicable . ”
Its state - controlled media had originally referred only to an unidentified “ interruption ” of Wen ’s speech , but later relaxed and showed the full incident on the evening news .
Jahnke blew a whistle and yelled “ How can the university prostitute itself with this dictator ? ” before hurling a black shoe towards the stage .
Wen paused as the shoe landed far wide of him and then continued his speech , ad - libbing that it would not affect China - U.K. relations .

My head is spinning and my imagination is exhausted , even twelve hours after seeing Henry Selick ’s wonderful Coraline , a 3 - D stop- motion animated film that tells a very Alice in Wonderland - esque story .
It took Selick four years to make the film , and it shows through the film ’s meticulous attention to detail and all - around technical perfection .
But that ’s only the beginning of my admiration for Coraline , a movie ( not unlike last year ’s In Bruges ) that seems way too good for its early - February release .
Based on a 2002 novella by Neil Gaiman , Coraline is certainly darker than your average family film , conjuring images that are at once startling , creepy , and often very funny .
The only work of Gaiman ’s that I have been very familiar with up to this point is his Sandman comics series , but it ’s enough to know that he ’s a brilliant and endlessly creative writer .
To know that both of these concotions are the work of the same artist is of no surprise to me .
Coraline starts with the Jones family moving into their new apartment .
We meet Coraline Jones ( voiced by Dakota Fanning ) , a spunky young girl , as she steps outside on a gray gloomy day ( there are n’t really any bright sunny days in this one ) , using a stick as a divining rod to find a nearby well , all the while being followed by a mysterious and sickly - looking cat .
She finds the well , but not before being abrasively introduced to the charmingly annoying ( or perhaps the other way around ) boy - next - door Wyborn .
The boy ’s name is indicative of the same frustrated neglect that Coraline ’s own parents have for her , and it ’s possible that she might have a kindred spirit in poor ol ’ Wybie .
If only he was n’t so damn chatty …
Coraline returns home to her parents , only to be shooed away by both of them .
Her mother ( voiced by Teri Hatcher ) is busy writing about gardening and her father ( John Hodgman ) is …also busy writing about gardening .
Sufficed to say , neither of them are ever actually gardening .
Coraline goes to bed that night , frustrated and alone .
That is , until she follows the white rabbit , er , several mice downstairs , and watches them disappear into a very small door in the wall of the living room .
She opens the door to find an illuminated tunnel , leading into a mysterious other room .
Being the adventurous girl that she is , Coraline crawls through the tunnel , surprised when she comes out the other side into the exact same room .
Sort of .
Coraline finds herself in an alternate version of her reality , one where her parents have time for her , sing to her , and feed her and give her everything her heart desires .
It ’s practically a perfect world and Coraline is , understandably , in no rush to leave .
There is one odd little detail : all the people have buttons in place of their eyes .
Her parents , neighbors , the photograph of the friends she left behind after the move– all have button - eyes .
She goes to bed , her Other Mother and her Other Father , fondly tucking her in , only to wake up the next morning back in her what she can only assume is the one and only reality … right ??
The plot takes some more whacky turns as the Other world battles against Coraline ’s reality for control over her soul , and along the way Coraline meets several hilariously deranged and entertaining characters , including Mr. Bodinsky ( voiced by Ian McShane ) , an oddly disproportionate vaudevillian whose trained dancing mice are the ones leading Coraline to the Other world night after night .
It ’s a consistently creative story from a couple of consistently creative minds .
The film ’s dark sense of humor is charming where it could have been abrasive — try and find another movie that contains a swarm of red-eyed Scottish terrier bats !
But what really sets it apart from just about anything else of its ilk , is its intelligent thematic structure .
Coraline ’s
Other world , at its most appealing , is made up of all the people , places , and things in her life , hand - crafted ( quite literally ) to fit Coraline ’s most selfish desires ( why , just look what they do to poor Wybie ! )
But the film is far more than simply a cautionary be - careful - what - you - wish - for tale ( despite what the tag line might tell you ) .
Every single element that makes up Coraline always seems to be subtly countered by another .
Sharp dialogue and clever motifs run rampant throughout the film , like the connective tissue holding it all together .
The details are spot-on !
For every mangy dog there ’s a dignified feline , for every vicous cat there ’s a poor mouse , and for every cute little mouse there ’s a big ugly rat .
The parallel between the well and the tunnel to the Other world is alone enough to put me in awe of the expert craftsmanship of the storytelling .
If there was ever a family film you could write a thesis on , you can bet it ’d probably be Coraline .
And the visuals !
What could I possibly say that can do justice to the gorgeous stop-motion animation and the stunning design of everything on display here ?
Selick , who previously directed the stop - motion films The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach , has created his undisputable masterpiece , not only as a film in its own right , but as a wondrous visual achievement .
Having not read Gaiman ’s original novella , I can only imagine what the descriptions might have been like for the bizarre and surreal images on display here and , more than that , I can only imagine how the filmic translation of them could have gone horribly wrong in the hands of a less capable filmmaker .
It ’s the kind of story where the visual element increases the sense of wonder to the heights necessary to fully realize the thematic weight of every delightfully dreary drop .
Selick pulls it off like the pro he is .
Is it a perfect film ?
It ’s damn close .
Some pacing issues create an awkward false ending , and the second climax we ’re treated to does n’t quite live up to the one from seven minutes prior , but this is a small complaint , and it ’s not something many are likely to notice–and the thing about pacing is if you do n’t notice it , then it ’s pretty good .
Frankly , I was more just glad to see that the film was n’t quite done yet .
As I mentioned earlier , this is a 3 - D film –the first stop - motion 3 - D film ever .
However , it ’s not available in 3 - D everywhere .
It must be said , though , that if you can seek the film out in 3 - D , please do !
It ’s a terrifically orchestrated 3 - D presentation that works the medium in more subtle ways than you might expect .
It rarely plays out any flying - at - the - screen gags , and when it does , it ’s tasteful and appropriate .
It ’s a terrific little film , that will translate just fine on DVD , but nothing can match the feeling of allowing this film wrap itself up around you , creating an experience that is far larger and greater than simply “ catching a flick . ”
Coraline is an inspired and boundlessly imaginative picture that I can’t stop thinking about .
The atrocious remake of Friday the 13th quite triumphantly claimed the top spot at the box office this weekend ; I guess that ’s just what the kids are into these days .
But on the off - chance ( statistically , of course ) you ’d like to see something both you and your brain can enjoy , this film deserves a look .
Look at the latest Credit Default Swap spreads for European sovereigns ( these are the data from yesterday ’s close ) .
As we ’ve discussed here before , CDS are not a perfect measure of default probability but they tell you where things are going – and changes within an asset class ( like European sovereigns ) are often informative .
European CDS have been relatively stable – albeit at dangerously high levels – for the past month or so .
But now Ireland has moved up sharply ( the green line in the chart ) .
We ’ve covered Ireland ’s problems here before ( banking , fiscal and – big time – real estate ) ; type “ Ireland ” into our Search box for more .
My point today is simple : a key warning sign just moved from orange to red .
The G7 ministers of finance and central bank governors need to focus on this problem during their discussions today and tomorrow .
What is the strategy for Ireland ?
Does the European Union come in to help ?
Is this a job for the IMF ?
Just do n’t , please , tell me more about the “ basic principles ” of financial reform ( and similar nostrums in the draft communique ) unless and until you have addressed the Irish Problem .
And do n’t tell me , “ the Irish have to sort this out for themselves . ”
Eventually , the world always comes to help ; check your notes on Iceland .
It ’s much better and much cheaper to come in early and decisively – of course , the Irish will have to do some painful things , but we really can help ( or , if we can ’t , this will be a long dark winter for the eurozone ) .
We need a plan of action for Ireland , and we need it now .
What we do n’t need is another Iceland - type situation .
Stella Rimington has often been critical of the government A former head of MI5 has accused the government of exploiting the fear of terrorism and trying to bring in laws that restrict civil liberties .
In an interview in a Spanish newspaper , published in the Daily Telegraph , Dame Stella Rimington , 73 , also accuses the US of " tortures " .
The Home Office said it was vital to strike a right balance between privacy , protection and sharing personal data .
It said any policies which impact on privacy must be " proportionate " .
Dame Stella , who stood down as the director general of the security service in 1996 , has previously been critical of the government 's policies , including its attempts to extend pre-charge detention for terror suspects to 42 days and the controversial plan to introduce ID cards .
" It would be better that the government recognised that there are risks , rather than frightening people in order to be able to pass laws which restrict civil liberties , precisely one of the objects of terrorism - that we live in fear and under a police state , " she told the Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia .
Seven years after 9/11 it is time to take stock and to repeal abusive laws and policies enacted in recent years .

She said the British security services were " no angels , " but they did not kill people .
" The US has gone too far with Guantanamo and the tortures , " she said .
" MI5 does not do that .
Furthermore it has achieved the opposite effect - there are more and more suicide terrorists finding a greater justification . "
' Take stock '
Dame Stella 's comments come as a study is published by the International Commission of Jurists ( ICJ ) that accuses the US and the UK of undermining the framework of international law .
Former Irish president Mary Robinson , the president of the ICJ said : " Seven years after 9/11 it is time to take stock and to repeal abusive laws and policies enacted in recent years .
" Human rights and international humanitarian law provide a strong and flexible framework to address terrorist threats . "
The BBC 's security correspondent Frank Gardner said the ICJ report would probably have more of an impact than Dame Stella 's remarks because it was a wide - ranging , three - year study carried out by an eminent group of practising legal experts .
Dame Stella appeared to be more restrained in her comments than the ICJ , he added .
She was keen to stress the risk of civil liberties being curtailed , while the jurists insisted that international law had already been " actively undermined " .
Shadow security minister Baroness Neville - Jones said the Conservatives were " committed to ensuring that security measures are proportionate and adhere to the rule of law " .
The Tories said the government 's push to extend the detention time limit for terror suspects was the kind of measure condemned by the report .
Human rights campaign group Liberty pointed to a number of other recent developments it said represented " a creeping encroachment on our fundamental rights " :
Government plans for a giant database to record the times , dates and recipients of all emails and text messages sent and phone calls made in the UK
The growth of Britain 's DNA database - it is now the world 's largest , per head of population , with samples from some 4 m people
The use by councils of laws designed to track criminals and terrorists to spy on ordinary citizens .
In one case a family was watched to see if they were really living in a school catchment area
The spread of CCTV cameras .
Britain now reportedly has some 4 m , the highest density in western Europe
Proposals for " secret inquests , " excluding relatives , juries and the media , which the government says would prevent intelligence details leaking out Isabella Sankey , director of policy at Liberty , said she was " enormously heartened " by what Dame Stella had said .
" Over the last seven years , we 've seen a number of measures passed , some of which affect very few of us in a horrible and terrible way , whether that 's house arrest under control orders or rendition and torture in foreign states , " she said .
We have very broad police powers which sweep the innocent up with the guilty
Isabella Sankey , Liberty " We 've also seen many , many measures that affect all of us just a little bit and , most of all , which seriously impact our rights to privacy .
" We have very broad police powers which sweep the innocent up with the guilty . "
' Effective safeguards ' A Home Office spokesman said : " The government has been clear that where surveillance or data collection will impact on privacy they should only be used where it is necessary and proportionate . "
" This provides law enforcement agencies with the tools to protect the public as well as ensuring government has the ability to provide effective public services while ensuring there are effective safeguards and a solid legal framework that protects civil liberties . "
Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Ed Davey said : " This is damning testament to just how much liberty has been ineffectually sacrificed in the ' war on terror ' . "
Dame Stella became the first female head of MI5 in 1992 .

This story is part of an ongoing series of profiles by CNN about economic survival in this time of financial crisis .
Some members of the Frankel household gather around the dinner table at their home in New Mexico .
( CNN ) -- Chris and Georgia Frankel have no idea what it must be like to live alone as a married couple .
They started out their life together staying with relatives and later friends .
Those early years proved to be good training because their house in Albuquerque , New Mexico , now has 12 people calling it home .
In addition to their three daughters , ages 3 , 6 and 17 , the couple shares their space with five adults and two teens .
The family started taking in people before the economy soured , and now they say they are weathering the downturn better than some , in part because of their unconventional living arrangement .
iReport.com :
Tell us how you 're surviving
In the Frankel household , everyone has pulled together to make the way a little bit easier for them all .
They are all there for various reasons , from difficult family situations to trouble with former roommates .
Some are there daily , and others come and go based on school schedules and work commitments .
Rent -- if the person can afford it -- is minimal and sometimes even shunned .
" It 's difficult with Georgia , because she does n't like to take money from anyone , " said Jamie Cooper , a co-worker of Georgia 's who has lived in the Frankel home for more than a year .
" She wants to take care of everyone all the time . "
Not that the Frankels are wealthy .
Georgia works as an executive assistant at Heel Inc. , a homeopathic pharmaceutical firm , and Chris is director of programming for Fitness Anywhere , a company that sells exercise equipment .
But even with a lifestyle Chris describes as " living paycheck to paycheck , " the couple say they are fortunate to have a large house ( it 's more than 3,800 square feet ) that has become a haven for those living there .
" People were there for us and helped us when we needed it , " Chris said .
" We wanted to do the same . "
It was just a few years ago that the family needed care .
First , the eldest Frankel daughter got sick and ended up in the hospital .
Then Chris ' father moved in while in the final stages of cancer .
" We were under the impression that he had six months to live , but he had nine days to live , " Chris recalled .
" I went through a battle with depression , and my wife was taking care of the kids and actually taking care of me quite a bit . "
Undone by stress and grief , Chris stopped working some of the personal training jobs he held to supplement his income teaching in the exercise science program at the University of New Mexico .
The family finances plummeted , he said .
" We learned how to get by when there was not enough food in the house for the kids , " Chris said .
" We had to beg and borrow money from people to get by . "
Gradually , things stabilized , and as times got better , the Frankels found themselves in a position to pay it forward .
Rachel Balkovec was the first to move in two years ago .
Chris was her professor , and when he offered her a job as a personal trainer during summer break , she declined because she had nowhere to stay .
" I said , ' I have to go home and work and save money .
I ca n't stay here if I do n't live for free , ' " said Balkovec , who hails from Omaha , Nebraska .
" The next day at school , he was like , ' Hey , my wife said you can move in whenever you want . ' "
After getting over the surprise of the offer , Balkovec moved in and has been there ever since .
" They ended up being like my own family , " said Balkovec , whose boyfriend later moved in also .
" [ The Frankels ] are really open .
There is every type of person living in this house .
They do n't judge , and they love everyone .
They just want to help people . "
Everyone agrees that the driving force behind the living arrangement is Georgia .
She is a woman with a big heart whose door is always open .
It 's not rare for the kids ' friends to be found hanging at the house , and every Thursday , the family hosts a group of local Mormon missionaries for dinner .
The couple has converted spare rooms into bedrooms to accommodate everyone , and even with a food bill that averages about $ 1,000 a month , Georgia swears she would n't have it any other way .
" I feel like everyone needs a good environment to live in , " Georgia said .
" We have a home we were blessed with , and it has a lot of room for everybody .
We work well as a family . "
A typical day at the Frankel household is not as hectic as you might imagine .
The presence of four bathrooms helps , and everyone 's schedule varies .
The group divides up chores and enjoys gathering around the crowded dinner table at the end of the day .
A Wii they saved up for has helped the house develop a fondness for a little healthy video game competition on the weekends .
And although they may not all share blood , they are bound by respect and affection for each other , they say .
Alfredo Loda is a chef who calls Casa Frankel home when he is not working in various parts of the country .
Finding work has gotten tougher and tougher , he said , and he has been able to secure only seasonal jobs here and there .
Were it not for the Frankels , said the Italian - born chef who speaks three languages , he probably would have left for Europe to try to find work .
" This is how people used to live , looking out for and taking care of one another , " said Loda , who cooks and helps with the care of the children as a way to contribute to the household .
i Reporter Austin
Chu posted a clip of the Frankels to share the story of a family he says " embodies what we all need to embody . "
iReport.com : Inspiration in Albuquerque
Austin and his brother Brian are traveling the United States filming a documentary they have titled " The Recess Ends , " about the country 's current economic plight .
Austin Chu said the Frankels are an example of America at its best .
" Imagine if every family was like the Frankel family , " Chu said .
" In times of real trouble , these are the values we need to hang on to . "
Chris Frankel 's job is based in San Francisco , California , and he is on the road quite a bit these days .
He said he considered moving his family and selling his house , but the current real estate market and the expense of living in California made it impossible .
Instead , he travels with the knowledge that his wife and daughters are in good company .
" My kids get to experience different cultures and different kinds of people , " he said .
" At the end of the day , if it comes down between saving a dollar or helping someone else out , we have been pretty good about seeing the investment in our friendships and our family .
That 's what keeps us going and keeps us pretty happy . "

As most of us know wine is used to run windows applications on linux .
But setting it up always has been pain .
For example if your windows program requires some prerequisites that are n't shipped or not implemented in wine then you have to go for hunting on net .
Examples include mscore fonts , Internet Explorer , DCOM , etc .
And this guide explains how to install winetricks on ubuntu .
Crossover office has a little wizard that will download install all the prerequisites of a particular software but It costs money to use .
But there is one little known tool called winetricks which you can use to automate that stuff for free .
Finally you can concentrate on something productive rather than hunting for some obscure stuff .
Download winetricks
Use following commands to get winetricks and set it up .
wget http://www.kegel.com/wine/winetricks chmod +x winetricks
Using winetricks
For example if you want to install Microsoft Core fonts use following command .

7 black Houston firefighters sue , say city exam biased
Seven black firefighters are suing the city , contending that the Houston Fire Department ’s test for officer promotions adversely affects blacks .
“ This is systemic discrimination , ” said the firefighters ’ attorney , Dennis Thompson .
“ Selection rates for African - Americans are abysmally smaller than for white candidates . ”
City Council on Wednesday delayed consideration of a request by the city attorney ’s office to spend up to $ 197,000 on an outside law firm to defend the city against the federal lawsuit , which was filed in August .
The council is expected to take up the request next week .
Firefighters trying to attain the rank of captain and above in the Houston Fire Department must take a 100 - question multiple - choice test .
Numerous studies show that blacks as a group do less well on high - stakes tests , Thompson said .
He said fire departments should use cognitive tests only as a pass - fail benchmark and also should focus on performance exercises and other criteria .
“ We do n’t do as well on these multiple - choice tests , ” said Capt .
Otis Jordan , president of the Houston Black Firefighters Association .
Jordan and the HBFA are not part of the suit .
“ I compare fighting a fire , riding an apparatus , to playing football .
Your best athlete might not be the straight - A student . ”
HFD has about 4,200 firefighters and paramedics .
Roughly 700 are black , Jordan said .
Senior Assistant City Attorney Timothy Higley declined to comment on the substance of the lawsuit , but he said the case was complex .
“ It ’s all about the testing system in the Fire Department , so it ’s going to require quite a bit of analysis , ” Higley said .
“ Analysis about the validity of the testing program ( and ) whether the testing program is valid in the sense that it tests people for what is necessary in order to be ( an officer ) . ”
Kevin Michael Foster , an education anthropologist at the University of Texas at Austin ’s College of Education , agreed that research has demonstrated a test score gap between blacks and whites .
There are several theories about why , but a primary explanation has to do with minority students disproportionately receiving inferior educations compared to whites , he said .
“ If you are African - American , there is a greater likelihood that throughout your academic career you have been taught by teachers of less experience , you have been taught in settings of low - performing schools , ” Foster said .
During standardized tests , minorities are also vulnerable to performance anxieties that stem from cultural stereotypes , Foster said .
The result , he said , is that historically marginalized groups often do worse on tests , especially “ high stakes ” tests that affect one ’s livelihood or future life path .
System adjusted in 2005
While officer promotions once heavily emphasized the written test , HFD ’s system was adjusted in 2005 as part of a collective bargaining agreement , said Jeffrey Caynon , president of the Houston Professional Fire Fighters Association Local 341 .
There has been only one testing cycle since the change , he added .
The new system ranks candidates based on a 122 - point system : 100 points possible from the multiple - choice test , and other points awarded based on seniority , college or graduate education , and level of state fire certification .
When vacancies occur , candidates are promoted from the top of the list .
Promotions in the lower ranks still use the old system of 100 points for a written test and 10 points for seniority , for a maximum of 110 , according to Assistant Fire Chief Bill Barry .
The lawsuit seeks promotions to captain or senior captain for the plaintiffs , back pay and damages .

There were only two bits worth repeating in last night ’s Saturday Night Live – at least for a political junkie like me – both of them on the Weekend Update .
The first was Seth Myer ’s take on the Obama , “ I screwed up ” admission :
The second was a sort of defense of Michael Phelps and put - down of Kellogs .
The last “ Really … ” is of course the best – and the one mainly unexplored part of the story .

Every year art schools across the country spit out thousands of groomed - for - success graduates , whose job it is to supply galleries and auction houses with desirable retail .
They are backed up by cadres of public relations specialists  otherwise known as critics , curators , editors , publishers and career theorists  who provide timely updates on what desirable means .
Many of those specialists are , directly or indirectly , on the industry payroll , which is controlled by another set of personnel : the dealers , brokers , advisers , financiers , lawyers and  crucial in the era of art fairs  event planners who represent the industry ’s marketing and sales division .
They are the people who scan school rosters , pick off fresh talent , direct careers and , by some inscrutable calculus , determine what will sell for what .
Not that these departments are in any way separated ; ethical firewalls are not this industry ’s style .
Despite the professionalization of the past decade , the art world still likes to think of itself as one big Love Boat .
Night after night critics and collectors scarf down meals paid for by dealers promoting artists , or museums promoting shows , with everyone together at the table , schmoozing , stroking , prodding , weighing the vibes .
And where is art in all of this ?
Proliferating but languishing .
“ Quality , ” primarily defined as formal skill , is back in vogue , part and parcel of a conservative , some would say retrogressive , painting and drawing revival .
And it has given us a flood of well - schooled pictures , ingenious sculptures , fastidious photographs and carefully staged spectacles , each based on the same basic elements : a single idea , embedded in the work and expounded in an artist ’s statement , and a look or style geared to be as catchy as the hook in a rock song .
The ideas do n’t vary much .
For a while we heard a lot about the radicalism of Beauty ; lately about the subversive politics of aestheticized Ambiguity .
Whatever , it is all market fodder .
The trend reached some kind of nadir on the eve of the presidential election , when the New Museum trotted out , with triumphalist fanfare , an Elizabeth Peyton painting of Michelle Obama and added it to the artist ’s retrospective .
The promotional plug for the show was obvious .
And the big political statement ?
That the art establishment voted Democratic .
NEWSMAKER INTERVIEW :
The Republican governor of Utah on Monday said his party is blighted by leaders in Congress whose lack of new ideas renders them so “ inconsequential ” that he does n’t even bother to talk to them .
“ I do n’t even know the congressional leadership , ” Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. told editors and reporters at The Washington Times , shrugging off questions about top congressional Republicans , including House Minority Leader John A. Boehner of Ohio and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky .
“ I have not met them .
I do n’t listen or read whatever it is they say because it is inconsequential — completely . ”
In a separate interview at The Times , House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence , one of the party ’s chief message makers , said that Republican lawmakers have improved their standing with voters by attacking waste in the economic stimulus package even if rank - and - file Republicans ca n’t agree to forgo earmarks - the pork - barrel spending projects despised by the electorate .
Mr. Pence said such a move would benefit Americans and his party .
The back - and - forth underscored the leadership debate within their party .
Mr. Huntsman called on national Republican leaders to show that they have alternatives and solutions , and Mr. Pence argued that congressional Republicans are n’t as incompetent as they might appear .
“ Is my party in Congress as far along as I would like to see us be ?
Probably not .
But the contrast between our party that is having a thorough debate over how to change the way we spend the people ’s money and the other party , which is going on a spending spree and engaging in earmarking as usual , I think is the stark contrast , ” Mr. Pence said .
Unlike some of his Republican counterparts in other states , Mr. Huntsman said he will not turn back any of his state ’s share of President Obama ’s $ 787 billion economic stimulus .
But he said much of the spending is misdirected and more likely to bloat the government than boost the economy .
He said congressional Republicans failed to score political points for opposing the bill — only three Republican senators supported it — because the public saw them as objecting to being shut out by Democrats from helping write the bill rather than as taking a principled stand .
The governor said congressional Republicans are being frustrated by a lack of credibility on the party ’s No. 1 tenet : fiscal responsibility .
“ That ’s why no one is paying any attention , ” he said .
“ Our moral soapbox was completely taken away from us because of our behavior in the last few years .
For us to now criticize analogous behavior is hypocrisy .
We ’ve got to come at it a different way .
We ’ve got to prove the point .
It ca n’t be as the Chinese would say , ‘ fei hua , ’ [ or ] empty words . ”
Mr. Huntsman , a U.S. ambassador to Singapore under President George H.W. Bush , speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese .
Mr. Pence said opposing the stimulus bill was the right decision and that Republicans have tried to come up with alternatives , such as their financial rescue alternative package last year and a counter to Democrats ’ stimulus plan that relied on tax cuts .
“ My hope is that not only governors but everyday Americans will begin to realize in increasing measure that we ’re not just the party of ‘ no , ’ we ’re offering substantive alternatives , ” said Mr. Pence , who said Republicans have lost credibility on spending , though he pointed out that he had opposed big - government expansions such as President George W. Bush ’s Medicare prescription drug program .
Still , the Indiana Republican acknowledged that House Republicans still have n’t come up with a unified position opposing pork - barrel spending .
“ I believe that a conferencewide moratorium on earmarks would be in the interests of the American people and the interest of the Republican Party , ” Mr. Pence said .
After unilaterally swearing off earmark requests himself in 2008 , Mr. Pence announced that he would do the same again in 2009 and 2010 .
“ My reason for that is not because I think members of Congress should forever be foreclosed from making requests , spending requests , large and small , but because I think this system is a disservice to the American people , ” he said .
Mr. Pence also took pains to distance himself from Mr. Bush ’s eight years in office , touting his opposition to the “ Bush banking bailout ” financial rescue plan .
“ Americans fired [ the ] big - government Republicanism of George W. Bush , ” he said .
“ Big - government Republicanism is a failed political experiment . ”
Mr. Huntsman , who was in Washington for a meeting of governors , said the failure of Republican leaders in Congress to move beyond “ gratuitous partisanship ” has left it to the party ’s governors and other state officials to come up with “ big , bold solutions and ideas ” that will win over voters and revive the party .
“ Until we get to that point , we are going to be sort of out there gasping for air , and that ’s were we are right now , ” he said .
“ A good spirited debate is always important and always healthy , but right now , we are devoid of some of those big ideas that will allow us to become a governing party once again and allow us to win national elections , ” Mr. Huntsman said .
“ As one Republican governor still standing , I ’m very mindful of this and I ’m very mindful of the need to be part of the larger debate about coming up with real fixes and real solutions that the American people recognize as being good for them and their state and their country . ”
Instead of Republican legislators , Mr. Huntsman said , he turns to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to discuss ideas about health care , environment and energy policy .
“ I had Newt Gingrich in my office a few weeks ago , ” Mr. Huntsman said .
“ What did we talk about ?
We did n’t talk about how you harpoon the opposition through gratuitous rhetoric .
It was health care … environment and energy reform .
Real ideas . ”
Mr. Pence acknowledged an appetite for leadership among voters but said Republicans are well - positioned to fill that void .
Mr. Pence has been one of the chief sponsors behind a federal shield law to protect reporters from having to reveal their sources and said he thinks the bill can be signed into law under President Obama .
“ We ’re feeling that there ’s a more amenable environment there , ” he said , predicting both 60 votes in the Senate — the threshold needed to more contentious bills — and the support of Mr. Obama and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr .
On immigration , Mr. Pence said he still supports his own proposal that required illegal immigrants to leave the country and apply for a guest - worker plan from outside the U.S.
He said that doing so would not preclude them from getting in line for a path to citizenship .

There is no shortage of Twitter clients these days , but Goose Apps is bringing a unique two - punch approach to the table with Lounge .
Offered as a client for both iPhone and Mac OS X , Lounge is perhaps the first Twitter app that works the same way on the desktop and in your pocket .
Lounge for the Mac , currently in public beta , offers a broad set of Twitter tools .
Separate , reorderable lists allow you to view the timelines of your friends , the public , replies , and even a " vanity " section that includes any mention of your Twitter user name .
A search section keeps a list of your latest terms , and you can save searches to the left sidebar for easy access .
Multi-account support also lets you get your alter ego on .
Lounge for iPhone , available now in App Store for $ 1.99 ( iTunes Link ) , takes the desktop UI on - the - go .
You have access to all the same separate lists of tweets , and multi-account support is again available .
A clever new feature in Lounge for the Mac ( in private beta testing for iPhone ) is the synchronization of tweet read states and categories .
If you need to keep up with every single tweet and your custom searches , this will help you pick up where you left off when switching between your iPhone and Mac ( syncing requires both devices to connect to the same LAN ) .
It can also be used to sync this info between two Macs .
Lounge on the Mac offered us a pretty good experience during our brief runthrough .
Polish is sprinkled throughout , such as a colorized pop-up panel that confirms whether you are publicly replying or direct messaging a user , as well as support for linking , copying , and retweeting your friends ' posts .
Lounge 's icons are a bit too Rainbow Brite for my personal tastes , but this is cancelled out by the fact that you can hide the categories column and slim down a stream of tweets .
Lounge for Mac cannot , however , change your iChat or Adium status messages , a favorite feature among Twitterrific users .
There is no price listed for Lounge for Mac once it comes out of beta ( 10.5 Leopard is required , by the way ) , though users are reminded that it is definitely a beta .
Specifically , you cannot yet delete tweets or accounts .
Still , Lounge for Mac is a strong client if you are looking for alternatives to incumbents and ho - hum Adobe AIR clients .
Drama students at Corona del Mar High School were excited to push the envelope with a spring production of the Bohemian love story “ Rent . ”
But the drama teacher at the Newport Beach school says the principal told him to cancel the show because she disapproved of the gay characters in the musical .
Fal Asrani , the school ’s principal , disputes that she pulled the plug on the production , saying that she only asked to review the script , according to district officials .
Now , amid growing backlash and consternation from some students and members of the gay community , the actors at Corona del Mar High are grudgingly preparing for a very different show : “ You ’re a Good Man , Charlie Brown . ”
The drama teacher said it ’s a safer choice and one sure to pass muster with his boss .
Ron Martin said he chose “ Rent , ” the story of artists struggling in New York City , for the spring musical because he hoped it would be a vehicle for teaching tolerance after overhearing students using homosexual slurs .

“ My responsibility as a drama teacher is to expose my students to a variety of different types of plays , ” Martin said .
At a recent meeting with Martin and a union representative , Asrani shut down the plans for “ Rent , ” saying that she needed to review the script because of “ prostitution and homosexuality , ” Martin said , adding that there is no prostitution in the musical .
Asrani did request a script , a common practice in the school district , but was not provided one , said Newport - Mesa Unified School District spokeswoman Laura Boss .
The principal has discretion over anything that occurs on campus , but she “ emphatically denies ” canceling the show , Boss said ; that call was made by the drama teacher .
“ We feel confident at the role the principal played , ” Boss said , adding that district officials will follow up on the matter when students and staff return next week from a break .
Asrani “ gets to the bottom ” of things , said Dana Black , president of the Newport - Mesa Board of Education .
The district , Black says , does not shy away from edgy subject matter , but , “ we do n’t want anybody feeling alienated . ”

And it makes sense for a principal to review potentially sensitive material , Black said .
“ I ’m just kind of surprised , to be honest with you , that there was any controversy . ”
Asrani did not return calls seeking comment ; Martin stands by his account of the meeting .
Martin said that in the five years he ’s worked at the school , Asrani had never asked to review a script before a production .
The teacher had already discussed the abridged school edition of “ Rent ” -- which cuts out same - sex contact -- with actors ’ parents and says none had a problem with the material .
And previous shows such as “ A Streetcar Named Desire ” and “ A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum ” portrayed adult themes without raising administrators ’ eyebrows .
A parent complaint about this winter ’s production of “ No Reservations , ” which included light profanity , a kissing scene and a gay character ’s monologue , prompted Asrani to attempt -- unsuccessfully -- to edit the show after it had opened , according to Martin and students in the department .

Upon hearing the news that their spring musical was canned , drama students , about 20 of whom had already been cast for roles in “ Rent , ” were flabbergasted .
“ We ’ve all been angry , ” said Tim Dyess , 17 , president of the Drama Club .
“ The reason why it got canceled was completely ridiculous . ”
He and other students have plans to distribute fliers and buttons and post YouTube.com videos criticizing what they view as a discriminatory move .
Some have called the American Civil Liberties Union .
Alumni were tipped off to the controversy after an anonymous student letter blasting Asrani circulated and was posted on the gay blog Queerty late last week .

Autumn Haile , 24 , a 2003 Corona del Mar graduate and drama department alumna , counted gay students as some of her closest high school friends .
“ To think that they would feel unwelcome there now is what angers me so much about this , ” she said .
“ We ’re not trying to preach to an audience -- we just wanted to do something that was a little different , ” said Monique Danser , 18 , a Corona del Mar High senior active in the drama department .
“ I think it speaks a lot for the student body in a positive way , saying that we ’re not people who are going to take this lying down . ”
Yet what causes an uproar in one town might pass unnoticed in another , said David Dingman , president of the Drama Teachers Assn. of Southern California .
School - suitable content is “ something the community has to wrestle with , ” he said .
“ There is no one - size - fits - all in this case . ”
At the very least , Martin considers the hullabaloo “ probably the greatest civics lesson ” his students will ever have .

Conky is a simple , lightweight system monitor application that can display information on your desktop and allows you to monitor several processes simultaneously .
For those who like to keep a minimal desktop , but still want to have quick access to various information such as emails , weather , memory usage etc , then Conky is just the application for you .
While the installation of Conky is easy , configuring it can be a rather troublesome task .
Follow this tutorial closely and I am sure you ’ll master the trick in no time .
Installation
Open your terminal ( “ Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal ” ) and type :
Once the installation is completed , type in the terminal :
To test if conky is working , in the terminal , type
A window will pop up showing all your system information .
Other than the background which is your own wallpaper , the information will be the same as the one shown in the image below .
Close the conky window .
We are now going to configure it to display the information that we want and also to change its color to match those of your wallpaper .
Configuring Conky
Go to your Home folder ( “ Places -> Home ” ) .
Press Ctrl +
H to show hidden files .
Scroll down till you found the file “ .conkyrc ” .
Double click to open it in Text editor .
This is the main config file that will affect what is showing on your desktop .
Scroll down the list and make sure the following configuration are set properly .
Make sure that these settings do not have a ‘ # ’ in front .
If yes , remove them .
The above configurations are the default setting that I used in my system .
When you are more familiar with it , you can change it to suit your needs .
When you are done with the configuration setting , leave this aside for a while .
We will get back to it later .
Installing the Mail and Weather Forecast package for Conky
We need to install additional package in order for Conky to display new mail and weather forecast on your desktop .
In your terminal ,
Add the following line to the end of the file .
Save and close .
Back to your terminal ,
Configuring Weather Forecast
Now , go to Weather.com and sign up a partner account .
This will enable you to enquire the weather information in your city .
Once you have signed up , check your mailbox for the confirmation email .
Scroll down the mail until you see your Partner ID and License key .
Back to your terminal ,
Fill in the “ XOAP_Partner_ID ” and “ XOAP_License_key ” fields with the information from the confirmation email .
Save and exit .
On your browser , go to http://xoap.weather.com/search/search?where=YOUR_CITY and replace “ YOUR_CITY ” with the name of your city .
You will see a xml similar to the image below .
Record down the id .
This is the identifier for your city and you will need it later on .
Putting all together
Back to your .conkyrc file , scroll down to until you see the line
As stated in the statement , anything that is placed under the word TEXT will be displayed on the screen .
There is a certain syntax that you need to follow to get it to display correctly and beautifully .
The following is my configuration .
You are free to copy and modify .
Some of the commonly used syntax involve :
$ {font Verdana: style=Bold:size=12 } – This means setting the displayed font to “ Verdana ” of size 12 and bold .
You can modify the font or the size to suit your desktop .
A thing to note is that it only supports fonts that are installed in your system .
To get new fonts , you can go to dafont.com and download your favorite fonts at no charge at all .
$ {execi 3600 …} – The “ execi ” syntax allows you to execute external scripts .
Note that we use the execi syntax to check your email address , weather forecast and also to read a TODO list file and output to the screen .
The number behind the “ execi ” determines the interval ( in sec ) for Conky to execute the scripts .
$hr / $ stippled_hr – This is to insert a horizontal line in the screen .
The “ $ stippled_hr ” syntax refers to a dotted line .
$ {execi 3600 conkyForecast --location =SNXX0006 -- datatype=LT} – This is the execution code to retrieve Weather information from Weather.com .
Note that you need to replace the -- location=xyz by your city ’s identifier .
$ {execi 600 conkyEmail -- servertype=IMAP
--servername=imap.googlemail.com --username=xyz --password=xyz -- ssl} –
This is the execution code to retrieve information from your Gmail and Yahoo mail account .
To enable IMAP service , you will need to enable the IMAP setting in your Gmail account ( “ Settings -> Forwarding and POP / IMAP ” )
$ {execi 30 cat /home / damien / TODO.txt} –
This is the execution code to read my TODO list file located in my Home folder and display it on the screen
For more information on the syntax , check out the Conky variable site .
Testing out your Conky
When you are done with your setting , in your terminal , type
to get it running , and
to terminate it .
Start Conky everytime you log in
Go to “ System -> Preferences -> Sessions ” and click “ Add ” .
Fill in the field as shown below
Conky will now load up automatically next time you log in to your system .
This is a screenshot of my Conky setup .
Not really the best , but it does clean up my desktop in an elegant style .
I am sure you have a much better setup than mine .

I 've uploaded my CMonad package to Hackage .
It allows you to write Haskell code in a C style .
Unfortunately , GHC lacks certain optimizations to make efficient code when using CMonad , so instead of C speed you get low speed .

Shai Reshef has a vision : soon , anyone with an Internet connection and some proficiency in English can take classes online at his new " University of the People . "
And not just classes — the school will be accredited , offering actual degrees in subjects like computer science .
Charges will be minimal , starting at just $ 15 , and will be based on the student 's country .
It sounds too good to be true , but Reshef is enough of a believer in the idea to pump a million dollars of his own into it , and he argues that it can be a self - sustaining nonprofit once it tops 10,000 worldwide students .
Open coursework , peer learning , volunteers
To make this vision a reality , University of the People will embrace two key concepts : open courseware and peer learning .
The courseware aspect is simple enough to understand ; numerous top - ranking universities have recently made complete course lectures and other materials available free of charge , and the Internet is awash in quality resources that could be used in online classes without paying license fees .
But there 's a problem with lectures : the size of the audio or video files .
Reshef is especially targeting the developing world with his new project , and though Internet access is increasingly possible to come by , many students wo n't have broadband .
To make sure they can access the course materials , University of the People will start with text - based materials .
Later on , audio and video resources will be added .
Materials are only a small part of the cost of higher education , though .
There 's also the cost of all those campus buildings , which Internet learning largely eliminates , and the cost of employing all those professors .
To operate with the low fees he proposes , Reshef explained the new learning model to Ars as a combination of three factors : peer teaching , volunteers , and paid ( likely Indian ) professionals .
Students in any particular course will be broken up into a virtual class of 20 .
They will have an online forum in which they can download lectures , see discussion questions , and discuss items with one another .
Students are expected to help other students in their class learn the material , but when problems or questions arise , any student can go to the forum for the larger course and pose questions .
These questions can be answered by students in the other classes , but volunteer educators will also assist in these broader forums .
Reshef hopes to attract a community of professors , graduate students , and professionals willing to contribute a bit of time to help students from around the world .
To maintain quality , courses will also be overseen by paid staff , who will likely be based in India to save money .
The paid staff will monitor the courses , the work of the volunteers , and will step in themselves when problems arise or questions go unanswered .
Quality control
The emphasis on peer learning means that courses have no grades .
Weekly quizzes and assignments will exist , with answers provided , but these are simply meant as learning aids .
To assess the students — a necessity for any university that hopes to gain accreditation — University of the People plans to partner with worldwide testing agencies .
At the end of each course , students will need to travel to the nearest test center , show a photo ID and pay another small fee , then sit for a comprehensive course exam .
" I do n't see any reason why we wo n't be accredited , " says Reshef , who claims that the university will be " very similar to a regular American program " in terms of number of courses , content , and quality of exams .
He acknowledges that certain programs , such as science courses that require lab work , wo n't work with this model .
In addition , anything that is " culturally biased would not work , " he says , which means that teacher training programs are probably out for now .
But for programs like computer science , he believes the model will work .
It 's not the same experience as attending a four - year residential college , of course , but Reshef points out that for most of the students he wants to reach , the choice is n't between University of the People or a traditional college — it 's a choice between University of the People or nothing .
For many students , " we are the only alternative , " he says .
And so , while it's not a model that everyone will want to use , he hopes it can bring educational opportunities to those who would otherwise have none .
The school will start enrolling 300 students on a trial basis this year , with classes beginning in September .
Reshef hopes to grow by 30 percent a semester until he hits 10,000 students , at which point even the minimal fees will cover the school 's expenses .
Optimism and experience
Reshef is n't simply a wide - eyed Internet optimist , either .
He holds an MA in Chinese Politics from the University of Michigan , and he has spent most of his life since in education .
He has already helped to start an online university and is currently on the board of Cramster , an online service that helps students with homework questions .
His new venture must hurdle some significant obstacles — raising several million dollars , gaining accreditation — but if successful it could mean new opportunities for many .
It sounds like the best sort of transformative Internet thinking , but it has some way to go before it 's a reality .
The slum at the outskirts of Madurai , India , accomodating the untouchables , lies along a highly polluted and smelling canal which is used for the pigs to find a delicious bite .
If you were casting for a film about a policy academic in Whitehall , and Nicholas Stern auditioned , you would reject him on the grounds that he looked so much like a cliche that he would be a caricature .
If you were casting for the rock star of the modern climate change movement , on the other hand , he would be the last man in the world you would choose .
Middle - aged , soberly suited , grey and compact , he speaks softly in the fastidious register of academia , comprised of paragraphs constructed almost entirely out of words such as " policy framework " , " costs and benefits " , " transparency of governance " and so on .
Yet , when he speaks , the whole world now listens .
Since publishing the Stern Review in 2006 , the professor has become the global authority on climate change .
Commissioned by Gordon Brown , his study of the economics of climate change shifted the debate away from polar bears and unseasonal summers , and reframed it in the cold hard language of the balance sheet .
Unless we invested 1 % of global GDP per annum in measures to prevent climate change , the review warned , it would cost us 20 % of global GDP .
Suddenly , the CBI and the Institute of Directors were paying attention .
It was a defining moment for the credibility of a movement once belittled as too counter - culture to be taken seriously .
Stern became the grey hero of the greens - powerful precisely because he seemed such an improbable eco warrior .
Since then Stern has returned from the Treasury to the London School of Economics , been made a life peer , and is now about to publish a book - A Blueprint For a Safer Planet .
Guided by three principles of effectiveness , efficiency and fairness , it calls for an investment of closer to 2 % of GDP , with rich countries leading the way in emissions reductions .
Proposing green technologies , international emissions trading , and financing to halt deforestation , it lays out the terms by which he believes we can avert catastrophe - and as such is fundamentally hopeful .
But Stern navigates a delicate path between optimism and Armageddon , and at a recent climate change conference he was still exhorting world leaders to grasp the magnitude of the crisis .
" Do the politicians understand just how difficult it could be ? " he appealed .
" Just how devastating [ a rise of ] four , five , six degrees centigrade would be ?
I think not yet . "
With hindsight , he says he fears that even his own review underestimated the risks we face .
" When it came out , people thought I 'd over - egged the omelette .
But all the things people were looking at turned out to be worse than they thought .
Doing nothing looks even more reckless than it did even a few years ago . "
He pauses , as if uneasy with such an intemperate word , but keeps going .
" Recklessness is the only word .
I mean , we have to recognise the scale of the risk .
If we go on at anything like business as usual , we 'll be at concentration levels by the end of this century which will give us around a 50 - 50 chance of being above five degrees centigrade relative to , say , the 19th century .
We humans are only 100,000 years old .
We have n't seen that for 30 to 50 million years .
We have n't seen three degrees centigrade for three million years .
The idea that humans can easily adapt to conditions like these ... "
He lets the proposition tail away , too foolish even for words .
" What will we do ?
We 'll move .
People will move .
Why ?
Because much of southern Europe will be desert .
Other places will become underwater .
Others will be hit by such severe storms with such frequency that they become almost uninhabitable .
So hundreds of millions of people will move .
You 're already seeing people moving in Darfur , where droughts devastated the grazing land of pastoralist people , and they moved , and come into conflict with people in the places they 're moving to .
We 're seeing that already on just a 0.8 degree rise .
We 're the first generation that has the power to destroy the planet .
You 're re-writing the planet .
So you can only describe as reckless ignoring risks like that . "
At the heart of Stern 's work is a simple calculation .
If the science on climate change is right , the transition costs incurred by switching to a low - carbon economy will - however daunting - be a fraction of what we will save by averting disaster .
If the science is wrong , and we incur those costs unnecessarily , they would be " very far from disastrous " , and we would still benefit , " because we will have a world that is more energy efficient , with new and cleaner technologies , and is more biodiverse as a result of protecting the forests " .
The logic of the argument is compelling , but is there any part of Stern that believes the science could be wrong ?
" It 's very , very remote , " he says slowly .
Less than one in 100 ?
He looks surprised .
" Oh , much , much less . "
The puzzle must therefore be why anyone would still doubt it .
Nigel Lawson , for example , dismissed his review as " fraudulent " , and published a book last year disputing the entire scientific premise of climate change .
" As an undergraduate , I did maths and physics .
That does n't make me a scientist , " Stern responds , with exaggerated patience .
" So I try to read and understand and talk to scientists .
I 'm staggered by how many people who are lawyers , or politicians ... "
Or former chancellors ?
" For example , " he agrees drily .
" Taxi drivers .
People behind bars .
People cutting hair .
They all seem to be knowledgeable and expert on the science .
" In public policy we have to understand a little bit about nuclear physics , and biochemistry , and genetics .
So what do you do if you want to understand about genetics ?
You talk to a geneticist .
You do n't turn to taxi drivers or politicians .
Both respectable professions , but you do n't go to them for the science of climate change , you go to scientists .
And what do you hear ?
That this is basically simple physics .
It 's not as if it 's something strange or mysterious that people can't explain to you .
It 's not something outside the experimental .
The greenhouse effect is something you can observe experimentally - and most people have observed the greenhouse effect themselves , in greenhouses .
Yes ? "
Does Stern feel angry with sceptics - or , as he calls them , irrational optimists ?
" Well , they 're marginal now , " he says with rather withering indifference .
When he finds himself sitting next to one at a dinner party , does he even bother to argue ?
" I still believe in rational argument and communication .
It 's our duty to try .
But it is an area in which people can be deliberately destructive , " he says disdainfully .
" There 's a kind of yah boo argument : ' Do n't believe it , do n't believe it , do n't believe it . '
Or using language that 's slightly more colourful , like that Paul Whitehouse character who said bollocks to everything .
That 's the kind of thing .
It 's yah boo stuff . "
Stern suspects their perversity is ultimately down to political prejudice .
He has no patience with those on the right who assume climate change is just a Trojan horse - an excuse for the left to interfere in the market .
" This is about trying to help markets work .
This is n't anti-market , this is about making markets work well .
My position is pro-markets and pro-growth - not anti-growth .
Indeed , it 's ignoring the problem that will kill off the growth .
High carbon growth kills itself .
First on very high hydrocarbon prices , but second and , of course , much more fundamentally , on the very hostile physical environment it would create . "
But he has even less time for those on the left who think climate change is " an elitist hobby horse " ; a distraction from poverty in the developing world .
" We will not overcome world poverty unless we manage climate change successfully .
I 've spent my life as a development economist , and it 's crystal clear that we succeed or fail on winning the battle against world poverty and managing climate change together .
If we fail on one , we fail on the other . "
When we meet in his book - lined office at the LSE , Stern has just returned from breakfast with his old friend Mervyn King at the Bank of England , and I get the impression that he suffers any less cerebrally rarefied company with weary forbearance .
Oxbridge - educated , 62 , he has worked at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the World Bank and the Treasury , but " I am a public policy analyst , that 's who I am , " he says more than once .
He seems intellectually and temperamentally ill - suited to the rough and tumble of political knockabout , for to speak in a language the rest of us can understand seems a challenge - if not a chore - at times .
Sometimes , though , I suspect he deliberately obfuscates .
It was Brown who commissioned Stern 's work on climate change - yet the prime minister subsequently authorised the third runway at Heathrow .
When I ask if Stern supported that decision , his reply is somewhat opaque : " I was uncomfortable with the way that decision was structured . "
I would have thought he'd have been furious about it .
" Well , no .
I was worried about the framework for the analysis . "
What does that mean ?
" I felt that the analysis should have been done in the context of an overall strategy . "
Surely , I press , given the urgency of the situation , and the authority his voice would carry , he had a responsibility to speak out ?
" I do n't want to get into having to take a running position on each individual project and proposal .
You have to keep it in that overall perspective and we should n't turn it into a symbolic argument over one particular thing . "
Politics is symbolic , though , is n't it ?
" Yes , but I 'm not a politician giving a running commentary .
I 'm a public policy analyst . "
At other times I wonder if he understands the way less rational or educated minds work .
On policy analysis he is quite brilliant - but on the politics of the real world he can seem almost naively high - minded .
For example , his book highlights the imperative of halting deforestation , but says relatively little about the problem of corruption in developing countries where the issue applies .
Clearly , the west needs to divert some of its wealth to them , to deter deforestation .
But taxpayers complain that Africa is corrupt , and that they 've already spent decades sending aid that went straight into the pockets of officials .
Why should they send more money if it wo n't stop the forests being destroyed but will fuel corruption - while they 're being told they can't fly off on holiday whenever they like ?
" Yes , but that 's based on a misunderstanding , " he says , looking irritated .
" Progress in Africa over the last two decades has been much , much stronger than the preceding two decades .
If you ask those people to tell you how many sub-Saharan Africa countries there are , and what their growth rates were over these last four decades , they would n't be able to tell you .
They would n't have a clue . "
I 'm sure they would n't - but that seems beside the point .
Similarly , although he talks hopefully of a World Environment Organisation , he puts surprisingly little emphasis on coercion .
Wo n't we need some sort of equivalent to the International Criminal Court to enforce international agreements ?
" People have to ask themselves , if I transgress as a country what would be the implications for me and for the coalition that 's dealing with this problem ?
You 'll have to think about the consequences of your actions .
If a big country pulls out of this they can't simply say , ' Well everyone else will do their bit . '
They have to ask themselves what will happen .
It will be the politics of particular countries .
People will demand that their governments behave responsibly . "
Ultimately , he points out , the choice is quite simple : however difficult the challenge of action may be , the alternative is unthinkable .
" If you say I 'm not going to do that , what 's left ?
What 's left is you just reach for the suntan lotion and the big hat , and you say it 's all too difficult , I 'm signing off on this , and let 's all fry .
Why would you want to go there ? "
It seems more or less unimaginable to Stern that people would be stupid enough to allow a catastrophe to unfold , and his ultimate message is one of optimism .
" There are so many ideas out there , the pace of technological progress is so fast .
It 's a very optimistic thing about human nature ; when humans focus on a problem , they 're quite ingenious .
And we have to recognise that this subject is young .
It 's only been deep in our understanding for two or three years .
The scientists , of course , have been thinking about this for a long time , but in terms of politics and policy it 's been big only for two or three years .
I think if you look at it in that context , let 's recognise what the government has done .
We 're ahead of the world on climate change legislation .
I think the climate change bill is broadly along the right lines .
If you ask yourself the question , ' How far have we got ? ' , we 've got a long way .
It has to be faster , but let 's not fail to recognise how far we 've come . "
Not even the world recession has dampened his optimism .
" This recession is seen as something that would prevent action on climate change only if we confuse ourselves .
If we think clearly , this is an opportunity to bring forward some of those investments , because resources are a bit cheaper at the moment .
I 've been struck that this climate change story has stayed very much on the agenda , the way that the green stimulus has been seen as part of the expansion package .
In the next two or three decades , I think low - carbon technologies are going to be like the railways or IT - big drivers of growth . "
Stern wo n't live long enough to know if the world takes his advice .
But if he had to go to the bookies now and place a £ 1,000 bet on whether we 'll manage to do what 's necessary in time , which way would he put it ?
" I would bet , " he says cautiously , " we 'll get there .
But as in any bet , there 's a risk of being wrong " .
' There are many half - baked attempts to naysay the science , but they always unravel on inspection ' .
Jarron Gilbert Can Jump Out Of A Pool
Total Pro Sports – San Jose State ’s Jarron Gilbert is a freak of nature !
Jarron Gilbert is a 6′5 ″ 287 lbs. DE out of San Jose State , who is projected in some mocks as a late 2nd to early third round pick in the upcoming 2009 NFL Draft .
He can squat 635 pounds and dead - lift 655 pounds ( almost half of what I can do ) and yes he can jump out of a water filled pool with his shoulders and head submerged .
This may look like an easy task but we suggest you try this before you make a comment .
With the ledge of the pool almost 4 feet high and the water pressure holding you down , this task is much harder than it really looks .
Jarron Gilbert created this video to hopefully increase his draft value , we think this may have put him over the top .
Eugene Monroe , can you jump out of the pool ??????

Unemployed in Michigan
“ There ’s just nothing here — everybody is fighting for the same jobs ”
By Andre Damon
11 March 2009
Reporters from the World Socialist Web Site traveled earlier this week to the Michigan unemployment office in Livonia , a suburb of Detroit .
The unemployed people we interviewed all told common stories .
Many face plummeting home values and the prospect of foreclosure .
Others were looking for a way to get out of Michigan .
Workers complained of the abusive manner in which they had been laid off , and the difficulty they encountered claiming their unemployment benefits .
Jason Darke , a former construction worker , told us , " I ca n't find a job — not even pizza delivery .
Every time I see an ad — when I go , there are at least 10 people waiting ahead of me .
I used to install tires on construction equipment like front - loaders .
A lot of my work was on construction projects .
" I thought I was doing well , but then I lost the job I had held for 11 years .
I had to take a job where I had to travel 45 miles each way .
It was costing me $ 350 a week in gas ; I could n't afford it .
I was let go unfairly .
I have been waiting for my unemployment for over a year .
You can't believe the red tape you go through .
You can't get hold of anyone over the phone .
It 's constantly busy . "
Detroit , once the auto manufacturing capital of the world , is now the poorest large city in the US .
Michigan has an unemployment rate of 11.2 percent , the highest in the country .
The state has one the 10 highest foreclosure rates in the country .
Detroit properties often fail to sell at auction for $ 1 , are regularly abandoned , squatted in , and accidentally burned down as people burn scrap wood for heat .
The unemployment center we visited is located in Livonia , a suburb about 20 miles northwest of the city center .
Many of the workers we spoke to had originally lived in Detroit , but moved out of the city as jobs dried up .
Mary , a waitress at the diner adjacent to the unemployment center , said she used to live in Detroit , but moved out to Livonia to find work .
" There 's really nothing here , " she said .
" I just really want to get away from Michigan , but I can't .
My house is n't worth what I paid for it , and I can't sell it under these conditions .
I had a chance to move out a few years ago , but now I 'm stuck here . "
Jessica , a laid - off computer programmer who we met outside the unemployment center , said , " Both my husband and I , who is also a programmer , lost our jobs .
We tried to lower our mortgage payment , but the bank said it could n't do that unless we showed proof of income .
So now we 'll probably have to foreclose .
I do n't know how long we can hold out , but you can't argue with the bank . "
An unemployed nurse told us , " I have been trying to get work since December .
I still have not been able to get anything yet .
A lot of hospitals just are not hiring anymore .
I have still not received any unemployment benefits .
The system tells me that everything is accepted , but I never get the money . "
Since most Michigan jobless file for benefits online , the workers passing through the unemployment center were there to resolve problems with their claims .
Many people we spoke to said that companies were intentionally trying to obstruct their claims in order to avoid paying their half of unemployment insurance .
John Demarco
John Demarco , an accountant , said he was fighting with his former employer for unemployment benefits .
His employer claims that John was intentionally underperforming to get fired and collect unemployment .
" They test every employee to see who they can try to deny unemployment to , " he said .
" I was n't told anything before I got laid off .
I just got called into a meeting , and they told me I did n't have a job any more .
Their claims are absurd ; I brought in four times my salary .
The company I used to work for consulted other firms on how to cut benefits .
That 's part of my case .
" If I do n't find a job , I might have to move out of state ; that 's what everybody else is doing .
" I come from a working class family , and a lot of my friends work for the auto companies .
Many of them are unemployed too .
Those who are still working are getting reduced pay and benefits .
I have friends who work at Delphi and have had their pay cut in half after the new contact . "
Vincent Drake found himself in the same situation as John Demarco .
He used to work as a salesman at Pfizer .
After retiring , he got a job passing out free samples at Costco .
Club Demonstration Services , the company contracted by Costco for temporary workers , is disputing his unemployment claim .
Vincent told us , " They treat workers like they 're nothing .
We have little old ladies and disabled people working there , and they act like the workers are completely expendable .
Nobody 's there to protect us .
" They let the company lawyers give the charges over the phone instead of appearing in person .
If you ask me , companies try to draw out the process as long as they can , hoping you get killed or maimed in the meantime .
I guess it 's easier to pay 60 lawyers to sit in an office and dispute unemployment claims than it is to actually pay workers who have been laid off . "
Aslam Shaik
We met Aslam Shaik while he was coming to check on the status of his unemployment payments .
He was an information technology manager at Lear — the auto parts maker — before losing his job .
" Nineteen ninety - nine through 2009 was a very bad decade for all the workers in the auto industry , " he said .
" Of all the workers that Leer had 10 years ago , maybe 20 percent are left . "
Dennis Cronk , a former electrician at General Motors , came to the unemployment center to correct a payment error .
He was laid off from the Warren transmission plant , together with almost 300 other workers .
He was told his plant would close by 2012 , and another 700 to 800 people will lose their jobs .
He has been an electrician for 18 years , and had worked at GM for seven .
Dennis Cronk
" My house is in foreclosure , " Dennis said .
" When I bought it , I paid $ 165,000 .
Now it 's worth $ 110,000 .
I 'm a single parent with three children .
I 've completely wiped out my 401 ( k ) and my savings are depleted .
I have nowhere to go .
" Over the past few decades , pay for executives has increased three or four hundred times ; ours has gone down .
What happens if you halve an executive 's pay ?
He 's still a millionaire .
You could do it again and again and he'd still be rich .
What happens when you halve a worker 's pay ?
He can't afford his house .
And when a lot of workers can't afford their houses , you have a problem . "

Working over the site .
2011 02 12
The content was not changed , not so the site .
I 've chosen green to be my color .
Good luck ,
tenner
Let 's face the truth .
2010 09 27 I missed to update my age , which should have happened three week ago .
I absolutely lack time to fill in any content on a regular base .
Only the playlist will be altered automatically .
Things might change in the future , who knows .
This site is not dead yet , just frozen :-)
Have fun ,
tenner
Oh , noes .
It happened again .
2009 09 07 Happy Birthday to me .
It updates faster than I thought .
2009 05 02
Well , I promised more things to come and here they are .
I had to fix some of the CSS stuff , since it looked fucked up using the Internet Explorer .
Not that I care a lot about it , but well .
Besides that , I also have a fancy news - feed icon in the top right corner now , getting mainstream as you can see .
Furthermore there are several styles that were made for geek00L and the predecessor of the HeX liveCD from the raWPacket Security Team .
He gave his OK to put them on this site , so here they are : icicle_open , icicle , cup , mydefcon_6 , mydefcon_5 , mydefcon_4 , mydefcon_3 , mydefcon_2 , mydefcon_1 .
The next post might take a bit longer , but I alreay have new things to work on .
Have fun .
Surrendering to the dark side .
2009 05 02 NO !
I am not changing to windows ( tm ) .
I am just talking about this website .
You may have noticed some little visual changes though the content was not touched .
Anyway , there were two new Styles added : teriaki and sunlense .
Also , I added three simple wallpaper to my deviantart account .
Check them out here if you want :

Even if I might repeat myself , but I 'm going to update this site more often , I was kind of stunned when I looked at the date of the last posting .
Again , more to come .

I felt like making a fresh one , maybe someone likes it .
You might want to check the .
Xdefaults file ( also in the snippets section ) and look for " colorset3 ( sloppy ) " to get the colors right .
A special wallpaper and a funny coincidence .
2008 06 12
Even though this looks like a blog , I can ensure you it 's not ... yet .
Ok , you all know that little MacOS X walls , that blue abstract , overlayed with white , blurry thingies , erm things .
Well , someone was wondering how they are made , without spending hours on adjusting layer modes ( he tried it in photoshop , some application i do n't claim to like very much ) .
I showed him how to bring up that simple background using a wonderful open source project called inkscape .
It took me something about 10 minutes plus some minutes tuning in the GIMP .
You all can dignify the result at http://10r.deviantart.com/art/abstract-blue-88572288.
Do n't be to frugal with your NICE comments on it :-D .
Well , just kidding .
What was actually really making me grin is , that in the beginning of the year , I ran into an incredibly nice site , that offers great turorials about using inkscape .
In this particular case I 'm talking about http://screencasters.heathenx.org/episode-053/, which describes exactly what I did to achieve the wallpaper .
This is not funny at all some might say , but ... some of those some might also remember the site http://www.linuxreality.com.
A site that used to offer nifty podcasts for linux beginners .
One cast was about fluxbox ( hey I was mentioned :-) ) in a series of the most common windowmanagers .
The site 's logo was somehow created by heathenx and Richard Querin or least they seem to have been heavily involved in creating it .
Those two guys actually are the guys , who run http://screencasters.heathenx.org, the site that has the tutorial , showing how to make those Mac OS X wallpapers , which is the topic of this post here .
Ok , comes out rather boring , reading throught it a second time if you do n't remember all bits but at least you have learned about a great site dedicated to inkscape .
So , thank you for reading , I 'm tenner .
Adding the styles made for fluxbox 1.0 .
2008 06 09 New Styles added : arch , bloe , bora_black , bora_blue , bora_green , zimek_bisque , zimek_darkblue , zimek_green .
This seems to be strange somehow since all those styles should come with an install from your distro's repositories but just in case they do n't .
Hell there , what happened ?
2008 06 05 New Styles added : carbonium_yellow , carbonium_red , carbonium_pink , carbonium_orange , carbonium_green , carbonium_blue , carbonit .
Hello again , the site looks different ?
Yes it does .
I changed the layout a bit again .
I did n't feel comfortable with the first one and since this only took ~ 15 minutes , it was done quite fast .
Anyway , i put the little " space_dapp howto " back online again .
Some might remember it .
If not , then go there and check it out .
This might be the uber - application you 've always been searching for .
Furthermore I added one wallpaper to my deviantart account .
I guess I should upload more .
There still are some unfinished images .
News - Feed available again .
2008 05 23
If you want then you can get the RSS - Feed for tenr .de now .
One style was added and searching is enabled again .
2008 05 22 New Style added : trinity .
This style was around for quit a big time , really found it by accident .
Since the development version supports different border - colors for focused and unfocused windows now , this was ready to be finished .
Also the little search option was put online again on the style - page .
This was basicly made for personal purposes , but obviously some really miss it :-) .
You can try it here with something like " blue " or " green " or any other color .
That 's the way i like to use it .
Another thing added is the " wall of styles " , which just shows all styles from this site at once .
Besides that the litte " how to use space_dapp " text was added to the howtos on the snippets page .
Some styles were added .
2008 05 16 New Styles added : limish , greeworks , ginfizz , cobalt , blueworks , camo2 .
Those styles were originally done for a project called " fluxbuntu " .
I jumped off the ship due to lack of time , but it still exists .
From what I 've heard it 's not dead , just slowly moving .
i'm quite curious about the further progress .
Searching for some info i stumbled upon the group head 's blog http://blog.joejaxx.org
... I can tell you it 's highly annoying after 5 minutes but for fuck 's sake , is 's really funny to play around with it 8 ) .
New site , different colors , different idea , welcome to the blockworld .
2008 05 13 Hello folks , tenr .de went back to activity .
As you can see the site was stripped down radically , stripped down to what seemed important to me .
Fluxbox styles are still and always will be part of it , but things like the wallpapers and screenshots have gone from the site .
Those are now at my account on deviantart.com ( http://10r.deviantart.com).
I thought it might be a better idea to let them do it , since that 's what they do .
My resource files are available as always , so is the stuff related to fluxbox .
Well just explore the site , it 's not too big :-) .
For those who might miss the news feed ( if even anyone recognized or used it ) , let me know and i'll include it again .
Things that are in line to get up are some styles , a makeover of the " fluxbox style howto " and some of the old news that are worth to put them in somewhere .
That means the old site is gone and it wo n't come back .
That 's it so far , might be more to come ,
tenner .
« Go back to the short news .
The babies are shown on television .
After viewing her first interview ( the mother of 14 , Nadya Suleman ) and this one , my take the woman is not viewing reality .
She is delusional , stating after she finishes her schooling she will be able to take care of her children .
A mother who is unmarried , no job , living with her parents , and will definitely be looking for money for this story either here in the U.S. or abroad .
Suleman says she is not accepting any welfare , but must have forgot that food stamps and SSI payments are government assistance programs .
And disability payments for 3 of her 6 kids , but will not say what their disabilities are ?
And her family ?
Well , her mother is tired of it and overwhelmed .
And states , " The truth is Nadya 's not capable of raising 14 children . "
Finally , who is going to take care of all these kids ?
The State of California ?
A church ?
But for how long ?
Where is the father ?
Fertility Doctor being investigated
Nadya Suleman , the woman who gave birth to octuplets last month , is receiving $ 490 a month in food stamps , and three of her first six children are disabled and receiving federal assistance , her publicist confirmed to The Times .
Publicist Michael Furtney confirmed the information after two sources told The Times that Suleman was receiving food stamps and federal supplemental security income .
Suleman had told NBC News correspondent Ann Curry in an interview that she was not receiving welfare .
Furtney said Suleman did n't consider the food stamps and SSI to be welfare .
“ In Nadya ’s view , the money that she gets from the food stamp program ... and the resources disabilities payments she gets for her three children are not welfare , " he said .
" They are part of programs designed to help people with need , and she does not see that as welfare . "
Research presented today at the International Scientific Congress on Climate Change in Copenhagen shows that the upper range of sea level rise by 2100 could be in the range of about one meter , or possibly more .
In the lower end of the spectrum it looks increasingly unlikely that sea level rise will be much less than 50 cm by 2100 .
This means that if emissions of greenhouse gases is not reduced quickly and substantially , even the best case scenario will hit low lying coastal areas housing one in ten humans on the planet hard .
Dr John Church of the Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research , Hobart , Tasmania , Australia and the lead speaker in the sea level session , told the conference , " The most recent satellite and ground based observations show that sea - level rise is continuing to rise at 3 mm / yr or more since 1993 , a rate well above the 20th century average .
The oceans are continuing to warm and expand , the melting of mountain glacier has increased and the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica are also contributing to sea level rise . "
New insights reported include the loss of ice from the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets .
" The ice loss in Greenland has accelerated over the last decade .
The upper range of sea level rise by 2100 might be above 1 m or more on a global average , with large regional differences depending where the source of ice loss occurs " , says Konrad Steffen , Director of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences ( CIRES ) at the University of Colorado , Boulder and co-chair of the congress session on sea level rise .
The last assessment report from the IPCC from 2007 projected a sea level rise of 18 - 59 centimeter .
However the report also clearly stated that not all factors contributing to sea level rise could be calculated at that time .
The uncertainty was centered on the ice sheets , how they react to the effects of a warmer climate and how they interact with the oceans , explains Eric Rignot , Professor of Earth System Science at the University of California Irvine and Senior Research Scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
" The numbers from the last IPCC are a lower bound because it was recognized at the time that there was a lot of uncertainty about ice sheets .
The numerical models used at the time did not have a complete representation of outlet glaciers and their interactions with the ocean .
The results gathered in the last 2 - 3 years show that these are fundamental aspects that cannot be overlooked .
As a result of the acceleration of outlet glaciers over large regions , the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are already contributing more and faster to sea level rise than anticipated .
If this trend continues , we are likely to witness sea level rise one meter or more by year 2100 " , he says .
" Unless we undertake urgent and significant mitigation actions , the climate could cross a threshold during the 21st century committing the world to a sea level rise of metres " , said John Church
" Measurements around the world show that sea level has risen almost 20 centimeters since 1880 , " explains Professor Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research , who will give the plenary speech on sea level rise at the congress .
These data also reveal that the rate of sea level rise is closely linked to temperature : sea level rises faster the warmer it gets .
" If sea level keeps rising at a constant pace , we will end up in the middle of that 18 - 59 cm IPCC range by 2100 , " says Rahmstorf .
" But based on past experience I expect that sea level rise will accelerate as the planet gets hotter . "
The impacts of sea level rise - even in the lower ranges of the current predictions - looks to be severe .
Approximately ten percent of the worlds population - 600 million people - live in low lying areas in danger of being flooded ( 1 ) .
A previously released study led by John Church , shows that even a modest sea level rise of 50 centimeters will result in a major increase in the number of coastal flooding events .
" Our study centered on Australia showed that coastal flooding events that today we expect only once every hundred years will happen several times a year by 2100 " , says John Church .
John Church also brings new results of the current sea level rise to the congress , " Sea level is currently rising at a rate that is above any of the model projections of 18 to 59 cm " .
" Different groups may come to slightly different projections , but differences in the details of the projections should not cloud the overall picture where even the lower end of the projections looks to have very serious effects , " says Konrad Steffen .

NEW ORLEANS , Louisiana ( CNN ) -- New Orleans police lined up " like at a firing range " and fatally shot an unarmed man in the back as he fled from them in the days after Hurricane Katrina swept ashore , a witness to the shooting told CNN .
It marks the first time a witness has come forward publicly with information about the shooting of Ronald Madison , a 40 - year - old mentally retarded man whose death has sparked a police investigation and a grand jury probe into what happened in and around the Danziger Bridge that day .
" He just fell like he was collapsing , " Kasimir Gaston told CNN .
" Like something just wiped him out . "
( Watch Gaston describe what he saw )
Gaston was one of many flood refugees living on the second floor of the Friendly Inn , a low - income motel on the city 's east side .
On Sunday , September 4 of last year , he says he woke up and stepped onto the balcony of the motel and saw a man running , hands outstretched and being fired upon .
Initial police accounts said that Madison reached for his waistband and turned on police , but Gaston said Madison did not appear to have a weapon and that he was running away from police " hands out , full speed " when he was shot .
Police declined CNN 's request for an interview .
After the shooting last year , police said officers had responded to reported gunshots on the Danziger Bridge and that a running gunbattle ensued with six suspects .
One teenager was killed near the base of the bridge and three other people were wounded , according to police reports .
A police department press release from October 4 , 2005 , said Madison , described as an unidentified gunman , was " confronted by a New Orleans Police officer .
The suspect reached into his waist and turned toward the officer who fired one shot , fatally wounding him . "
When asked if Madison had a gun , Gaston said , " I did n't see any on him . "
No gun was found on Madison 's body .
An autopsy obtained previously by CNN and verified by the Orleans Parish Coroner said Madison suffered five gunshot wounds to his back and two in his shoulder .
( Watch police describe a running ' gunbattle ' )
' What I saw with my own eyes '
Gaston said he came forward now because he is still troubled by what happened .
He said he decided to break his silence after watching a " CNN Presents " documentary , " Shoot to Kill , " about the days after Katrina hit the Gulf Coast on August 29 , 2005 .
CNN has visited the room where Gaston was staying .
From that balcony , it is about 100 feet to where Madison was shot and killed .
The police department has said the shooting has been thoroughly investigated .
But Gaston said no officer or detective approached him about what he saw .
He was not asked for his name or phone number , Gaston said .
Gaston said his only contact with police on that day was when officers told him not to touch Madison 's body , which was lying behind Gaston 's truck , parked in the motel entranceway .
CNN has obtained a newspaper photo taken that Sunday morning that shows where the body fell .
The back of a truck with a rusted trailer hitch and broken tail light can be seen in the photo .
The photo appears to be Gaston 's truck , which now sits in a parking lot in Dallas , Texas , where he now lives .
" They notified me that I had two bullet holes in the passenger side , " he said .
Two bullet marks can be seen at the right rear of the truck today .
Mary Howell , an attorney suing New Orleans police on behalf of the dead man 's family , says there were several potential witnesses living at the Friendly Inn at the time of the shooting .
She has accused police of violating procedures by failing to even write down their names .
Howell said Ronald Madison and his older brother , Lance Madison , were trying to avoid the shootout between police and others that day when they ran up the Danziger Bridge , toward the other side of the Industrial Canal .
Lance Madison has said a policeman pointed what looked like a rifle or shotgun at his brother and shot Ronald near the top of the bridge .
Lance said he helped carry his wounded brother to the entrance of the motel and left him there while he ran for help .
After being arrested , Lance was brought back to the motel where , he says , he first saw his brother was dead .
Howell said police , in the chaos after Hurricane Katrina , failed to properly investigate the fatal shooting and are now trying to put everything behind them .
" There 's a lot of things that have been washed away with this hurricane , " Howell said .
" We are doing everything we can to make sure this is not one of them . "
While the family of Ronald Madison presses on with its lawsuit , a grand jury in New Orleans is investigating the case .
Gaston said he is willing to testify before the grand jury if it will help get to the truth .
" I 'm not trying to say nobody did this and nobody did that , " Gaston said .
" I 'm just saying what I saw and being truthful and honest about what I saw with my own eyes . "
MOTOR oil would seem to be a good candidate for a green makeover , especially because Americans use so much of it , and often dispose of it improperly .
According to a survey by the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association , 585 million gallons of engine oil , under a huge number of brand names , were sold for gasoline engines in 2007 .
Standard motor oil is not exactly environmentally friendly , especially once it is used .
The Department of Health and Human Services says oil can contain such toxic substances as benzene , lead , zinc and cadmium .
Consumers are urged to dispose of used oil properly at recycling centers , including local garages .
While an automotive - products company in Stamford , Conn. , has not solved the recycling problem , it says it has developed a way to make engine oil a bit greener .
And the solution involves cows — thousands of them .
Image Green Earth Technologies has been selling G - Oil since last May .
The company , Green Earth Technologies , has been selling G - Oil since last May .
The oil is made from beef tallow and is a byproduct of the slaughterhouse business .
According to Dr. Mat Zuckerman , the company president , one cow yields 110 quarts of oil .
In the Oklahoma panhandle some 50,000 cattle are processed every day within 150 miles of the company ’s plant in Guymon .
Does that make G - Oil green and a renewable resource ?
Dr. Zuckerman said he thought so .
How many arms does a spiral galaxy have ?
Can you spot a galaxy with a " peanut " bulge ?
Or how about a galactic merger ?
You — yes , you — can answer these and other strange questions , along with other ordinary web users who , by working together , have proven to be just as good at galaxy - spotting as professional astronomers .
The new initiative is a follow - up to the highly successful Galaxy Zoo project that enabled members of the public to take part in astronomy research online .
Originally the site asked members of the public to describe the million galaxies captured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey , to say whether each galaxy was spiral or elliptical , and which way it was rotating .
Galaxy Zoo 2 asks them to delve deeper into 250,000 of the brightest and best galaxies , to search for the strange and unusual .
Messier 66 : one of the galaxies imaged by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .
Image courtesy Sloan Digital Sky Survey .
This time the Zoo wants more detailed descriptions :
Is the galaxy a flat disk ?
How many spiral arms are there ?
Is there a ring ?
Does it look like two galaxies are merging ?
From these more detailed descriptions , astronomers can start to understand the how galaxies were formed ( for an example of what the shape of galaxies can tell us about the structure of the Universe see Lensing helps see in the dark ) .
All you have to do is register at Galaxy Zoo 2 .
" The first Galaxy Zoo provided us with a Rough Guide to the sky and now we want our users to fill in all the details and create a real Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxies , " said Dr Chris Lintott of Oxford University , one of the founders of Galaxy Zoo .
Astronomers came up with the idea of getting online volunteers involved because the human brain is still better at doing pattern recognition tasks than a computer .
What they had not expected was the huge enthusiasm for the project ; in the last 18 months 80 million classifications of galaxies were submitted on one million objects at www.galaxyzoo.org by more than 150,000 armchair astronomers from all over the world .
As with the original site , people are free to look at and describe as many galaxies as they like &mdash even five minutes ' work will provide a valuable contribution .
Galaxy Zoo 2 is intended to be even more fun , as galaxies are pitted against each other in " Galaxy Wars " ( which one is more spirally ? ) and users can compete against their friends to describe more objects as well as record their best finds .
" Galaxy Zoo has given everyone with a computer an opportunity to contribute to real scientific research .
We want people to feel truly involved in the project and keep them up to date with what we 're doing and with the results they 're generating , " said Dr Steven Bamford of the University of Nottingham .
Proof that unusual discoveries can be made is the catalogue of merging galaxies provided by users &mdash more than 3000 of these rare cosmic pile - ups have been caught in the act by Galaxy Zoo volunteers .
The team have already used the IRAM radio telescope in Spain 's Sierra Nevada to follow up the most exciting mergers , and are asking for more examples to study .
" In this International Year of Astronomy , it 's great to have so many people looking at these beautiful image of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey , " said Professor Bob Nichol of the University of Portsmouth , a member of the original Galaxy Zoo team .
" No single professional astronomer has ever looked at all these images and sometimes astronomers miss the wonder of what they are .
I think the public get this better than us . "
An utterly selfish mother :
There 's no father , her house is a pig-sty , she lives on welfare and she ALREADY has six children
Nadya Suleman with newborn octuplet Isaiah Angel Solomon
Parroting chunks of psychobabble from textbooks she once read on a college child - rearing course and throwing in a few pearls of homespun wisdom , Nadya Suleman is striving to present herself as a paragon of modern motherhood .
' There 's no such thing as a supermum - but I 'm trying ! ' this one - woman baby machine trills , as she attempts to justify her decision to undergo the fertility treatment which produced the world 's first all - surviving octuplets , even though she already has six young children - but no husband , job or money .
' I 've had to retrain myself with counselling programmes .
You learn about children and what they really need , and how to do play therapy , and I really am able to apply that to my own children .
A lot of parents do n't have the advantage of that .
' People ask me how I will be able to afford to take them all on holiday .
But children do n't actually need holidays .
They 're just an adult creation .
Children just need you to sit and talk to them in the beauty of nature .
When it comes down to it , all they really need is grass and worms . '
Headline hunger : Miss Suleman has given a string of media interviews since the birth of her eight babies
You suspect that Suleman , 33 - who appears to have conveniently forgotten the material price of her self - confessed obsession with procreation ( it will cost the Californian taxpayers up to £ 2.1 million in medical fees and welfare handouts ) - would blithely gabble on in this vein for ever if no one interrupted her .
With a child 's exquisite timing , her oldest son , Elijah , does just that .
' Mom , mom , take me to the DVD store !' he demands .
Listening to Suleman as she defends her decision to raise 14 test - tube children without what she calls quaintly ' a significant other ' , what strikes you most is her unswerving self - belief .
She is utterly convinced that no one is better suited to the gargantuan task that will confront her next month when the eight newborns are expected to come home .
All around her , however , the evidence suggests otherwise .
She may see herself as an enlightened Earth Mother , but her chaotic world is like that of the nursery rhyme about the old woman who lived in a shoe and has so many children she does n't know what to do .
Take the house where the octuplets will live .
With jawdropping naivety , she describes the three - bedroom bungalow , which belongs to her mother Angela , as ' one big play den ' .
Earth mother ?
Nadya Suleman eight days before the birth of her octuplets
She has stripped away all but the most basic furniture to accommodate what she regards as the true essentials of family life : trampolines , swings , wooden horses , toy tractors and a huge playhouse .
In truth , however , it is little short of a pigsty .
Nestling in one corner of a quiet cul - de-sac in Whittier - a Californian town 15 miles from Los Angeles , but which retains an air of bygone American charm - it ought to be the perfect place to raise children .
Yet , in contrast with the other homes in the street , it appears rundown and neglected .
A heap of expensive but discarded toys stands beside the bins and the garden is laden with bikes , pushchairs and skateboards .
Inside , the ambience is little short of bedlam .
The walls are smeared with food and scribbled writing ; the windows are not covered with curtains but old bed sheets ; clothes are scattered everywhere ; and the six children run Nadya ragged .
For reasons that will become clear , each of these six were conceived through IVF , just as the octuplets were .
They were born between 2001 and 2007 - four single pregnancies and one set of twins - and , if Suleman is to be believed , all 14 of her offspring have the same father .
' The twins are always fighting - they do n't look alike and they 're totally different from each other , ' she says , trying to calm squabbling two - year - olds Caleb and Calyssa , who are doing their best to sabotage her first newspaper interview .
Octuplet number one : Noah , male , 2lb 11oz
Octuplet number two : Maliah , female , 2lb 12oz
Then there is seven - year - old Elijah , the oldest of the six .
He suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .
His condition is evidently so serious that his grandfather Edward Suleman , an Arabic interpreter who works in Iraq , generously pays £ 1,250 a month for him to attend a private school .
Amerah , at six , seems mercifully healthy and well - adjusted , as does five - year - old Jacob , but Aidan , aged three , is autistic - which makes him , in his mother 's eyes , ' a special blessing ' - and Calyssa has speech problems .
In addition to her £ 340 - a- month state - provided food stamps , Suleman receives about £ 550 in benefits for each of the three children diagnosed with disabilities , giving her handouts of almost £ 2,000 a month in total .
As the octuplets are not yet three weeks old , and still spend most of their time in a row of incubators , no one knows what kind of long - term support they might require .
But since Noah , Isaiah , Nariyah , Josiah , Jeremiah , Jonah , Maliyah and Makai ( each of whom has the same middle name , Angel ) weighed only between 1lb 8 oz and 3lb 4oz , and they were born ten weeks prematurely , it seems likely that Suleman will soon be applying for a lot more state aid .
At a time when millions of U.S. citizens are struggling with terrible financial hardship , no wonder that one TV interviewer described her this week as ' the most vilified mother in America ' .
Nor that she has been the subject of so many death threats she was forced into hiding after the births .
Octuplet number three : Isaiah , male , 3lb 4oz
Octuplet number four : Nariah , female , 2lb 8oz
' That part has been a nightmare , ' she told me .
' They had to sneak me out of hospital .
I had to be away from the children for two days and I could n't stop crying .
But I needed to get out and be secure . '
She spends most of her time at home , watched by a security firm and besieged by the world 's Press .
When her babies leave hospital , the scrutiny will only intensify .
Even with the help of her nanny , plus the army of church volunteers who have promised to help , you wonder how she will cope when 14 children are billeted in three cramped bedrooms .
But there is , of course , a more pressing question .
Why , against all the acceptable social parameters , did she choose to bring so many children into her already chaotic world ?
According to Suleman , her impulsion can be explained away by her own childhood .
She has described this as ' dysfunctional ' , but now says she regrets using that term , presumably because it has upset her parents , and prefers to call it ' not typical ' .
Whatever phrase she chooses , however , her story must be treated with caution , for she sometimes appears to create her own reality .
She has , for example , changed her first and second names several times during her 33 years .
She also insists that she has never had plastic surgery , even though those who see her regularly say otherwise , and she looks radically different than she did in photographs taken a few years ago .

Octuplet number six : Josiah , male , 2lb 12oz
' It 's weird , my face always swells up before and after I have children , ' she says by way of explanation .
' I 'm 5ft 6in and normally weigh about 81/ 2st , but my weight doubled to 171/ 2st when I was pregnant with the octuplets . '
Born in Fullerton , California , in 1976 , Suleman portrays herself as a lonely child raised in a loveless home .
During her formative years , she says her Palestine - born father and Lithuanian mother slept in separate rooms , staying together only for her sake and splitting up when she left home , aged 20 .
Edward Suleman , whose values she says she shares , had wanted lots of children , but his wife Angela felt differently .
The net result was that Nadya spent her girlhood plaintively begging her parents to give her brothers and sisters .
During her late teens , she developed powerful urges to produce children of her own .
Her mother was so worried about Nadya 's obsession that she took her to a psychiatrist , who , she says , reassured her that she was normal .
Despite the fact her parents abhor her decision to have eight more children , they have , commendably , stood by her .
Both are approaching their 70s , but Mr Suleman is taking time off from his work in the Middle East to support his daughter , while his ex-wife works herself to exhaustion helping to care for the grandchildren .
Suleman 's pathological quest for children began in earnest when she was 19 and met Marcos Gutierrez , a Hispanic cousin of her room - mate at college , where both were training to be nursing assistants in a psychiatric hospital .
They married in 1996 when she was 21 , but stayed together for barely two years and are now divorced .
Octuplet number seven : Jeremiah , male , 1lb 15oz
Octuplet number eight : Jonah , male , 2lb 11oz
' I thought at first that I loved him , but really I was more in love with having children , ' Suleman tells me in her girlish voice .
' We split up , but we are still friendly .
He has n't been in touch since I had eight more , though - he 's probably too shocked . '
It was during her brief marriage that Suleman discovered she could not have children naturally because of blocked fallopian tubes .
Records show she had three miscarriages and was later told that her only chance was IVF .
After the marriage broke up , she claims to have explored the possibility of adoption , only to be told that she would never be considered because she was single .
In the event , she went back to a friend she had met in a nightclub in her teens and asked if he would provide the sperm that brought her 14 children .
Here , the story gets murkier .
If we believe Suleman , the donor is called David Solomon - a name which sound suspiciously close to her own , though she adds cryptically , that this might not be his full name .
Was she his girlfriend ?
' We went out on one platonic date , but it never became anything because I realised he was young and liked dating lots of women , and I was n't interested in that , ' she says .
But they remained friendly , and when she asked him to help her have babies , he readily agreed .
' Most vilfied ' : Nadya Suleman with two of her children in 2006
Where and how many times Suleman went for IVF treatment to conceive her first six children is not clear .
Quite how she paid also remains a mystery , for she says she did not use the £ 147,000 compensation payout she received following a spinal injury sustained in 1999 during a patient disturbance at the psychiatric hospital where she worked .
But through her IVF efforts , Suleman managed to produce enough fertilised embryos to freeze some of them .
She confirms that the octuplets came about after Iranian fertility specialist Dr Michael Kamrava implanted six fertilised embryos in her womb , with two of them splitting later to produce eight babies in total .
Kamrava is a highly controversial figure , who has been sued for £ 240,000 by a British female employee who left his clinic after just two weeks , appalled by his overbearing personality as much as his methodology .
He is also being investigated for breach of professional guidelines - the recommended limit for implanted embryos is just two .
Suleman claims the doctor implanted so many only because he believed that , given her medical history , just one or two of them would grow to fruition .
' I would have been very happy with just one more baby , ' she says .
She could have opted to ' selectively reduce ' the number of embryos , but is horrified at the very thought .
' I could n't imagine disposing of them . '
So what does she say to those who accuse her of behaving irresponsibly and even immorally ?
After all , she is not only single , but deeply in debt , owing at least £ 35,000 in student loans .
' I will admit that children need a father , I 'm not going to defend myself against that , ' she says .
' But I knew there was a limited timeframe in which I could have children and I had just six ( frozen and stored ) embryos left and I was determined to use them all .
' With the six I have no problems , but I 'm expecting 14 to be extremely challenging .
One human being can't possibly give enough love and emotion to each of them , so I 'll have to accept letting go and asking for help - and that 's difficult for me because I 'm a bit of a control freak .
So what role , if any , does the mysterious ' David Solomon ' , who has yet to reveal himself , intend to play in the octuplets ' upbringing ?
' Maybe some day in the future he 'll be interested in seeing them , but it 's not my choice .
I can't say whether he wants to play a part in their life . '
She last spoke to him when she was pregnant with what she then believed to be septuplets , she says .
' He was n't angry but he was speechless . '
He must have been even more shocked when he learned that the sharp upper torso pains which Suleman began to suffer in late pregnancy were actually baby number eight .
The tiniest child , Makai , had been lodged behind her ribs , and went undetected by the sonogram .
Despite weighing 171/ 2 st and being confined to a wheelchair during the final days , Suleman appears to have relished the pregnancy , with all its attendant expectation and attention .
Her only regret is that she had to have a Caesarean section at 30 weeks and three days , because the blood supply from her placenta to baby Jonah had stopped , and he would have died if the operation was not performed immediately .
Within five minutes of the operation , however , all eight had been delivered - and fought the odds to survive .
' It was amazing .
It still has n't sunk in , ' their mother says so joyfully that you momentarily suspend judgment of her .
The historic event was captured on video by Suleman 's best friend , whose constant jostling for better camera angles when the 46 - strong delivery team were working caused ' an altercation ' with one nurse .
The film will no doubt boost the fortune she is expected to receive for her story and commercial deals - if , that is , her PR image - makers can change the U.S. 's attitude towards her .
However , Suleman insists it will all go into a trust fund for the children .
So much for the mother 's version of events .
The story the grandmother tells this weekend in a mass - selling U.S. magazine contains significant differences .
Angela Suleman says she begged the doctor who implanted Nadya 's first six children not to help her have any more , and he agreed .
But then she went to a second specialist - presumably Kamrava .
More damagingly , Angela claims that the sperm donor is really her daughter 's besotted Mexican - American former boyfriend , who wanted to marry her , but was rejected because she was determined to have the children on her own .
The donor was duped into providing sperm in the belief that it would lead to a lasting relationship , she allegedly told the magazine .
She added that her daughter was not capable of caring for six children , let alone 14 .
Sadly , the disquieting scenes in that Whittier cul - de- sac this week have done nothing to dispel that stark summation .
New figures on the UK economy show that it fell even deeper into recession in the fourth quarter of last year than first thought , piling the pressure on the prime minister .
Revised data from the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) showed that gross domestic product shrank by 1.6 % in the last three months of 2008 , rather than the 1.5 % previously reported .
Worse than previously expected output in construction and services was blamed for the downward revision .
It is the worst performance since the second quarter of 1980 and confirms Britain is in the middle of a deep downturn following a contraction of 0.7 % in the third quarter of last year and zero growth in the second .
The annual decline was also revised lower , to 2 % from 1.9 % previously , the worst since 1991 .
Opposition politicians claimed the data was another blow to Gordon Brown 's authority .
The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury , Philip Hammond , said : " Far from being better prepared for the recession as Brown told us , the UK economy is shrinking more than the United States , and faster than in the previous recession . "
The Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman , Vince Cable , added : " These figures confirm just how hopelessly optimistic the government 's assessment of the state of the economy has been .
" Gordon Brown has become his own worst nightmare , presiding over a fall in the UK economy not seen since the dark days of the last Tory recession . "
The breakdown of the data also showed a big jump in the so - called savings ratio - the amount households save rather than spend - probably resulting from the big cuts in interest rates in recent months which have improved cash flow to some people .
It also showed that destocking by firms hit a record £ 4.2 bn in the three - month period .
The running down of stocks by firms is always a key part of a recession and usually has to run its course before firms are ready to boost production again .
" Inventory shedding in the UK economy is well under way , " said Philip Shaw , chief economist at Investec bank .
" It is somewhat more advanced than in other industrialised economies .
Hence we are very sceptical of the IMF 's claim that the British economy will contract by 3.8 % this year and that it faces a worse downturn than the majority of its competitors . "
Economists fear the current quarter could show an even deeper contraction after retail sales data on Thursday showed the biggest drop for 14 years , suggesting that consumer spending overall has flagged in the face of tens of thousands of job losses .
Separate data from the Land Registry today suggested that the housing market remains in freefall .
It said prices in England and Wales fell by 2 % in February , from January , leaving them 16.5 % down from a year earlier .
The average house price is now down to £ 153,862 .
" While latest mortgage approvals data suggest that housing market activity may have bottomed out and survey evidence indicates that buyer enquiries have picked up significantly recently as people are attracted by lower house prices and the Bank of England slashing interest rates , we remain sceptical that sales will pick up substantially anytime soon and put a floor under prices , " said Howard Archer , economist at IHS Global Insight .
The Bank of England 's chief economist , Spencer Dale , said in a speech this morning that the economy would probably recover at the end of 2009 but the risks were weighted to the downside and policymakers may need to take more action .
" As we go through 2009 , I believe that it is most likely the pace at which output is contracting will ease and that we will see some signs of recovery by around the turn of this year , " he told an Association of British Insurers conference .
" I think the risks around this central path are weighted to the downside , reflecting the possibility that the actions taken by the authorities around the world to improve the availability of credit and to restore business and consumer confidence are slow to take effect .
So there may still be more to do . "
The Bank has already cut interest rates to a record low of 0.5 % and has started flooding the economy with cash through quantitative easing .
Dale said it was too early to say whether the easing was having the desired effect but he said there were some " good signs " .
But consultancy Capital Economics issued new research predicting that government borrowing could shoot up to £ 200bn in the fiscal year 2009 / 10 and then stay at that elevated level for five years .
Police in the Bahamas are deepening their investigation into an alleged plot to extort up to $ 25 m from Hollywood star John Travolta over the death of his 16 - year - old son .
A prominent politician on the island of Grand Bahama , Pleasant Bridgewater , quit as a member of the Bahamas senate over the weekend , and investigators questioned a former tourism minister who had claimed to be a close friend of the Travoltas .
Sixteen - year - old Jett Travolta was found unconscious in a bathroom at the family ’s holiday home on the island on 2 January , and hospital authorities concluded he died of a seizure .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Tarino Lightbourne , a paramedic who said he tried to revive him is still in custody , on suspicion of being part of an extortion plot , although neither the local police nor Mr Travolta ’s lawyers have released details of the alleged scam .
Early reports suggested that Mr Lightbourne and others had been trying to get money in return for suppressing a photo of the 16 - year - old just before he died , but conflicting accounts are now circulating in the island of 75,000 people .
The former tourism minister , Obie Wilchcombe , was questioned by police last Friday , it has emerged .
He was involved in a negotiation with Mr Travolta ’s lawyers which , according to some allegations , demanded payments of between $ 10 m and $ 25 m .
He was released without charge .
Mr Wilchcombe , a close friend of the Saturday Night Fever and Pulp Fiction star , made a round of television appearances in the days after the tragedy death , saying he had been with the family in the hours after his son ’s death .
On CNN ’s Larry King Live , Mr Wilchcombe shared intimate details of the funeral home and the cremation of Jett Travolta .
Ms Bridgewater , a leading lawyer and politician in the island , angrily vowed to clear her name , as she submitted her resignation from the 16 - member senate appointed by the Bahamas governor - general , the Queen ’s representative .
She had been acting as a lawyer , and the charges of extortion were “ untrue and unfair ” , Ms Bridgewater said .
" How these innocent actions can be so misconstrued , so perversely twisted to mean something other than it was , is a mystery , " she said without providing more details .

Ms Bridgewater is free on bail .
The leader of the opposition party , former Prime Minister Perry Christie , said in a statement that he regrets the turn of events and accepted Ms Bridgewater ’s resignation .
John Travolta and wife Kelly Preston have returned to the US with the remains of their son .
The couple have said Jett became sick when he was two years old and was diagnosed with Kawasaki Syndrome , an illness that leads to inflamed blood vessels .
They blamed household cleaners and fertilizers and said a detoxification program based on teachings from the Church of Scientology helped improve his health .
Outsiders have repeatedly claimed that Jett exhibited signs of autism , a condition which the Church of Scientology does not recognise .
The couple said at the time of his death that they were " heartbroken that our time with him was so brief " .
Jett was the couple ’s only son .
They have a daughter , eight - year - old Ella Bleu .
Last week , the Travolta family sparked a mystery by filing their extortion plot , saying : “ Regrettably , in a time of such terrible grief , there are often a few individuals who attempt to make false claims in hopes of making millions of dollars .
We will never let that happen . "
Reports today suggested that family lawyers had entered negotiations with the people involved in the plot , in order to help gather evidence .

The banded snail has been studied for at least 60 years Members of the public across Europe are being asked to look in their gardens or local green spaces for banded snails as part of a UK - led evolutionary study .
The Open University says its Evolution MegaLab will be one of the largest evolutionary studies ever undertaken .
Scientists believe the research could show how the creatures have evolved in the past 40 years to reflect changes in temperature and their predators .
The six - month study , starting in April , will ask people to submit data online .
' Ideal organism ' Professor Jonathan Silvertown , from the OU , said : " I was thinking about Darwin year and how we could help people get an idea of what Darwin was talking about .
" The banded snail has been studied for 60 or more years , so it 's an ideal organism to use .
It 's something that 's very common , we know what the genetics are and it's safe to handle . "
Professor Silvertown said there were two main evolutionary drivers that affect where yellow and brown banded snails are found .
The first is climate - darker - shelled snails tend to be further north , and scientists believe this is because dark shells get warmer quicker than lighter ones .
Darker - shelled snails could also be active for longer - which would make a difference to how much they could eat and how many offspring they could have .
The second evolutionary driver is predation by thrushes .
The birds hunt by sight and they find it more difficult to find yellow - striped shells around grass and brown shells against brown leaves - so yellow - shelled snails have been more common in grassland and darker ones in areas with brownish background environments .
' Genuine study ' " We think [ the snails ] have changed in the last 40 or 50 years , " said Professor Silvertown .
" Firstly , the climate has warmed up , so we think the distribution of colours has probably changed .
" Secondly , thrushes have become far less common in the last 30 years or so - so snail colouring in different habitats might be less important . "
This is what the Evolution MegaLab , which will run from April to October , will be trying to discover .
" There 's a lot of historical data on the website , " said Professor Silvertown .
" We have data from the past on 8,000 or so snail populations , so if you submit your data on the website , it will automatically make a comparison telling you whether there 's been any change in your area . "
Professor Silvertown said this was a genuine scientific study and not just a public relations exercise .
It has been funded in part by the Royal Society and the British Council , and he and his team are hoping that a major report will be published on the data collected at the beginning of next year .
He also points out that this could be an invaluable tool for researchers of the future who will be able to look at this project and compare any further evolutionary changes .

The review wants to see a more flexible primary timetable Children in England are getting a primary education that is too narrow , because schools focus too much on maths and English , claims a major report .
The author of the Cambridge University report warns that too much emphasis on testing the basics could " impoverish " learning in areas such as the arts .
Professor Robin Alexander says this could mean a " deficient " education .
The government has rejected the claim as " insulting " and says it " flies in the face of international evidence " .
The Cambridge Primary Review 's interim report is part of the biggest independent inquiry into primary education in England for 40 years .
Their education , and to some degree their lives , are impoverished if they have received an education that is so fundamentally deficient
Professor Robin Alexander
Cambridge Review
It calls for an urgent debate about the purpose of primary education .
The report says inadequacies in the primary curriculum stem from a mistaken belief that breadth in the curriculum is incompatible with improved standards in the " basics " of maths , literacy and numeracy .
History , geography , science and the arts have been " squeezed out " , it argues .
The report 's authors suggest learning in primary schools is skewed towards subjects which are formally tested in the national tests , used to draw up league tables .
It calls testing " the elephant in the curriculum " , noting that in Year 6 especially , the final year of primary school , " breadth competes with the much narrower scope of what is to be tested . "
Professor Robin Alexander , director of the Cambridge Primary Review , said : " Our argument is that their [ children 's ] education , and to some degree their lives , are impoverished if they have received an education that is so fundamentally deficient . "
' Eight new domains '
The review suggests the primary curriculum should be " re-conceived " with 12 specific aims , which it arranges in three groups :
The needs and capacities of the individual : wellbeing ; engagement ; empowerment ; autonomy
The individual in relation to others and the wider world : encouraging respect and reciprocity ; promoting interdependence and sustainability ; empowering local , national and global citizenship ; celebrating culture and community
Learning , knowing and doing : knowing , understanding , exploring and making sense ; fostering skill ; exciting the imagination ; enacting dialogue .
These aims would be achieved through eight " domains " , rather than a small number of subjects .
The domains would be : arts and creativity ; citizenship and ethics ; faith and belief ; language , oracy and literacy ; mathematics ; physical and emotional health ; place and time ( geography and history ) ; science and technology .
Prof Alexander said there had always been a problem in primary schools with striking the right balance between the basic skills , such as numeracy and literacy , and other areas , such as history .
" All of them should be taught to the highest possible standard , raising the quality of educational experience across the board , " he said .
The report warns that tests limit the last year of primary school " The key benefit to pupils is a retention of the statutory entitlement of a broad and balanced curriculum . "
A spokesman for the Department for Children , Schools and Families denied primary pupils were getting inadequate schooling .
" To say our children are receiving a deficient education is insulting to hard working pupils and teachers everywhere and flies in the face of international evidence , " he said .
" English children were recently recognised as being the highest achieving in maths and science among European countries . "
The government has commissioned its own independent inquiry into primary education .
Its interim findings - already published - called for a flexible , less - overloaded time table .
Sir Jim Rose , heading the review , suggested there could be six broader " areas of learning " , rather than up to 14 individual subjects , such as history , geography and science .
' Freedom and flexibility '
The spokesman for the Department for Children , Schools and Families continued : " We thank Professor Alexander for his contribution and Sir Jim Rose will no doubt read it with interest as part of his extensive , independent consultation into the primary curriculum , which is still gathering evidence from a wide range of experts and academics , teachers , parents and the public . "
He added that the Rose Review 's aim was to give teachers more freedom and flexibility , smooth children 's transition between the stages of their education , and ensure the best possible educational outcomes for all children , he added .
Acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers , Christine Blower , said it was a matter of " concern " that the government was keeping the Cambridge Primary Review " at arms length " .
" His proposals for the primary curriculum have depth , credibility and , above all , respond to the realities of the primary classroom . "
Nick Seaton , of the Campaign for Real Education , said children needed to be taught the basics at primary school , as well as a range of subjects .
" But if literacy and numeracy are taught well there should be enough time in the curriculum to teach the other subjects , " he said .
The Cambridge Primary Review is an independent body which began its research on primary education in 2006 .
The primary curriculum report is its 10th published study .
A final report will be published later this year .

Hey ... There 's news for Houston fans of the Pixies :
The heart of the band , Frank Black ( going by his name Charles Thompson ) , is going to be working with the Catastrophic Theatre to produce a " musical play " based on his album Bluefinger .
( Which was released under the name Black Francis , but we 're tired of trying to keep up with it all . )
Bluefinger studies the life of Herman Brood , a controversial Dutch artist who committed suicide in 2001 .
The new production will feature songs from the album and new compositions from Thompson / Black / Francis .
He 'll be working with Catastrophic 's Jason Nodler and Tamarie Cooper , along with Anthony Barilla , who was part of Infernal Bridegroom , the predecessor to Catastrophic .
The play will premiere in Houston in 2010 , if things work out according to schedule , and then tour America .
We 'll update when we hear from Nodler .
Ten Things That Look Wrong in Internet Explorer

Kellogg 's recent dumping of Michel Phelps as its spokesman had at least one unexpected consequence :
The sudden appearance of about 3,800 pounds of cereal at the San Francisco Food Bank .

Kellogg's , one of the many corporations to tell Phelps to get out and stay out as their spokesman after his love of bongs and frat parties hit the media , had to have somewhere to get rid of all the cereal boxes adorned with his likeness .
Nicaragua is already teeming with Patriots 19 - 0 t- shirts ; it 's not taking the Frosted Flakes as well .
So suddenly boxes and boxes of the stuff began showing up at the San Francisco food bank , as columnist C.W. Nevius reports in his Chronicle column today .
Kellogg 's is n't actually saying that it dumped the cereal boxes on food banks — a spokesman for the cereal company did not return a call — but it is a logical conclusion .
For starters , said San Francisco Food Bank executive director Paul Ash , it has become unusual for companies to offer cereal .
" It 's a very tough item to get , " Ash said .
" In the last six or eight years , it 's become very hard to get ahold of . "

So Phelps ' indiscriminate Mary Jane toking is curbing the munchies in major metropolitan areas ?
Few seem troubled by Phelps ' marijuana problems .
" The boxes have kind of flown off the shelves , " Ash said .
We would advise quickly disposing of the free toy surprise :
The plastic crack pipe that is also a whistle .

If you ’ve read this site before , or even just glanced over it ’s archives , then my appreciation and admiration of director Mamoru Oshii is clearly laid out .
As such it would seem not only redundant but also somewhat self indulgent to elaborate further on my love of his tense political sci-fi dramas Ghost in the Shell and Patlabor , or his low budget , live action masterpiece Avalon .
Ever since his latest feature film
The Sky Crawlers was first announced I have been gripped with excitement and anticipation – although , as always , resigned to the long wait us western fans must endure before we are granted an audience .
This week that wait finally ended , and putting aside my deep rooted fanboy allegiances for just under two hours , I was able to sit down and see if anime ’s most esteemed auteur could still deliver the goods .
Based on a series of novels by Japanese author Hiroshi Mori , The Sky Crawlers takes its time in revealing it ’s true nature to the viewer .
Oshii is famous for never rushing his narratives and giving his viewers time to indulge in his slowly paced cinematography , but tSC takes its time in revealing even it ’s true setting .
Much of the truth about what is happening in the world it ’s characters inhabit is n’t made clear until it ’s final act , and as such it makes it hard to elaborate without drifting into spoiler territory .
Simply put , it is set at a time – possibly the future , or equally maybe an alternate past – when humanity has decided that the only way to avoid war is to stage an artificial , and seemingly endless , one .
As a result an eternal air conflict is fought between two rival corporations using WWII style fighter planes and bombers , just to fill the war cravings of the global media , economy and watching public .
This concept is not a new one for Oshii , it being the main driving theme of his second , complex Patlabor movie .
Then the subject was how small scale , but very real , wars were allowed to rage unhindered in the less developed parts of the world so that the industrial nations could create the illusion of a lasting peace , and made in 1993 it gives a chillingly clairvoyant portrayal of how easily this cosy illusion can be broken through acts of terrorism .
To Oshii war is a vital force in modern capitalist societies , the secret fuel that drives their economies and cultures , but while Patlabor 2 meditates openly and explicitly on this train of thought , tSC is all the more subtler .
Throughout it ’s duration it only hints at it ’s thematic backdrop , preferring instead to focus it ’s other unique ingredient ; it ’s characters .
If eternal , staged war is the formula for peace , then one huge moral question faces the society that puts it into practice : who will do the fighting ?
For the tSC the answer is the ‘ Kildren ’ , apparently genetically engineered clones of teenage children , raised to do nothing but fly and fight for the corporations that mass - produce them .
It is through their eyes that we slowly learn not only about their world , but also the abusive psychological effect it has on them .
Raised to know nothing but war , they fly routine , daily sorties while filling the gaps within with drinking and mindless , detached sex .
In fact everything appears detached to them ; their lives are so routine – the war so endless – that even the thrills of partying and combat seem to bore them .
The fact that they are designed to never age – forever staying young , knowing that they will only , inevitably , die in battle – only compounding their increasing alienation from both each other and the world they are supposedly fighting for .
The image of robotic , innocence stripped children being used as weapons in this way is a disturbing one , and one seen to devastating effect in Madhouses ‘ groundbreaking 2003 series Gunslinger Girl .
Now , as then , it appears the target of critique is anime itself , and perhaps to some larger extent Japanese culture as a whole .
For decades anime and manga have made children their assassins and war heroes , and both Gunslinger Girl and Oshii attempt to deconstruct these respective memes , showing instead the brutal reality of how that could manifest in real life .
tSC goes a stage further though , coupling this with the earlier theme of the need for perpetual war , and perhaps turning it into an attack on the endless repition of anime subject material , the boredom of the characters representing Oshii ’s own disdain at the stale offerings much of the industry produces .
At times it even feels like an attack on himself ; the use of character names from his previous works is jarring to any watching fan , and coupled with his frequent visual signatures it is almost as though Oshii - san is looking back at his portfolio of work with disappointment at his own lack of originality .
If The Sky Crawlers reassures his audience of only one thing its that he should n’t be so harsh on himself .
Visually , the film is sumptuous and intoxicating as we have come to expect from the director and his highly experienced creative team at Production IG .
The green fields and cloudscape filled blue skies mark a refreshing change of palette from their usual dark , urban environments – but while also maintaining the director ’s trademark cold , stark and lonely atmospheres .
While the character design is suitably minimal compared to previous IG works , the mechanical design is as phenomenal as expected , the retro-but - futuristic fighter planes betraying a Miyazaki - like fetishism towards WWII aircraft engineering and attention to detail .
The dogfight sequences themselves are breathtaking , and again show IG ’s mastery of the use of combining CGI and traditional cell animation .
Here they had help from FX studio Polygon Pictures , whose recent portfolio shows they are clearly industry leaders – and I do n’t say that just because I know someone that works there .
In fact , the opening and regularly punctuating dogfight sequences are perhaps Oshii ’s greatest trick .
Not only do they break up the mesmerising monotony of watching the Kildren ’s routine lives unfold , but they also make the audience participants in their world .
The action sequences are so exhilirating , so beautifully choreographed that the viewer ends up almost craving them to return to the screen , and thus becomes the gawping , voyeristic , war - demanding public of the Kildren ’s world , and thus ultimately the guilty abuser .
It ’s a master stroke of manipulation , and a subtle one that perhaps does n’t truly reveal itself until the films final , bloody dogfight .
Despite it ’s deeply thematic nature and social commentary , The Sky Crawlers is perhaps Oshii ’s most accessible film since Patlabor .
Gone , thankfully , are the philosophical ramblings of GiTS 2 : Innocence , instead the discussion is more subtle , the plot more linear .
In many ways it feels that Oshii , although rapidly becoming what is considered a veteran filmmaker , is still learning from mistakes and honing his skills .
Plus , as always with his work , it ’s nothing else if not a visual masterpiece , the imagery and score from Oshii ’s long time composer of choice Kenji Kawai combining again to make a compelling and memorable viewing experience .
It ’s not an easy ride at times , but The Sky Crawlers is certainly one you ca n’t afford to miss .
Then the world changed .
The Internet had spawned Netflix , the elimination of late fees and no -effort rentals .
The Internet also distracted consumers , stealing hours they might once have spent reveling in movies .
In other words , the Internet was a force more powerful than the “ Blood Sword of the 99th Virgin , ” one of the more esoteric works in the Kim ’s Video collection .
At the store ’s peak in the 1990s , more than 200,000 people were listed in Kim ’s database , but by the end of last year , only about 1,500 of them were considered active members .
Though customers still harbored an obsessive affinity for Kim ’s cult collection , along with its cantankerous employees and underground spirit , for too many of them , that affection had faded into a fond memory .
“ Kim ’s was the cutting - edge ; that was always the business concept , ” Mr. Kim said the other day in one of a series of conversations about the fate of his video collection .
“ But ironically , I did n’t prepare . ”
Last September , in a move that swept through the Internet at viral speed , he issued a public challenge .
In a notice pasted on a wall inside the front door , he wrote , “ We hope to find a sponsor who can make this collection available to those who have loved Kim ’s over the past two decades . ”
He promised to donate all the films without charge to anyone who would meet three conditions :
Keep the collection intact , continue to update it and make it accessible to Kim ’s members and others .
Offers poured in .
Every one failed on one count or another .
Every offer , that is , except one .

Comparing DSLs in Ruby and Scala
by Bill Venners
March 10 , 2009
Summary
Last week I released a new version of ScalaTest ( 0.9.5 ) that includes a " matchers DSL " for writing more expressive assertions in tests .
In this post I show differences between ScalaTest matchers and those in Ruby 's RSpec tool , and discuss some of the general differences in DSL creation in Ruby and Scala .
Advertisement
Dynamic languages such as Ruby and Groovy have a reputation for enabling " internal " domain specific language ( DSL ) creation , but internal DSLs are not only a feature of dynamic languages .
Although Scala is statically typed , its flexible syntax is quite accommodating to internal DSLs .
However , the different languages place different constraints on DSL design .
Invoking methods without parentheses ( or dots )
One feature of Ruby that helps in DSL creation , for example , is that you can leave off parentheses when you invoke a method .
For example , given a string in Ruby :
>> s = " hello " => " hello "
You can determine whether it contains a substring like this :
>> s.include ? ( " el " ) => true
Or , alternatively , by leaving off the parentheses , like this :
>> s.include ? " el " => true
Scala does not let you leave off the parentheses in the same way :
scala > val s = " hello " s : java.lang .
String = hello scala > s.contains ( " el " ) res5 : Boolean = true scala > s.contains " el " : 1 : error : ' ;' expected but string literal found .
s.contains " el " ^
However , Scala supports an " operator notation , " which allows you to leave off both the dot and the parentheses :
scala > s contains " el " res6 : Boolean = true
By contrast , Ruby does not support this kind of operator notation :
>> s include ?
" el " ( irb ) :21 : warning : parenthesize argument (s ) for future version NoMethodError : undefined method `include ? ' for main : Object from ( irb ) :21
Adding methods to existing classes
Another feature of Ruby that facilitates DSL creation is its open classes , which among other things allows you to add new methods to existing classes .
For example , class String in Ruby has no method named should :
>> " " . should NoMethodError : undefined method `should ' for " " : String from ( irb ) :
1
Nevertheless , here 's how you could , using open classes , add a method named should to class String in Ruby :
>> class String >> def should >>
" should was invoked ! " >> end >> end => nil
Now you can invoke should on Ruby String :
>> puts " " . should should was invoked ! => nil
Scala , being statically typed , does n't support open classes .
The methods supported by a class are fixed at compile time .
However , Scala 's implicit conversion feature provides much the same benefit , allowing you to write code in which it appears you are invoking new methods on existing classes .
For example , because Scala 's string is java.lang .
String , you can't invoke should on it :
scala > " " . should : 5 : error : value should is not a member of java.lang .
String " " . should ^
Nevertheless , you can define an implicit conversion from String to a type that does have a should method .
The Scala compiler will apply the implicit conversion to solve a type error .
Here 's how you could define the implicit conversion :
scala > class ShouldWrapper(s : String ) { | def should = " should was invoked on " + s | } defined class ShouldWrapper scala > implicit def convert(s : String ) = new ShouldWrapper(s ) convert : ( String ) ShouldWrapper
Given this implicit conversion , you can now write code that appears to invoke should on a string :
scala > " howdy " .
should res10 : java.lang .
String = should was invoked on howdy
Behind the scenes , the Scala compiler will implicitly convert the String to a ShouldWrapper , and then invoke should on the ShouldWrapper , like this :
scala > convert ( " howdy " ) .
should res11 : java.lang .
String = should was invoked on howdy
Comparing Matchers DSLs
Ruby 's RSpec tool includes a matchers DSL , that allows you to write assertions in tests that look like this :
result .
should be_true # this is RSpec result .
should_not be_nil num.should eql( 5 ) map.should_not have_key ( " a " )
One thing to note is that Ruby 's convention of separating words with underscores helps make these expressions read more like English .
Between each word is either a space , underscore , or dot .
In Scala , you could use operator notation to get rid of the dot , yielding expressions like :
result should be_true // Could do this in Scala result should_not be_null num should eql ( 5 ) map should_not have_key ( " a " )
The problem is that this use of the underscore is not idiomatic in Scala .
Like Java , Scala style suggests using camel case , which would yield expressions like :
result should beTrue // Could do this in Scala result should Not beNull num should eql ( 5 ) map should Not haveKey ( " a " )
This works , but is not quite as satisfying , because the words do not separate as nicely in camel case compared to underscores .
When designing a matchers DSL for ScalaTest , I decided to try and see how far I could go with operator notation .
The corresponding expressions in ScalaTest are :
result should be ( true ) //
This is ScalaTest result should not be ( null ) num should equal ( 5 ) map should not contain key ( " a " )
The parentheses on the rightmost value are not always required , but the rule is subtle , so I recommend you always use them .
The parentheses also serve to emphasize what is usually the expected value .
Here 's how one of these expressions will be rewritten by the Scala compiler , when it desugars the operator notation back into normal method call notation during compilation :
result.should ( not ) .be( null )
The should method is invoked on result ( via an implicit conversion ) , passing in the object referred to by a variable named not .
Then be is invoked on that return value , passing in null .
In other words , in this expression , operator notation is used twice in a row .
Conclusion
When designing an internal DSL , you do n't have as much freedom as when you design an external DSL — i.e. , a new language from scratch .
With an internal DSL you need to work within the confines of the host language , and so will your users .
In RSpec 's matchers , for example , users need to keep track of where to put dots , underscores , and spaces .
Similarly , in ScalaTest matchers , users need to keep track of where to put parentheses .
In both cases , the syntax is nevertheless quite easy to learn , and the resulting code is quite readable .

Exclusive : Ted Haggard Breaks
His Silence
Two years after sex scandal , preacher said he was " suicidal " with despair .
Nov. 12 , 2008  --
Ted Haggard , the disgraced former evangelical leader , recently broke his silence on the second anniversary of the scandal that brought him down .
He gave a pair of sermons at a small church in Illinois where the pastor is an old friend of his .
" The first thing I want you to know is I sinned , " Haggard began .
Haggard 's comments were quite revealing .
They were recorded on audiotape and put on the Internet at www.tedhaggard.com.
Haggard told the congregation that a sexual incident with a man when he was 7 years old may be related to the scandal involving a male prostitute and crystal meth use that cost him his job two years ago .
" My dad was pretty successful , " Haggard said .
" He had a lot of workers .
One of those workers had a sexual experience with me .
I was 7 years old . "
Haggard said that incident stayed with him throughout his life .
" There I was , 50 years old , a conservative Republican , loving the word of God , an evangelical , born - again , spirit - filled , charismatic , all those things , " he said .
" But some of the things that were buried in the depths of the sea from when I was in the second grade started to rage in my heart and mind . "
" I 'm very , very sorry that I sinned , " he said .
" My wife -- all my sin and shame fell on her .
People treated her as if she had fallen .
And my children -- they all went through carrying my shame . "
But Haggard did not specifically discuss how he'd sinned , but said that some of the allegations against him from former gay prostitute Mike Jones concerning sex and crystal meth use were exaggerated .
He revealed how devastating the scandal was .
" There came a moment in my life when we were so alone and there was so much despair that I was suicidal , " he said .
" And I 'd figured out how I was going to kill myself and rid the world of the horrible curse of Ted Haggard . "
But now , he said , he has been transformed with the help of God and his wife .
" I'm a stronger Christian than I 've ever been in my life .
I have a stronger marriage than I 've ever had in my life , " he said .
Haggard then issued an emotional critique of church leaders for not using his scandal to present Christian love .
" I believe that he [ God ] gives us opportunities every couple of years to communicate the gospel worldwide through secular media and we consistently blow it , " he said .
" A congressman in trouble , that 's the time .
A family member gets himself in horrible trouble , that 's the time .
A preacher gets himself in awful trouble , that 's the time . "
WASHINGTON , Feb 27 ( Reuters ) - Investors burned by the recent boom and bust in the U.S. ethanol industry will be wary of pouring money into plants for the next generation of biofuels without more stable returns , a J.P. Morgan analyst said on Friday .
U.S. law requires that 10.5 billion gallons ( 40.8 billion litres ) of ethanol be blended into the gasoline supply this year to reduce dependence on foreign oil imports and lower emissions of climate - changing greenhouse gases .
But ethanol producers have struggled to find profits amid volatile corn prices and plunging gasoline demand and prices .
“ We have a real dilemma in the industry , ” Ann Duignan told the U.S. Agriculture Department ’s annual outlook forum .
“ As long as nobody ’s making money , the industry is not viable long term regardless of a mandate . ”
Four or five years ago , when corn prices were below $ 2 per bushel and oil prices were high , there was a “ gold rush ” feeling in the business , Duignan said , recalling a farmer she had met who had invested $ 200,000 in an ethanol plant .
“ His stocks had split nine times and his investment at that point was worth $ 2.3 million .
Never in his life did he think he was going to be a millionaire , ” she said .
But backers built too much capacity and production costs soared .
Many plants are idled and some made bankrupt .
“ I think all that is going to be remembered for a long time is the kind of boom - loss that Wall Street saw with ethanol , ” Duignan said .
“ I think from that perspective , it ’s going to be difficult to get investors to invest in ... cellulosic ethanol , ” she said .
The administration of President Barack Obama has been keen to foster the “ next generation ” biofuels like cellulosic ethanol made from crop waste , grasses and wood pulp .
The fuels are still at the pilot stage and are more expensive to produce than corn - based ethanol .
Government programs such as a permanent production tax credit for biofuel producers could help provide some stability to the industry and certainty to investors , Duignan said on the sidelines of the conference .
A production tax credit for cellulosic ethanol will expire in 2012 , long before many plants are built and producing the fuel , she said .
Wall Street will also watch carefully the impending release of the Environmental Protection Agency ’s rules for the renewable fuels standard , she said .
The rules will provide a framework about how the United States will meet its 2007 mandate that calls for 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels to be used by 2022 , including 15 billion gallons of ethanol , 16 billion gallons of cellulosic , and 5 billion gallons of other new types of biofuels .
The agency is looking carefully at the environmental impacts of the fuels , including how much they reduce greenhouse gas emissions over time , said Karl Simon , an EPA official .
The rule , which Simon said would be hundreds of pages long , will be released “ soon ” for public comment , but there was no set date , Simon said .

The State of the Russian State
Geography and Development
The Reality of Russian Power
Geography : Unlike its main geopolitical rival , the United States , Russia borders most of the regions it wishes to project power into , and few geographic barriers separate it from its targets .
Ukraine , Belarus and the Baltic states have zero geographic insulation from Russia .
Central Asia is sheltered by distance , but not by mountains or rivers .
The Caucasus provide a bit of a speed bump to Russia , but pro-Russian enclaves in Georgia give the Kremlin a secure foothold south of the mountain range ( putting the August Russian - Georgian war in perspective ) .
Even if U.S. forces were not tied down in Iraq and Afghanistan , the United States would face potentially insurmountable difficulties in countering Russian actions in Moscow 's so - called " Near Abroad . "
Russia can project all manner of influence and intimidation there on the cheap , while even symbolic counters are quite costly for the United States .
In contrast , places such as Latin America , Southeast Asia or Africa do not capture much more than the Russian imagination ; the Kremlin realizes it can do little more there than stir the occasional pot , and resources are allotted ( centrally , of course ) accordingly .
Politics :
It is no secret that the Kremlin uses an iron fist to maintain domestic control .
There are few domestic forces the government cannot control or balance .
The Kremlin understands the revolutions ( 1917 in particular ) and collapses ( 1991 in particular ) of the past , and it has control mechanisms in place to prevent a repeat .
This control is seen in every aspect of Russian life , from one main political party ruling the country to the lack of diversified media , limits on public demonstrations and the infiltration of the security services into nearly every aspect of the Russian system .
This domination was fortified under Stalin and has been re-established under the reign of former President and now - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
This political strength is based on neither financial nor economic foundations .
Instead , it is based within the political institutions and parties , on the lack of a meaningful opposition , and with the backing of the military and security services .
Russia 's neighbors , especially in Europe , cannot count on the same political strength because their systems are simply not set up the same way .
The stability of the Russian government and lack of stability in the former Soviet states and much of Central Europe have also allowed the Kremlin to reach beyond Russia and influence its neighbors to the east .
Now as before , when some of its former Soviet subjects — such as Ukraine — become destabilized , Russia sweeps in as a source of stability and authority , regardless of whether this benefits the recipient of Moscow 's attention .
Social System :
As a consequence of Moscow 's political control and the economic situation , the Russian system is socially crushing , and has had long - term effects on the Russian psyche .
As mentioned above , during the Soviet - era process of industrialization and militarization , workers operated under the direst of conditions for the good of the state .
The Russian state has made it very clear that the productivity and survival of the state is far more important than the welfare of the people .
This made Russia politically and economically strong , not in the sense that the people have had a voice , but in that they have not challenged the state since the beginning of the Soviet period .
The Russian people , regardless of whether they admit it , continue to work to keep the state intact even when it does not benefit them .
When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 , Russia kept operating — though a bit haphazardly .
Russians still went to work , even if they were not being paid .
The same was seen in 1998 , when the country collapsed financially .
This is a very different mentality than that found in the West .
Most Russians would not even consider the mass protests seen in Europe in response to the economic crisis .
The Russian government , by contrast , can count on its people to continue to support the state and keep the country going with little protest over the conditions .
Though there have been a few sporadic and meager protests in Russia , these protests mainly have been in opposition to the financial situation , not to the government 's hand in it .
In some of these demonstrations , protesters have carried signs reading , " In government we trust , in the economic system we do n't . "
This means Moscow can count on a stable population .
Natural Resources : Modern Russia enjoys a wealth of natural resources in everything from food and metals to gold and timber .
The markets may take a roller - coaster ride and the currency may collapse , but the Russian economy has access to the core necessities of life .
Many of these resources serve a double purpose , for in addition to making Russia independent of the outside world , they also give Moscow the ability to project power effectively .
Russian energy — especially natural gas — is particularly key : Europe is dependent on Russian natural gas for a quarter of its demand .
This relationship guarantees Russia a steady supply of now - scarce capital even as it forces the Europeans to take any Russian concerns seriously .
The energy tie is something Russia has very publicly used as a political weapon , either by raising prices or by cutting off supplies .
In a recession , this lever 's effectiveness has only grown .
Military : The Russian military is in the midst of a broad modernization and restructuring , and is reconstituting its basic warfighting capability .
While many challenges remain , Moscow already has imposed a new reality through military force in Georgia .
While Tbilisi was certainly an easy target , the Russian military looks very different to Kiev — or even Warsaw and Prague — than it does to the Pentagon .
And even in this case , Russia has come to rely increasingly heavily on its nuclear arsenal to rebalance the military equation and ensure its territorial integrity , and is looking to establish long - term nuclear parity with the Americans .
Like the energy tool , Russia 's military has become more useful in times of economic duress , as potential targets have suffered far more than the Russians .
Intelligence : Russia has one of the world 's most sophisticated and powerful intelligence services .
Historically , its only rival has been the United States ( though today the Chinese arguably could be seen as rivaling the Americans and Russians ) .
The KGB ( now the FSB ) instills fear into hearts around the world , let alone inside Russia .
Infiltration and intimidation kept the Soviet Union and its sphere under control .
No matter the condition of the Russian state , Moscow 's intelligence foundation has been its strongest pillar .
The FSB and other Russian intelligence agencies have infiltrated most former Soviet republics and satellite states , and they also have infiltrated as far as Latin America and the United States .
Russian intelligence has infiltrated political , security , military and business realms worldwide , and has boasted of infiltrating many former Soviet satellite governments , militaries and companies up to the highest level .
All facets of the Russian government have backed this infiltration since Putin ( a former KGB man ) came to power and filled the Kremlin with his cohorts .
This domestic and international infiltration has been built up for half a century .
It is not something that requires much cash to maintain , but rather know - how — and the Russians wrote the book on the subject .
One of the reasons Moscow can run this system inexpensively relative to what it gets in return is because Russia 's intelligence services have long been human - based , though they do have some highly advanced technology to wield .
Russia also has incorporated other social networks in its intelligence services , such as organized crime or the Russian Orthodox Church , creating an intricate system at a low price .
Russia 's intelligence services are much larger than most other countries ' services and cover most of the world .
But the intelligence apparatus ' most intense focus is on the Russian periphery , rather than on the more expensive " far abroad . "
Under the leadership of Vladimir Putin , Russia has been re-establishing much of its lost Soviet - era strength .
This has given rise to the possibility — and even the probability — that Russia again will become a potent adversary of the Western world .
But now , Russia is yet again on the cusp of a set of massive currency devaluations that could destroy much of the country 's financial system .
With a crashing currency , the disappearance of foreign capital , greatly decreased energy revenues and currency reserves flying out of the bank , the Western perception is that Russia is on the verge of collapsing once again .
Consequently , many Western countries have started to grow complacent about Russia 's ability to further project power abroad .
But this is Russia .
And Russia rarely follows anyone else 's rulebook .
Russia has faced a slew of economic problems in the past six months .
Incoming foreign direct investment , which reached a record high of $ 28 billion in 2007 , has reportedly dried up to just a few billion .
Russia 's two stock markets , the Russian Trading System ( RTS ) and the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange ( MICEX ) , havefallen 78 and 67 percent respectively since their highs in May 2008 .
And Russians have withdrawn $ 290 billion from the country 's banks in fear of afinancial collapse .
One of Moscow 's sharpest financial pains came in the form of a slumping Russian ruble , which has dropped by about one - third against the dollar since August 2008 .
Thus far , the Kremlin has spent $ 200 billion defending its currency , a startling number given that the currency still dropped by 35 percent .
The Russian government has allowed dozens of mini-devaluations to occur since August ; the ruble 's fall has pushed the currency past its lowest point in the 1998 ruble crash .
The Kremlin now faces three options .
First , it can continue defending the ruble bypouring more money into what looks like a black hole .
Realistically , this can last only another six months or so , as Russia 's combined reserves of $ 750 billion in August 2008 have dropped to just less than $ 400 billion due to various recession - battling measures ( of which currency defense is only one ) .
This option would also limit Russia 's future anti-recession measures to currency defense alone .
In essence , this option relies on merely hoping the global recession ends before the till runs dry .
The second option would be toabandon any defense of the ruble and just let the currency crash .
This option will not hurt Moscow or its prized industries ( like those in the energy and metals sectors ) too much , as the Kremlin , its institutions and most large Russian companies hold their reserves in dollars and euros .
Smaller businesses and the Russian people would lose everything , however , just as in the August 1998 ruble crash .
This may sound harsh , but the Kremlin has proved repeatedly — during the Imperial , Soviet and present eras — that it is willing to put the survival of the Russian state before the welfare and survival of the people .
The third option is much like the second .
It involves sealing the currency system off completely from international trade , relegating it only to use in purely domestic exchanges .
But turning to a closed system would make the ruble absolutely worthless abroad , and probably within Russia as well — the black market and small businesses would be forced to follow the government 's example and switch to the euro , or more likely , the U.S. dollar .
( Russians tend to trust the dollar more than the euro . )
According to the predominant rumor in Moscow , the Kremlin will opt for combining the first and second options , allowing a series of small devaluations , but continuing a partial defense of the currency to avoid a single 1998 - style collapse .
Such a hybrid approach would reflect internal politicking .
The lack of angst within the government over the disappearance of the ruble as a symbol of Russian strength is most intriguing .
Instead of discussing how to preserve Russian financial power , the debate is now over how to let the currency crash .
The destruction of this particular symbol of Russian strength over the past ten years has now become a given in the Kremlin 's thinking , as has the end of the growth and economic strength seen in recent years .
Washington is interpreting the Russian acceptance of economic failure as a sort of surrender .
It is not difficult to see why .
For most states — powerful or not — a deep recession coupled with a currency collapse would indicate an evisceration of the ability to project power , or even the end of the road .
After all , similar economic collapses in 1992 and 1998 heralded periods in which Russian power simply evaporated , allowing the Americans free rein across the Russian sphere of influence .
Russia has been using its economic strength to revive its influence as of late , so — as the American thinking goes — the destruction of that strength should lead to a new period of Russian weakness .
But before one can truly understand the roots of Russian power , the reality and role of the Russian economy must be examined .
From this perspective , the past several years are most certainly an aberration — and we are not simply speaking of the post - Soviet collapse .
All states economies ' to a great degree reflect their geographies .
In the United States , the presence of large , interconnected river systems in the central third of the country , the intracoastal waterway along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts , the vastness of San Francisco Bay , the numerous rivers flowing to the sea from the eastern slopes of the Appalachian Mountains and the abundance of ideal port locations made the country easy to develop .
The cost of transporting goods was nil , and scarce capital could be dedicated to other pursuits .
The result was a massive economy with an equally massive leg up on any competition .
Russia 's geography is the polar opposite .
Hardly any of Russia 's rivers are interconnected .
The country has several massive ones — the Pechora , the Ob , the Yenisei , the Lena and the Kolyma — but they drain the nearly unpopulated Siberia to the Arctic Ocean , making them useless for commerce .
The only river that cuts through Russia 's core , the Volga , drains not to the ocean but to the landlocked and sparsely populated Caspian Sea , the center of a sparsely populated region .
Also unlike the United States , Russia has few useful ports .
Kaliningrad is not connected to the main body of Russia .
The Gulf of Finland freezes in winter , isolating St. Petersburg .
The only true deepwater and warm - water ocean ports , Vladivostok and Murmansk , are simply too far from Russia 's core to be useful .
So while geography handed the United States the perfect transport network free of charge , Russia has had to use every available kopek to link its country together with an expensive road , rail and canal network .
One of the many side effects of this geography situation is that the United States had extra capital that it could dedicate to finance in a relatively democratic manner , while Russia 's chronic capital deficit prompted it to concentrate what little capital resources it had into a single set of hands —
Moscow 's hands .
So while the United States became the poster child for the free market , Russia ( whether the Russian Empire , Soviet Union or Russian Federation ) has always tended toward central planning .
Russian industrialization and militarization began in earnest under Josef Stalin in the 1930s .
Under centralized planning , all industry and services were nationalized , while industrial leaders were given predetermined output quotas .
Perhaps the most noteworthy difference between the Western and Russian development paths was the different use of finance .
At the start of Stalin 's massive economic undertaking , international loans to build the economy were unavailable , both because the new government had repudiated the czarist regime 's international debts and because industrialized countries — the potential lenders — were coping with the onset of their own economic crisis ( e.g. , the Great Depression ) .
With loans and bonds unavailable , Stalin turned to another centrally controlled resource to " fund " Russian development : labor .
Trade unions were converted into mechanisms for capturing all available labor as well as for increasing worker productivity .
Russia essentially substitutes labor for capital , so it is no surprise that Stalin — like all Russian leaders before him — ran his population into the ground .
Stalin called this his " revolution from above . "
Over the long term , the centralized system is highly inefficient , as it does not take the basic economic drivers of supply and demand into account — to say nothing of how it crushes the common worker .
But for a country as geographically massive as Russia , it was ( and remains ) questionable whether Western finance - driven development is even feasible , due to the lack of cheap transit options and the massive distances involved .
Development driven by the crushing of the labor pool was probably the best Russia could hope for , and the same holds true today .
In stark contrast to ages past , for the past five years foreign money has underwritten Russian development .
Russian banks did not depend upon government funding — which was accumulated into vast reserves — but instead tappedforeign lenders and bondholders .
Russian banks took this money and used it to lend to Russian firms .
Meanwhile , as the Russian government asserted control over the country 's energy industries during the last several years , it created a completely separate economy that only rarely intersected with other aspects of Russian economic life .
So when the current global recession helped lead to the evaporation of foreign credit , the core of the government / energy economy was broadly unaffected , even as the rest of the Russian economy ingloriously crashed to earth .
Since Putin 's rise , the Kremlin has sought to project an image of a strong , stable and financially powerful Russia .
This vision of strength has been the cornerstone ofRussian confidence for years .
Note that STRATFOR is saying " vision , " not " reality . "
For in reality , Russian financial confidence is solely the result of cash brought in from strong oil and natural gas prices — something largely beyond the Russians ' ability to manipulate — not the result of any restructuring of the Russian system .
As such , the revelation that the emperor has no clothes — that Russia is still a complete financial mess — is more a blow to Moscow 's ego than a signal of a fundamental change in the reality of Russian power .
So while Russia might be losing its financial security and capabilities , which in the West tend to boil down to economic wealth , the global recession has not affected the reality of Russian power much at all .
Russia has not , currently or historically , worked off of anyone else 's cash or used economic stability as a foundation for political might or social stability .
Instead , Russia relies on many other tools in its kit .
Some of the following six pillars of Russian power are more powerful and appropriate than ever :
Thus , while Russia 's financial sector may be getting torn apart , the state does not really count on that sector for domestic cohesion or stability , or for projecting power abroad .
Russia knows it lacks a good track record financially , so it depends on — and has shored up where it can — six other pillars to maintain its ( self - proclaimed ) place as a major international player .
The current financial crisis would crush the last five pillars for any other state , but in Russia , it has only served to strengthen these bases .
Over the past few years , there was a certain window of opportunity for Russia to resurge while Washington was preoccupied with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
This window has been kept open longer by the West 's lack of worry over the Russian resurgence given the financial crisis .
But others closer to the Russian border understand that Moscow has many tools more potent than finance with which to continue reasserting itself .

Manga creator Kiyohiko Azuma ( Azumanga Daioh , Yotsuba& ! ) has posted a blog entry on Friday about the recent surge of rumors about a hypothetical Yotsuba& !
anime adaptation .
As early as 2005 , Azuma has had to discount rumors of any anime plans .
However , Azuma says the recent rumors are not about false anime plans , but about false reasons for why there are no anime plans .
People have been asking Azuma about rumors that friction between him and the Azumanga Daioh anime staff is the reason why a Yotsuba& !
anime has never been green - lit .
Azuma emphatically states that the new rumors are false , and laughs at the notion that there is friction between him and director Hiroshi Nishikiori or voice actress Tomoko " Kane - Tomo " Kaneda ( Chiyo ) .
Still , he acknowledges it is not good to have two people competing for control of an anime production .
Azuma explains that the reason that a Yotsuba& !
anime has not been attempted so far is the difficulty of adapting its idiosyncratic storytelling .
For example , he notes there is one scene in which the title character Yotsu ba is visiting the Ayase family to play .
Yotsu ba walks in the door and says , " Konnichiwa — " ( " Hello ! " ) .
Azuma uses several panels of nothing happening to represent time passing , and then the scene just ends .
North America's A.D. Vision released the first five volumes of the Yotsuba& !
manga , as well as the Azumanga Daioh manga and television anime series .
Thank you to dormcat for the news tip .
Update
The example that Azuma gives is the way other anime would have adapted a scene , not the way he would have , and removed sentence accidentally inserted from another article .

Collapse of Complex Systems I : Nationalization and Shadow Capitalism
February 23 , 2009
Perhaps the " debate " about nationalizing banks is distracting us from the more interesting questions : what complex systems are spinning apart ?
Who stands to win and lose if the current financial pyramid does topple under its own weight ?
Lost in the media kerfluffle about nationalizing banks is the larger question : exactly what difference does any of this make ?
Not to put too fine a point on it , but if assets are falling in value , risk is being priced into loan qualifications for the first time in a decade and nobody in their right mind is seeking to saddle themselves or their firm with more debt , then who cares who or what owns the banks ?
I 've been working through three related texts in the past few weeks :
The Fall of the Roman Empire
Collapse : How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed
The Collapse of Complex Societies ( recommended by astute correspondent Geoffrey G. )
The name of this week 's theme , " Collapse of Complex Systems , " arises from these excellent analyses .
Before we get into the main topic , let 's review the case for nationalizing banks as a " cure for what ails us : "
' Nationalize ' the Banks ( Nouriel Roubini interview ) ( WSJ.com ) Dr. Doom says a takeover and resale is the market - friendly solution .
" Mr. Roubini tells me that bank nationalization " is something the partisans would have regarded as anathema a few weeks ago .
But when I and others put it in the context of the Swedish approach [ of the 1990s ] -- i.e. you take banks over , you clean them up , and you sell them in rapid order to the private sector -- it 's clear that it 's temporary .
No one 's in favor of a permanent government takeover of the financial system . "
There 's another reason why the concept should appeal to ( fiscal ) conservatives , he explains .
" The idea that government will fork out trillions of dollars to try to rescue financial institutions , and throw more money after bad dollars , is not appealing because then the fiscal cost is much larger .
So rather than being seen as something Bolshevik , nationalization is seen as pragmatic .
Paradoxically , the proposal is more market - friendly than the alternative of zombie banks . "
And courtesy of frequent contributor Michael Goodfellow , here is a counter - argument which suggests that " nationalizing the banks is the fix " is simplistic , naive and perhaps entirely wrong - headed :
Banks vs. bank holding companies ( Marginal Revolution blog )
" I usually do n't like to speak so negatively , but it 's the advocates of nationalization who are in denial .
There is a belief that Obama , Bernanke , and / or Geithner are somehow spineless or in the pocket of the banking lobby .
The sadder truth is that they understand just how ill - prepared the U.S. government , or the Fed , would be to run such an enterprise .
I do understand that if all the water runs out of the sink , as it may , nationalization will come in some form or another , however disastrous that may be .
But the desire to postpone it until the last possible moment , and the desire to pursue even a small chance of avoiding nationalization , are signs of wisdom , not cowardice .
When you read about nationalization , and see only the word " bank , " and not " bank holding company , " be very afraid of the advice on tap . "
What strikes me about the nationalization " debate " ( in italics to suggest it is staged / phony / a mere distraction ) is its extreme reification / distance from the core issue , which is what passes for " capitalism " nowadays is a shadow simulacrum of the real thing .
These bogus " debates " dominate the mainstream media ( MSM ) not because the issue is " important " in the sense of " curing what ails us " ( beware facile medical analogies ) but because they offer brilliant obfuscation of what really " ails us " : a model of capitalism which only superficially simulates real capitalism .
Large - scale enterprises which are passed off or presented as " free market capitalism " are in fact one of the following simulacrums of capitalism :
1. Crony capitalism in which money is siphoned off and funneled to one 's pals ( see TARP ) .
2. Gangster capitalism in which legitimate competitors are restricted / limited by regulations
designed to favor the gangsters ' enterprises , or by financial legerdemain or threats / blackmail / seizure .
3 . Monopoly capitalism in which an oligarchy owns controlling stakes in key institutions and enterprises , and then maintains a carefully tended facade of " competition " to shroud the reality of plutocracy .
4 . Pie - in - the - sky capitalism as presented by ideologically funded think - tanks and MSM / plutocracy shills in academia , NGOs ( non-governmental organizations , a.k.a. non-profits ) and the media .
Virtually every example of monopoly / crony capitalism can be cleaned up via propaganda and manipulated / edited " data " into shiny " free market capitalism " if sufficient manure , oops , I mean funding , is shoveled into the think - tanks and shills ' pockets .
5. Central government planning masquerading as " free market capitalism . "
Look no further than the millions of dollars in contracts awarded under the umbrellas of Homeland Security and Defense .
Not to mention TARP , " loans " to the so - called " domestic " auto industry , and other blatant central planning / politically driven awards within supposedly " competitive " structures .
From this perspective , the " debate " about who " owns " the banks , or if the government
nationalizes them just long enough to absorb the losses and then spins them off to the old cronies as " private enterprises " again , is essentially Kabuki theater for the edification of the masses .
By all means , rake those evil greedy bankers over the coals in front of the hot lights of an indignant Congress ( which collected millions of dollars in campaign donations from said evil greedy bankers without a peep ) -- great stuff , great theater ; all we need is a gladiator match or two afterward to complete the public " show . "
And yes , let 's " nationalize " the losses ( that is , shove them onto the taxpayers ) , pull a few wires and strings , and then sell the profit centers off as private companies .
And who stands ready to buy these newly cleaned - of - bad - assets banks ?
Hmm -- does this remind anyone else of how the assets of the old Soviet Union ended up in the hands of a small oligarchy ?
The line that " we need to fix the banks before the economy can prosper again " has been repeated so often that it has acquired a truism status akin to gravity : of course apples must fall to earth .
But is this really true , or is it just a way of defending a desperate attempt to return to the glory days of simulated capitalism ?
Maybe the " problems " we face globally lie elsewhere than the banks ' bad debt and inability to leverage 40 - to - 1 . ( Sob ; without unlimited borrowing and leverage , capitalism is broken ! )
Maybe we should look for systems which are collapsing beneath the superficial " debate " about nationalization .
We are told as a matter of faith that the central " problem " is bad debt and insolvent banks .
That seems too simplistic and convenient to be true ; at a deeper level , it seems the real " problem " is that free - market capitalism has been entirely subverted by simulacrums presented as capitalism .
We are supposed to be terrified of systemic financial collapse , as if civilization will end the second we can't buy cars and houses with almost no money down and banks can't write trillions of dollars in derivatives .
I would hazard that what the powers that be are terrified of is the collapse of simulacrum - capitalism , of which the financial system is the most visible facet .
While we 're on the subject of " collapse , " here are a few other relevant titles :

An important aspect of socializing in our application is letting users to maintain their friend lists and browse through the bookmarks of their friends .
So , in this section we will build a data model to maintain user relationships , and then program two views to enable users to manage their friends and browse their friends ’ bookmarks .
Creating the friendship data model
Let ’s start with the data model for the friends feature .
When a user adds another user as a friend , we need to maintain both users in one object .
Therefore , the Friendship data model will consist of two references to the User objects involved in the friendship .
Create this model by opening the bookmarks / models .py file and inserting the following code in it :
class Friendship ( models .
Model ) :
from_friend = models .
ForeignKey (
User , related_name= 'friend_set '
)
to_friend = models .
ForeignKey (
User , related_name='to_friend_set '
)
def __unicode__( self ) :
return u' %s , %s ' % (
self.from_friend.username ,
self.to_friend.username
)
class Meta :
unique_together = ( ( ' to_friend ' , ' from_friend ' ) , )
The Friendship data model starts with defining two fields that are User objects : from_friend and to_friend .
from_friend is the user who added to_friend as a friend .
As you can see , we passed a keyword argument called related_name to both the fields .
The reason for this is that both fields are foreign keys that refer back to the User data model .
This will cause Django to try to create two attributes called friendship_set in each User object , which would result in a name conflict .
To avoid this problem , we provide a specific name for each attribute .
Consequently , each
User object will contain two new attributes : user .
friend_set , which contains the friends of this user and user.
to_friend_set , which contains the users who added this user as a friend .
Throughout this article , we will only use the friend_set attribute , but the other one is there in case you need it .
Next , we defined a __unicode__ method in our data model .
This method is useful for debugging .
Finally , we defined a class called Meta .
This class may be used to specify various options related to the data model .
Some of the commonly used options are :
db_table :
This is the name of the table to use for the model .
This is useful when the table name generated by Django is a reserved keyword in SQL , or when you want to avoid conflicts if a table with the same name already exists in the database .
: This is the name of the table to use for the model .
This is useful when the table name generated by Django is a reserved keyword in SQL , or when you want to avoid conflicts if a table with the same name already exists in the database .
ordering :
This is a list of field names .
It declares how objects are ordered when retrieving a list of objects .
A column name may be preceded by a minus sign to change the sorting order from ascending to descending .
: This is a list of field names .
It declares how objects are ordered when retrieving a list of objects .
A column name may be preceded by a minus sign to change the sorting order from ascending to descending .
permissions :
This lets you declare custom permissions for the data model in addition to add , change , and delete permissions .
Permissions should be a list of two - tuples , where each two - tuple should consist of a permission codename and a human - readable name for that permission .
For example , you can define a new permission for listing friend bookmarks by using the following Meta class : class Meta :
permissions = (
( ' can_list_friend_bookmarks ' ,
' Can list friend bookmarks ' ) ,
)
: This lets you declare custom permissions for the data model in addition to add , change , and permissions .
Permissions should be a list of two - tuples , where each two - tuple should consist of a permission codename and a human - readable name for that permission .
For example , you can define a new permission for listing friend bookmarks by using the following class : unique_together : A list of field names that must be unique together .
We used the unique_together option here to ensure that a Friendship object is added only once for a particular relationship .
There cannot be two Friendship objects with equal to_friend and from_friend fields .
This is equivalent to the following SQL declaration :
UNIQUE ( " from_friend " , " to_friend " )
If you check the SQL generated by Django for this model , you will find something similar to this in the code .
After entering the data model code into the bookmarks / models .py file , run the following command to create its corresponding table in the database :
$ python manage .py syncdb
Now let ’s experiment with the new model and see how to store and retrieve relations of friendship .
Run the interactive console using the following command :
$ python manage .
py shell
Next , retrieve some User objects and build relationships between them ( but make sure that you have at least three users in the database ) :
>>> from bookmarks .
models import *
>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
>>> user1 = User.objects.get(id=1 )
>>> user2 = User.objects.get(id=2 )
>>> user3 = User.objects.get(id=3 )
>>> friendship1 = Friendship( from_friend=user1 , to_friend=user2 )
>>> friendship1.save ( )
>>> friendship2 = Friendship( from_friend=user1 , to_friend=user3 )
>>> friendship2.save ( )
Now , user2 and user3 are both friends of user1 .
To retrieve the list of Friendship objects associated with user1 , use :
>>> user1.friend_set.all ( )
[ , ]
( The actual usernames in output were replaced with user1 , user2 , and user3 for clarity . )
As you may have already noticed , the attribute is named friend_set because we called it so using the related_name option when we created the Friendship model .
Next , let ’s see one way to retrieve the User objects of user1 ’s friends :
>>> [ friendship.to_friend for friendship in
user1.friend_set.all( ) ]
[ , ]
The last line of code uses a Python feature called “ list ” comprehension to build the list of User objects .
This feature allows us to build a list by iterating through another list .
Here , we built the User list by iterating over a list of Friendship objects .
If this syntax looks unfamiliar , please refer to the List Comprehension section in the Python tutorial .
Notice that user1 has user2 as a friend , but the opposite is not true .
>>> user2.friend_set.all ( )
[ ]
In other words , the Friendship model works only in one direction .
To add user1 as a friend of user2 , we need to construct another Friendship object .
>>> friendship3 = Friendship( from_friend=user2 , to_friend=user1 )
>>> friendship3.save ( )
>>> user2.friend_set.all ( )
[ ]
By reversing the arguments passed to the Friendship constructor , we built a relationship in the other way .
Now user1 is a friend of user2 and vice - versa .
Experiment more with the model to make sure that you understand how it works .
Once you feel comfortable with it , move to the next section , where we will write views to utilize the data model .
Things will only get more exciting from now on !

Has Scholastic , the direct - to - classroom publisher and bookseller , lost its way , pushing cheap toys and video games straight into your kids ' backpacks , all in the name of promoting reading and kicking a few bucks back to our ailing schools ?
Judging by the number of articles and posts I ’ve run across lately , I do n't think I 'm alone in having serious doubts about what role – if any – Scholastic should be allowed to have in schools .
I understand that the schools receive books and teaching material from Scholastic based on sales through students , and I do n't have a particular issue with that .
Other than the fact that it ’s a little sad when school budgets are apparently low enough that supplemental fund raising is needed to help equip the classroom , but that 's another story .
Obviously , I wholeheartedly support the idea of promoting reading to children .
Selling books to kids at decent prices , which in turn helps to support the school seems to be a reasonable balance then .
One of the key factors to me is that most books are n't really considered status symbols by children and the school library is always there for borrowing reading material .
So if a few kids in the class buy books from Scholastic and receive their purchases in the classroom , kids whose parents chose not to support the program , or simply could n't afford it are n't likely to suffer hurt feelings .
But as soon as you cross the line into tie - in books ( like Pokemon , for example ) ; or even worse , into toys , things get much more complicated .
More expensive products truly separate the " haves " from the " have nots , " potentially add a significant degree of peer pressure and make it really difficult to justify this as a reading - promotion program .
Most kids are n't going to ask their parents for a book ; they 're going to go straight to the toy .
I suspect there would be an outcry if Toys ' R ' Us , for example , was allowed to direct - market videogames to students through their school , but Scholastic has snuck this in under the guise of selling books .
They have defended the practice by suggesting that " some kids learn through video games , " as reported in the Chicago Sun - Times .
That 's lame ...
Looking through this month 's offering , which all three of my children bought home from school ( complete with reminders on their calendar of when monthly Scholastic book orders are due ) , I found a selection of books , but also the following products :
Book accompanied by glow - in - the - dark vampire teeth
Book accompanied by plush bunny
Book accompanied by " 4 Cool Tattoos "
Book accompanied by a card game
Book accompanied by an audio CD
Telescope kit ( accompanied by an astronomy book )
70 - piece magnetic car construction and racing kit
A magic set including ring , fake finger and scarf
Themed book set with bonus " Glittery Butterfly Pen "
A kitten - themed writing set including stickers , stationery , stamps , pen and storage box
Bakugan drawing set including pencil crayons
Hannah Montana book pack with writing set ( Hannah Montana notepad , paper , stickers , pen , pencil , etc ... )
Littlest Pet Shop math book with stickers
Transformers reading workbooks with stickers
Panda jigsaw puzzle plus electronic virtual pet
Green - themed science book accompanied by material to make recycled paper
Book accompanied by a fake spilled ketchup packet ( for spilled ketchup - related pranking )
High School musical posters with markers and ( shudder ) a bonus velvet folder to color
More velvet and coloring , this time with a set of NHL posters and markers
Fingerboard mini skateboard ( complete with extra wheels , mini wrench and screwdriver , screws , rivets and a " 32 - Page Color Booklet " that I suppose is intended to make this pass as reading material as opposed to a toy .
Out of 79 items offered for sale on this flyer , I counted 16 that were direct TV show or movie tie-ins .
Mind you , we do n't get cable , so I probably missed some .
And , out of the 79 items , 20 are pushing the definition of " book " to various degrees .
The current flyer does n’t contain video games , but you do n't have to look very hard to find Scholastic school catalogs flogging everything from Lego to Nintendo DS games .
Some of the items are indeed educational , like the telescope for example , but that is n't the point .
Scholastic is a large company with 6,500 employees and 2008 revenues of $ 2.2 billion .
This is obviously big business and adding $ 30 videogames to the mix would certainly increase revenue compared to a $ 2.99 chapter book , so I can understand why they think this is a good idea .
But , should they be allowed to ?
I do n't know about you , but when I buy a toy or a videogame , I 'm going to go to a store ( brick and mortar or online ) where there is selection , I do n't feel like I ’m being guilted into making the purchase and no other kid is going to feel bad because I walk into the school and hand the toy to my kids in front of their classmates .
If you kill more fish , the total population of the species declines .
However , kill only small , young fish , the total number of small , young fish increases .
This seemingly paradoxical conclusion has far reaching implications for the sustainable management of oceans , and is the result of a theoretical study conducted by a research team led by Prof.
André de Roos of the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics ( IBED ) , University of Amsterdam .
A follow up study conducted by the same team now provides experimental evidence to support their initial findings .
When fish are killed , by fishing or predation , a first obvious effect is that the total number of fish of the species in question declines .
However , the removal of fish also results in less competition for food among the remaining individuals .
For example , young , small fish , one can imagine that when a certain percentage of young small fish is selectively removed , the remaining ones have more food available to grow into bigger and stronger adults .
These adults in turn , are able to produce more offspring , i.e. more young small fish , to compensate for the ones that were killed .
In fact , the increased reproduction more than compensates for the number of small fish that were selectively removed in the first place .
This is a simplified version of the type of relationships that Prof .
De Roos and his team revealed in a theoretical study that was published in the American Naturalist in 2007 .
The modeling study indeed predicted that selectively removing specimens of certain size classes not only results in compensation induced by changes in competition for resources , but in fact results in over - compensation .
The seemingly paradoxical implication is that selectively fishing away small , young fish results in an increase in the number of small , young fish .
In a similar manner , the modeling study also predicted that the selective removal of large , adult individuals can lead to an increase in small , young fish densities .
To test their predictions , Prof .
De Roos and his team performed an experimental follow up study in Sweden that was recently concluded and supports their theoretical conclusions in all respects .
This includes the specific example of selectively culling a certain percentage of small , young fish , which indeed was found to lead to an increase in their total numbers .
The results of the experimental study were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science in February 2009 .
Together , both studies show once more that marine food webs are very complicated and that interfering with them may lead to unanticipated results .
However , they also show that by carefully studying the relationships , they can be understood and modeled .
Both these conclusions have far reaching implications for the sustainable management of oceans .
For example , in a forthcoming publication in the Canadian Journal for Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences it is shown that this type of overcompensation may prevent a marine reserve from functioning as a source of young fish .
This latter is one way in which marine reserves were believed to contribute to a sustainable exploitation of marine fish stocks .
Now the plan is to increase investment banking and investment management across Asia .
Agius says he would certainly look at RBS 's sale of the Asian business it acquired when it beat Barclays to buy ABN Amro .
One of the attractions of the Dutch bank had always been its network of licenses in Asia .
He did not however meet anyone from RBS while he was there , as the sale of that business would , he said , be dealt with out of London .

Moderates now find themselves betwixt and between .
On the left , there is a president who appears to be , as Crook says , “ a conviction politician , a bold progressive liberal . ”
On the right , there are the Rush Limbaugh brigades .
The only thing more scary than Obama ’s experiment is the thought that it might fail and the political power will swing over to a Republican Party that is currently unfit to wield it .
Those of us in the moderate tradition  the Hamiltonian tradition that believes in limited but energetic government  thus find ourselves facing a void .
We moderates are going to have to assert ourselves .
We ’re going to have to take a centrist tendency that has been politically feckless and intellectually vapid and turn it into an influential force .
The first task will be to block the excesses of unchecked liberalism .
In the past weeks , Democrats have legislated provisions to dilute welfare reform , restrict the inflow of skilled immigrants and gut a voucher program designed for poor students .
It will be up to moderates to raise the alarms against these ideological outrages .
But beyond that , moderates will have to sketch out an alternative vision .
This is a vision of a nation in which we ’re all in it together  in which burdens are shared broadly , rather than simply inflicted upon a small minority .
This is a vision of a nation that does not try to build prosperity on a foundation of debt .
This is a vision that puts competitiveness and growth first , not redistribution first .
Moderates are going to have to try to tamp down the polarizing warfare that is sure to flow from Obama ’s über - partisan budget .
They will have to face fiscal realities honestly and not base revenue projections on rosy scenarios of a shallow recession and robust growth next year .
They will have to take the economic crisis seriously and not use it as a cue to focus on every other problem under the sun .
They ’re going to have to offer an agenda that inspires confidence by its steadiness rather than shaking confidence with its hyperactivity .
If they can do that , maybe they can lure this White House back to its best self  and someday offer respite from the endless war of the extremes .

A Dutch MP who called the Koran a " fascist book " has been sent back to the Netherlands after attempting to defy a ban on entering the UK .
Freedom Party MP Geert Wilders had been invited to show his controversial film - which links the Islamic holy book to terrorism - in the UK's House of Lords .
But Mr Wilders , who faces trial in his own country for inciting hatred , has been denied entry by the Home Office .
He told the BBC it was a " very sad day " for UK democracy .
The Dutch ambassador was also at Heathrow to make clear his government 's opposition to the ban on Mr Wilders entering the UK .
' Free speech ' Mr Wilders ' film Fitna caused outrage across the Muslim world when it was posted on the internet last year .
After being questioned at Heathrow , the MP said he had been to the House of Lords two weeks ago and there had been " no problem " .
He added : " I 'm not doing anything wrong .
I 'm not protesting or running through the streets of London . "

Send us your comments Mr Wilders added : " Democracy means differences and debate .
It 's a very sad day when the UK bans an elected parliamentarian ...
Of course I will come back . "
He said the government 's actions had proved that Gordon Brown was the " biggest coward in Europe " .
Mr Brown 's spokesman said the prime minister " fully supports the decision " taken by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith .
Mr Wilders was invited to the House of Lords for a screening of Fitna by the UK Independence Party 's Lord Pearson .
The peer said it was a " matter of free speech " , telling the BBC : " We are going to show it anyway because we think MPs and peers should see this film . "
' No purpose '
He added : " The film is n't offensive unless you are a violent Islamist .
Most of my Muslim friends think it 's a very good film . "
Fitna 's opening scenes show a copy of the Koran followed by footage of the 9/11 attacks in the US and the bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005 .
The Lords screening went ahead as planned , despite Mr Wilder 's non-attendance .
RECENT CASES
Jamaican reggae singer Bounty Killer ( real name Rodney Pryce ) allowed entry despite using controversial lyrics about homosexuals and gang culture Muslim cleric Dr Yusuf al - Qaradawi refused entry in order to protect community cohesion .
He has described suicide bombers as " martyrs " and homosexuality as " a disease " Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan barred on the grounds that his allegedly racist and anti-Semitic views could threaten public order Martha Stewart and US rapper Snoop Dogg denied entry because of criminal convictions
Who is barred from Britain ?
Profile : Geert Wilders BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said about 30 people had been at the screening and had given a round of applause , while calling for a debate on the issues raised .
The Dutch prime minister has said the film serves " no purpose other than to offend " .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband told the BBC's Hardtalk : " The home secretary made a decision on an individual case as she is required to do . "
He added that the film contained " extreme anti-Muslim hate and we have very clear laws in this country " .
Mr Miliband also said : " We have profound commitment to freedom of speech but there is no freedom to cry ' fire ' in a crowded theatre and there is no freedom to stir up hate , religious and racial hatred , according to the laws of the land . "
Cabinet Office minister Liam Byrne said , on BBC One 's Question Time : " This guy was n't coming here to exercise his right of free speech .
This guy was trying to come here in order to sow division between us in this country .
" Everything I 've heard about this guy tells me he's a bigot and the right place for him is to stay at home . "
The Home Office said there was a blanket ban on Mr Wilders entering the UK under EU laws enabling member states to exclude someone whose presence could threaten public security .
' No respect ' " The government opposes extremism in all forms , " it said in a statement , adding that it had tightened up rules on excluding those engaging in " unacceptable behaviour " in October .
The home secretary has the power to stop people entering the UK if she believes there is a threat to national security , public order or the safety of UK citizens , but she cannot exclude people simply because of their views .
Earlier this year , a Dutch court ordered prosecutors to put the MP on trial for inciting hatred and discrimination by making anti-Islamic statements .

More from BBC Radio 5 live Labour peer Lord Ahmed , who expressed his concerns to the parliamentary authorities about Mr Wilders ' visit , told the BBC : " This man does n't have any respect for law .
He 's doing this for publicity and he 's seeking that and getting that . "
He added : " If this man was allowed into this country it would certainly cause problems within communities around Britain . "
The Muslim Council of Britain said Mr Wilders was " an open and relentless preacher of hate " .
Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " Freedom of speech is our most precious freedom of all , because all the other freedoms depend on it .
" But there is a line to be drawn even with freedom of speech , and that is where it is likely to incite violence or hatred against someone or some group . "

Greetings from Cambridge !
The American one , that is .
I 'm at the International Lisp Conference , which is an OK set of talks , but an excellent group of almost 200 Lisp hackers .
What follows is not strictly journalism , but rather reflections of a more subjective nature .
Sunday was reserved for " tutorials " , four sessions of an hour and a half in length , with an expository and relaxed flavor .
There were three sessions running at a time , which made for some hard choices .
The first session that I went to was " Monads for the Working Lisp Programmer " , which started off by explaining monads , and in the second session looked at their uses .
As a working Lisp programmer , I guess it 's good to be able to talk down Haskell weenies , but something about the complexity of the " plumbing " does n't sit right .
People keep talking about separating the " plumbing " from the computation -- as if programming somehow involves clogged pipes or something .
The presenters did a good job , but " different strokes , different folks " .
I jetted out after the first session .
Next I decided to drop in on the second session of Pascal Constanza 's tutorial on CLOS , generic functions , and the meta - object protocol .
It was very clearly presented , and even though I 've been working with GOOPS ( a CLOS - a - like ) for a long time , I came away with some style tips .
Also seeing his LispWorks environment was very interesting .
So much of programming is workflow and environment , something that often requires you to look over the shoulder of a master .
I was a bit frustrated though , as I came with questions but it seemed Pascal had a curriculum he wanted to stick to .
I 'll corner him later .
Actually , that 's the best thing about this conference , this ability to corner smart people .
So far they do n't have that harried , ragged look yet .
In the afternoon , I went to Rich Hickey 's Clojure tutorials ( parts 2 and 3 ) .
What a treat .
Hickey 's instincts and good taste as a language designer are evident .
All languages deserve to have his persistent data structures .
His discussion of state and identity was particularly lucid , as well .
( Hickey say that the talk on state and time was basically the same one he gave at InfoQ . )
Personally I do n't care for the JVM , and I feel Clojure 's worth as a general - purpose language is actually hampered by the lack of tail recursion , but I really think that his design ideas should percolate out to all the dynamic languages of the world .
Now it 's Monday morning , and I 'm sitting in on the plenary technical talks and software demonstrations .
They 're OK , but thus far yesterday had a better feel .
I 'm very much looking forward to the afternoon sessions .

Has Sheriff in Phelps Pot Case Gone Too Far ?
Eight arrested for pot possession -- has crusading sheriff gone too far ?
Feb . 12 , 2009  --
Two South Carolina defense attorneys are questioning the motives of Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott , who is pursuing criminal charges against eight people who allegedly smoked marijuana with Olympian Michael Phelps .
" It is a fascination if not an effort to destroy a public hero , " said Joe McCulloch , an attorney for one of the suspects , today on " Good Morning America . "
" He 's the sheriff , not the Terminator ! "
Authorities recently executed search warrants at two private homes in Columbia , S.C. , and arrested eight people for marijuana possession in connection with an investigation into the photo of Olympic swimmer Phelps holding a bong .
Less than an ounce of marijuana was confiscated by sheriff 's deputies , sources told ABC News .
" This is ridiculous .
This is about college kids smoking pot and in no way justifies 12 officers entering a house with guns drawn to terrorize college kids , " said attorney Dick Harpootlian , who is representing another suspect .
The lawyers would not name their clients , who each face up to 30 days in jail and a $ 200 fine if convicted on the pending charges , according to The Associated Press .
Lott would not comment today to " GMA , " but said earlier in the week that Phelps should not get a free pass because he is a celebrity .
" The sheriff has a responsibility to not turn a blind eye because someone is a celebrity , " Lott told ABC affiliate WIS - TV .
" I just do n't think you can have something like this done and publicized and say , ' I 'm sorry and we 're supposed to forgive you . ' "
But even South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford questioned Lott 's judgment .
" I do n't see what it gets at this point , " Sanford said on Fox News 's " Geraldo at Large . "
McCulloch and Harpootlian believe Lott may want to bring charges against Phelps himself .
Harpootlian said that his client and others were " extensively interrogated " about Phelps .
" What they are trying to do is get somebody to say , ' I was there , that was Michael Phelps , he was smoking marijuana , ' so maybe they can charge him , " McCulloch said .
Bong , Partially Smoked Joint Confiscated
One of the properties was identified by the sheriff 's department as a location where marijuana was " frequently stored and consumed , " according to the search warrant affidavit , which also said police searched trash from the property that had been left by the road for collection .
Sgt. M.A. Poole of the Richland County Sheriff 's Department appeared before a judge Feb. 6 to request the search warrants .
Sheriff 's spokesman Lt. Chris Cowan would not confirm the arrests , but said there is an ongoing investigation into whether Phelps or others broke the law during a party -- allegedly held in November 2008 -- where Phelps was photographed with a bong in his hands .
Property taken during one of the raids included computers , marijuana -- including a partially smoked joint -- a bong , a cell phone , a portable drive and a camera , according to the sheriff 's inventory from the search .
Phelps ' Bong On eBay ?
Legal sources close to the men arrested denied reports that the bong allegedly used by Phelps was put up for sale on eBay .
The exact whereabouts of that bong , or whether it was the one seized in the raid , could not be confirmed .
The legal sources also questioned why the sheriff has focused resources on a raid to arrest marijuana users when the city has experienced a spate of violent crime , including several armed robberies at ATM machines in recent weeks .
According to The State newspaper , there was a fatal shooting at a Bank of America ATM on Jan. 21 .

A few weeks ago , our Editor Loyd Case issued a challenge : For the Bang for the Buck system , build a Core i7 - based PC for $ 1200 .
We failed .
Here ’s the thing , though .
We could have gone much cheaper on some of the parts , but who wants a 320 GB hard drive or a weak graphics card ?
Who wants onboard audio or a tidbit of memory ?
Who wants el- cheapo Core 2 Duo parts when the Core i7 920 is so affordable ?
This is n’t the sub -$ 800 build , it ’s the Bang for the Buck , and we look at every part and scour the industry for the best performance we can get for the price .
Our system is built from a set of components , each individually offering the best bang for the buck .
A $ 1200 Core i7 would have been mostly a budget system with a high performance CPU — clearly not fitting our definition of Bang for the Buck .
Even with keyboard , monitor , mouse and speakers , plus , the total price of this BftB is just a bit over $ 2000 if you shop smartly .
If you have peripherals and a transferrable version of Vista Home Premium , the core components only come to $ 1500 or so .
This , folks , is a bargain for a build with current - generation equipment .
Ready for the ride through the parts breakdown and benchmarks ?
Here we go .

LAND O' LAKES , Fla . -
A middle - school teacher accused of coming to class intoxicated and forcing students to dance in an inappropriate manner has been caught on video .
During the incident last week , students used cell phones to take videos and pictures of 42 - year - old teacher Kylene Nelson as she began exhibiting the strange behavior during her first - period language arts class at Charles S. Rushe Middle School , where Nelson taught eighth - graders .
A student , who did not want to be identified , said Nelson reeked of alcohol and was making strange faces during her first - period language arts class .
Later , music was turned on and , students say , Nelson began grabbing them and demanding they dance .
" She started saying , ' If you do n't dance with me , you guys all fail , ' " the student recalled .
At one point , witnesses say Nelson partially exposed her buttocks while dancing with a 13 - year - old boy .
" We told her , Miss Nelson , please pull up your pants ' , and she did , but then they fell down again and she held them there , " the eighth - grader said , also noting her teacher did not appear to have on underwear .
" She was kinda grinding , like , putting her butt against you , " the student said .
Reports show Nelson had a blood - alcohol level of 0.26 and later ran from the school to a nearby community center where she was found passed out by a pool .
District administrators say Nelson remains on administrative leave pending a decision on her future by the Pasco County School Board .
A recommendation on how to discipline Nelson will be made during an April 21 school board meeting .
The decision on whether or not to terminate her employment will ultimately be left up to the school board .
In a separate incident in October 2006 , reports indicate Nelson failed to show up for a third - period class at Seven Spring Middle School .
A school resource officer found Nelson passed out in her car surrounded by bottles of wine .
She was ordered to change schools and undergo a substance abuse program , but remained employed with the Pasco County school district .
Students say Nelson was a great teacher , but now hope she can get help for her alcohol problem .
The country ’s leading health insurers Tuesday offered to end their long - standing practice of charging sick customers higher premiums , a significant concession in the face of mounting criticism of the industry in Washington .
The offer from America ’s Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Assn. , whose member companies cover more than 200 million people , comes as lawmakers on Capitol Hill debate a proposal to create a government - run insurance program .
It underscores the pressure the industry faces from Congress and the Obama administration as policymakers move ahead with plans to reshape the nation ’s healthcare system .
The industry ’s underwriting policies are widely criticized for driving millions of people into the ranks of the uninsured .

The number of uninsured people in the U.S. has increased by nearly 9 million since 1994 , reaching 45.7 million , according to a study released Tuesday by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation .
The study also found that nearly 1 in 5 working adults is uninsured .
Tuesday , Karen Ignagni , who heads America ’s Health Insurance Plans , said insurers want to help reverse that .
“ The private sector can rise to the challenge of solving these problems , ” she said .
Ignagni and Blue Cross Blue Shield Assn. President Scott P. Serota made the offer in a letter to senior senators .
But it came with a catch :
The insurers said all Americans must first buy health insurance to boost the size of the risk pool , a concept opposed by many consumer groups .
“ By enacting an effective , enforceable requirement that all Americans assume responsibility to obtain and maintain health insurance , we believe we could guarantee issue coverage with no pre-existing condition exclusions and phase out the practice of varying premiums based on health status in the individual market , ” they wrote .

The two industry leaders said insurers would still need to vary rates based on age , family size and geography .
And they called for permission to offer discounts for people who engage in healthier behaviors such as quitting smoking and adhering to treatment programs for chronic diseases .
CRT Capital Group analyst Sheryl Skolnick , who follows the insurance industry , said the offer to forgo medically underwritten premiums may be a recognition by insurers that they need to “ do what it takes ” to get people back into the insurance market .
“ I ’m sure they want this to be seen as a major step forward in promoting reform , ” Skolnick said .
“ I just want to know what the catch is . ”

She said insurers had decided they had more to gain by dropping variable pricing than by fighting to maintain it .
Ignagni would not say Tuesday whether revenue lost by equalizing premiums between sick and healthy customers could be recouped by insurers in a larger market in which all Americans have to buy insurance .
Also unclear is whether the insurers ’ proposal will head off calls for a government - run insurance program .
After years of horror stories of Americans denied coverage , many congressional Democrats are committed not only to stepping up regulation of the insurance market but also to creating a so - called public plan to bring down the number of uninsured .
Advertisement
Such a plan , which liberals and interest groups say is necessary , would compete directly with private insurers .
Industry representatives vehemently oppose it , saying it would drive insurers out of business and lead to the creation of a single - payer system akin to those in Canada and Britain .
Ignagni and Serota reiterated their opposition Tuesday in the letter .
“ Creating a new government - run plan would thwart the ability of the healthcare sector to implement meaningful delivery system reforms , exacerbate the cost shifting from public programs to consumers in the private market , and destabilize the employer - based system , ” they wrote .
Advertisement
But industry leaders , who 15 years ago were blamed for scuttling President Clinton ’s health reform campaign , are also being careful not to appear too recalcitrant .
Late last year , America ’s Health Insurance Plans said insurers would no longer reject people with pre-existing conditions if Washington policymakers created a mandate requiring all Americans to get insurance .
And Tuesday , Ignagni emphasized again the industry ’s commitment to remaining at the negotiating table .
She said her group would release a proposal within a month to address problems that many small businesses face when one of its employees gets sick , resulting in dramatic premium hikes for the business .

“ We ’ve been working with a number of small - business organizations and small businesses themselves , ” Ignagni said .
The industry groups ’ letter was greeted with mild praise by several lawmakers Tuesday .
But an aide to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , who is a leader in the effort on Capitol Hill to overhaul the healthcare system , said he would not back away from creating a new government insurance program .
The White House declined to comment on the offer .
A spokeswoman for Iowa Sen. Charles E. Grassley , the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , dismissed the letter as simply reiterating the industry ’s positions .
Advertisement
Richard Kirsch , who heads Healthcare for Americans Now , a leading consumer group in Washington , blasted the letter as cynical ploy .
“ It ’s a sign of their desperation , ” Kirsch said .
“ They are still looking to find out how they can charge us as much as they want and have no competition from a public plan . ”

New Book on Nazi - Era Humor  Did You Hear the One About Hitler ?
A new book about humor under the Nazis gives some interesting insights into life in the Third Reich and breaks yet another taboo in Germanys treatment of its history .
Jokes told during the era , says the author , provided the populace with a pressure release .
Das Bundeskabinett hat am heutigen Mittwoch die Eckpunkte für eine gesetzliche Regelung über Blockaden kinderpornographischer Webseiten beschlossen .
Bundesfamilienministerin Ursula von der Leyen zeigte sich zufrieden : Die Mehrzahl der großen Provider , nämlich 75 Prozent , habe sich entschlossen , den von ihr seit Monaten mit Nachdruck geforderten Vertrag über eine freiwillige Zugangserschwernis zu kinderpornographischen Angeboten im Web abzuschließen , erklärte die CDU - Politikerin vor der Presse .
So seien die Deutsche Telekom , Vodafone / Arcor , Hansenet / Alice , O2 und Kabel Deutschland nun bereit , die Selbstverpflichtung abzugeben .
Die aus den Verhandlungen ausgestiegenen Zugangsanbieter Freenet , Versatel und United Internet ( 1&1 ) würden im zweiten Schritt mit dem angestrebten Gesetz gezwungen , " Seiten , die Vergewaltigungen zeigen , zu sperren " .
Im Vorfeld hatte eine Sprecherin des Verbands der deutschen Internetwirtschaft eco gegenüber der " taz " noch gewarnt : " Eine politische Absichtserklärung ändert nichts an der bestehenden Rechtsunsicherheit für die Unternehmen . "
In den von der Bundesregierung verabschiedeten Eckpunkten heißt es auch unmissverständlich , dass im Rahmen der angestrebten gesetzlichen Regelung erst noch " Fragen bezüglich des Schutzes der Grundrechte " zu klären seien .
Beruhigt hat die kooperationswilligen
Anbieter aber wohl die Klausel , dass Haftungsansprüche bei Einhaltung nicht näher spezifizierter rechtlicher Vorgaben " wirtschaftlich nicht von ihnen zu tragen sind " .
Von der Leyen geht nun davon aus , dass die den Vertrag unterschreibenden Provider die Filter - und Sperrmechanismen " in drei bis sechs Monaten " implementiert haben .
Zumindest habe Telekom - Chef René Obermann ihr zugesichert , dass sich sein Unternehmen jetzt zügig an die Umsetzung machen werde und diese Zeitschiene dafür benötige .
Zugleich versicherte die Ministerin , dass das Bundeskriminalamt ( BKA ) die einzelnen Seiten identifiziere und " die volle Haftung übernimmt " .
Parallel werde die Bundesregierung unter Führung des Bundeswirtschaftsministerium eine Änderung des Telemediengesetzes ( TMG ) vorantreiben und darin die Auflagen zur Zugangserschwernis normieren .
Sie hoffe , dass auch die SPD " zügig helfen wird " , die Novellierung zu verabschieden : " Wir müssen ganz konsequent an einem Strang ziehen . "
" Die Würde des Kindes ist ein höheres Gut als die Massenkommunikation " , betonte die Familienministerin .
80 Prozent der Nutzer würden " per Zufall und aus Neugier " auf kinderpornographischen Webseiten landen .
Dort habe man sich bisher Filme runterladen können , " die das Zerfetzen der Kinder zeigt " .
So hätte der Eindruck entstehen können , " dass das etwas sei , was viele machen " .
Das habe die Hemmschwelle gesenkt .
User seien " angefixt " und dann in schwerer zugänglich Foren für Pädophile gelockt worden .
Nun würden die Verbindungen zu entsprechenden Webseiten von vornherein unterbunden .
Bernhard Rohleder , Geschäftsführer des Branchenverbands Bitkom , begrüßte unterdessen im " Deutschlandfunk " , dass die Eckpunkte das Thema der Haftung aufgreifen würden .
" Aber wir wollen an der Stelle durchaus eines vermeiden , dass die Internet - Wirtschaft eine Art Hilfspolizei im Internet wird " , gab er trotzdem zu bedenken .
" Wir sehen eine lange Liste von Anspruchsstellern aus ganz anderen Bereichen .
Dort geht es dann um Rechtsradikalismus , es geht um Antisemitismus bis hin zu einfachen urheberrechtlichen Verletzungen . "
Dringend erforderlich sei es daher , " dass wir hier eine Diskussion führen in Deutschland über die Frage , wie frei darf das Internet sein und wo sind die Grenzen dieser Freiheit " .

In yesterday 's New York Times , Author 's Guild president Roy Blount Jr. rails against the Kindle 's text - to - speech feature , opining that it infringes copyright because it provides a " derivative work " by creating audio editions of your textfiles .
Blount says that eventually , text - to - speech will be so darned perfect , the audiobook market will be destroyed by it , so he aims to do something about it right now .
He does n't actually say what that thing is .
Presumably , he 'd like Amazon to simply remove the feature .
But if you take Blount at his word , then we can only assume the feature will spread to other platforms — does he think that iPhones should n't be able to read your email to you as you jog ?
And if it can read your email , what 's to stop it from reading your ebooks ?
Blount implies that there 's a simple solution to his technological problem , but if you truly believe that it should be illegal to ask software to produce audio of copyrighted works , then Blount 's lining himself up to fight the entire future of technology that can convert text to speech .
Continuing to take Blount at his word , let 's assume that he 's right on the copyright question , namely , that :
1. Converting text to speech infringes copyright
2 . Providing the software that is capable of committing copyright infringement makes you liable for copyright infringement , too
1. is going to be sticky — the Author 's Guild is setting itself up to fight the World Blind Union , phone makers , free software authors , ebook makers , and a whole host of people engaged in teaching computers to talk .
But 2 . is really hairy .
If Blount believes that making a device capable of infringing copyright is the same as infringing copyright ( something refuted by the Supreme Court in Betamax in 1984 , the decision that legalized VCRs ) , then email , web - browsers , computers , photocopiers , cameras , and typewriters are all illegal , too .
Time and again , the Author 's Guild has shown itself to be the epitome of a venal special interest group , the kind of grasping , foolish posturers that make the public cynically assume that the profession it represents is a racket , not a trade .
This is , after all , the same gang of weirdos who opposed the used book trade going online .
I think there 's plenty not to like about the Kindle — the DRM , the proprietary file format , both imposed on authors and publishers even if they do n't want it — and about Amazon 's real audiobook section , Audible ( the DRM — again , imposed on authors and publishers even if they 'd prefer not to use it ) .
But if there 's one thing Amazon has demonstrated , it 's that it plans on selling several bazillion metric tons of audiobooks .
They control something like 90 percent of the market .
To accuse them of setting out to destroy it just does n't pass the giggle - test .
One of the most powerful weapons in the publishing industry 's arsenal is that it is n't the record or film industry .
By and large , publishing is undertaken by bookish people who love books and bookselling and readers and writers .
By and large , writers get a decent deal from their publishers — especially relative to recording artists ; most writers do n't have to sign over their copyrights , do n't have the promotion of their books deducted from their royalties , etc .
By and large , publishers do n't sue tool - makers or accuse readers of being crooks .
Unlike the record and film industries , who seem bent on doing everything in their power to build the moral case for ripping them off — to convince the public that they are a passel of greedy , clueless technophobes who deserve to have their industries killed , if only to protect the 21st century from them — there are very few people who feel this way about publishing and authorship .
Unless , that is , groups like the Authors '
Guild continue to make us all out to be cut from the same cloth as media execs like Universal Music 's Larry Kenswil , who once bellowed " FAIR USE IS THE LAST REFUGE OF THE SCOUNDREL " at me from a stage at the RSA in London .
Dear Mr Blount : you do n't represent me .
You do n't represent the future of authorship .
You and your group are jeopardizing the future of authorship and of society with your petty little grabs and ridiculous posturing .
Cut it out before someone gets hurt .
True , you can already get software that will read aloud whatever is on your computer .
But Kindle 2 is being sold specifically as a new , improved , multimedia version of books – every title is an e-book and an audio book rolled into one .
And whereas e-books have yet to win mainstream enthusiasm , audio books are a billion - dollar market , and growing .
Audio rights are not generally packaged with e-book rights .
They are more valuable than e-book rights .
Income from audio books helps not inconsiderably to keep authors , and publishers , afloat .
The Kindle Swindle ?
Not many know , but Russian engineers have constructed the mobile nuclear power plants that were sucessfully used in distant parts of Russia .
Those were small sized self moving fully functional atomic power plants with a small reactor inside .
Just imagine , small nuclear power plants that could reach the destination points by themselves .
There were two basic models – tracked and on regular wheels .
After the Chernobyl disaster use of those was discontinued .
This could be an outcome :

Barry Manilow , the coiffed , ever - young hero of blue - haired old ladies the world over , could live to see his music transformed from drunken pub fare into the newest innovation in crowd control , according to the Associated Press .
A shopping mall in the New Zealand city of Christchurch is reportedly having trouble with juvenile delinquents spreading trash , getting drunk , getting high , tagging walls with spray paint , and talking filth to local shoppers .
The solution ?
Pipe in hits like “ Mandy ” and “ Ca n’t Smile Without You , ” which , like this obnoxious tone said to be the scourge of teenage ruffians everywhere , will ( it is hoped ) clear the area of smack - talking punks .
Paul Lonsdale , manager of the local business association , denies that Manilow was selected to drive teenagers crazy .
“ The intention is to change the environment in a positive way … so nobody feels threatened or intimidated , ” he says .
“ I did not say that Barry Manilow is a weapon of mass destruction . ”
No , for that look to some other acts , like the Red Hot Chili Peppers , which the CIA used to bully Al Qaeda leader Abu Zabaydah into spilling his beans ( along with other forms of “ enhanced interrogation ” ) .
We should also not forget that Van Halen , Whitesnake , and Black Sabbath , among others , ultimately convinced Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega that he ’d rather spend the rest of his life in a federal supermax than sit through another minute of “ War Pigs . ”
Will such tactics work on Christchurch ’s problem children ?
Doubtful if we believe 16 - year old Emma Belcher .

A Norfolk couple whose children were adopted after accusations of abuse have been told they can not get them back .
The couple " may be right " in believing they suffered a miscarriage of justice but the courts can do nothing for them , senior Appeal Court judges have said .
Nicky , 27 , and Mark Webster , 35 , from Cromer , were refused permission to set aside adoption orders for their three eldest children made in December 2005 .
Social workers began proceedings after accusing them of injuring a child .
The three children have only been referred to in the case as A , B and C .
The action was taken by Norfolk County Council because B had suffered non-accidental injuries .
The court concluded that after three years it was in any event too late to set the orders aside
Appeal Court judgement
However , evidence came to light in 2007 showing the child may not have suffered deliberate injury and the fractures may have been attributable to scurvy or iron deficiency caused by a feeding disorder .
The three appeal judges said : " The case emphasises the finality of adoption orders .
" The circumstances in which adoption orders can be revoked or set aside are extremely limited .
None applied in the present case .
" The court concluded that after three years it was in any event too late to set the orders aside , and that it would not be in the interests of the children to do so .
" It is therefore possible ( Mr and Mrs Webster would say probable ) that the basis upon which A , B and C were taken into care and subsequently adopted ( Mr and Mrs Webster 's alleged non-accidental injury of child B ) was wrong .
I have huge sympathy for Mr and Mrs Webster
Lisa Christensen , director of children 's services at Norfolk County Council " Mr and Mrs Webster believe that they have suffered a miscarriage of justice .
They may be right .
" It would , however , be wrong in the court 's view to criticise any of the doctors or social workers in the case .
Each has acted properly throughout .
" If there is a lesson to be learned from the case it is the need to obtain second opinions on injuries to children at the earliest opportunity , particularly in cases where , as here , the facts are unusual . "
Lisa Christensen , director of children 's services at Norfolk County Council , said : " I have huge sympathy for Mr and Mrs Webster .
" It has taken a very long time to reach this stage and this must have been a very hard experience for them .
" The judgement explores every element of the case .
I needed to be assured Norfolk children 's services ' role was done properly and I am satisfied the judges have recognised we did everything we should have done . "

The " inlet outlet " allows users to give power back to the grid to counteract energy consumption .
Image credit : Carla Diana and Jeff Hoefs , Smart Design .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Ever wish you could you power your home 's electrical appliances with the energy you generate on your exercise bike ?
A new concept called an " inlet outlet " could allow homeowners to put power from kinetic household activities - such as exercise equipment - back into the grid through a wall socket , helping to lower electricity bills .
Basically , the inlet outlet would be the opposite of a typical wall outlet .
The concept was one of 50 finalists at this year 's Greener Gadgets Design Competition , which was held last Friday , February 27 , in New York City , and is sponsored by the Consumer Electronics Association .
Designed by Carla Diana and Jeff Hoefs of Smart Design , the inlet outlet concept includes adapter kits that convert common household products into energy - generating devices compatible with the inlet outlets .
Besides exercise equipment , sources of reusable energy could include things like a refrigerator or gas oven / range , which generate heat that could be captured by a panel and converted into electricity .
In addition , motion is everywhere : a welcome mat that is constantly stepped on , an outdoor trampoline , and a flag in the wind all generate kinetic energy that could be converted into electricity and fed back into the grid through the inlet outlet .
No matter how small , inlet energy could counteract some of the energy consumed .
The designers hope that , if the inlet outlet plugs and adapters are easy to use , the system could encourage further development of household devices that can be used to generate electricity .
The inlet outlet was just one of many innovative eco concepts at the competition , and did n't make the top 10 .
Based on audience feedback and live judging , a concept called the Tweet - a - Watt - a power meter that wirelessly publishes your power usage on your Twitter page - won first place .
The Power - Hog , a piggy bank that monitors power consumption , won second place .

Artist 's Statement
As a rare glimpse into the collaborative process between two creative minds , I reproduce these excerpts from an email exchange between myself and Jennifer Boylan , author of She ’s Not There : A Life in Two Genders and I ’m Looking Through You : Growing Up Haunted .
Tim , Yesterday , November 17th , 2008 , I had this dream : I was back in the house I lived in with my family in the 1960s , and there in one of the rooms was our man Mr. Jerry Garcia .
I was my present grown - self Jenny Boylan .
[ SEX SCENE REDACTED ]
In the end it was time for me to leave , and he seemed sad , and I said , LISTEN , JERRY .
I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING .
And he looked at me suspiciously and said , What , man ?
And I said , YOU'RE IN TERRIBLE TROUBLE .
SOMETHING AWFUL IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU UNLESS YOU'RE CAREFUL .
He raised an eyebrow and said , " How do you know what 's going to happen to me ? "
And I put my arm around him and said , plaintively , " Because .
I 'm from the future ! "
At this moment it was clear from his expression that he thought I was nuts , just one more insane chick trying to mess with his head .
You know that look people give you when you tell them you 're from the future , and they do n't believe you ?
That look .
I just said , " I 'm sorry you do n't believe me . "
He said , " I 'm sorry too . "
Then he picked up his guitar and he sang a song -- it was " Attics of My Life , " from American Beauty .
He looked me in the eyes and sang , " When I had no dreams to dream , you dreamed of me . "
Later , after I woke up , I thought , you know what , I DO come from the future .
And I was n't wrong about him either .
Because , since he 's dead and everything , he does n't have any dreams to dream .
But nonetheless , I dreamed of him .
I was thinking the line , " Because !
I 'm from the future ! " is probably a line that ought to go in a panel of The Pain , at some point .
It 's sad the way people in the past NEVER EVER FUCKING BELIEVE YOU when you tell them you 're from the future , they just assume you 're an asshole , instead of someone sent through the space time continuum especially to help them .
It 's a thankless job , time - travel .
Jenny , I think in my hands this cartoon would be called , " I'm From the Future , Asshole ! "
It 's a solid premise .
Tim I would use my time travel simply to try to knock a little sense into people .
Like --" Mr. Kennedy , why do n't you travel in a car with a roof ?
Just for the heck of it ? "
OR : " Hey !
Trojans !
Did ya ever wonder WHY the Ithacans want you have a giant horse ?
I mean , you KNOW they hate you !
I would want to tell my eight - year - old self all sorts of things , but my guess is , I 'd just take the kid out and get him drunk .
Recently my colleague Alex Robinson has taken to posing the question : " If your high school self could see you now , what would he / she think of you ? "
Some have answered that their high school selves would be utterly disgusted , and smother their adult selves with a pillow - - and that their adult selves would limply submit to smothering as their just due .
Tony Consiglio , one of the funniest people alive , immediately said that , granted this opportunity , he would make sweet , sweet love to his 16 - year - old self .
Tim , you should know that since this morning I cannot stop thinking about the idea of a Time Machine owned not by some evil scientist genius , but by , like , just some stoner guy , who uses it to go and get Demerol .
Like , he could go see the Crucifixion , Pickett 's Charge , or the signing of the Constitution , but no , not so much .
Sometimes he goes and bothers his old girlfriends .
" Aw come on , man , just gimme one more chance ! "
Our narrator , who is me , keeps finding evidence that our man is fucking with the space time continuum .
And every time he goes back to like , Woodstock , say , he keeps running into dozens of other versions of himself there , because in the future ?
He just keeps coming back to the same places .
I guess this is turning into some sort of chrono- synclastic " Boy Who Loves his Waffles " [ SEE TIM KREIDER'S FIRST COLLECTION , The Pain — When Will It End ? ] .
I 'm also thinking that this same guy has a yard full of other junk he 's invented that does n’t work : like a Rocket Ship to the Moon that has never moved an inch , or a catapult .
There 's also lots of cars up on blocks and a dog on a chain .
But the Time Machine ?
Totally works !
I would like to call this novel " ______'s Fuckin ' Time Machine ! "
The blank being some stoner name like " Doober Moynihan , " or " Loogey . "
I wonder if I could get Random House to actually call the books so - and - so's FUCKIN ' TIME MACHINE !
Somehow I doubt it .
I do owe Random House another novel , and every time I think of writing this one , I am convulsed with laughter .
I think I need to sit down with you in [ NAME OF TIM'S FAVORITE NEW YORK BAR REDACTED ] in early December and sketch out the whole thing in one night .
This idea is brilliant .
Doober MacKenzie ?
I once asked my own publisher whether calling book # 2 Fuck Them All would adversely affect marketing / distribution / sales , and his answer , which I construed as not exactly a no , was : " It would sell just as well as any other book with fuck in the title . "
I am already at work on " I'm From the Future , Asshole . "
Fair enough .
Let the best man win .
Just so you do n't mind me doing the same idea as a novel .
Which will take two years to write , a year to publish , a year of book tour .
I think I like the title : LOOGEY'S FUCKIN ' TIME MACHINE !
My 54 - year - old self wants to appear to me to say , Dude .
Do n't write this .
Jenny Boylan
Author • Professor • Public nuisance Look for Looger 's Fuckin ' Time Machine ! from Random House Books in 2012 .

Nearly five years into a steady buying binge , eBay ( s ebay ) is looking bloated , unfocused and schizophrenic .
eBay owns well over 100 subsidiaries , some of which were built in - house .
But many are acquisitions that have been crammed into the parent company like those Tokyo train conductors at rush hour .
And where has it all left eBay ?
In a blur .
eBay is an auction site painfully morphing into a direct sales site , with an online payment system that supports the e-commerce sites if you push it hard enough , a bunch of scattered classified sites , one that sells tickets , one that finds apartment rentals , and a software that lets you make phone calls online .
Got that ?
It ’s the same mistake Barry Diller made with IAC ( s iaci ) : Lash together a bunch of intriguing e-commerce models and hope they gel .
But they never do .
And so you end up spending money on building a bunch of not - quite - related brands , only without much return because none of them really stand out .
After buying Skype in 2005 , then - CEO Meg Whitman said the deal put eBay at the intersection of e-commerce and communication .
Three years later , it still is n’t clear what that means .
eBay sellers , for example , did n’t want buyers making free , time - eating calls to discuss their orders .
Skype has since grown , but what exactly is it doing in eBay ?
How is Rent.com helping Stubhub , or PayPal helping Kijiji ?
What are MeetUp and StumbleUpon doing in there at all ?
If there ’s synergy at work , it ’s awfully weak .
Diller finally realized he ’d have to spin off IAC into several companies , and it ’s time eBay consider the same .
John Donahoe , eBay ’s current CEO , said last month , “ We have a powerful portfolio ; one that , I frankly believe , is not fully credited in the value of the company . ”
He ’s absolutely right .
In fact , the value of the portfolio pieces would be more apparent if the portfolio was broken up .
Not all the recent acquisitions have been misfits .
Some of them , like last year ’s purchases of Fraud Sciences for $ 169 million and Bill Me Later for $ 820 million , both of which are being rolled into PayPal , made good sense ( although it ’s too bad eBay did n’t wait a little longer to get better prices ) .
Others need to be sold off or spun out .
Om has discussed the merits of spinning off Skype .
Stubhub.com would be more at home at Ticketmaster ( s tktm ) , and a company like Microsoft ( s msft ) could make good use of StumbleUpon .
But these companies , like everyone else , are in no mood to buy , so well - timed spin - offs may be the best option .
The stock market is still volatile , and likely to slump further in coming months .
But breaking up eBay once it ’s stabilized could leave the company with large ownership stakes in entities that are doing well even in the downturn .
Stubhub ’s revenue rose 54 percent last year , and classified revenue was up 57 percent ( 48 percent in the last quarter ) .
There is one way that these Balkanized subsidiaries help eBay right now — they shore up the shrinking revenue on the flagship e-commerce site , which fell 18 percent last quarter from the year - ago period .
Meanwhile , revenue rose 12 percent at PayPal and 26 percent at Skype .
e Bay ’s shopping spree over the last several years has masked slowing growth ( and now declining revenue ) at the original auction and e-commerce site .
So it ’s clinging onto healthier business units like a life raft — but it ’s also holding many of them back from their potential .

The unveiling of the sculpture took place on Thursday
Enlarge Image
A sculpture of a shoe erected in Iraq to honour a journalist who threw his footwear at George W Bush has been dismantled , reports say .
Foreign media say the bronze - coloured fibre - glass shoe was removed from its site in the city of Tikrit on the orders of the local authorities .
It had been erected in the grounds of an orphanage .
The monument was reportedly taken down just a day after being unveiled in the late Saddam Hussein 's home town .
The head of the Childhood organisation , which owns the orphanage , said she had been told to remove the monument immediately by the Salaheddin Provincial Joint Coordination Centre .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement " I did take the shoe down immediately and destroyed it , and I did not ask why , " Shahah Daham told the German news agency DPA .
Salaheddin 's deputy governor , Abdullah Jabara , told DPA : " Children should be put away from any political - related issues .
Since this is an orphanage , this monument can instil in children 's heart things for which the time is not now . "
Mr Jabara was also quoted by CNN as saying : " We will not allow anyone to use the government facilities and buildings for political motives . "
' Source of pride '
When the sculpture was unveiled , artist Laith al - Amari insisted it was not a political work , but a " source of pride for all Iraqis " .
Profile : Shoe - throwing journalist Bush shoe-ing worst Arab insult Mr Bush managed to dodge the shoes but the man who threw them , Muntadar al - Zaidi , was arrested and awaits trial .
As he pulled off his shoes , Mr Zaidi , now 30 , shouted : " This is from the widows , the orphans , and those who were killed in Iraq . "
He also told Mr Bush , who launched the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and was paying a final visit to Iraq last month : " This is a farewell kiss , you dog " .
Mr Zaidi shot to fame as a result of his action , which signalled extreme contempt in the Arab world , and inspired rallies across the Middle East and beyond .
Since his arrest , the TV journalist has reportedly been beaten in custody , suffering a broken arm , broken ribs and internal bleeding .
He has been charged with aggression against a foreign head of state , and faces up to 15 years in jail if convicted .
His family denies he has done anything wrong .

Conyers 's response to Luskin 's request for yet another continuance is classic .
After pointing out that the Feb. 23 date was provided to accommodate Luskin 's prior request for a continuance , Conyers points to Rove 's public statements that he did not intend to abide by the subpoena , then adds : " I am puzzled as to why Mr. Rove needs a mutually convenient date to fail to appear . "

i was up late last night watching msnbc , they were covering the plane crash in ny .... their was a guy on who had taken 100s of pictures , including pics of 2 houses nearly destroyed by the crash and he said " these are before the house it landed on " he also had talked to 7 - 9 eye witnesses that said the plane was on fire in the air today on the news the story is changed , repeatedly they r saying only 1 house was hit , and the debis feild is compact ... the exact opposite of what was reported last night when i heard about the crash my first thought was , who was on that plane ?
turns out a 9 - 11 activist that was calling for a complete investigation and an expert on the genocide in rwanda were passengers while i admit i am overly suspious because of 99s interest in 9 - 11 i wanted u regs to know what i saw last night and wondered if anyone else saw the early reports

Conyers is feeling his wheaties on this one .
You go , Senator !
The payoff will be Rove in handcuffs if he forgets to show up .
What does he think he is , a greased pig ?
He 's not slipping out of this one , unless he goes offshore .
Fight it if you must , Rove .
You can have the cell next to mAnn Coulter , and stay a lot longer .

John Adams :

I do n't know you or Karen but I take issue with your statement .
I saw the original coverage of 9 - 11 as it unfolded , the missile strike of the Pentagon ( missile strike is a considered characterization ) and the coverage of the plane that went down ( or not ) in Pennsylvania .
All real time coverage .
I watched the statements and observations of the newsmen / women present ( which reflected no more than what I was watching and thinking ) reverse itself and at one point be apologized for .
Obvious contradictions between my ( apparently lying ) eyes and the news accounts became the norm , the official story .
And gee , I ; m still surprised at how many small planes go down when they are carrying liberals and how many wrong - doers get that ol ' contrition and commit suicide just before they 're they testify .
I think we - the - people will never know the full or honest story bout just about anything and if Karen 's first instinct is to look up who's on the plane or at the end of the rope then good for her ; she 's probably just told you more truth than you 'll ever get from the MSM or government .
Implying the herbal cigarettes are in play is rude - she 's just being prudent .
Nothing is off the table these days .

Lotta , that 's okay , if I had n't spaced on that comment earlier , due to lack of coffee , not excess of herb , believe me , it would have been more strident by a few orders of magnitude .
I want the shit to stop from the groupthink name - callers against truth .
You can't accuse people who grasp the laws of physics of being dopers or conspiracy nuts .
Not here .
I 'm not going to put up with it !
John Adams , do you hear me ?
Go post your insulting blather somewhere else .
If you would like to provide links regarding Colgan Air 's purported maintenance problems and accidents due to them , great , but the tired old accusations of being a conspiracy nut or on dope or needing to get back on meds are completely unwelcome personal attacks , against the rules , and I 'm so sick of that shit I 'm going to start going as close to Zero Tolerance as possible without being completely unreasonable .
Be warned .

Karen from Illinois : ALSO ... ALL the first reports said the crew radioed in " no problems " , and later stories started the " ICE " stories , where a federal official said " the crew discussed ICE " .
How did this " federal official " know the crew discussed ICE , when all the initial reports said the crew radioed in " no problems " ?
Did this federal official have a special radio ???
How come no reporters asked the official : " All the stories said the crew radioed in ' no problems ' , now YOU just said the ' crew discussed ICE ' , how do you know that ? "

I 'm going to go out on a limb , and say you are a shill , because you accused a person , Karen from Illinios , asking a VERY legitimate question and making legitimate comments , of being high .
That is the # 1 tactic for shutting people up with legitimate questions - insinuate that they 're " nuts " .
YOU are a SHILL .

You offer NOTHING , except to call someone " nuts " because you have no intelligent comment or cannot dispute anything Karen from Illinois said .

OK , plane crash made easy .
This is the chronology of events of the plane crash .
It can be put together from all the articles I 've been reading , but this one has it all in one .
In this article : http://www2.canada.com/n...46/story.html?id=1283946
( and it 's the same in all the articles , the chronology ) ... all reports up to this point said the crew radioed in " no problems " .
Then , miraculously , NTSB spokesman Steve Chealander comes out of nowhere , the lone person who knows exactly what happened , and says the crew " discussed ICE " on the wings .
The initial reports did n't say how Chealander knew this , in light of the fact that all stories thus far said the crew radioed in " no problems " .
Subsequent stories then said Chealander found this out from the crew discussing this on the black box voice recorder .
One problem - at the time of Chealander 's statement , THEY DIDN'T READ THE BLACK BOXES YET !!!
The NTSB spokesman needs to be questioned .
There 's a cover up in progress .

" We found the cockpit , tail section , both wings and the engine .
And they 're where they should be if an airplane was laying flat , " National Transportation Safety Board Member Steven Chealander told reporters ...
" This airplane right here had very sophisticated deicing systems on it .
They had very sophisticated procedures and processes in place to use to mitigate ice .
We 're not saying that ice caused this accident . "

A Newport Beach police officer surveys wreckage of a Ferrari that split in half after hitting a pole on Jamboree Road .
One man was killed , a woman was injured and another man was arrested in connection with the crash .
( Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times )
MALBORK , Poland ( Reuters ) - Polish authorities have unearthed the remains of 1,800 bodies and expect to find even more in a mass grave first discovered three months ago and believed to date back to the final days of World War Two .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
The site is in a corner of northern Poland that was part of Germany until 1945 and the authorities suspect the remains are of ethnic German civilians , at least some of whom were probably killed by advancing Soviet forces .
“ We are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of German origin .
The presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , ” Zbigniew Sawicki , a Polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told Reuters on Wednesday .
“ It is very puzzling that no personal belongings have been found among the remains ...
We have few clues as to how these people died , though there is a high probability they were war victims , ” Sawicki added .
Some 30 bodies were found with gunshot wounds , though the probable cause of death for many was hunger and cold , he said .
The first few skeletons were unearthed last October by construction workers laying the foundations of a new hotel in the town of Malbork , whose imposing castle -- built by Teutonic Knights in the 13th century -- is a major draw for tourists .
Harsh winter weather has now slowed the exhumation process .
In 1945 , Marlbork was the scene of heavy fighting between retreating German forces and the advancing Russians .
Adolf Hitler ’s army withdrew from Malbork , then known by its German name of Marienburg , in early March 1945 and the Soviet Red Army entered the town on March 17 .
German civilians had already been ordered to leave .
The region became part of a reconstituted , communist - ruled Poland after World War Two within borders which moved sharply westwards at Germany ’s expense , compensating Poland for the loss of eastern territories to Soviet Russia .
When the grave was discovered , authorities initially found the remains of just 60 people but the figure mounted rapidly .
“ These people were buried in an appalling and inhuman manner , ” said Piotr Szwedowski , a Malbork city official .
“ It was a serious shock to us ...
We are trying to exhume the remains in the most humane way possible and to ensure them a respectable burial , ” he added .
State prosecutors said Poland ’s Institute of National Remembrance would conduct research into the findings .
“ We are looking for witnesses , or sources of information .
We hope to find some leads because we still know virtually nothing about the mass grave and the victims , ” said Piotr Wojciechowski of the district public prosecutor ’s office in Malbork .

You ’re a failed cold - war state with a predilection for repressing your native gay and lesbian population and you have a pesky editor of a gay website calling your government out for all its human right violations .
So what do you do ?
Well , if you ’re Belarus , you do what you do with all dissidents – draft them .
23 - year - old Alexander Paluyan , the editor - in - chief of the largest and most popular LGBT website in Belarus , Gay.by , was previously excused from service for medical reasons , but has been ordered to report to the military department in Mozyr today to find out if his medical exemption is confirmed or if he will be called up to service .
Human rights groups are concerned and Sergey Androsenko spokesperson for the Belarusian Initiative for Sexual and Gender Equality says , “ It is not safe for openly gay persons to be called - up for military duties ”

( CNN ) --
A man shot and killed seven patients and a nurse at a Carthage , North Carolina , nursing home Sunday before being wounded during a shootout with a police officer , authorities said .
Relatives of the nursing home 's patients gathered at a nearby church , where they learned details of the shooting .
Three other people , including the police officer and a visitor to the nursing home , were wounded in the attack , Carthage Police Chief Chris McKenzie said .
The police officer was treated and released , McKenzie said .
The slain patients ranged in age from 78 to 98 , Moore County District Attorney Maureen Krueger said .
The man accused of carrying out the attack , 45 - year - old Robert Stewart , was in custody , and his condition was unknown Sunday night , McKenzie said .
Stewart was not an employee of the Pinelake Health and Rehab Center , and he did not appear to have been related to any of the patients , she said .
" There is still more to be uncovered as far as his purpose in being there , " she said .
A witness told CNN affiliate WRAL - TV that Stewart was armed with a rifle , a shotgun and other weapons .
The officer who stopped him , Justin Garner , " acted in nothing short of a heroic manner " and probably stopped the carnage from being worse , Krueger said .
Watch stunned community react »
Jerry Avant Sr. told WRAL that his son , Jerry Avant , a 39 - year - old registered nurse , was the employee who was killed in the shooting .
He said a doctor told him that his son had been shot more than two dozen times .

Home Builders Give Housing Market a Boost
Category Rss Feed - http://www.realestateproarticles.com/rss.php?rss=280
By : Tina Fountain
On a positive note in the housing market , 2009 opened with an increase in home sales for the month of December in most regions .
Sales by region included :
- Midwest : increased by 4.0 percent
- South : increased 7.4 percent
- West : increased 13.6 percent
- Northeast : reduced by 1.4 percent
The gains are attributed to the decrease in median home prices and the favorable interest rates .
In an effort to maintain this positive momentum , certain builders have advertised record low mortgage rates in the hopes of stimulating the housing market even more .
Centex Corporation is offering 3.5 percent for the first two years , and then a lock in rate at 4.5 percent beginning in the third year .
Customers require a 3.5 percent down payment and credit rating must meet Federal Housing Administration standards .
As quoted in the Wall Street Journal by Robert S. Stewart , senior vice president at Centex Corp. , " Lower interest rates have a powerful impact on affordability and we know affordability is the key to selling homes , "
Probably the biggest blockbuster was a recent announcement by Toll Brothers offering a 3.99 percent fixed mortgage for 30 years with no points .
Loans must be for $ 417,000 or lower , customers must have a credit score of 720 or higher , and a minimum downpayment of 20 percent ( with no PMI ) .
Currently 30 year fixed rates are running about 4.96 percent � this deal is huge .
It 's not just the low interest rate that makes this offer so appealing .
This is not your average teaser rate that opens with a low rate , only to increase in a few years .
This is a 30 - year fixed rate that is lower than any adjustable rate mortgage out there .
Typically , buyers pay a premium on fixed rates , and the longer the term , the higher the premium .
Could we be seeing a real change in the way mortgage companies do business ?
So far there has been no word on the response Toll Brothers is receiving , or whether any of the other major builders are jumping on the bandwagon to offer similar deals .
Jerry Howard , chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders has an even more aggressive approach .
His formula to stimulate the housing industry involves a government funded program for new homebuyers that includes lowering interest mortgage rates to 2.9 percent , and expanding the homebuyer tax credit .
He believes this incentive combination could wipe out the excess inventory of unsold houses in less than 12 months .
Here 's a thought to make you wonder what kind of radical nut job Larry Gabriel is :
What about legalizing marijuana in Michigan and making hemp a part of our agricultural and industrial economy ?
I 'm not talking about creeping up on the idea in increments .
I 'm talking full - blown twisting up a doobie and publicly puffing your day away without recrimination .
Buying and selling marijuana for recreational purposes is already a huge part of our underground economy , or black market if you please .
" The state is losing billions of dollars due to marijuana being illegal , " says the Rev. Steven Thompson , president of the Michigan chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .
" It would be a big boost to our economy .
Federal statistics about two years back showed that the cannabis plant is the No. 1 cash crop here in the state of Michigan and it's illegally grown . "
When something illegal is your No. 1 cash crop , and you are in an economic freefall , it seems to me the crop needs to get some official attention from the state .
That 's what 's going on out West .
California State Assemblyman Tom Ammiano has proposed legislation to legalize marijuana in California .
His proposal acknowledges the fact that , although illegal , marijuana is California 's biggest cash crop .
We 're talking about $ 14 billion a year .
And that does n't even take into account what 's imported from outside of the United States .
Let 's get out front here in Michigan .
We do n't want to come late to the party after half the nation has legalized the weed when there is nothing but the equivalent of stems and seeds left in the marijuana bonanza .
There are so many ways marijuana and its hempen counterpart can bolster a faltering economy .
For starters , it can be grown here , which would bolster our agriculture industry .
It can be regulated and taxed , and the money paid for it will ripple through the economy .
We 'll save money in the criminal justice system , from initial arrests and court costs to prison and parole costs .
And hemp has so many uses it could almost be considered a wonder plant .
The wide - open fields found all about the city have already spawned a growing urban farming movement .
If hemp were added to the mix , it could spawn all kinds of economic activity , from textiles to car parts .
Canada legalized hemp - growing in 1998 , and 60 percent of what Canadian farmers grow is imported to the United States — not to mention the illegal cannabis grown there that comes here .
We could grow it ourselves .
There could be a hemp - based textile industry here .
Clothing of all kinds is made from hemp .
There are products such as jewelry , shoes , paper , rope and , from the seeds , body and cooking oils .
As we develop a cellulose - based ethanol industry , hemp has more cellulose content than most plants — and it grows really fast
There are even 100 percent biodegradable plastics made from hemp .
If you play Frisbee golf you may have been tossing the hemp around .
Ford , GM , Chrysler , Saturn , BMW , Honda and Mercedes use hemp composite door panels , trunks , head liners and other parts in their vehicles .
An Australian company uses a hemp plastic resin to make musical instruments and furniture .
It 's not new ; Henry Ford long ago demonstrated that car doors and fenders made with hemp and sisal cellulose plastic were strong , dependable car parts .
Hemp is even used in brewing one of our favorite beverages .
The Frederick Brewing Company in Maryland produces Hempen
Ale , brown ale made with hemp seeds that , according to the label , give it a " creamy head " and " mellow herbal flavors and aromas . "
Hmmm ... maybe the Stroh Brewery could do something with that .
Talk about a cash crop .
It 's hard to argue against hemp even if you have problems with people deriving pleasure from smoking marijuana .
The grade of cannabis that is grown for hemp production is pretty useless for the purpose for getting high .
The low level of THC ( the psychoactive ingredient that induces the high ) in the plant makes that nearly impossible .
But its nonrecreational possibilities seem nearly endless .
Maybe it 's just a pipe dream , but I can see the green hemp fields of Detroit waving in the breeze , the sun shining down as people work the fields .
I see textile manufacturing .
I see oils squeezed from the seeds .
I see industrial plastics .
All of it comes from a ubiquitous weed that practically grows itself .
" It can be grown anywhere , " says Thompson .
" It should be grown in Michigan . "
We once imagined a shiny , space age future with astronomically tall buildings , flying cars , domestic robots and vacations to the moon .
We could change our thinking and dream of a smaller , sustainable city with agriculture and small industries fueling a culture of community and closeness .
Since we 're already growing it here , we may as well get more out of it than an illegal buzz .
Michigan 's medical marijuana law has already produced a healthy result , although no distribution system has been created .
In Dec. 2007 , Keith Campbell , of Unionville in Tuscola County , was charged with possession , manufacturing and possession of marijuana with intent to deliver and , because he had a gun , two felony firearms counts .
Campbell 's doctor had recommended he try marijuana for a medical condition .
After the new law went into effect on Dec. 4 , Campbell 's attorney , Matthew Able , filed a motion to dismiss the charges and the judge did so .
I 'm sure there will be much legal wrangling over how the law is applied , and you may not want to go through the headache , but if you have a doctor 's recommendation , it 's legal to grow a bit of the herb for your personal use .
Just in case you need his help , Abel 's office is in downtown Detroit above the Anchor Bar .
It 's a shame that the uproar over the future of Cobo Center has degraded into an " us vs. them " argument .
I thought we had grown up past that .
Most of the bravado , posturing and rhetoric coming from Detroit City Council members have little to do with details of the deal arranged by Mayor Ken Cockrel .
Again we have the specter of a fight between council and the mayor , division between Detroit and surrounding areas , and race as an ordering principle of how and why we do things .
Barbara - Rose Collins ' rambling diatribe last Thursday , capped off by a rendering of the old hymn " Onward Christian Soldiers , " was embarrassing .
I 've never found that particular song , with its metaphors of military might and war , to be particularly uplifting .
And I have no idea what it has to do with the Cobo situation .
It does show that blacker - than - thou is still a strong part of Detroit politics .
I suspect that , in addition to any legitimate problems with the deal , there are political influences stemming from the upcoming mayoral races stirring the pot — and that goes from the mayor 's office , through council , and on down to Freeman Hendrix , who came in third and out of the race in the Feb. 24 primary .
Hendrix , who has been very vocally opposing the deal , may well have his hat in the ring for the August primary .
Whatever it is , our elected officials and others need to keep their arguments focused on the issues and not the egos .

Colt 45 is Bad , it 's Nationwide
How many times have you gone on vacation and found yourself running over budget because you did n't account for the price differentials of Colt .45 ?
Well , this is the page that seeks to solve that problem .
The G. Heileman Brewing Company has expanded its reign of Malt Liquor dominance across the nation .
Its tentacles have wriggled their way from Detroit into almost every facet of American life .
In an effort to more fully understand the phenomenon that is Colt .45 we have dedicated this page to the study of its relative ( but not the immeasurable inherent ) value at various liquor stores throughout the land .
All prices refer to a 40 oz bottle .
Sadly , the G. Heileman Brewing Company recently went bankrupt .
However , do n't be fooled into thinking that will stunt the cool flow of Colt 45 across the country .
No no , with a trademark as strong as Colt 45 Malt Liquor ( thanks in no small part to the credible yet incredibly smooth Billy Dee Williams ) brewers from all over the globe were begging for the chance to purchase the right to continue the tradition of this proud malt liquor .
The winner in this multi-billion dollar stakes poker game was none other than the Stroh 's Brewing Company .
Huzzah to Stroh's !
Stroh 's Sells Out !
On February 8 , 1999 CNNfn reported that after 149 years of brewing beer , Stroh 's was selling out .
Stroh 's sold some of its unimportant brands to Miller Brewing .
But the crown jewel , Colt .45 Malt Liquor , was sold to Pabst , who obviously had the sheer financial muscle from its skyrocketing sales of Pabst Blue Ribbon .
CNN estimated the value of Stroh 's brewing business at $ 400 million .
Obviously , at least 90 % of this is due to the value of the Colt .45 trademark .
Huzzah to Pabst !
Colt 45 Goes Mainstream !
The hottest malt liquor in America is Colt 45 .
The hottest show in America is " The Sopranos . "
Is this a case of ne'er the twain shall meet ?
Hell no !
Avid Colt 45 / Sopranos fans witnessed the most brilliant marketing coupling since milk and cereal recently .
An icy cold can of Colt 45 made a cameo appearance on the show , being enjoyed in Tony Soprano 's home .
It was a tallboy no less .
Colt 45 is on the come -up !

The plan was to reduce congestion in and out of Manchester
The people of Greater Manchester have voted against plans to introduce a congestion charge in the region .
Nearly two million people were asked to decide on a peak - time road charge to open up a £ 2.8 bn transport investment .
A majority of voters in all of the region 's 10 boroughs voted against the plans , with 812,815 ( 79 % ) no votes and 218,860 ( 21 % ) in favour of the charge .
It means the application for government Transport Innovation Fund ( TiF ) cash will not now go ahead .
The overall turnout across the 12 local authorities was about 53.2 % with 1,033,000 people casting their vote .
The failed plan aimed to create the biggest road congestion zone in the UK , charging drivers up to £ 5 a day to drive into the city centre .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Graham Stringer , MP for Blackley in Manchester , a long - time opponent of the scheme , said he was " delighted " with the result .
" It 's a brave politician that goes forward with such a scheme , unless it is an extraordinarily good scheme that virtually everybody benefits from , " he said .
" It is a pity we have had to waste three years on this ill - thought out scheme which the public have seen through .
" We must now go back to government to talk about how they can invest in trams , trains and buses in Greater Manchester . "
' Ill - conceived ' Immediately after the result was announced , officials in the ' Yes ' campaign told BBC News they were " disappointed with the voting turnout " .
Jason Torrence , who supported the charge , said : " This is a sad day .
This was a innovative solution which would have put Manchester in the premier league of cities in the world . "
Chris Hopkins , chief executive of Hydes Brewery in Moss Side , who was part of the ' No ' campaign , said the charge of up to £ 1,200 a year on his employees was just too much for the promised improvements in transport .
" We thought it was ill - conceived and the people of Manchester did as well , " he said .
The plans needed a majority in favour in at least seven local authorities to get the go - ahead .

Drama lacking in result Residents react to no vote Drivers reject C - charge ' carrot ' Lord Peter Smith , Leader of The Association of Greater Manchester Authorities ( AGMA ) , said he was " very disappointed " with the outcome .
" It is always a huge challenge to win any referendum and this one was always going to be particularly difficult - given the high feelings it has engendered , " he said .
" The TIF proposals may have been rejected but I am sure the people of Greater Manchester remain united in their desire to see this great city region succeed . "
Those against the proposals claimed the charge would have been an unfair tax on motorists , while those in favour had maintained it was a chance to create the best public transport system in the UK .
Motorists would have paid to cross two charging rings at peak times .
The outer ring roughly follows the M60 orbital motorway , while the inner ring surrounds the city centre .
Sir Richard Leese , leader of Manchester City Council , said : " I 'm sure the economic downturn , which is hitting everyone hard , has had a part to play .
" Investment in public transport in Manchester will remain a priority for the city council and our commitment to face up to the challenges going forward remains undiminished . "
AGMA will consider the outcome of the referendum at its meeting next week .
The Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority ( GMPTA ) chairman Councillor Matt Colledge , said : " We now need to rethink and reconsider the limited funding we currently get and prioritise this across the region , while looking to identify further funding for our longer term public transport vision .
" As a result of the detailed and dedicated work and extensive consultation that has gone into preparing such an enormously intricate bid , we now have a clear set of transport investment priorities and business cases for Greater Manchester .
" We are committed to ensuring that this legacy is put to good use by working hard with central government to establish alternative ways to deliver these schemes , which remain critical to the future of our economy . "

Microsoft has extended the general availability of the Windows 7 beta until February 10 due to the software 's popularity , the company said .
Microsoft was scheduled to remove the beta from the Windows 7 download site this past Saturday , but is allowing people to download it for another few weeks , the company said in a blog post .
People have until February 10 to start the download of the software , but downloads have until February 12 to be completed , according to the post , attributed to Brandon LeBlanc , a Microsoft Windows communication manager .
No one will be able to begin downloading the Windows 7 beta after February 10 , Microsoft said .
Microsoft made the first beta of Windows 7 available to the general public on January 10 , a day later than planned because interest in the beta crashed its
Web site when the company first posted it the day before .
So far , Windows 7 , the follow - up to the disappointing Windows Vista OS that fixes many of problems users reported with Vista , has gotten positive reviews from early users .
Microsoft wants to give people plenty of time to prepare for the end of the beta 's public evaluation period , according to LeBlanc 's post .
On Tuesday , the Windows 7 page will warn users that time is running out to download the software so they can prepare for the Feb. 10 deadline .
However , the new deadline does not apply to MSDN ( Microsoft Developer Network ) and TechNet subscribers , who will have access to the Windows 7 beta through its entire testing phase , according to LeBlanc .
Additionally , if a user has downloaded Windows 7 but does not have a product key for the software , Microsoft will continue to provide those to beta users indefinitely .
A product key validates that a user 's copy of the software is legitimate .
This summer , a little - known publisher by the name of Genius Products will release Scratch : The Ultimate DJ , a peripheral - based rhythm game for Xbox 360 , PS3 and Wii .
The game has been billed as the first Guitar Hero or Rock Band experience for hip - hop enthusiasts , and features creative oversight from legendary scratch DJ Mix Master Mike , aka Michael Schwartz .
In between scribbles , transforms , and crab scratches , Ars caught up with Mike to discuss his foray into video game land , his thoughts on the game , and how the upstart Scratch might compete with Activision 's DJ Hero , planned for release this fall .
To be clear , Schwartz 's involvement was mostly with creative oversight , not as a designer .
" For example , I helped by providing feedback on the cross fader functionality , and the sensitivity of the turntable wheel to make sure it felt as close to the real thing as possible , " he said .
Very little is known about Scratch at this point , let alone the peripheral it will ship with , which is a bit of a concern since the game is supposed to launch this summer .
And Mike was unwilling to disclose further details , presumably at the behest of the publisher .
" Without giving away too much , I will tell you that when the game is fully completed [ the peripheral is still in prototype ] , anyone that is into scratch DJing and beat making will be very pleased , " he assured Ars .
" The gameplay is designed to inspire players to be creative with the music and learn to improvise like real DJs do ...
Scratch not only simulates the art of scratching , but it also helps with practicing your timing and precision as a real - life DJ . "
Mike 's favorite part of the game so far ?
" The ability to bounce back and forth from scratching to beat making , " he said .
If Wired 's recent preview of the game is any guide , it seems the peripheral features extra buttons for sampled beats in addition to the platter wheel , something standard decks do not include .
" The idea is brilliant , " he added .
In terms of what artists will be included on the licensed soundtrack , Mike says players can expect " an amazing set list from artists like Eric B. and Rakim , Run DMC , The Beastie Boys , and a song from your boy , Mix Master Mike . "
He 's also confident the game will revitalize an interest in DJ culture , much like Rock Band has for classic rock .
" I know that Scratch can reinvigorate DJ culture , " he says .
" I think once kids get ahold of it , it 's definitely going to influence them into getting real turntables to not only keep the art alive but to spawn a new generation of DJs and beat makers . "
While rhythm gaming is a crowded genre , the hip - hop community has been ill - served in the current - generation offerings , and releasing a game focused on the turntables , with such an impressive mixture of talents , is a sure way to get noticed .
Without seeing the hardware however , it 's hard to know if this is going to be a game that can stand up to Activision Blizzard , or if it is destined to become an also - ran .
We can say the early signs are extremely positive , with all the right names attached to the project .
An old safe buried in a waste trench at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State has yielded an artifact from the birth of the atomic age : a batch of plutonium that is among the first ever made .
The plutonium , found in a one - gallon glass jug after a cleanup crew tore open the safe with an excavator , was processed at Hanford in late 1944 from spent uranium fuel from a reactor at Oak Ridge , Tenn .
It was the product of test runs of a plant built for separating plutonium for use in the Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb .
Apart from the historical significance of the discovery  the only earlier sample of man-made plutonium known to exist was produced in 1941 in an accelerator and is stored at the Smithsonian Institution  the techniques employed to determine its origins provide a glimpse of the kind of detective work that might be used against atomic terrorism .
“ This is a completely unclassified example of the type of science you could apply in nuclear forensics , ” said Jon M. Schwantes , who led a team that analyzed the plutonium at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland , Wash .
Their findings were published in Analytical Chemistry .
HANOI , VIETNAM — Donald Trump has made an offer to purchase the “ Hanoi Hilton , ” the infamous Vietnamese prison where John McCain spent five years as a POW , and turn it into high - rise , luxury resort .
HANOI , VIETNAM — Donald Trump has made an offer to purchase the “ Hanoi Hilton , ” the infamous Vietnamese prison where John McCain spent five years as a POW , and turn it into high - rise , luxury resort .
The Trump Hanoi Hilton Towers and Beach Club would contain over two - thousand rooms when completed , with seven five - star restaurants , three Olympic sized pools , a championship golf course and — just off the lobby — a Museum of Torture , where visitors can relive the horrors of war that occured right under their feet .
“ I ’m keeping McCain ’s actual prison cell intact , ” said Trump , “ and will be using its design as a motif for the rest of the building . ”
Trump said he was originally going to remove the manacles from the McCain cell , but instead decided to install a pair in every room .
“ I want guests to have a little taste of what it would have been like to stay here in 1968 , say , during the Tet Offensive — with the added comforts of a wet bar , indoor hot tub and private masseuse . ”
Critics have called the project grotesque and insensitive .
“ At the very least , it ’s showing incredibly bad taste , ” said Sam Warmington , president of the American Veterans Defamation League .
“ This place represents immense suffering for thousands of people , both Americans and Vietnamese .
It ’s sacred ground .
Put up a concrete memorial , maybe , but a hotel — it ’s a little freaky . ”
But Trump disagrees .
“ I am honoring the men and women who fought for our country , by turning a symbol of brutality into a high - profile , world travel destination with valet parking and a casino on the top floor , ” he said .
“ Incidentally , the masseuses , none of whom is over the age of nineteen , are all grandchildren of the prison guards who actually worked here . ”
The biggest supporter of the project appears to be none other than John McCain , himself .
“ If someone figures out a profitable way to exploit the injuries and suffering I endured as a prisoner - of - war , then it was all worth it , ” said the senator and former presidential candidate .
“ The beatings , the mental trauma , the agonizing pain — I ’d do it all again if it meant more money in the pockets of patriotic real estate developers like Mr. Trump .
He ’s the true hero . ”
McCain , who has already pre-booked a room at the hotel , said he looked forward to getting a rubdown from the granddaughter of the man who electrocuted his testicles .
Construction has been estimated at a fraction of the cost of building a similar structure in the United States .
“ The Vietnamese are very good workers , ” said Trump .
“ They make the equivalent of a dollar a day — and they can really live on it .
American ’s could learn a thing or two from the Vietnamese . ”
Americans just might have an opportunity to learn those things as Trump has signed a deal with Vietnam State Television to produce “ The Apprentice : Vietnam Edition . ”
“ We ’ll see who ’s the best rice farmer , and things like that , ” said Trump .
“ At the end of the season , the winner will be rewarded by actually being the guy who cooks the rice in one of my restaurants at the resort . ”
What happens to contestants who bring half - empty rice bags to the Donald ?
According to the Vietnam Government TV Production Company , they will be turned over to the state for reeducation .
Trump called the arrangement a “ win-win situation . ”
“ Besides , ” he added , “ ‘ You ’re Fired ! ’ does n’t translate well into Vietnamese . ”
While Penguin is a British company , the idea was rejected in the UK by cautious executives who must now be kicking themselves over what is almost entirely an Australian triumph .
The Popular Penguins series was conceived a decade ago by the company 's Australian sales director , Peter Blake .
He got the green light for the project last year only after " chipping away " at the company 's London head office .
According to one company source in London , bosses were so doubtful about the concept that they limited the sales area to Australia , New Zealand and India , a decision which cost them dearly in Britain 's Christmas market .
This is ironic , considering the " bargain " ethos of the series mirrors the sentiments that brought about Penguin 's creation by Allen Lane .
According to Penguin , it was Lane 's frustration at being unable to buy a good cheap book as he waited for a train that led him start the company in 1935 .
It is now rumoured that Penguin will launch the series in Britain this year .
Asked about his bosses ' reluctance to launch the concept globally , Blake parries politely : " They think it 's a terrific initiative and they are watching with a lot of interest . "
One reason for the series ' success is undoubtedly the price .
At $ 9.95 , each book is cheaper than a packet of cigarettes , which was Lane 's rule of thumb when he began producing paperbacks more than 70 years ago .
" The price bracket they 've been put in makes them very appealing , " says Chris Siver , manager of Dymocks bookstore in Camberwell .
" Since they 've been on sale we 've had people coming in and buying three or four at a time .
It 's a case of thinking , ' I could buy one book for $ 30 or get three instead ' .
The use of the orange and cream design , which mimics Penguin covers of the 1930s and again in the '50s and ' 60s , was deliberately aimed at tickling readers ' sense of nostalgia .
Says Blake : " They are instantly recognisable , and have an emotional pull .
Most people or their parents have got second - hand or old Penguins at home that have the same livery .
" But it 's not only pulling on that nostalgic lever .
It 's also got that retro coolness .
We 've found that younger readers have been really drawn to them . "
And what about what 's between the covers ?
The Popular series showcases the works of authors as varied as Jane Austen , Capote , Updike and Hornby on the fiction side , and titles such as Six Thinking Hats , The Consolations of Philosophy and A Year In Provence in non-fiction .
The publisher 's team in Australia came up with a 100 - strong shortlist and then passed it to the London office for a final choice .
The success of the range has caused just one headache : what titles should be included when the next series is brought out in the middle of this year ?
" We 'll definitely be launching another set of 50 titles later in 2009 and it's an exciting process drawing up the list of titles we want to include , " says Blake .
" There will be a number of Australian books in the collection and Picnic At Hanging Rock will be one … though we 're happy to hear any suggestions . "
The majority of Gazans are registered as refugees
The population of the Gaza Strip increased by almost 40 % between 1997 and 2007 , according to the results of a Palestinian census .
The survey , taken before Israel 's recent offensive , showed the territory has a population of 1.4 million people .
The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics estimated the annual growth rate at 3.3 % and said the population would double in 21 years at that rate .
The UN estimates the world 's current average population growth at 1.17 % .
CHANGING GAZA Overall population
1997 : 1,022,207
2007 : 1,416,543 Aged under 15
1997 : 50.2 %
2007 : 48.3 % Proportion married
1997 : 53.8 %
2007 : 49.6 % Receiving schooling
1997 : 62.8 %
2007 : 70.6 % Source Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics website
In a statement , the West Bank - based bureau said : " Assuming a stable growth during the coming years , the Gaza Strip population will multiply [ double ] in 21 years . "
There were mixed findings in the census for the people of Gaza .
The overwhelming majority of people in the territory ( 67.9 % ) continue to be UN - registered refugees .
The figure was only slightly lower ( 65.1 % ) in 1997 .
However , education and literacy showed signs of improvement .
The rate of people over the age of 10 unable to read fell from 11.3 % in 1997 to 5.5 % in 2007 , as the proportion of those receiving school education rose from 62.8 % to 70.6 % .
Preliminary results from the census were released in February 2008 .
According to those figures , the combined population of Gaza and the West Bank including east Jerusalem is 3.8 million .
The statistics bureau has not yet released final results on the West Bank or east Jerusalem .
So we scooped up our memories , took them on the flight home , scanned them over several hours , and share them with you now .
Hope you enjoy them as much as we did .
Special thanks to Chris Antista for his amazing additions .

If your software really gets better over time , and if you 've accepted the idea that backwards compatibility is technical debt , the important question is " How do I pay down that debt ? "
The only approach I 've seen work is to establish and maintain a sane deprecation policy .
Specific details depend on your project and your users ( and , likely , your availability to perform the work -- community - driven projects performed mostly by volunteers have different characteristics from paid projects ) , but the principles are the same .
Start with a regular release cycle .
I prefer monthly releases for free software projects , but several projects do well with quarterly or twice - a- year releases .
There are tremendous other benefits , but if you can make and meet your committment to releasing new versions of your software on a regular cycle , you add predictability to the process .
Not everyone will upgrade with every new release , especially if you have a short cycle period , but you demonstrate frequent progress -- and you have to keep your software stable to have a hope of maintaining this release schedule .
Mark deprecated features as deprecated and give a timeline for their removal .
In general , that 's one release cycle .
It can be more , but it can't be fewer .
The severity of deprecation depends on the scope of the change .
Perhaps adding a warning to a deprecated feature will help people know to upgrade .
Perhaps you can provide a backwards - compatibility feature as an optional extension .
You must notify people that there will be change , so that they can prepare for it .
Note that aggressive release schedules , such as monthly releases , may be too short a period for larger deprecations .
Appropriate periods depend highly on the nature of your work , but public projects probably should have a three month warning period for significant deprecations .
Remove the deprecated feature when its time has come .
Get rid of the code .
Stop carrying that baggage around .
That sounds easy , does n't it ?
It is !
All it takes is discipline , committment , and -- okay , you have to document your deprecation policy and refer to it prominently .
Some people will complain that they want to upgrade to new versions of your software which behave the same way as old versions without changes .
Ignore them .
Desire does n't make paradoxes logically consistent , even if you really really want it .
Before you post a comment , please note what I did n't say .
I did n't say " Break old features for the sake of breaking them . "
I did n't say " Deprecate features that people are using for the sake of expermenting with new ideas . "
I did n't say " Never undeprecate a feature " or " Never extend the deprecation or warning period if the change is difficult or widespread . "
You still have to use your best judgment -- but once you 've achieved the discipline of regular releases and have written your support policy , you have the benefit of being able to discard old code and shave off the rough spots of misfeatures until they 're right .
It 's not always easy to reach that point , but it 's always valuable to do so .
A judge ruled this week that jurors wo n’t hear part of the confession of a man accused of killing an 18 - year - old Greeley transgender woman .
In addition , Weld District Court Judge Marcelo Kopcow ruled that prosecutors wo n’t be able to tell jurors that Allen Andrade has gang ties that could have been a motive in the brutal slaying last summer of Angie Zapata , the Greeley Tribune reports .
Kopcow ruled that police should n’t have continued questioning Andrade once he told a detective he wanted to stop talking during a lengthy interrogation .
“ This court finds the defendant ’s statement , ‘ I ’m done .
Yeah , I ’m not talking right now ’ … is a clear statement of the defendant ’s request to remain silent and cut off further questioning , ” Kopcow wrote , according to the Tribune .
“ ( Greeley Police Department ) Detective ( Greg ) Tharp did not scrupulously honor the defendant ’s exercise of the right to remain silent and cut off questioning . ”
It ’s unclear what Andrade told police during the first 39 minutes of the interrogation , conducted over two hours after police arrested Andrade in Thornton driving a car belonging to Zapata ’s sister almost two weeks after Zapata ’s body was discovered .
According to a police affidavit cited by the Tribune :
… Andrade told Tharp he met Zapata on the Internet and that they had arranged a date .
The affidavit said he stayed at Zapata ’s apartment alone while she went out , and he realized Zapata was a man .
When Zapata returned later , Andrade confronted her about being a man , eventually hitting her with his fists and knocking her to the ground , the affidavit stated .
Andrade , according to the affidavit , said he then hit Zapata with a fire extinguisher , and later , when she started to wake up , he hit her several more times until she died .
The judge also ruled prosecutors can’t call experts to testify that Andrade was the member of a gang that routinely punished members — even killing them — when they engaged in homosexual acts .
The prosecution planned to argue Andrade decided he had to kill Zapata to save face with his gang once he discovered she was a transgender woman , The Denver Post ’s Monte Whaley reports .
“ While this proposed evidence ( about Andrade ’s gang ties ) may be material and relevant to the defendant ’s motive , this court finds that the probative value of this evidence is strongly outweighed by the unfair ( prejudicial ) effect it will have on the jury , ” Kopcow wrote .
The judge ’s ruling also noted that the Greeley Police gang expert did n’t know whether Andrade ’s gang had ever punished a member duped into having sex with a transgender woman , as the defense claims .
Andrade , 31 , is scheduled to go on trial April 14 in Weld District Court on charges of first - degree murder , commission of a hate crime , automobile theft and identity theft .
Late last year , District Attorney Ken Buck filed habitual criminal charges against Andrade , which could quadruple his sentence if he is n’t found guilty of the most serious murder charge .
Ruling that prisoners “ have little , if any , reasonable expectation of privacy while incarcerated , ” Kopcow decided recordings of calls Andrade made from jail to his girlfriend could be used in the trial .
In the calls , Andrade said “ gay things need to die ” and bragged that other prisons feared him because of his reputation wielding a fire extinguisher .
Andrade is being held without bond at the Weld County Jail .

Most of us have done it .
At Google 's Gmail Labs work area , employees ' e-mail ideas are made into reality .
Instead of hitting " reply " to an e-mail , we accidentally push " reply all , " sending a potentially embarrassing or insulting message to those we did n't intend to see it .
To address this problem , Google Inc. 's Gmail Labs has launched an experimental feature called " Undo Send " that gives users a chance to rewrite their message , correct settings or simply fix typos .
When a Gmail user who enables this feature sends an e-mail , a button that says " Undo " will pop up on their screen for five seconds .
If the user hits the button within that time , the service will retrieve the e-mail in draft form -- allowing the user to make changes or cancel the message altogether .
" Sometimes ... I send a message and then immediately notice a mistake , " said Michael Leggett , a Gmail Labs designer and the creator of the " Undo Send " feature , in the Gmail blog .
" I forget to attach a file , or e-mail the birthday girl that I can't make her surprise party .
I can rush to close my browser or unplug the Internet -- but Gmail almost always wins that race . "
Leggett added that he's had " Undo Send " turned on for a while " and it 's saved me several times . "
This may be good news to Gmail 's tens of millions of users as people in the digital era look to connect with others over the Web in a more efficient manner .
" Undo Send " is also just the latest example of the dozens of creative -- and sometimes downright wacky -- online features developed at Gmail Labs to address common e-mail problems .
Launched in June , Gmail Labs is an optional program .
It offers an assortment of tools , ranging from a service that stores e-mails onto a user 's desktop so the user can access mail offline to a feature that prevents users from firing away drunken e-mails during late - night hours .
Gmail users can enable the Gmail Labs settings by going to their settings tab .
Then they can customize their account by turning on features of their choosing .
Since the Gmail Labs program began , the features have grown in popularity among users , Google officials said .
The number of lab features has more than tripled , to more than 36 , as Gmail celebrates its fifth birthday next week .
Google 's Gmail Labs also typifies the Mountain View , California - based company 's reputation for innovation and brainstorming .
At Google , Gmail engineers can allocate 20 percent of their workweek to their own projects , which can include creating Gmail Labs features .
Google hopes the labs create an environment that will find out what Gmail users like and dislike .
" There is no screening process , " said Todd Jackson , a Google product manager .
" It 's up to whatever people want to build internally . "
Jon Perlow , a Gmail engineer , introduced the practical idea of " Mail Goggles " to help users , including himself , stop sending " mail you later regret . "
Perlow created the function last fall when he found himself sending messages to an ex-girlfriend -- late at night -- asking to get back together .
With Perlow's Mail Goggles , users can specify which hours they would like to enable the feature .
If a user tries to send an e-mail during the self - selected time -- say , midnight to 3 a.m. -- a screen pops up forcing the user to solve a series of simple math problems before the message can be sent .
Theoretically , this gives time for the intoxicated or emotional e-mailer to reconsider .
Gmail Labs also recently developed a feature that helps users who forget to add photo or document attachments to their e-mails .
Users can turn on a " forgotten attachment detector " ; if the program finds the word " attachment " in the e-mail text , a box pops up reminding the user to add an attachment .
Gmail engineer Michael Davidson was celebrating St. Patrick 's
Day last year at a bar when he came up with a feature to help e-mail addicts .
Davidson realized he was wasting valuable work time checking e-mails .
" Someone joked that it would be a great feature of Gmail to keep you from checking e-mail , " Davidson said .
So he created a program that locks people out of their Gmail accounts for a set period of time .
After spending two afternoons coding it , Davidson launched the " E- mail Addict " feature , which forces users to take a break from e-mailing by blocking Gmail for 15 minutes .
Company officials say the best lab ideas will eventually become standard features in Gmail .
For example , the idea of Google Maps started as a lab concept .
" The best thing you can do is to put your product and team in a position where you can move fast and get feedback from users to find out what sticks in the marketplace , " Jackson said .
Gmail is the third most popular e-mail site , following Yahoo !
Mail and Windows Live Hotmail , according to Experian 's Hitwise.com , a site that tracks Web traffic .
Google declined to comment on Gmail user growth .
Other e-mail services also are trying to enhance the electronic messaging experience .
Windows Live Hotmail added a " What 's New " feed in February that allows users to see what their friends and family are up to as well as pictures or posts they may have added .
In 2006 , Google added a chat feature .
Last fall the company added a video function allowing users to see each other when they e-mail .
Google officials hope to continue adding features regularly .
That 'll be good news to Doug Baruchin of Plainview , New York , who uses Gmail at least 16 hours a day between work and personal communication to family and friends .
Baruchin runs the Web company MyWorkster.com , a professional development portal for colleges and universities , where his 15 employees are required to use Gmail .
The video and chat functions also help workers stay connected when they are traveling , he said .
Baruchin especially likes " Superstars , " a Gmail Labs tool that lets him prioritize e-mails with star icons and colored labels .
Because his company receives thousands of e-mails a day , he said he and his coworkers would not be able to effectively manage their company without Gmail .
" With the way the economy is going , our company is growing very quickly , " Baruchin said .
" So the more organization we have , the better it is for us . "

Binyam Mohamed returned to the UK last month UK resident Binyam Mohamed , freed from Guantanamo Bay , has said he would not have faced torture or extraordinary rendition if it was not for British involvement in his case .
BBC
News reporter Jon Manel spoke to the Ethiopian - born asylum seeker about his alleged detention at what he calls the " dark prison " in Afghanistan and his interrogation in Morocco .
Here are the key quotes from the BBC Radio 4 interview : THE 'DARK PRISON '
" The dark prison - I was literally dead , I did n't exist .
I was n't there , there was no day , no night - music 24 hours a day , seven days a week for five , six months on end .
" There was literally music being played , or sound or horrible sounds or gunshots , or whatever they wanted to play and loud music , loud noise being played for the six months I was there .
In this cell with no lights at high volume .
" They played Eminem for one month and then they went to horror music , horror noises for another month .
" We had a toilet inside the cell which was a bucket and you literally just had to crawl to it ... and if you fell and they did n't clean it ... then it's on your bed and you sleep on your bed , which actually is just the floor with a blanket - that was the bed .
" You were given food which I would say [ was ] inedible - you could n't eat the food .
" I mean , there 's people who 've lost their teeth because of eating stones - they literally were feeding you stones in the food .
And I 've lost over 30kg from the time I went in to the time I left . "
INTERROGATION IN MOROCCO
" All the questioning was done by the Moroccans .
They would go out , talk to the Americans and then they would have all of their questions ready and most of the questions which I was asked could not have come from anywhere else but British intelligence .
" From issues of who my kick boxing trainer was , his name , where he lives , to questions of the road I 'm living on , my grades in college .
" The American 's do n't have [ those ] kind of questions .
These questions came from Britain . "
Interrogators also had hundreds of photographs of Muslim men in the UK , he said .
TORTURE CLAIMS
" The torture was going on weekly , sometimes monthly .
" From my understanding and to my belief , if it was n't for the British involvement right at the beginning of the interrogations in Pakistan , and suggestions that were made by MI5 to the Americans of how to get me to respond , I do n't think I would have gone to Morocco .
" It was that initial help that MI5 gave the Americans that led me through the seven years of what I went through . "
MOVING TO GUANTANAMO
" Compared to the dark prison , I do n't know if I should say this , but since I [ got ] out , it was like a five - star hotel .
Literally it was a holiday . "
IMPACT
" It literally closed me down .
I was a person who usually would laugh a lot , mix with people .
But after this experience I just pulled myself out of the world , I 've just - like I told you - I do n't exist .
I do n't feel the existence of life .
" From that experience , it has n't worn off - that experience , the dark prison , is not something I can just shake off and I 've tried and it 's just not coming off .
" I think it will take some time to actually get back and feel alive .
I did n't exist in the dark prison .
I did not exist . "
RELEASE
" I did n't believe I was free , even now I do n't feel , I do n't feel I 'm free .
I mean it 's been seven years of ... well literal darkness that I have been through .
" Coming back to life is taking me sometime - and literally I am dead .
" I do n't have the regular person 's feelings that people have - the feelings of happiness and sadness I still do n't have them as far as I 'm concerned .
Nothing matters . "
TRIP TO AFGHANISTAN Mr Mohamed said he originally travelled to Afghanistan in 2001 after converting to Islam .
" I decided to take a journey to Afghanistan as any 21 , 22 - year - old would do .
Just go and see a part of the world and learn about what 's happening over there .
" I was trying to understand Islam and I was told that Afghanistan was where the real Islam was . "
FEAR OF RECAPTURE
" Well it 's not the fear , I expect that to happen at any time .
It 's gone past fear , I mean I already put it into my mind that Guantanamo is not over yet .
" And at any time I could be taken to wherever it is they want to take me and whoever it is who wants to take me . "
US PLOT CLAIMS Mr Mohamed 's capture came at a time of increased concern that al - Qaeda might use so - called dirty bombs or attack installations such as gas storage depots .
But the former detainee said such claims were unrealistic and were made to frighten people .
" The amazing thing is - all these allegations - the US government themselves have said they could not be done , so they are allegations which look good on paper but in reality cannot happen .
" The Americans use it to terrorise their public into believing that there is another al - Qaeda attack just for the political interest .
That 's all it was . "

The private money guy and the state money guy go at it again .
PMG : If a gold standard is really a standard , who sets it ?
SMG : The government .
PMG : Why not the free market ?
SMG : Because someone has to enforce the law .
PMG : What law ?
SMG : The law governing money .
PMG : What law governing money ?
SMG : The law that says the government should govern money .
PMG : What about the law of supply and demand ?
SMG : That works for economics .
PMG : Is n’t money part of economics ?
SMG : Yes , but only partially .
It ’s also the realm of government .
PMG : Who says so , other than government officials ?
SMG : All academic economists except Austrian School economists .
PMG : Austrian School economists do n’t trust the civil government .
SMG : That ’s what I ’ve heard .
PMG : Especially in monetary policy .
SMG : That ’s what I ’ve heard .
PMG : But if the law of supply and demand works for allocating scarce resources , and money is a scarce resource , why wo n’t it work for money ?
SMG : Because there are counterfeiters .
PMG : You mean like the Federal Reserve System ?
SMG : There you go again .
The Federal Reserve System is a government agency .
PMG : The Board of Governors is .
The 12 regional banks are not .
SMG : But the 12 regional banks do what the Board of Governors tells them to do .
PMG : Who advises the Board of Governors on what to do ?
SMG : Economists at the 12 regional banks .
PMG : But why do we need the Federal Reserve ?
SMG : Because we need rational planning of the nation ’s money supply .
PMG : Why not just let the costs of mining gold set the limits , just like copper and lead and zinc ?
SMG : Because gold is a unique commodity .
It ’s not like other commodities .
PMG : How is it different ?
SMG : It ’s valuable mostly because it serves as money .
PMG : But there is no gold standard any longer , so where does it serve as money ?
SMG : Among central banks , who hold most of the world ’s gold .
PMG : Why do they use it as money ?
SMG : Because central bankers do n’t trust other central bankers .
PMG : Neither do I .
SMG : Then we are all agreed on central bankers .
PMG : But why should we allow them to keep the people ’s gold as reserves for central bank - created money ?
SMG : Because the public is n’t trustworthy either .
PMG : Are n’t people more trustworthy with their own money than central bankers are with the government ’s money ?
SMG : But every government lets its central bankers use the gold as if it were the central bankers ’ money .
PMG : Except for Gordon Brown .
When he was Chancellor of the Exchequer , he forced the Bank of England to sell half its gold at under $ 300 an ounce .
SMG : He is an idiot .
PMG : He is indeed , but why was that idiotic ?
Did n’t the public get access to gold that had been confiscated by the government in World War I ?
SMG : It did , but the gold probably went to India to be used for jewelry .
PMG : Is n’t that better than allowing central bankers to hoard it ?
SMG : We need central bankers to hoard it .
It ’s safer in their vaults .
PMG : Where thieves ca n’t get their hands on it .
SMG : Precisely .
PMG : Because no private citizen can get his hands on it .
SMG : Precisely .
PMG : How does the public know these vaults are secure ?
SMG : Because every nation ’s gold is stored in one huge , fully secured vault at 33 Liberty Street , New York City .
PMG : The New York Federal Reserve Bank .
SMG : Yes .
PMG : Why do all the central banks leave the gold there ?
SMG : Because it ’s convenient and safe .
PMG : But is n’t all that gold at the mercy of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ?
SMG : Yes , but the Bank is trustworthy .
It has a reputation to defend .
PMG : But ca n’t the U.S. government at any time tell the Federal Reserve ’s Board of Governors not to return that gold to the other central banks ?
SMG : The government would never do such a thing .
PMG : Why not ?
SMG : It would be dishonest .
PMG : That did not bother Nixon in 1971 .
SMG : If the U.S. government were to refuse to return other nations ’ gold , they could sell all their Treasury debt , which would send U.S. interest rates soaring .
PMG : The Federal Reserve would then create new money and buy all the debt to get rates back down .
SMG : But that would be inflationary .
PMG : Which would raise the price of gold .
SMG : Yes .
PMG : Which the U.S. government would now own — almost all of it .
SMG : Yes .
PMG : Which would mean that the Federal government would be in control of the most valuable asset during an inflation .
SMG : Yes .
But it would have to spend the gold into circulation to take advantage of this .
PMG : You mean return it to the private sector .
SMG : Yes .
PMG : What ’s wrong with that ?
SMG : It would be stolen gold .
PMG : Who owns it ?
SMG : The other central banks .
PMG : Where did they get it ?
SMG : From their governments .
PMG : Where did the governments get it ?
SMG : From commercial banks in 1914 , when World War I broke out .
PMG : Where did the commercial banks get it ?
SMG : From their depositors .
PMG : Why did depositors give it to the commercial banks ?
SMG : Because the commercial banks promised to pay the depositors interest .
PMG : How could they afford to do this ?
SMG : By lending IOU ’s to the deposited gold and collecting interest .
PMG : That ’s fractional reserve banking : banks issue more IOUs to gold than they have gold to redeem them .
SMG : Yes .
PMG : Did n’t the banks promise to redeem gold coins on demand by the depositors ?
SMG : Yes .
PMG : Did n’t the IOUs lent to borrowers also constitute a legal claim on the deposited gold ?
SMG : Yes .
PMG : But is n’t it counterfeiting when a bank lends out an IOU to gold that already has an IOU written to depositors ?
SMG : I would n’t call it counterfeiting .
PMG : What would you call it ?
SMG : Leverage with risk management .
PMG : What risk ?
SMG : Risk that all depositors would come down with their IOUs and demand payment in gold on the same day .
PMG : As when a war breaks out .
SMG : Yes .
PMG : Would n’t that be a run on the banks ?
SMG : Yes .
PMG : What can banks do to prevent this ?
SMG : Get the government to suspend contracts regarding the redemption of gold on demand .
PMG : Would n’t that mean that commercial banks would wind up with the public ’s gold ?
SMG : No .
The central banks would call in the gold from the commercial banks .
PMG : Which is what happened in 1914 .
SMG : Yes .
PMG : So , the real issue was the enforcement of contracts .
SMG : Yes .
PMG : The governments of Europe killed the international gold standard , which was a private gold coin standard , in order to save the commercial banks .
SMG : Yes .
PMG : Why ?
SMG : Because the governments needed to sell their wartime debts to banks .
PMG : Especially central banks .
SMG : Yes .
PMG : Then the biggest threat to the international gold standard is government .
SMG : In the past , yes .
PMG : But not today .
SMG : No .
PMG : Why not today ?
SMG : Because central banks control the gold .
PMG : But you do n’t trust central bankers .
SMG : No .
PMG : Do you trust the government ?
SMG : No .
PMG : Why not ?
SMG : Because Nixon killed the international gold standard .
PMG : Not Roosevelt in 1933 .
SMG : No .
PMG : Not Europe ’s central banks in 1914 .
SMG : No .
PMG : Nixon ’s the one .
SMG : Yes .
PMG : Yet you still think a government gold standard could work .
SMG : Yes .
PMG : Even when there is a Nixon or a Gordon Brown ?
SMG : There will never be another Nixon .
PMG : But there surely is Gordon Brown .
SMG : He has learned his lesson .
PMG : What lesson ?
SMG : That when you sell half your nation ’s gold , you can still get elected Prime Minister .
PMG : And make a mess of things .
SMG : Like nothing Great Britain has seen in decades .
PMG : Why not just get government out of the money creation business ?
SMG : Because we ca n’t trust commercial bankers .
PMG : But with a 100 % private system of contractual banking and warehousing of gold coins , would n’t it pay conservative bankers to police the system by demanding payment in gold by all other bankers ?
SMG : Yes .
PMG : Would n’t that be preferable to entrusting the policing responsibility to civil government , which can change the rules at any time ?
SMG : But government can change the rules of contract at any time , and thereby destroy a private gold coin standard .
PMG : That would not destroy it .
It would let the public decide : put gold coins in a bank that honors its contracts or else put coins in a bank that breaks its contract to redeem gold , because the government allows it .
SMG : But that would favor one group of citizens at the expense of others .
PMG : It would favor citizens who did not trust their coins to bankers who issue lots of unbacked IOUs to gold .
SMG : It ’s better for everyone to trust all of the banks than to favor some citizens over others .
PMG : How do you figure ?
SMG : It ’s more democratic .

" I have never had any problems and you learn to trust the drivers .
Almost when you get into a black cab , in your mind , you are home , so your guard is not up as usual . "
Barack Obama has slammed bonuses worth billions of dollars which have been handed out to bankers despite the global financial crisis .
The new US President ( 47 ) spoke out after it was revealed that Wall Street firms gave payouts worth more than $ 20bn last year , according to ABC.net.au .
Obama , who has been busy since his inauguration earlier this month , labelled the bonuses “ shameful ” and the “ height of irresponsibility ” .
Many Americans will be furious that the banks have agreed to such massive payments despite asking for billions in bailouts from Congress .
Obama said : “ Part of what we are going to need is for the folks on Wall Street who are asking for help to show some restraint and show some discipline and show some sense of responsibility .
“ The American people understand that we have got a big hole that we have got to dig ourselves out of but they do n’t like the idea that people are digging a bigger hole even as they are being asked to fill it up . ”
Barack Obama has achieved his first victory as US President after Congress passed the $ 830 billion economic recovery plan .
US President Barack Obama has made his first speech to Congress , telling them that " the day of reckoning has arrived " .
ACMA 's blacklist does not have a significant impact on web browsing by Australians today but sites contained on it will be blocked for everyone if the Federal Government implements its mandatory internet filtering censorship scheme .
But even without the mandatory censorship scheme , as is evident in the Whirlpool case , ACMA can force sites hosted in Australia to remove " prohibited " pages and even links to prohibited pages .
Online civil liberties campaigners have seized on the move by ACMA as evidence of how casually the regulator adds to its list of blacklisted sites .
It also confirmed fears that the scope of the Government 's censorship plan could easily be expanded to encompass sites that are not illegal .
" The first rule of censorship is that you cannot talk about censorship , " Wikileaks said on its website in response to the ACMA ban .
The site has also published Thailand 's internet censorship list and noted that , in both the Thai and Danish cases , the scope of the blacklist had been rapidly expanded from child porn to other material including political discussions .
Already , a significant portion of the 1370 - site Australian blacklist - 506 sites - would be classified R18 + and X18 + , which are legal to view but would be blocked for everyone under the proposal .
The Government has said it was considering expanding the blacklist to 10,000 sites and beyond .
Electronic Frontiers Australia said the leak of the Danish blacklist and ACMA 's subsequent attempts to block people from viewing it showed how easy it would be for ACMA 's own blacklist - which is secret - to be leaked onto the web once it is handed to ISPs for filtering .
" We note that , not only do these incidents show that the ACMA censors are more than willing to interpret their broad guidelines to include a discussion forum and document repository , it is demonstrably inevitable that the Government 's own list is bound to be exposed itself at some point in the future , " EFA said .
" The Government would serve the country well by sparing themselves , and us , this embarrassment . "
Last week , Reporters Without Borders , in its regular report on enemies of internet freedom , placed Australia on its " watch list " of countries imposing anti-democratic internet restrictions that could open the way for abuses of power and control of information .
The main issue raised was the Government 's proposed internet censorship regime .
" This report demolished the Communications Minister 's contention that Australia is just following other comparable democracies , " Greens communications spokesman Senator Scott Ludlam said .
" We are not .
The Government is embarking on a deeply unpopular and troubling experiment to fine - tune its ability to censor the internet .
" I agree with Reporters Without Borders .
If you consider this kind of net censorship in the context of Australia 's anti-terror laws , it paints a disturbing picture indeed . "
EFA said the Government 's " spin is starting to wear thin " and it could no longer be denied that the ACMA blacklist targets a huge range of material that is legal and even uncontroversial .
The Communications Minister , Stephen Conroy , has repeatedly claimed his proposed mandatory filters would target only " illegal " content - predominantly child pornography .
" As time goes on , pressure will only mount on the Government to expand the list , while money and effort are poured into an enormous black box that will neither help kids nor stem the flow of illegal material , " EFA said .
" If the minister truly believes that children are seeking out , or being bombarded with , child pornography , then there 's a dearth of both common sense and proper research in the ministerial suites . "
Already , the head of the Australian Christian Lobby , Jim Wallace , has said he hopes the sex industry will go broke as a result of the censorship scheme .
Independent Senator Nick Xenophon previous expressed his desire to have online gambling sites added to the blacklist but has since withdrawn his support for the scheme , saying it was dangerous and could be " counter - productive " .
The Greens and Opposition also oppose the scheme , meaning any legislation to implement it will be blocked .
The Opposition has obtained legal advice that " legislation of some sort will almost certainly be required " , but others have said it may be possible to implement the scheme without legislation .
Speaking at a telecommunications conference last week , Senator Conroy urged Australians to have faith in MPs to pass the right legislation .
Despite previously saying his scheme would be expanded to block " refused classification " content that includes sites depicting drug use , sex , crime , cruelty and violence , he said opponents of his plan were spreading " conspiracy theories " .
The Government 's internet censorship trials are due to begin shortly but critics have said they may not provide much useful data on the real - world implications because none of the major ISPs were chosen to take part .
CORUMBA , Brazil ( Reuters ) - Jaguars still roam the world ’s largest wetland and endangered Hyacinth Macaws nest in its trees but advancing farms and industries are destroying Brazil ’s Pantanal region at an alarming rate .

The degradation of the landlocked river delta on the upper Paraguay river which straddles Brazil ’s borders with Bolivia and Paraguay is a reminder of how economic progress can cause large - scale environmental damage .
“ It ’s a type of Noah ’s Ark but it risks running aground , ” biologist and tourist guide Elder Brandao de Oliveira says of the Pantanal .
Brazil ’s exports of beef , iron and to a lesser extent soy -- the main products from the Pantanal -- have rocketed in recent years , driven largely by global demand .
Less well - known than the Amazon rain forest , the Pantanal is larger than England and harbors a huge fresh water reserve and extraordinary wildlife , ranging from 220 - pound ( 100 - kg ) jaguars to giant otters that mingle in water holes packed with nine - foot ( 3 - meter ) caimans .
The world ’s largest freshwater wetland , it is almost 10 times the size of Florida ’s Everglades .
Of the Pantanal ’s 650 bird species , the largest has a wing span of nearly 3 meters ( yards ) and the smallest weighs only 2 grams ( 0.07 ounce ) .
During the rainy season the water level rises by as much as five meters ( yards ) , creating a mosaic of dark - brown swamps with islands of shrubs and tall standing tropical trees .
When the water first hits dry soil it loses oxygen and kills schools of fish as part of a nose - wrenching natural life cycle .
A melting pot for various ecosystems , the Pantanal has the greatest concentration of fauna in the Americas , according to The Nature Conservancy , a global environmental advocacy group .
But some species are in danger of disappearing , including the long - snouted giant anteater , which claws into anthills and flicks its two - foot tongue up to 160 times per minute to quickly gobble up stinging ants .
The giant armadillo and maned wolf are also on the list of endangered species because of their falling numbers .
Visitors to the Pantanal marvel at the idyllic scenery and the proximity and abundance of wildlife .
“ I had n’t heard about it before , it ’s a bird - lovers ’ paradise , ” said Alkis Ieromonachou , a Cypriot tourist , eyeing a group of giant Jabiru storks from the deck of a bungalow .
The impact of modern farming is obvious even in the tourist resort , however , as a large herd of cattle wanders through the swamp , squashing floating lily pads .
Cattle ranchers cut trees on higher elevations and sow pasture in the lowlands , which are flooded for months .
Many say they have been here for decades and ca n’t be expected to abandon the land and their livelihood .
“ True , deforestation is a problem but 50 years ago when it began nobody thought of these things , ” said Ademar Silva , head of the local association of farmers and cattle ranchers .
“ The government needs not only to punish bad behavior but promote new technology with financial incentives . ”
ECONOMIC PRESSURES
Brazil ’s beef exports have more than tripled in five years to $ 5 billion in 2008 , with pasture often replacing forests .
Experts say improving productivity , from currently around one head of cattle per hectare ( 2.5 acres ) , could prevent much deforestation .
“ We ’re using our natural resources fast and inefficiently , ” said environmental economist Andre Carvalho at the Getulio Vargas Foundation , or FGV .
The environmental group Conservation International says 63 percent of the forest in elevated regions of the Pantanal and 17 percent in lowland regions have been destroyed .
Under a federal law dating back to 1965 , ranchers can clear up to 80 percent of the forest on their property .
Parks and protected areas make up only a small fraction of the Pantanal , and the rest is largely unprotected .
Demand for charcoal from Brazilian pig iron smelters has accelerated deforestation , environmentalists say .
“ We set up shop precisely to use wood from the advancing agricultural frontier , ” said Vitor Feitosa , operations director for MMX , a smelter located in the Pantanal town Corumba and owned by Brazilian billionaire Ike Batista .
Brazil ’s pig iron exports have grown sixfold to $ 3.14 billion since 2003 .
Around 1.5 million hectares ( 3.7 million acres ) of native forest are lost annually in Mato Grosso do Sul state , home to much of the Pantanal , an FGV study showed .
Marcos Brito , head of a charcoal manufacturers group with 15,000 employees in the state , claims most producers use wood cut and discarded by ranchers .
But Alessandro Menezes , an activist with the environmental group ECOA , says they clear forests in exchange for the wood .
After being fined several times , MMX agreed not to buy Pantanal charcoal , but most smelters in the state still do .
Erosion resulting from deforestation has created large sandbanks on tributaries to the Paraguay river , such as the Taquari and Rio Negro , making them partially unnavigable .
“ Rivers will change course , lakes appear or disappear -- the size and shape of the Pantanal will change , ” said Sandro Menezes , manager of Conservation International ’s Pantanal project .
“ It ’s very probable that local flora and fauna will become extinct . ”
Already , there are signs that runoff water from nearby farms is altering the ecosystem ’s delicate balance .
“ We see trees flower and birds breed earlier -- we believe it ’s because of fertilizers in the water , ” said de Oliveira .
The global financial crisis has hit demand for steel and beef and temporarily eased pressure on the Pantanal as smelters and farmers put expansion plans on halt .
But most environmentalists agree the next commodity boom could cause irreversible damage .
“ Now is the time for stricter laws , environmental education and corporate citizenship , ” said Ricardo Melo , environmental public prosecutor in Corumba .
“ Economic development here is inevitable ; we need to make it sustainable . ”

I ’ve heard of the effects of code devices saving permanently onto a game cart , but it almost always involves data that is saveable in some form or fashion .

Edit due to ninja : Could n’t somebody take a cart and replace the ROM with an edited one ?
I mean , if the filesize is the same , should n’t it run normally aside from any modifications a hacker may have made ?
Zaphod , you ’d probably need tools to hook the cart up to your system and check it with an unaltered game file or something .
Unless there ’s any other change in the game to possibly hint at someone editing it , I ’m not sure of any other way .
Northern Rock collapsed after a run on the lender Northern Rock is to revive its mortgage lending with extra cash from the taxpayer , it has been announced .
It is part of government plans to boost lending generally , and reverses its earlier policy of winding down the bank 's loans .
The bank also revealed that it would report a loss of £ 1.4bn for 2008 .
And it said senior staff would get no cash bonuses for 2008 or 2009 , apart from contractual entitlements , and have their pay frozen at 2008 levels .
More lending The Newcastle - based bank will now embark on a radical change in its lending policy .
Instead of running down its mortgage book , it aims to lend an extra £ 5 bn in new mortgages this year and up to £ 9bn from 2010 .

Government pulls lending levers
To help fund this the Treasury will provide an extra £ 10bn in taxpayers money to the bank .
" This is good news for customers of Northern Rock and for consumers generally , who will benefit from an increase in mortgage availability , " said the bank .
" The new lending proposition means that the company 's existing mortgage customers will not be actively encouraged to leave when their mortgage deal matures and they will have more choice , " it added .
This means they will now be able to apply for some of the favourable deals which have been on offer to new customers only .
Chancellor Alistair Darling also suggested that some mortgages would be lent at up to 90 % of the value of the property being bought .
Currently , mortgage lenders typically require a deposit of at least 20 % of the purchase price .
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Vince Cable said the " 90 % rule " was a start , but urged the government to clarify the rule and apply it to all lenders , " not just Northern Rock " .
' Welcome ' Mr Darling said the new plan was one of a series of measures being taken to rebuild the banking system .

" [ Northern Rock ] repaid about £ 18bn of the loan the government made , and I said in January this year that because of the problems the mortgage market faced , instead of looking to wind down its business , it would be better for Northern Rock to maintain lending , " he said .
This change in policy should also help other lenders who have taken on a large number of former Northern Rock customers who were effectively encouraged to switch lenders so that the bank could pay off the government loan .
" By removing this market pressure , other lenders as well as Northern Rock should experience an increased capacity to lend to other borrowers , " said Michael Coogan of the Council of Mortgage Lenders .
With the value of all new mortgages currently averaging £ 112,000 , an extra £ 5 bn of lending would amount to about 44,600 averaged - sized home loans per year .
That would be roughly equivalent to the number that were lent each month last year by all lenders in the UK .
However the bank 's financial problems are not over .
As well as the huge loss for last year , it revealed that arrears among its mortgage borrowers have risen rapidly .
Nearly 3 % of these borrowers are now in arrears by more than three months , up from less than 2 % last September .
The bank said the problem lay particularly with people who had been given 125 % loans under its notorious " Together " mortgage policy .
And it warned that it would still be " significantly loss making " this year .
Bonus policy
The bank 's new bonus arrangements mean that while senior staff will not get bonuses , frontline staff at Northern Rock , such as bank tellers , will receive bonuses worth up to 10 % of their salaries for 2008 .

That is because they helped the bank achieve its target of repaying a large part of the government loan taken on prior to its nationalisation early last year .
In addition , junior management will receive a bonus for 2008 , but this will be deferred until 2010 and can be clawed back if performance criteria are not met .
Northern Rock said the frontline and junior management bonuses covered about 4,400 workers with an average annual salary of about £ 21,000 .
The bank also said that " senior individuals who are important to the company 's future " would also receive a deferred bonus , payable in 2010 if certain criteria are met .
Restructuring A change in the nationalised banks ' lending policy first became apparent last month when the government announced steps to revitalise the moribund mortgage market .
Northern Rock collapsed in 2007 after a run on savers ' deposits when it emerged it had sought government help .
When the bank was nationalised last year it pledged to reduce the amount of state aid it would borrow .
However , in January this year , the lender was given more time to pay back its £ 27bn government loan as part of broader government efforts to boost lending , which it is hoped will aid economic recovery .
Previously , the bank had been encouraging customers to re-mortgage with other lenders so it could quickly pay off the loan , but this policy is now being stopped .
Greg Hands , shadow treasury minister , told the BBC the reversal of policy showed the " chaos " at the heart of government decision - making .
" We 've been calling on the government for some time to free up credit in the economy and to make sure credit flows , " he said .
" However , for Northern Rock it is a bit of a volte - face because until now Northern Rock had been under orders to wind up its mortgage operation and essentially to close down business , " he added .

Linux vendor Red Hat today is angling to position itself as one of the big players in virtualization , today unveiling a slew of new product initiatives designed to penetrate the enterprise on a number of fronts .
The company today showed off a new standalone virtualization hypervisor based on KVM ( Kernel Virtual Machine ) , as well as a new hypervisor for Red Hat Enterprise Linux .
It also took the wraps off new management tools for virtualization on servers and desktops .
The initiatives aim to position Red Hat ( NYSE : RHT ) as a leader in virtualization , challenging vendors like VMware , and a series of moves that have been months in coming .
The moves build on Red Hat 's acquisition of KVM vendor Qumranet in September 2008 .
That acquisition -- and Red Hat 's newest launches of KVM - based virtualization offerings -- also further distances the company from the competing open source Xen hypervisor technology .
The efforts also continue the momentum Red Hat created last week with its virtualization support deal with Microsoft , itself trying to gain more of the virtualization market .
For Red Hat , the Linux vendor is betting that its KVM - based approach can deliver on key areas lacking in the industry 's current offerings .
" Cost , performance scalability and security are the different ceilings that we see preventing virtualization from going to the next level in the datacenter , " Navin Thadani , senior director of Red Hat 's virtualization business , said during a press conference today .
" This is exactly where Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization comes in . "
Key to the company 's efforts is the new , standalone Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization hypervisor .
The new hypervisor is based on KVM , and Thadani said he believed it would offer better performance than existing Xen - based hypervisors .
The launch serves to add another competitive hypervisor into the market against Citrix 's Xen and VMware .
While Red Hat will be challenging two virtualization giants in earnest , Thadani said there is a need for another hypervisor in the market , and that 's it 's all part of the evolution of virtualization technology .
Red
Hat will also be including a KVM - based hypervisor as part of its next Red Hat Enterprise Linux ( RHEL ) update , RHEL 5.4 .
By providing both a standalone hypervisor and an integrated hypervisor in RHEL , Red Hat is aiming to serve two different markets , Thadani said .
" The standalone hypervisor [ is ] easy to use and quick to deploy , and we expect that enterprises that do not have a lot of Linux expertise and just want to use a virtualization solution quickly will use the standalone hypervisor , " he said .
" From that standpoint , we believe this will be a new market for Red Hat . "
In addition to the new hypervisor , Thadani also talked up new virtualization management tools for servers and desktops .
Red Hat Virtualization Manager for Servers enables users to manage all their virtual assets from a central location .
He added that it can scale for high - availability needs and includes complete monitoring , reporting and auditing capabilities .
Thadani also said that the company 's virtualization manager also implements a new , search - based organization tool .
Instead of the conventional approach of viewing components in their environment by drilling down through a hierarchical tree , the new system lets users do a search .
On the desktop side , Red Hat also unveiled its Virtualization Manager for Desktops , which lets administrators centrally secure and manage policies for a virtual desktop environment .
The effort marks something of a change for Red Hat , which to date has not been aggressive in the desktop virtualization space .
Severing ties with Xen As for Xen , which had been the integrated hypervisor technology in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 since 2007 , Red Hat will continue to support existing users .
Still , Thadani said he believes that KVM is a superior architecture , and that it represents the future for virtualization .
" Existing customers using RHEL 5 Xen need not be concerned about continuing its use in production , " Thadani said .
" However , our strategic direction is KVM , and from that standpoint , we 'll offer specific tools and services to our Xen customers to transition to the KVM platform whenever they 're ready . "
Red Hat plans on releasing the new hypervisor and management products over the next 12 months Thadani said .
He added that Red Hat is not currently announcing any pricing on the products .
While Thadani pledged all the solutions would be made available as open source , he added that not everything -- like the management technology -- has yet to be made open source .
" We will make it open source over time as we develop a cross- platform version of the solution , " Thadani said .
The Oklahoma House of Representatives has passed a bill that says that a student can receive a passing grade in an Earth Science class if they say that the Flying Spaghetti Monster created the Earth an hour ago , and then planted false memories into every single living creature on Earth to make it seem like they 've been around longer .
Of course , that 's not the intent of the bill .
The intent is that a student can say the Earth is 6000 years old and still get a passing grade .
The bill itself says that a student cannot be graded down if they say that what they are being taught interferes with their religious beliefs .
Specifically , the bill states :
A school district shall treat a student 's voluntary expression of a religious viewpoint , if any , on an otherwise permissible subject in the same manner the district treats a student 's voluntary expression of a secular or other viewpoint on an otherwise permissible subject and may not discriminate against the student based on a religious viewpoint expressed by the student on an otherwise permissible subject .
It 's the " otherwise permissible subject " phrase that 's sticky .
That can easily be interpreted as meaning tests , besides just normal classroom discussion .
For a long time , I have been disquieted by the fact that many people want to give patently ridiculous ideas as much standing as reality .
One problem with this is that once you open the door to fantasy , any and all flavors of it can walk on through , as in the example above .
But it also elevates fantasy to the same level as reality , and that is simply wrong .
I taught a few classes back when I was a grad student .
If someone had answered a question on a test saying the Earth was 6000 years old , I would have marked it as incorrect .
That 's because - and sit down for this breaking news - that answer is wrong .
The student could complain , they could take it to the dean , the president , the Supreme Court for all I care - I would n't have backed down .
Wrong is wrong .
I do n't care what your religious belief is , there are some things that are simple facts .
An object with mass has gravity .
A lump of lithium dropped into water will create heat and hydrogen gas .
An accelerating charged particle will emit radiation .
These are facts .
It does n't matter what you believe : reality is that which , when you go to sleep , does n't go away .
What I find most ironic about this legislation - and there is a rich , rich field of irony to choose from - is that it was passed by conservatives , people who no doubt would rail against political correctness and relativism ( for example , the bill 's primary author , Sally Kern , has spoken clearly about her being against " the gay lifestyle " - she even compares being gay to cancer ) , yet this is exactly what this legislation is all about .
The problem here is that they are trying to legislate relativistic reality .
And that 's simply wrong .
And it 's not like they have to go far to see what a disaster this bill will create :
Texas is already in a peck o' trouble for passing a similar law .
This bill still has to pass Oklahoma 's state Senate before it becomes a law .
If that happens , Oklahoma will have taken a long stride back into the Dark Ages .
I 'll be honest : if I were an employer , or a University recruiter , and the bill becomes law , I would look very skeptically at any application that came to my desk from a student who graduated in Oklahoma .
That makes me sad , but that is the reality Oklahoma is aiming toward .
For more about this horrid bill , check out Oklahomans for Excellence in Science Education .
Also , evidently this bill will also allow the straightforward teaching of religion in school .
Mainstream Baptist has something to say about that .
I meet a lot of nice , intelligent people these days who say they are n't aware that their lives have become any less free .
Maybe your life is unaffected , I say , but a lot of people are now experiencing Labour 's authoritarian laws .
Then I choose a story such as this one from yesterday 's papers about the artist and photographer Reuben Powell who was arrested and held for five hours under terrorist laws .
I point out that Reuben , who was photographing the old HMSO print works in London , was doing nothing wrong but he had everything to fear from the police who treated him like a criminal , fingerprinted him and took his DNA .
But for the action of Simon Hughes MP , a member of the one party that seems to understand the threat we face from the police state – the Liberal Democrats – Mr Powell would have spent a lot more time in custody .
I would add that this is a far from unique event in Britain .
I have it on the authority of a policeman of my acquaintance that most of the stop and searches under terrorist laws are inspired by the need for local police commands to meet targets each week , which means that the public is being needlessly harassed while no significant gain against the terrorists is being achieved .
In the case of Reuben , the police had only to ask themselves if the former HMSO print works were a likely terrorist target and if a terrorist on reconnaissance would be carrying sketch pad , rubber and craft knife for sharpening pencils .
Oh but this is just a one off , they say .
Well , actually it is n't .
Photographers , artists , naturalists , trainspotters , journalists are being routinely harassed and persecuted up and down the country .
Today , there are reports of a Tory MP , Andrew Pelling , who was arrested while taking photographs of a cycle path .
People 's fundamental rights are being eroded and nobody seems to give a damn .
Except Norman Baker , another Liberal Democrat MP , who has discovered that the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2004 has been used to stop a staggering 62,584 people at railway stations , while a further 87,000 were stopped by police under rules which allow them to ask people to account for themselves .
( What nonsense it is for the government to continue to insist that ID cards will never be demanded on the street . )
Among those most frequently stopped are trainspotters .
A 15 - year - old boy in school uniform was accosted last year and made to sign a form under Section 44 of the anti-terror act .
( Plainly part of any New Labour 's modernised tyranny is form filling .
We have form 27 of the Violent Crime Reduction
Act which is being issued to football fans , form 696 required by the police for those staging live events in London , and this week we had first sight of the 53 questions to be issued to all people travelling abroad .
It seems that anyone who takes a picture in a public is at risk of prosecution and harassment .
A Polish man who photographed a woman who was " ill " outside an Edinburgh pub was fined £ 100 under public order laws and told by the sheriff that he was " unchivalrous " .
Maybe , but he was hardly a threat to public order .
Perhaps that sheriff needs to be sent on a course to learn about Britain 's fundamental rights .
More serious , perhaps , is an incident which took place outside the Greek embassy last month when two press photographers were prevented from covering a demonstration .
Police removed them from the scene and grabbed one camera .
Happily this was filmed and a complaint has now been formally lodged .
However many examples one produces of the slow deterioration of our national life , the erosion of our freedoms and the loss of respect between authority and public , nice intelligent people shrug their shoulders and say the police are just trying to do their job , and we do n't live in a perfect world .
This is the ultimate complacency , and it derives from a failure to understand that a system of rights can only work if it is universally applied .
That is to say that we must are all feel outrage when someone is arrested unfairly and prevented from doing his or her job , even if it 's just a bloke taking pictures for his art .
The Guardian is the media partner for The Convention on Modern Liberty , taking place on Saturday February 28 2009 , which will debate these and other issues .

But some are so far out there that they seem to have left the entire concept of sex far behind .
These strangely safe - for - work fetishes are , in some ways , far more disturbing than anything involving poop or anime tentacles .
Such as ...
Some fetishes are really easy to understand .
A silk stocking fetish , hell , everybody 's down with that .
Or a fetish that involves a naked woman rubbing her boobs on another naked woman .
5 Piggyback Rides
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
We all associate piggyback rides with children on their parents ' shoulders at fairs and the occasional drunken nights when transporting passed out friends to a taxi .
You likely do n't think of this as a turn - on unless it's in a pool and you 've got a girl on your shoulders who 's up for an arousing game of " chicken fight " which , according to the videos we 've seen , end up with everyone naked .
But then there are the fetishists who just plain get off on riding the shoulders of other people .
As one piggyback enthusiast puts it : " A month ago , when intoxicated , I asked another male friend from Canada to piggyback me .
Although the entire session only lasted a minute or two , my sexual drive ( not specifically for him ) suddenly sparked , more than alcohol can ever do .
Halfway through the piggyback , I maneuvered myself to hold on his front , dangling there like a koala . "

We imagine this fetish revolves around trust and security .
Oh , and crazy .
Trust , security and crazy .
Through our countless hours of research and sleepless nights , we 've come to the conclusion that piggybackers find themselves trapped in a sexually arousing power struggle .
The piggybackee can offer suggestions on speed and direction , but it 's ultimately up to the piggybacker to control the situation .
" You want to go left ?
Fuck you , I 'm going right . "
Is this turning you on ?
It 's confusing us .
It Gets Weirder ...
This fine man below was gracious enough to let the world see his fetish .
In his own words , " I like it very much to ride on older men .
I can sit on the old man of about four minutes and bouncing on his shoulders . "

Were you expecting something else ?
The guy likes to ride old men .
Congratulations humanity .
Then again , maybe we should give Ralphmunic the benefit of the doubt .
He 's living his dream .
What are you doing with your life ?
YouTube Responds :
" Love your videos !
I like to ride on , sit on and trample folk .
I'm 6 ' and 16.5 stone /231 lbs ( 183 cm and 105 kg ) and live in south UK .
If any of you guys want to be riden hard , sat on or trampled under my feet and / or enjoy a good beasting , contact me ! "
" But , if you can do so , try to ride him ( the old man ) , with your ass full of shit , you know , after you do poo-poo .... , would you like it ? "
The California Energy Commission is proceeding with a proposal this summer to ban the sale of TV sets that do not meet new efficiency standards when they are turned on and displaying a picture — a measure of power consumption that is not currently regulated at all .
But the market and technological advances may already be advancing this goal , as large - screen plasma sets fall out of favor and LCDs become more energy efficient .
The CEC proposal is set up as a two - tiered system .
The first enforces efficiency standards beginning in 2011 and would save 3,831 gigawatt hours ( and bring down overall TV energy consumption by 33 % ) by placing a cap on the active mode power usage ( in watts ) of individual TVs .
Current standards in California only regulate TVs in standby mode , at a cap of 3.0 watts .
According to the Commission , energy used in standby mode only represents about 5 percent of all TV energy consumption .
The proposal is based on the following formulas :
The program 's 2013 second stage promises to reduce energy use by 49 % .
If they are enforced , the new standards are expected to save Californians between $ 18 and $ 30 a year per TV set in energy costs .
As noted by the Commission , current LCDs use about . 27 - watts per square inch and plasmas use 0.36 - watts per square inch .
This is n't the first time Government has stepped in to regulate the energy efficiency in a gadget .
More than thirty years ago , regulations on always - on refrigerators were passed and were first seen by companies as oppressive .
Those companies eventually adapted and the result was a more efficient product .
Similar acts have managed the energy needs of air conditioners and other gadgets .
Not surprisingly , several TV companies are seeing this proposal as an all out declaration of war .
On the front lines are the folks that put on the Consumer Electronics Show every year , members of the Consumer Electronics Association .
They think they 've done enough to self - regulate their industry , including setting up tougher energy criteria with the new Energy Star 3.0 .
Currently , the standards set up by the Energy Star project are not as stringent .
The Energy Star caps are set by a formula that uses native vertical resolution and visible screen area .
Power Integrations recently noted that the Energy Star formula ( PMax = 0.240 * A + 27 ) , with a TV - viewing area between 680 inches and 1045 inches , limits 42 - inch TVs ( 754 in.sq. ) to 208 watts in consumption .
More than 300 TVs qualify at that limit right now , including some energy - hogging Plasmas .
It 's important to note that the Energy Star program is voluntary , and most of the TVs that would be banned by the proposal would be larger TVs that are already losing steam in the market anyway .
The CEA , working on behalf of companies likely to be most affected by the proposal ( over - 40 - inch CRT and Plasma television makers ) , says pushing through this law would immediately take out 25 percent of TVs off the market .
They claim that removing any TV options would harm companies already hurting from the recession .
Those who'd benefit from the new law do n't share the same belief .
The LCD Manufacturers Association , including up - and coming TV makers like Vizio , are supporting the proposal .
The Commission , says the law 's main goal is to reduce the strain on the energy grid , which will help avoid building expensive new power plants .
It cites the fact that TVs are among the fastest growing electronics in the business and are slated to grow further .
But that 's a deceptive citation because recent TV growth has focused on LCDs and other ' greener ' TVs .
Energy - hogging
TVs are on their way out , without the help of the government or an overriding desire by consumers to own energy - efficient TVs .
Most buy LCDs because they 're simply cheaper and are finally approximating the quality of larger plasma televisions .
As we noted recently , the next six years are expected to follow this model as well , with super - efficient OLEDs growing in popularity and availability .
So this might be a moot issue after all , even if you take into account the very largest TVs , which the CEA says will be ones most penalized .
Consider the Mitsubishi LaserVue Laser TV , which comes in huge sizes over 65 inches .
Its laser technology not only produces good video , but is also the most energy - efficient , with long - lasting lasers that never need replacing .
So the intention of the commission is generally positive , but it looks like consumers are already ahead of the game here .
No matter what happens with the proposal , energy - hogging TVs will be gone within two years .
The CEC has told Wired.com there will be further opportunities for the public to give input on this issue through public hearings and comments on its website , www.energy.ca.gov/commission/complaint.html.
There 's currently no word on the exact date the proposal will come to vote in the summer , but we 'll update this post when we learn more .

As promised , here 's the second part of my post about web hosting .
I thought I would highlight the technology that we use for the main Wolfire site , Google App Engine , and explain why we chose it .
Before I explain what App Engine is exactly , let me talk about what I look for in a web host .
- Scalability and reliability
It is critical for your website to be online .
If your site has been featured on Slashdot , Digg , etc. that is not an excuse for downtime -- that is more reason than ever for your site to be up !
Your site 's speed and stability should be independent of its load or you have built a glass ceiling for yourself .
- Speed and latency
Your site should be fast -- this is pretty obvious .
Both Amazon and Google actually have run experiments that quantify how responsiveness affects their sales or ad clicks respectively .
According to Google 's experience , " half a second delay caused a 20 % drop in traffic . "
- Time and money
In my opinion , the most important feature , is that it should be easy to develop for .
Fast prototyping is a mantra in the indie community and I think it extends into web development as well .
Furthermore , price is a very sensitive issue .
Of course , we want the top of the line , but at the same time , almost by definition , most indies just do n't have much cash to invest in our own data center .
What is Google App Engine ?
To summarize what App Engine is , it lets you create web applications that can be deployed on Google 's ridiculous server infrastructure relatively easily .
You are given a neat set of APIs to use , for instance , Google 's BigTable database system , a memcached compatible API , an email API , and a number of other things .
The idea is that if you code your web app in a certain way within Google 's best practices , you can relax and your web app will scale pretty much indefinitely , with great speed , and near perfect uptime .
Here 's how it works .
Basically , when you write your site using App Engine , Google has tricked you into making a self contained , independent piece of code that nicely interacts with other parts of itself through rigid APIs .
Your website is therefore not defined in terms of servers , databases , or hardware , it is defined in terms of nice little Python processes .
When someone types in your URL in their browser , there is no defined machine for it to go to .
It is routed to Google , and Google can run your application on any number of machines to handle the request in an optimal manner .
If you just were featured on Digg , you can bet that your code is running on a ton of machines and your site will be as responsive as ever .
The beauty is that you do n't have to think about that .
Google handles all of that for you .
How well does it work ?
From our experience , App Engine scales quite well .
We 've been linked to by a number of sites : Slashdot , Ars Technica , Digg ( via Ars Technica ) , Reddit , and App Engine did n't break a sweat .
The biggest test came when Lugaru was part of the MacHeist Giving Tree .
When the Giving Tree was unveiled , we experienced a sudden spike that generated about 30 visits / second .
While many of the other participating apps featured were immediately destroyed ( even the Giving Tree itself at some points ) , Google kept up without breaking a sweat .
How much does it cost ?
App Engine is a shining example of " software as a service " .
You pay for exactly what you use , and in fact , the first chunk is free ( i.e. the first 5 million page views / month , more or less ) .
Needless to say , at Wolfire , we are not even close to exceeding our free quota and when we do , we are not going to be too concerned with forking over the 10 cents per gigabyte and other nickels and dimes Google charges based on your precise usage .
Click here for the full breakdown .
Disadvantages
A common criticism of App Engine is that you become locked into the platform .
This is mostly because Google 's BigTable database is unlike many other database systems , so if you make a complicated , database heavy app , it might be non-trivial to port it to another system , since you wrote it the " Google way " .
The Wolfire website is simple enough that I could easily port it to another system in less than a day , but if you are working on a highly complicated web application , I can see how this might be a concern .
Also , App Engine is very young .
You will probably run into minor bugs every once in a while .
Lucky for you , Wolfire and a number of other early adopters have been putting App Engine through its paces and have found a number of bugs for you .
Google has actually offered to come to my Wolfire office ( aka my bedroom ) and observe my App Engine usage to help improve it .
We 'll see if they are still comfortable once they learn that fact .
What do you guys use for hosting ?
Would you guys like to hear more about App Engine or Amazon 's web services ?
I have barely scratched the surface .

Today is the day that Obama Kamina was sworn into office ( along with Vice President Bright as you remember . )
To help celebrate this momentous occasion , I decided to litter Japanator with “ Obamicon ” anime posters .
However , it is not only me who will do this , but you as well !
You can make your own “ Obamicon ” style of poster by going over to Obamiconme ’s website and inserting an image into their program .
Its real simple , and real easy to begin campaigning for the next anime president using this program .
Those of you who really want Shinji as president are going to have to start early , because Kamina can always run for a second term in office .
These are a lot of fun to make , and there are still millions more I want to create ; but alas , I ’m only one man .
So go on and post yours after the jump , I ’ll be waiting with cake .

( Fortune Magazine ) --
The numbers are staggering , especially because the tallies are being measured in human beings : Caterpillar ( 20,000 layoffs ) , Alcoa ( 15,000 ) , Boeing ( 10,000 ) , Pfizer ( 8,300 ) , and tens of thousands more .
The toll of jobs lost in the U.S. since the recession began is heading toward three million .
Unlike previous downturns , this one is not confined to the tech or manufacturing sectors .
It is the Equal Opportunity Recession , winding its way into every corner of the economy .
To put faces on the numbers , Fortune interviewed dozens of jobless people across the U.S.
They are old and young , rich and poor , from rural Maine and urban California .
They are your neighbor or your nephew .
Or they are you .
They may be from radically different backgrounds , but these job seekers have a few things in common : frustration , fear - and resilience .
They want to work .
They have treated unemployment as a full - time job in itself because they have learned that in the end , they have only themselves to rely on .
Here are their stories .
Where the people feel like spare parts
Annette Ison , 48 , Barbara Philpot , 50 , and Michele Scales , 52 , of Dayton
In her final weeks as an assembly - line worker , Barbara Philpot spent an entire summer just sitting and waiting for her time to run out .
" My last day was Aug. 31 , 2007 , " recalls Philpot , a 22 - year factory veteran , " but they had already closed down the facility .
All we did was sit in an auditorium and sleep or play cards .
It was depressing .
They gave us a lunch our last day for everybody who was still there , a fried - chicken lunch .
Who wants a piece of chicken when you know your demise is coming ?
I 'd rather have had the $ 5 it cost . "
Philpot and her former co-workers Michele Scales and Annette Ison had collectively spent almost six grimy but gratifying decades in the factories of Dayton , where they worked for auto - parts maker Delphi ( spun off from GM in 1999 ) .
Philpot ran a giant welding machine , Ison worked on the line , and Scales had just finished training to be a factory plumber .
They never thought they'd be the last of their families to work at the plants , but GM 's decline accelerated more quickly than anyone imagined .
In 2005 , Delphi filed for bankruptcy protection .
By the fall of 2007 the three women were spare parts .
" Dayton has always been an automotive city , " says Ison , " but it 's becoming a dried - up town . "
In Moraine , the suburb where the three women worked , the community is ebbing as well .
Thirty - year - old family restaurants are closing .
Foreclosure signs are spreading like cracks in a sidewalk .
The women still feel resentment from others who remember when Delphi was part of the GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) gravy train .
" I get so tired of people thinking that because you worked at GM , life is so great , " says Philpot .
" Life is a day - to - day struggle now .
I used to love my job .
I wish every day I wake up that I could punch my clock and do my eight hours .
I never , ever dreamed it would end up like this . "
Former Delphi union employees do have some benefits .
With unemployment and supplemental pay , they 'll receive health care and about 70 % of their hourly wages until 2010 .
They also get money to go to school .
But there have been misunderstandings , particularly about the terms of the severance .
All three women mistakenly thought they were entitled to more money .
They did n't understand that they had to go to school to keep collecting unemployment , and did n't know there would be restrictions on what they could study .
Bad enough they 'd been laid off .
Now they had to take midterms ?
" The last time I was in school I had ovaries , " says Scales , who has undergone 21 surgeries in the past five years due to complications from a mastectomy and hysterectomy .
Scales had just finished her training in May 2007 when she was told she'd have to help pack up the company 's equipment .
" I shipped my job to Mexico , " she says .
Scales ' experience is in industrial , not residential , plumbing , and she says there are no industrial jobs out there .
Now she 's hoping to land a management position in plumbing by completing an associate 's degree .
Unable to get funding for that , Scales took out a student loan .
" I 'm in foreclosure .
I do n't know how long I can stay in my house .
That 's another thing that makes it hard to study .
I feel like my life is depending on this . "
A career counselor takes his own advice
Greg Dillon , 49 , Marietta , Ga .
Even before times turned bad , Greg Dillon volunteered at career centers and his church to help people write resumes and strategize about jobs .
It was a satisfying way to share his skills as a training and development specialist .
So today he does n't need to read the papers to see the impact of the recession on his Cobb County neighbors .
" It 's the worst I 've ever seen , " he says , noting that the last Cobb Job Seekers meeting he attended had 40 people instead of the usual 15 to 20 ; a local career group sponsored by the Society of Human Resources Management has also doubled in size .
Dillon is now in the odd position of having to take his own advice .
Last Nov. 10 , the day before his 49th birthday , he was laid off from Forum Co. , the second time he'd lost a position in the previous 18 months .
" Unfortunately for me , I know what to do in terms of being unemployed , " he says .
" It 's kind of like the Hair Club for Men . Now I 'm a user too . "
For a long time Dillon 's career had been all about stability .
After working at the Randstad staffing agency as a national learning manager for seven years , he had decided to try something different , so he took a position in August 2006 at an Atlanta - based diversity - training company .
In retrospect , it was n't the best time to make a move .
Eleven months later , in July 2007 , he was let go because of slowing business .
" I had wanted to broaden myself a little more , " he says .
" But it was n't anything like it is now . "
He soon found the job at Forum , where he worked for just over a year .
Dillon is anxious , but hopeful he will find something soon , ideally in academia .
There is a promising job at a local university , but he can't be hired until the job has been posted - and it took several frustrating weeks for the listing to appear .
He has had other good interviews , but everything seems to be on the slow track .
" I 'm in a strange kind of limbo state , " he says .
" I feel like I have stuff out there , but I 'm not yet solidified enough to feel at peace . "
The worst thing for Dillon is the sense of powerlessness , even as he knows that others are in the same situation .
" It 's a double - edged sword , " he says .
" You do n't take it as personal because it 's affecting everyone , but at the same time those other people are also competing against you for jobs . "
Ultimately he relies on his family and his church , the North River Church of Christ , for support .
" I 'm supposed to be learning something here about perseverance , " he says .
Forum gave Dillon four weeks of severance .
But it does n't go very far with three daughters , one of whom just started college and would have had to move out of the dorms if it were n't for the generosity of relatives .
His wife , Kathryn , has a drapery business , but customers are being more cautious about spending .
And the transmission on the family 's ' 93 Nissan Maxima just died .
" I donated it to charity , " he says .
At least someone will benefit .
Looking for life after Lehman Brothers
Anthony Singh , 51 , New York City
It 's not easy going to a job interview when the first item people see listed in your " experience " column is a name synonymous with financial disaster .
" One of the things I 've discovered is that having Lehman on your resume is not a good thing , " says Anthony Singh with a slight smile .
Singh , who worked as a Lehman vice president in capital markets , was laid off in January 2008 , eight months before the company 's collapse .
But that does n't matter much to people who see the resume and ask , only partly joking , whether he caused the downfall of the free world .
When he arrived at Lehman in early 2007 , Singh was excited to be landing at a blue - chip firm that was practically printing money , and remembers being pressured to decide whether to take the job .
" They said , ' We need an answer right away .
Are you with us ?
Are you onboard ? ' "
Once on the job , however , he became frustrated with the lack of communication between units .
When he was laid off after just nine months , he attributed it to a mismatch of personalities rather than a portent of doom .
" There was no writing on the wall , " he says .
Singh loves his work .
He has an MBA from New York University as well as more than two decades of expertise in revenue and cost management for banks - figuring out which parts of a business are the most profitable when all costs are included .
But embattled banks are consolidating and laying off tens of thousands of workers .
They are n't spending a lot on the types of long - term analytics at which Singh excels , no matter how much they may need to .
" There 's not much hiring , " he says .
" But I think companies are being penny - wise and pound - foolish . "
So for the past 12 months , Singh , who is single , has spent a lot of time in his Manhattan apartment , working out with weights and watching old movies like Casablanca .
He has also finally had the time for hobbies like researching his family tree .
A native of Guyana who arrived in the U.S. with his parents and seven siblings when he was 13 to escape political turmoil , he has discovered that he 's part Indian , part Chinese , part Scottish , and part Irish .
He had hoped to travel the globe doing research , but those kinds of expenditures will have to wait for now .
While he 's confident in his abilities , he freezes - just for a second - when asked whether banking may be changing so drastically that the opportunities for him are diminishing .
" I hope not , " he says , before wondering aloud whether , say , agricultural businesses might be able to use his skills .
" I like Florida ... "
Sleepless nights after the mill winds down
Cory Clapsaddle , 37 , Jay , Maine
While so many Americans were overreaching during the boom years , Cory Clapsaddle appreciated what was right in front of him .
He wanted to follow in his dad 's footsteps , working at the local paper mill and raising a family in the home he grew up in .
" If it was good for my father , it was good for me , " he says .
Clapsaddle was patient , working construction and odd jobs for seven years .
Finally , in 1998 , he took his place among the 235 workers at the century - old mill owned by Wisconsin - based Wausau Paper .
He had faith in its durability .
" It seemed like a mill that could never die , " he says .
For ten years he thrived there , turning paper pulp into everything from masking tape to writing tablets .
Then the real world intervened .
A few days before Labor Day last year , Wausau Paper announced it was shutting down one of the two giant papermaking machines in Jay and laying off about 150 people , citing " difficult market conditions . "
" It 's going to devastate a lot of personal lives , " town manager Ruth Marden told the local Sun Journal .
Clapsaddle 's was one of them .
Since finishing that last 11 P.M. to 7 A.M. shift , Clapsaddle has n't slept well at night .
" It 's always on my mind , " he says , " the whole big picture .
Looking for a new job , losing a job , bills .
The whole picture . "
Clapsaddle does n't have a cushion beyond his severance package of $ 10,000 .
Two years ago he and his wife , Amanda , bought his childhood home in nearby Livermore Falls to make room for their two boys , ages 4 and 7 - and their mortgage quadrupled to almost $ 1,000 a month .
He gets $ 344 a week in unemployment benefits .
They 've cut costs by reducing cellphone minutes and using their wood - burning stove instead of heating oil .
Clapsaddle is only gradually adjusting to the idea that the mill is no longer part of the family 's future .
He still has the wooden basket his dad used to carry his meal to work every day .
" It hurts , " he says , staring out the window at his sons playing in the snow .
" You drive by and know you 'll probably never drive in again , and that someday it wo n't be there at all . "
But leaving central Maine will be the family 's last resort .
Jay ( pop. 5,000 ) is the kind of place where an out - of - state license plate turns heads .
It 's far enough north that locals consider a few inches of snow a dusting .
The Clapsaddles do n't yearn for the Sunbelt .
What now ?
Clapsaddle has thought about going back into construction .
He 'd like to be a full - time firefighter , but he does n't think he can compete with the younger folks coming out of school .
He did n't make the cut on the law - enforcement test , but he might retake it .
In the meantime he has enrolled in a heating and air - conditioning course in Scarborough , an hour and a half away .
A federal program will pay for his tuition , books , and travel .
At this point he just knows he has to make a move .
" It 's coming down to the wire , " he says .
" I need to do something . "
An odyssey of downward mobility
Diana Mackey , 62 , Sparks , Nev .
If you 'd told Diana Mackey a few years back that she'd be working the night shift as a temporary sorter in an Amazon.com ( AMZN , Fortune 500 ) warehouse , she probably would have laughed out loud .
With a long career in human resources for the likes of Ernst & Young and Cambridge Technology Partners , Mackey , 62 , had been able to raise two children on her own , buy herself a few homes , travel , and save for retirement .
But she lost even the Amazon job after just four days , let go for not being fast enough on her feet .
A stream of corporate rationalizations , mergers , and plain old bad luck has left her jobless , frustrated , and open to anything that will help her and her boyfriend pay the mortgage on his condo in suburban Reno .
" It 's hard to believe that no one wants you now , " she says .
" It 's hard to deal with that .
But we 're survivors . "
Mackey , a native of Columbus , spent many years shuttling between New York and Ohio , recruiting new hires for Ernst & Young and rising to the position of senior manager .
She moved to Claremont Technology Group , which went public and netted her enough cash to finance a move to San Francisco and a job with Cambridge in 1997 .
From that point she suffered a long decline in earning power .
She joined two dot - com startups , both of which went under .
Looking for a fresh start , she moved to Sparks with her boyfriend , John Corbin , in 2002 and landed a job in HR for a telecom company , working her way up to $ 90,000 .
But the company was bought by Sprint ( S , Fortune 500 ) , her job functions were relocated to Sacramento , and she was laid off .
She landed a $ 70,000 job recruiting for Round Table Pizza that lasted 16 months , until management merged two regions .
She knew what would come next .
" The assistant manager wanted to meet me for breakfast on the last day of the month , " Mackey says .
" I said , ' You 're going to let me go . ' "
Since then Mackey has been caught up in a job search that she says is even more difficult in a place like Reno , with a lot of transplants and few large companies .
Career - counseling sessions , she says , are " like 100 unemployed 60 - year - old people in a room looking at each other . "
She recently endured a series of nine interviews with a medical company , only to be told that it had decided not to fill the position .
Mackey volunteered for the Obama campaign ; then , out of money , she and Corbin decided to take temp jobs at Amazon .
They lasted only four grueling nights .
Today Mackey is getting $ 362 a week in unemployment and has reluctantly decided to start collecting Social Security ( for less than she would have had she waited until 65 ) .
The couple feels trapped , unable to sell the condo because of the glut of foreclosures in their neighborhood .
So Mackey has started selling off possessions on eBay and living an unfamiliar lifestyle .
" I used to go to Costco and load up on steaks and chops , " she says with a hint of self - deprecation .
" Now we go to Wal - Mart .
I got 75 boxes of Hamburger Helper on sale . "
She keeps a careful spreadsheet of every grocery item she buys and which store has it at the best price .
It saves money - and , she says with a weary wink , keeps those technical skills fresh .
Back from war but fighting for a job
Adam Schulz , 28 , Chicago
Adam Schulz 's online - networking profile says it all : " Combat veteran searching for job in Chicago .
Strong background in leadership under pressure in hostile environments . "
It 's a good thing Schulz has this kind of experience , because the streets of the Windy City are feeling almost as mean as those of Baghdad - at least when it comes to finding a project management job in technology or defense .
A 2002 West Point graduate with a 3.47 GPA in information - systems engineering , Schulz , 28 , stood out at school and on the battlefield .
He did two Iraq tours , one in 2003 and one in 2007 , as a platoon leader and an executive officer , respectively .
In between he was selected for specialized leadership training and was an aide - de - camp for a one - star general in Germany .
In Iraq he helped reduce attacks in his area by some 90 % on his first tour and trained a local police battalion in his second .
It was during that tour that one of his best friends from West Point was killed by a sniper .
Schulz took a one - month leave and eventually decided to exit the Army in March 2008 .
Since then his civilian job search has been a nonstop losing battle .
" I 've gone to multiple interviews where I felt like the next step was going to be an offer ; they call and say they love you .
And in about a month or two they come back and say they really wanted you , ' but because of current economic situations ...'
It 's happened about six times now , " Schulz says .
A Louisville native who likes snowboarding and watching ultimate fighting , Schulz has connected with search firms that specialize in placing military veterans , like the Lucas Group , and says he has applied for more than 200 jobs on CareerBuilder and Monster in the past year - with , he says , " absolutely no response . "
Believing that he'd land something quickly with so much real - world experience , he bought an apartment last May .
Now struggling to pay the mortgage , he 's doing some bartending and temp work and has joined the National Guard .
He 's also considering going back to school for a joint MBA and master 's in engineering management .
Schulz is confused and frustrated by the fact that his accomplishments in Iraq have n't found him a home in the business world .
Some companies , like APP Pharmaceuticals , have focused on his lack of industry experience , but he thinks leading a platoon in war gives him a kind of outlook on life that most employees will never know .
" The greatest aspect that leaders bring to the table is the ability to be adaptable , " he argues .
" You 're just given a bunch of people to be in charge of and told to figure it out .
That 's what I try to express to companies . "
Most perplexing of all is that Schulz thought he'd done all the right things .
" When you 're at West Point , everybody tells you that if you do decide to leave , you 'll have so many possibilities you wo n't know what to do with them , " he says .
They did n't count on an economy like this one .
A pig farmer 's last truckload
Norlin Gutz , 56 , Storm Lake , Iowa
Out in Storm Lake , Iowa ( pop. 10,076 ) , pigs outnumber humans by about 18 to one .
For 36 years Norlin Gutz raised 50,000 piglets annually on a farm first settled in the 19th century by his great - grandfather .
Gutz was one of the few remaining independent pig farmers in an increasingly corporate industry .
But on Jan. 11 , Gutz loaded his last 1,500 pigs onto a truck .
Norlin Gutz is bankrupt .
" What caused it is the feed costs , " he explains , " and what started that was the unleashing of the ethanol industry .
If there had been some type of a gradual phasing in , maybe we could have adjusted .
But it was bam !
It 's just been devastating for the industries that use the corn . "
While the price of corn has dropped over the past few months , in 2007 - 2008 the cost per bushel rose from $ 2 to $ 7 .
At the same time , a glut of pigs led to lower prices per head .
Gutz says that at the bottom of the market , he got $ 10 for a ten - pound baby pig that cost him $ 30 to raise .
In March 2008 the bank Gutz had done business with for almost seven years asked him and his wife , Becky , to come in for a conversation .
" We were nervous , " Gutz recalls .
" We knew we had trouble paying bills .
We just prayed that we would accept whatever happened . "
The loan officer confirmed their worst fears - that there would be no more financing - and Gutz began the process of liquidation .
He slowly let go his dozen employees , sold his farm equipment , and fattened his baby pigs to a 260 - pound marketable weight , selling them for whatever he could get .
He became a statistic , one of the 900 pork farms that the USDA estimates have disappeared since 2006 .
He also started suffering from severe headaches .
" The doctor asked me if I was angry .
I was surprised .
I said , ' I may be disappointed in myself , but I 'm not angry . ' "
Eventually the headaches stopped .
But the second - guessing has not .
" I was trying to find a niche by using an older facility at low cost , " Gutz says .
" But it was n't a very efficient facility .
The bank does n't even want it . "
On Dec. 2 , Gutz declared bankruptcy ; 18 months ago he had a net worth of $ 1.3 million .
To make ends meet , the farmer has been taking care of pigs for other people .
In November , Becky hit the books so that she could renew the nurse 's license she has n't used in 30 years while raising five children and helping out on the farm .
Successfully recertified , she accepted a job in a nursing home in January .
" Once you 've had your heart tore out , " says Gutz of his wife , " it 's hard to get enthused and go back into it .
She 's looking forward to something new . "
Whether he will also try something new remains to be seen .
" I grew up in this business , " says Gutz , who was once recognized by the state as a Master Pork Producer .
" I do n't have anything else I can do .
You feel like you 've let your wife down , your family , your parents , you know ?
And you feel like other people are talking about you .
It 's embarrassing .
This was my whole world . "
From Yahoo to layoff in Internet time
Melissa Daniels , 24 , San Jose
At her age , Melissa Daniels can't conceive of life without the Internet .
One of her most vivid childhood memories is of agonizing about choosing her AOL screen name , at the age of 8 ( she settled on mndkid , using her initials ) .
So when a manager at Yahoo ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) offered her a position as a community manager in May 2008 , Daniels leaped at the chance .
Little matter that the company was already in turmoil , having just rejected a takeover bid from Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) .
It was the kind of job you do n't turn down , the modern - day equivalent of one at 1960s General Electric .
" It 's always an honor to be asked to work for a company like that , " she says .
" It definitely sweetened the deal . "
Thrilled with her team and her role as a liaison between Yahoo users and its product teams , Daniels did n't focus much on the day - to - day struggles at the company .
But when the layoffs came in December only seven months in , she was less shocked than disappointed .
" It was n't something new , like a black cloud of smoke descended , " she says .
" I was never angry .
But I was more sad than I thought I would be , because I loved my job and everyone I worked with .
You cry about puppies and family members , not over jobs . "
For Daniels , this is an unwanted pause in a life that has been on fast - forward .
At 22 , she earned a master 's degree in communications management from the University of Southern California , writing her thesis on user - generated content and viral media .
At 23 , when she took the Yahoo job , she bought a condo in San Jose with some help from her mom .
By 24 , she had already been downsized .
" I did n't really know what you do in a layoff , " she says .
" Logistically I did n't even know how it worked . "
Now the self - proclaimed " digital native " is using the tools of her generation to find her next job .
She networks through Linked In , posts on Twitter , and keeps a blog ( new2oldmedia.wordpress.com ) where she comments on happenings in her industry .
And now she looks at every company with a more skeptical eye .
" The big thing for me is stability , " she says .
" I just do n't want to be laid off again . "
Daniels has had almost a dozen in - person interviews , several with the same potential employer .
Nothing has panned out yet .
" It 's kind of like dating .
Do they like me ?
Do they not ? "
Perhaps because of her youth , Daniels remains highly confident .
She says she wo n't take a pay cut unless it 's for the perfect job .
Daniels also knows instinctively what so many older people have experienced : that being young - and relatively inexpensive - gives her an edge .
In the meantime , she lives cheaply .
Besides her mortgage , her only bills are her utilities and a manageable student loan .
And while she once loved to buy clothes , she 's learned to window - shop .
" It 's okay to hang out at someone 's house and watch Lost , " she says .
The hardest thing , given what she calls her go - go - go personality , is the downtime .
" I hate sitting idly by , " she says .
" I can't stand it .
Sometimes weekends were too long for me .
So a month and a half with no work is , like , are you kidding ? "
It helps , too , that she still feels passionate about her field .
" I wanted to do something that really interested me , " she says , " because I thought it 's always better to do something that you love as opposed to just doing something that pays the bills . "
It would be nice , though , to have both .
An Ivy League mom with a dream on hold
Anne Naggayi , 44 , Burke , Va .
Anne Naggayi's middle son is always trying to help her come up with new job - search strategies .
Recently he watched the movie The Pursuit of Happyness , starring Will Smith as a homeless man who talks his way into financial success , and told his mother that she should follow his lead .
" Mom , you should be like this man , " he said .
" Tell them your story . "
Having her struggles compared to those of a homeless person would have seemed absurd when Naggayi arrived in the U.S. from Uganda in 2001 , the recipient of a partial scholarship from Cornell to complete a master 's in community development .
But three years after receiving two degrees ( the other is in adult education ) , Naggayi , 44 , who holds a work permit while she waits for her green card , is without a job in her chosen field , despite having moved to the D.C. area specifically to take advantage of its many NGOs and nonprofits .
With three sons ( ages 18 , 16 , and 11 ) to raise alone - her husband , a public administrator , died of a heart attack in 2000 - Naggayi believed the opportunities for her family would be better in the U.S. than in Uganda , where she 'd worked for the government .
" Life changes all of a sudden when you lose a spouse , " she says .
" Your life collapses in front of you .
But this [ degree program ] made me feel like I could change myself again . "
Unfortunately for Naggayi , the change has been tougher than she expected .
Despite sending out countless r�sum�s and searching nonprofit job sites like idealist.org , she has n't been able to find anything linked to her degree or her experience working with women in agriculture back in Uganda .
Naggayi , a shy woman , blames her lack of networking skills - or perhaps her accent - for her inability to land something .
She is lonely in the place she came to with such hope .
" I need a mentor , " she says , " someone to talk with .
I 'm a Cornellian , but I 'm lost in the cracks . "
Naggayi has even tried several times to make an appointment with her priest , but has n't heard back .
Now Naggayi is one of the estimated eight million Americans who are underemployed , or working far below their skills .
To pay the bills , she took a job as a provider of in - home care for elderly people , which pays $ 13 an hour .
She works brutally long hours and often drives an hour or more each way to the jobs .
Her oldest son , a good student , is applying to college , but she has no idea how she 'll afford it when even daily expenses are a struggle .
" We used to go bowling and go out to eat every Friday , " she says .
" We used to go to the movies .
Now we go walking .
It 's the only family activity . "
Naggayi feels that she has not been the role model she hoped to be for her children .
" I would like to be a good example and show what education can do for a human being . "
While the best outcome will be when she can put her real skills to work , she probably underestimates what she has already shown her sons .
The whole family joins the army
Lynette Mendez , 43 , Holyoke , Mass .
Lynette Mendez wears pink sweaters and recently took in an unwanted cat .
She is a mother hen who shuttles her daughter , Cheramie , to her after - school job and picks up her kids ' friends from work .
So it 's hard to picture Mendez decked out in camouflage , scaling walls or firing M - 16s .
But that 's what she 'll be doing as soon as the paperwork goes through .
Despite having a master 's degree in accounting , she can't find a job - so she has joined the U.S. Army Reserve .
Mendez concedes that basic training may be a physical struggle , but the single mom will do it to gain the financial stability she longs for .
" I know we 're going to be in a better position , " she said , sitting in the living room of her fourth - floor walkup apartment in Holyoke , Mass .
While she has found odd jobs , she says , " It 's never been anything steady .
It 's been here and there .
And it 's awful . "
The military has become an employer of last resort for Mendez 's family , reflecting a national trend toward higher enlistment rates in the midst of recession .
Her older son , Samuel Morales , 23 , joined the army and left on Dec. 31 for basic training in Kentucky .
Ezxavier Morales , 20 , decided to go the same route and will leave for South Carolina on Feb. 11 .
For all of them , it 's a way out of Holyoke , which has an unemployment rate of 9.5 % .
Mendez tries to stay upbeat , but she admits she never expected her life to turn out this way .
At 21 she came to Massachusetts from Puerto Rico and earned a bachelor 's degree part - time while raising her kids .
After graduating , Mendez landed a job examining claims at a health insurance company , but her division closed down in 2000 after she 'd worked there for five years .
She fell into what she now identifies as depression .
" It takes a toll on you , when you do n't have a job , " she says .
" It 's not easy to be nice to people . "
Things deteriorated further in 2005 after Mendez 's husband , who had been injured at his job as a mechanic , died of complications from the medication he was taking .
Mendez went back to school , figuring that a master 's degree in accounting and taxation from American International College , the same place she had earned her bachelor 's , would give her the edge she needed to get a full - time job .
She kept looking while studying , but since finishing up in December , nothing has come through ; even applications to Wal - Mart and Burger King have n't worked out .
Her final unemployment check arrived in mid-January .
Soon she 'll have to figure out how to start paying off her $ 36,000 student loan .
That unemployment check - and Cheramie 's Social Security benefit from her father 's death - have been Mendez 's only steady source of income , apart from irregular part - time work .
At one point she held three jobs a day , working two gigs as a bookkeeper while squeezing in a job as a school bus monitor .
Everyone chips in , including her daughter , who works at least 20 hours a week at McDonald 's while going to high school .
Mendez stays in touch with her sisters and mother in Puerto Rico but glosses over her struggles .
" I 'm ashamed of telling them my problems , " she says .
" You think you would have been in a better position by now . "
Mendez worries that her job woes have turned her kids off of higher education .
" My oldest will say , ' You have so much schooling , and look at you , ' " she says .
" It 's like they lost faith . "
Not completely , though , and not all of them .
Cheramie , 17 , plans to go to college and has dreams of law school .
How does she expect to pay for it ?
She 's signed up for the U.S. Army Reserve .
The reverse brain drain
Bonnie Loo 36 , Daly City , CA
Silicon Valley may have a reputation as a place where people change jobs as easily as they change clothes .
But that was never the case for Bonnie Loo , who started as a software tester for Macromedia in 1999 and survived the dot - com crash , a merger with Adobe Systems , and a move into project management .
So when Loo heard rumors of coming layoffs last December , she was n't too concerned .
She 'd already survived so much .
But even Loo could n't make it through this recession .
" When it did happen , " she says , " it was something of a shock .
I had been there so long I was n't worried . "
Yet when she thought about it , Loo understood why it happened ; though she 'd had good performance reviews , there were two people working with the same engineering team , and it could be managed by one .
She also realized that this unexpected jolt may actually have been the kind of push she 'd needed all along to rethink what she really wanted out of life .
" One of my biggest fears was becoming too complacent , " she says .
" And this forces me to not be that way . "
As a first - generation American ( her parents are from Hong Kong and Southern China , ) Loo and her family have always valued economic security .
Her mother ran a dry cleaning store on the ground floor of the San Francisco house she grew up in and also taught Chinese school , and her father was a lithographer .
So Loo worried about telling her family what had happened , deciding to wait until after the holidays to break the news .
" I thought [ my mother ] would pressure me right away to find something , " she says .
As it turned out , her mom saw the news of the Adobe layoffs on television , and rather than getting upset , was " very supportive and encouraging .
She said do n't worry , you 're a smart girl , and if at anytime you run into problems , just let us know .
It was a huge relief . "
Financially , Loo is in good shape ; single , with a small mortgage and no credit card debt , she 'll collect a few months ' severance .
She has decided to take a two - week trip to Asia with a friend to clear her head before starting her job search in earnest and getting a project manager certification , an optional credential that she thinks will help her chances .
Yet Loo is also realistic ; at the one interview she 's had , the recruiter said he 'd received hundreds of resumes .
She thinks that it will take at least four to six months to get a new job in her field .
And if that does n't work , Loo has a Plan B ; get a job teaching English for a year , preferably in Japan , where she 's studied the language .
It 's something she 's always wanted to do - and now , she thinks it might be a great time to get out of town .
" I 've told myself that if by the end of the summer I do n't find something here I might go ahead , and hopefully come back with a new perspective , " she says .
Getting laid off could lead to the best experience of her life .
After an eight - month search :
You 're hired !
Jessica Pfeiffer , 35 , Detroit
This is a story with a happy ending , but the conclusion is not the most important point .
It 's how Jessica Pfeiffer , who job - hunted for eight months , decided to spend her time .
There 's not much that she did n't try .
The attorney offered pro bono services , taught a law - school class , served as a board member for two nonprofits , was a guest blogger , a tutor , and a babysitter .
In between she called employers , submitted r�sum�s , and handed out business cards by the hundreds .
" I viewed my search as a job , " she says .
It was n't an easy one .
She heard every kind of rejection , including a novel variation on the " you 're overqualified " rebuff : " Your experience is too sophisticated for this marketplace . "
It was demoralizing , but she plowed ahead .
" You have to be willing to excuse rudeness , " she says .
" When you 're calling someone and they 're not responding , you are probably not in the top 100 most important things on their mind . "
By night Pfeiffer made the rounds of professional gatherings .
" Sometimes I had to gear myself up , " she admits , " especially for the ones I had to pay for .
I 'd think ,
Do I really want to drive 45 minutes and pay $ 25 to drink with lawyers ?
It 's not easy when everyone knows you 're not working . "
A Duke Law School grad , Pfeiffer worked for three companies in nine years with postings as diverse as London and Dallas .
Then , in 2006 , a recruiter called about a position at Comerica Bank in Detroit .
Pfeiffer jumped at the offer to work in her hometown .
But just nine months later Comerica announced it was relocating - to Dallas .
She decided she could n't go back .
So she went in a new direction , running a Labor Department grant program to promote entrepreneurship .
At the end of a year , she figured the program could survive without her .
" They could get someone a lot less expensive than me , " she says .
In her job search , Pfeiffer 's most successful connection came through volunteer work .
She had already interviewed at the Clark Hill law firm when , while working on the Obama campaign , she met an attorney who was training poll watchers .
He turned out to be a senior member of the Clark Hill executive committee that would vote on her new position .
The two worked together again answering phones on Election Day .
" I do n't think I was as nervous about the idea that every minute is a job interview as I was about winning the election , " says Pfeiffer .
" But clearly I wanted to make a good impression . "
Evidently she did .
On Jan. 7 , she joined the Clark Hill law firm as manager of professional development , where she 'll help young attorneys shape their careers .
" I finally have business cards I did n't make myself .
And I 've already been on my first business trip , " she says , as if her trek to Grand Rapids was the sweetest assignment of all .
" It feels so good to be back in the working world . "
JOAN CAPLIN and BETH KOWITT contributed to this article .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Global institutional investors holding more than $ 6 trillion in assets pushed policymakers Tuesday to quickly hash out a binding agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions and promote clean technology .
More than 130 big investors , including London Pensions Fund Authority , want countries to agree to reduce the climate - warming emissions by 50 percent to 80 percent by 2050 .
Those numbers are in line with global warming policy favored by U.S. President - elect Barack Obama , who supports an 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by mid-century .
The investors also want policymakers to set long and medium term emission reduction targets for developed countries and to provide for an expanded and more liquid global carbon market .
Already big U.S. investors , such as the California Public Employees ’ Retirement System , with $ 185.6 billion of assets under management , have been calling for legislation to promote new and existing clean technologies .
They have also called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to force publicly traded companies to disclose climate - related risks along with other factors that affect their business .
“ As institutional investors , we are concerned with the risks presented by climate change to the global economy and to our diversified portfolios , ” said Mike Taylor , chief executive of London Pensions Fund Authority .
“ We are ... urging world leaders to implement strong and effective policies to support us in allocating capital toward low carbon investments . ”
The group of global investors want countries to sign on to a new binding agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol climate pact , which set binding targets for industrialized countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions .
The European Union is aiming to cut greenhouse gas emissions 20 percent by 2020 and increase the share of wind , solar , hydro , wave power and biofuels in their energy mix by the same date .
The United States is alone among major industrialized countries in rejecting the Kyoto Protocol , but is participating in discussions to craft a follow - up global agreement .
“ It is time to put an agreement in place where the United States is involved , ” said Mindy Lubber , the president of Ceres , a coalition of investors and environmental groups working on climate change issues .
The global group of investors is hoping its voice is heard ahead of a December climate change convention in Poland .
“ Polio vaccination is effective in first three months of the year when virus transmission is lowest and so there is no interference with the vaccine virus , ” said Dr Abid .
Recently , Amazon released their Fire TV Stick product in India , together with a special voice remote feature .
You can plug the Stick into a TV set that is compatible , so that you can surf for more content on Prime Video , Netflix and other options on your regular TV .
But what is the difference between this and the Google Chromecast 2 ?
Amazon Fire TV Stick
One of the best advantages that comes with the Amazon Fire TV Stick is the fact that it comes together with lots of apps .
These are useful if you want to stream some content on your own old TV .
It is quite small ( 3.4×1.2×0.5 inches ) and it ’s 32g heavy .
It runs on a MediaTek 1.3 GHz CPU , paired with a Mali 450 GPU .
Moreover , it offers 8 GB storage for apps and games , plus 1 GB RAM .
It also offers free cloud storage for Amazon content , and it is available for the price of Rs 3,999 .
Google Chromecast 2
Meanwhile , the Chromecast device allows you to stream whatever content you need straight from your smartphone and tablet However , for this you will need an Android phone , since for the iOS not all apps are available .
Moreover , on iOS you have to download the Google Home app .
It measures 51.9×51.9×13.49 mm , and the power cable is 1.75 mm long .
The Chromecast is 39.1 grams heavy and it includes a Wi - fi 802.11 ac connection .
The power supply charger is a 5V , 1A one , coming with a micro-USB .
It costs Rs 3,399 .
Conclusion
Both streamers are great devices , even though they are quite different .
The Chromecast is indeed cheaper , but it depends on your smartphone .
Amazon does n’t depend on your smartphone , plus it has some deals for free data at the moment , which might attract lots of users .
If you 're a Time Warner Cable subscriber who has been having trouble with your Internet service lately , the company wants you to know why .
In a letter to Ars , Jeff Simmermon , the director for Digital Communications at TWC , told us , " We 've been having serious service problems in SoCal related to hacker activity . "
The company has posted an official statement on the issue with a few more details , but the culprits ' identities are as yet unknown ( or being kept out of the public while the situation is under investigation . )
In its official statement , Time Warner Cable states that the attacks have been occurring over the past seven days and that they have caused customer DNS queries to repeatedly time out .
The company 's statements refer to these outages as " sporadic timeouts which appeared to be random events , " implying that it took corporate IT time to ascertain the malicious intent behind these seemingly random failures .
These sort of attacks are scarcely news to any major ISP , but Time Warner admits that the problem this time around has been both larger and more difficult to control .
As of February 24 , the ISP claims to have deployed additional early detection and response capabilities , but declined to offer additional details on how the new systems function or if they closed any newly discovered loophole that allowed this attack on the ISP to occur .
Boilerplate advice follows : customers who want to reduce their chance of being infected by malware or zombified by a botnet should update their antivirus scanner and / or deploy some sort of firewall .
The standard " we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you " concludes the statement .
Kudos to TWC for stepping up and admitting the existence and scope of the problem — better to tell your customers there is an issue rather than let them sit around pulling out their hair .
If the ISP really wants to make a good impression it could pro-rate the monthly bill for those customers who were effectively knocked offline for significant amounts of time , but TWC 's apology may not extend into actual service compensation .

" The idea is for the Obama family to plant an organic vegetable garden on part of the White House lawn , with the cultivated veggies going to the White House kitchen and any overflow going to feed those in need , " Roger Doiron , the man behind the petition , said .
Scientists Invent Floatiest Material On Earth
Bugs that skate on water can do it because their feet are “ superhydrophobic . ”
Chinese scientists applied a similar coating to a tiny copper mesh boat , and suddenly it could hold three times the weight .
It ’s actually crazy :
The superhydrophobic coating — what the scientists are casually calling “ the cooperative effect of hierarchical micro / nanostructures and a low - surface - energy wax coating ” — creates a cushion of air around the boat ( or the bug ’s leg ) , putting an invisible bubble between it and the water .
The boat is literally floating on air , while the water tries to touch it but can’t .
What ’s creepy is that the coated boats sink immediately when immersed in organic liquids like ethanol and acetone .
Now that these scientists discovered ways to make super - buoyant objects , what can be done ?
They predict a new era of “ novel superfloating and drag - reducing aquatic devices , ” by which they mean , either cybernetic death from the sea , or the biggest , sleekest , craziest yacht you ’ll ever only see pictures of because you wo n’t even know people who know people who will be able to afford it .
[ American Chemical Society – Thanks Michael ! ]
A woman who went to the cinema to watch a movie says she was " treated like a criminal . "
First of all cinema staff searched her looking for camming equipment , but found candy instead which they demanded she turn over .
She refused and would n't leave the building when told to either , despite the security guards .
Is it any wonder that the movie and music industries are earning themselves more and more enemies and losing loyal customers every day ?
Not content with sueing the life out of anyone they feel is a threat to their business , they also have almost unparalleled skill in alienating paying customers too .
According to a report , a woman from the north of England went to the cinema along with her sister to watch the Ben Affleck and Jennifer Anniston movie “ He ’s Just Not That Into You ” .
Upon arriving at Cineworld in Stockport , Greater Manchester , ‘ Sue ’ and her sister were subjected to a search of their belongings by staff who were looking for ‘ camming ’ equipment .
However , although they failed to find any such hardware , the staff did come across something of serious concern – a bag of milk chocolate Revels .
“ I had a packet of Revels and this is where the whole situation started , ” Sue told BBC Radio Manchester .
Going on , she explained that staff ordered her to hand over the chocolates and said she could collect them after the show , but “ out of principle ” she refused .
And quite rightly so – who do these people think they are ?
Followed by the duty manager and two security guards , Sue was told to leave the premises , despite being a paying customer .
When she refused the manager said , “ Well , I ’m going to have to call the police – is that what you want me to do ? ”
Sue replied “ Yes , please do .
That ’s a good idea . ”
The manager failed to reappear with the police but wo n’t have any trouble with Sue in future as she says she will not return to the cinema .
For their part , cinema staff said that selling food and drinks to customers is a part of the profit - making in the business , hence the action against Sue and her sister .
Clearly ‘ discretion ’ and ‘ customer service ’ are alien concepts to these people .
TorrentFreak has been unsuccessful in finding any torrent sites that treat their users like this , but we ’ll keep looking .

Even Ralph Macchio hates the new Karate Kid !!!
January 20th , 2009 under Stupid Sequels / Remakes
The only Karate Kid , in my eyes , has spoken out to MTV about the stupid idea that they are remaking the movie that made him a superstar and he like me wants to wax off the film !
" It feels pretty good that some people are pretty angry that they 're trying to remake The Karate Kid .. it feels good that the public feels you do n't touch certain things .
Some times you go back to that well , and probably should n't . ''
“ From my personal view , the filling the void of what Mr. Miyagi was – and the magic of that character – is going to be the toughest task . "
Macchio however did have some words of praise for 11 - year - old Jaden .
" Listen , here ’s my take on it .
I think Jaden – you know , Will Smith ’s kid – the kid ’s got chops .
He ’s young ; he ’s like eleven … That story will work forever , when well - told .
So , it makes sense in that respect . ”
Let 's hope that the right people hear us angry fans and do n't make the new Karate Kid movie , but since Will Smith 's name is attached sadly we will be stuck with this movie that will destroy the Karate Kid name .
And from the sounds of the plot of the remake , it has very little to do with the Ralph Macchio classic .
So I say scrap the Karate Kid name and just make a stand alone karate movie .
BTW Ralph Macchio is at Sundance promoting his upcoming movie Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead which I can’t wait to see him in .

Public interest groups are calling on the CRTC to put a stop to the controversial practice known as bandwidth throttling -- the deliberate slowing down of Internet speeds by telecom companies .
By Monday , more than 5,000 web users had submitted complaints about the practice through SaveOurNet.ca , a web community focused on promoting net neutrality -- keeping online traffic free of corporate interference .
Monday marks the final day that the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission , which regulates Canada 's broadcasting and communications industries , will accept public input on the issue .
The body plans to make a ruling later this year .
Several of the country 's largest Internet providers , including Bell and Rogers , have admitted to " traffic management " during peak hours .
SaveOurNet.ca's
Steve Anderson and his organization 's thousands of supporters believe telecommunications companies should not have the right to control the way their subscribers use the Internet .
" You can think of it like a telephone .
If you want to call someone , you do n't want the telephone provider to be telling you which people to call , or be put on a waiting list because you want to call someone in Toronto .
" You pay for access to the phone system and it works .
If you want to access something that 's online , you do n't want ( the phone companies ) picking and choosing which content you can view . "
Bell says a small number of customers use a majority of the available bandwidth .
Spokesperson Jacqueline Michelis told CP24.com that if high - use customers are n't capped , speeds will be slower for all of their customers using the Internet during peak times .
" It is a small proportion of users that are using more than 50 per cent of the bandwidth , " Michelis said in a phone interview on Friday .
" During peak hours we shape the traffic so that it flows fairly for everybody .
It is actually making it more equitable because it's not slowing it down for everybody . "
A spokesperson for Rogers said their company was too busy preparing their submission for the CRTC to speak with CP24 .
Telus is one of few large Internet providers that does not manage traffic , according to documents recently submitted to the CRTC .
Anderson believes the Internet 's egalitarian nature has been the backbone of its success and says muzzling the sharing of information does everyone a disservice .
United States President Barack Obama has already voiced strong support for net neutrality , as has Michael Copps , the new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , the American equivalent of the CRTC .
Anderson believes businesses seeking the free exchange of information online -- such as those that depend on teleconferencing services such as Skype -- will be less likely to launch in Canada due to an environment where providers are allowed to manage web traffic .
" This is an issue between a few big telecom companies and the rest of Canada , " says Anderson .
" Other than those large companies , there 's no one else who wants to see the Internet get throttled .
" My hope is that the CRTC will see that it's in the public interest to have access to an open Internet in terms of free speech , consumer choice and economic development . "
The next step of the process is a public hearing on the issue set for July 6 in Gatineau , Quebec .
Speculation is once again running rampant as to how Twitter will make money .
Earlier this week , the company threw its support behind ExecTweets , a mashup of sorts that aggregates Tweets from top executives that is sponsored by Microsoft and the brainchild of ad network Federated Media .
Meanwhile , today Twitter once again indicated that paid accounts are in the works , telling The Wall Street Journal that they are “ watching the outside initiatives closely as it prepares to launch its own fee - based services this year . ”
Those outside initiatives include the likes of Glam Media 's integration of " filtered Tweets , " and our very own Twitter Brand Sponsors at Mashable .
Adding to the mix , developers of applications for Twitter are beginning to experiment with their own business models too .
TwitterCounter charges users looking for more followers for front page placement , while stock market analysis community StockTwits today announced its own intentions for eventually launching premium services , a smart move considering the already large market for investment research .
So how do Twitter ’s money - making ambitions fit into this mix ?
I think “ watching outside initiatives ” is exactly what Twitter should be doing , considering they have plenty of cash in the bank .
As for what users will be willing to pay for , early signs point to activities that will get their brand a larger following on Twitter , which can correlate directly to more traffic and business .
A combination of analytics and pure - play sponsorship and advertising seems likely , very similar to the way Facebook allows brands to setup Pages for free , then buy ads to promote them to a very specific subset of users while tracking performance with the Facebook Insights platform .
The beauty of Twitter is that it ’s opt - in , so while such a program might sound like “ selling out ” on the surface , you can ignore ads and brand accounts to your heart ’s content , if that ’s the direction Twitter goes in .
In any event , the transition will be fascinating to watch .

Colbert Skewers President While Neutered News Media Gape Posted by Pile ( 7517 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ News Media ] The White House Correspondents ' Association Dinner was televised on C - Span Saturday evening .
Featured entertainer Stephen Colbert delivered a biting rebuke of George W. Bush and the lily - livered press corps .
He did it to Bush 's face , unflinching and unbowed by the audience 's muted , humorless response .
Click here for the " must see " video !
On Colbert 's gutsy delivery , watertiger writes , " Stephen Colbert displayed more guts in ten minute of performance at the White House Correspondents Dinner than the entire Bush family .
He , along with the ever - feisty Helen Thomas , deftly exposed the " truthiness " to the world ( or at least those who were watching ) that Bush AND the D.C. press corps are indeed a naked emperor and his gutless courtiers . "
Mash at dKos says , " Standing at the podium only a few feet from President Bush , Colbert launched an all out assault on the policies of this Administration .
It was remarkable , though painful at times , to watch .
It may also have been the first time that anyone has been this blunt with this President .
By the end of Colbert 's routine , Bush was visibly uncomfortable .
Colbert ended with a video featuring Helen Thomas repeatedly asking why we invaded Iraq .
That is a question President Bush has yet to answer to the American public .
I am not sure what kind of review Stephen Colbert 's performance will get in the press .
One thing is however certain - his performance was important and will reverberate . "
It appears Mash 's misgivings about press coverage are well - placed .
The AP 's first stab at it and pieces from Reuters and the Chicago Tribune tell us everything we need to know : Colbert 's performance is sidestepped and marginalized while Bush is treated as light - hearted , humble , and funny .
Expect nothing less from the cowardly American media .
The story could just as well have been Bush and Laura 's discomfort and the crowd 's semi-hostile reaction to Colbert 's razor - sharp barbs .
In fact , I would guess that from the perspective of newsworthiness and public interest , Bush - the - playful - president is far less compelling than a comedy sketch gone awry , a pissed - off prez , and a shell - shocked audience .
This is the power of the media to choose the news , to decide when and how to shield Bush from negative publicity .
Sins of omission can be just as bad as sins of commission .
And speaking of a sycophantic media establishment bending over backwards to accommodate this White House and to regurgitate pro-GOP and anti-Dem spin , I urge readers to pick up a copy of Eric Boehlert 's new book , Lapdogs .
It 's a powerful indictment of the media 's timidity during the Bush presidency .
Boehlert rips away the facade of a " liberal media " and exposes the invertebrates masquerading as journalists who have allowed and enabled the Bush administration 's many transgressions to go unchecked , under - reported , or unquestioned .

The weather in Atlanta felt like Spring this weekend , which got me thinking about our Spring garden and , of course , our compost bin .
Composting is a fabulous , cheap source of fertile soil .
On top of that , keeping a compost bin prevents your food scraps from heading to the landfill where they break down and produce methane , a more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2 .
While some communities , like San Francisco , offer curbside composting , unfortunately however , most do not .
Luckily , it ’s really easy to get your own bin going !
Whether you ’re living in a house or an apartment , there are great composting solutions out there .
Here ’s a roundup of some options , so you can have your compost ready in time to get that Spring garden going !
Composting Basics
No matter what scale bin you ’ve got , there are a few basic things to keep in mind .
Ideally , you ’ll fill your bin with plant matter , like vegetable leavings from cooking , and you can toss in egg shells , too .
Most bins do n’t do well if you mix in meat or dairy products or anything fatty .
That stuff tends to turn rancid , which is no good .
Your typical compost bin needs to be turned or stirred from time to time to help everything break down .
With those basics in mind , let ’s take a look at some different bins for houses and apartments !
Back Yard Composting
If you have a house with a back yard , you might think about keeping your bin outside .
We have a glass bowl in the kitchen to collect food scraps which we just dump into the bin every few days .
If you want to keep it simple , you can do an outdoor bin using a few stakes surrounded with chicken wire .
Wiki How has another DIY compost bin option .
For a basic bin , you ’ll want to layer “ brown matter , ” like dried leaves , over the food scraps to help things break down .
If you ’re good about turning it , you should have usable compost within 2 - 3 months !
Back yard composting can be as costly or inexpensive as you want it to be .
If you ’ve got some spare cash , check out this awesome Tumbler compost bin over at Clean Air Gardening !
Instead of using a shovel or pitchfork to turn your bin , you just spin the crank .
It also collects “ compost tea ” at the bottom , which is great for adding nutrients to soil .
Apartment Composting
Apartment dwellers , do n’t despair !
Composting might seem like something you ca n’t do without an outdoor space to store a bin , but that ’s not true at all .
If you ’re willing to give up a little bit of space under the sink or on top of the fridge , you too can keep your food scraps out of the landfill !
Even if you do n’t have plants that need the compost , you can dump that good , nutrient - rich dirt outside to give some neighborhood greenery a boost !
You might look into a bokashi bin , for your composting needs .
Bokashi is a mixture of “ effective microorganisms , ” ( EM ) usually in some sort of medium like wheat bran .
After you add your food scraps to your bokashi bin , you sprinkle the mixture on top .
The EM helps break down the food scraps .
If managed properly , the bin will have no smell at all !
Most bokashi bins also collect compost tea , which you can drain out of a spout on the bottom and use as fertilizer .
If bokashi is n’t your speed , you might give vermi-composting a shot !
Barb Finnin from Freshtopia explains how to get this setup going :
You can find the red wigglers online .
Bait shops sometimes carry them for fishing , too .
The worms tend to multiply , so after a while , you can help your friends start their own worm bins with your excess wigglers !
Do you already have a compost bin in your house or apartment ?
Please share your composting experiences !
Editor 's Note :
This article originally appeared in Spektrum , and has been translated from German .
We are publishing it as part of our tribute to Charles Darwin on his 200th birthday .
Before marriage , Charles Darwin had confessed everything to her .
That he was in the process of rewriting the history of life .
That , according to his convictions , all living things descended from a common ancestor .
And that species were not to be attributed to God 's endless creativity , but were the product of a blind , mechanical process that altered them over the course of millions of years .
This alone was pure heresy .
Darwin even nursed doubts about the very survival of human beings .
And this man , who had gone around the world once , and was going to marry Emma Wedgwood , did not believe a single word of the biblical story of creation .
" Reason tells me that honest and conscientious doubts cannot be a sin , " wrote the deeply religious Emma to her betrothed in a cautioning letter in November 1838 .
" But I felt that it would be a painful rift between us . "
Charles was supposed to find his way back to the right faith by reading the Bible : " I implore you to read the parting words of our Savior to his apostles , beginning at the end of the 13th chapter of the Gospel according to John , " she wrote .
But for Charles Darwin there was no turning back .
He definitely assured Emma in his reply that he would take her concern seriously .
But in fact he was experimenting at that time with all kinds of heretic theories .
" Love of godhood is a result of intellectual organization , oh you materialist ! " he confided to himself in revolutionary words in his secret notebook .
And although his theories were not yet mature , he was completely aware of their explosive nature :
By dissociating intellect and morality from god 's power of creation , and attributing them instead to self - evolving forces , Darwin undermined the very foundations of a society shaped by the Anglican Church , with its hopes of eternal life and the omnipresent threat of punishment .
" As soon you realize that one species could evolve into another , the whole structure wobbles and collapses , " he remarked .
And if man were nothing but a superior animal , where would that leave his spiritual dignity ?
And if he himself is the product of evolution , then what about his moral accountability to God ?
Believe only what is proved
" Charles ' confession was a big shock for Emma , " explains the science historian John van Wyhe from the University of Cambridge .
" On the other hand , he impressed her with his openness and honesty .
Nothing would have hurt her more badly than the feeling that her future husband was keeping secrets from her . "
But Emma 's worries over the well - being of Charles 's soul could not come in the way of her wedding at the end of January 1839 .
His habit of " never believing anything till it is proven " had apparently prevented him from " taking into account other things that cannot be proved in the same manner , and which , if they are true , would probably go far beyond our power of imagination , " she complained in another letter .
Emma 's worst fear was that Charles was forfeiting his salvation through his religious disbelief , and this threatened to separate them in death .
Her letter was to go unanswered .
" Charles respected Emma 's faith and probably kept his religious doubts to himself , " van Wyhe says .
The man from the English town of Shrewsbury , northwest of Birmingham , had drawn his theories from it .
His wife 's reactions had shown him how difficult it was to convince other people of his ideas :
The criticism would be devastating were he to publish his theories without adequate proof ; and his scientific career would be ruined .
If he wanted his theories to be accepted , he would have to leave the tricky " issue of apes " on the periphery and write only about how oranges or animals changed gradually .
And he would need collaborators , respected naturalists who would stand by his side — scholars like Charles Lyell , whose Principles of Geology had given him important intellectual stimuli .
He had collected enough facts .
Charles Darwin had spent five long years in the remotest corners of the Earth and observed , described and dissected with inexhaustible meticulousness .
But his proud booty was to reveal its secrets only gradually ; small bits of a puzzle that fell into place slowly , forming a larger , overall picture , and gave shape gradually to his theory of the evolution of species .
" The journey on the Beagle was , by far , the most important event in my life , and shaped my whole career , " Darwin once said , looking back on his time on board the ship .
In August 1831 the British Admiralty was looking for a young gentleman to provide company for Capt .
Robert Fitzroy , a small , dark haired man with fine features and an aristocratic arrogance during his long mission .
The HMS Beagle was supposed to chart the South American coast on its survey journey .
" You are exactly the person they are looking for , " the old botany professor John Stevens Henslow wrote to his former student , the 22 - year - old Darwin .
Fitzroy wanted a natural scientist as companion , because this would mean unprecedented opportunities for him to engage in research on the extended stopovers on land .
The ship was equipped for scientific research ; a man of " commitment and intelligence could do wonders , " Henslow gushed .
Darwin was indeed not a full - fledged natural scientist , but he could still make up for this deficit by taking along some books .
The young man plunged into the preparations as if electrified , and in all haste : the journey was to begin soon .
It was the chance of a lifetime .
But sober reality did n't dawn on him until after the Beagle set out from Plymouth , shortly after Christmas in 1831 .
If only he had listened to his father !
Robert Waring Darwin had been against Charles 's feverishly embraced the adventure , right from the start .
Another of these useless ideas that had gotten into this fickle son's head — further proof of his aimlessness .
The aspiring natural scientist had abandoned his study of medicine , and the homeless years in the company of rough seamen were going to ruin him completely .
It was only the appeal of an uncle that persuaded the elder Darwin to consent .
But after just three days on rough seas , the aspiring natural scientist was already yearning for the soft meadows of his Shropshire home , on the Wales border .
Even a lonely parish in the country would have been an utterly welcome prospect to him now : firm land beneath the feet , above all !
All day he could not hold down anything but rusks ( breads ) and raisins or , if even these repulsed him , glögg ( spiced wine ) , offset with sago .
And when he tried to stand up in his tiny cabin , he almost knocked himself out cold .
From the deck , he could hear the shrill voices of four crewmen , who were being punished by Fitzroy with a total of 134 lashes for their Christmas escapades .
" Before the journey , I used to say often that I was certainly going to thoroughly regret the whole enterprise , " he wrote in his dairy that day .
" But I had never thought how vehemently I was going to do so . "
Fitzroy , who swore by physiognomy ( judging character based on outward appearance ) , had also known it all along : Darwin 's nose pointed to a deficiency in energy and resoluteness ; his knowledge of people indicated that this young gentleman was never going to make it till the end of the journey .
Chaos of rapture
And how wrong he was !
Once the Beagle reached the South American coast on the 28th of February 1832 , Darwin became enraptured by what seemed to him to be paradise .
While the crew chartered and plotted the harbor of Salvador in the Baía de Todos os Santos ( the Bay of All Saints ) , Darwin wandered in astonishment through the Brazilian rainforest , caught in the " chaos of rapture , " completely bewitched by its wealth of vegetation .
" The landscape in Brazil is like looking into a Thousand and One Nights , with the advantage that this is real , " he wrote in his diary .
Resting in a shaded spot , he listened to the humming , squeaking and pulsating life around him .
He heard parakeets screeching , saw hitherto unimagined varieties of orchids and anthills standing more than 10 feet ( three meters ) tall .
Not a single bizarre detail seemed to escape the young researcher :
He once discovered a spider that preyed on alien webs and played dead and fell down if it sensed danger .
Then he came across a wasp that stung caterpillars and used them as food for its own larvae in its nest of loam .
" And imagine , " he cried out after having shot a particularly magnificent lizard , " calling a pleasure such as this duty ! " but the journey had some more surprises waiting .
In the bay of Punta Alta in Argentina , Darwin chiseled out the fossilized bones of a colossal protozoan from the cliffside .
Beside himself with joy , he lugged the valuable find on board the Beagle .
The booty , scorned by Captain Fitzroy as " a box full of useless stuff , " was to make him famous later .
There was only one comparable specimen in England at that time .
When he returned to the site a few months later , he was able to free from the cliff almost the complete skeleton of a bizarre mammal , the size of a horse , with an enormous pelvis and a narrow , long face , resembling that of an anteater .
" Formerly , this place must have been teeming with large monsters " , he recorded later in his travel log .
But why did they die out ?
And why were the extinct giants so similar to the animals now found in South America , except for their size ?
Darwin began to ask questions .
The gauchos told him about a unique variety of a South American bird called a rhea , smaller and darker than usual in form .
Very few had seen one , but their nests had been found , and everyone confirmed that it was found more frequently farther south .
After a long search , he found the unique creature : on his plate for dinner !
Incredible : he had finally found the unique bird and almost eaten it inadvertently !
Fortunately , it was still possible to save the " head , neck , legs and one wing , " and some large feathers ; they were conserved promptly and stacked away in the hold .
Why is a type of ostrich found only in North Patagonia , and the others are found only in the south ?
Why did the Almighty have to create two such closely related species , whose environments hardly differed ?
In the beginning of the year 1835 the Beagle reached the coast of Chile .
After a morning ramble through nature , Darwin was stretched on the ground when it began to shake .
" The Earth — the epitome of firmness , " the natural scientist wrote , trembled under his feet " like the crust on a liquid . "
It was only in the following days that the terrifying dimension of the catastrophe that lasted about two minutes , became evident to Darwin as the Beagle sailed up the long Chilean coast .
" The entire coast was strewn with balconies and household objects , as if a thousand ships had been stranded " , he reported .
The city of Concepción at the foot of the Andes offered a terrible scene : " The ruins were so scattered and the whole scene had so little of anything akin to a habitable place , that it was barely possible to still imagine the earlier state . "
The inhabitants spoke of the worst earthquake mankind had ever known .
The shock waves had reached Concepción , " rumbling like distant thunder " ; fires had broken out everywhere .
Those who had managed to salvage their material possessions were living in fear of plunderers .
And then the wave came : a tsunami , taller than 20 feet ( six meters ) , broke over the city .
Innumerable people drowned or were washed away .
Once he had recovered from the initial shock , the young researcher went looking for the cause of the quake .
The local people along the coast told him about a shallow edged by cliffs , which was earlier covered completely by water , but had become exposed after the earthquake .
And on the island of Santa Maria , barely 30 miles ( 50 kilometers ) or so away , he came across fresh banks of mollusks just above the flood line , which had already begun to rot away .
The land must have heaved just a few meters away !
That was the unequivocal evidence for the hypotheses postulated by Charles Lyell in his " Principles of Geology " : mountains such as the Andes had not been formed in one colossal upheaval , but grew , barely perceptibly , over the course of millions of years , as the result of countless small quakes , to which Darwin had just been a witness .
But had not the Archbishop of Armagh , James Ussher , calculated in 1658 the Earth 's age accurate to the day ?
Accordingly , god must have created our planet on the night preceding October 23 , 4004 B.C. on the Julian calendar .
Cultivated part of hell
Toward the middle of the year the Beagle left behind the South American continent and set sail for the Galápagos islands , where the crew came upon a cheerless scenario : " A jagged field of [ irregular or wavelike layers of ] black , basaltic lava pockmarked with huge fissures , and covered everywhere with stunted , sun -burnt brushwood , " Darwin complained in his report .
The land , overheated by the midday sun , lent the sweltering air a closed and oppressive feeling , like an oven ; and it smelled very unpleasant .
Countless crabs and iguanas ran helter - skelter in all directions as the new arrivals clambered from cliff to cliff , " like one might imagine the cultivated part of hell , " Darwin wrote .
The birds were not afraid of human beings and were very tame ; where was the joy of hunting , then ?
Conscious of duty , he added the animals to his collection .
He thought he had collected wrens , finches , black and spotted thrushes .
But the forms of the beaks puzzled him : some were thick and strong , like those of the grosbeaks , others , on the contrary , were thin like those of songbirds .
But he did not stop to figure out which bird came from which island .
It was too late when Darwin realised that he had missed an opportunity .
Shortly after departure , the vice governor of the English penal colony at the Galápagos Islands told him that each of the colossal turtles that were native to these islands could be assigned to its respective island of origin , based on the appearance of its shell .
In other words , the turtles of those islands were unique variants , perhaps even separate species ; Darwin had already suspected something similar for the plants .
Could it possibly be true for the birds as well ?
It was no longer possible to discover the truth , because his specimens were not adequately labeled and the Beagle was already on its way home across the Pacific .
On October 1836 the ship reached England .
Barely had he touched shore when Darwin handed over the birds from the Galápagos to the renowned ornithologist John Gould .
The latter was not too bothered about how the bills had evolved on the birds .
In the case of the spotted thrushes , Darwin had suspected that they were distinct varieties ( ranks below that of a species ) .
Gould , however , found that these were in fact three new species , closely related to the species that are native to the South American continent .
Darwin had made another mistake : Gould recognised that what were supposed to be black thrushes and wrens were also types of finches .
They were so unique that he later put them under a new group of finches that consisted of 14 species , each of which had its own ecological niche on the Galápagos .
Was it possible that something similar applied to the species Darwin had originally classified as finches as well ?
Darwin contacted Captain Fitzroy , whose crew members had put together their own collections , and had been more conscientious in labeling them .
And indeed , like in the case of the thrushes , every island had its own species of finch !
Had God created separate kinds of birds for each island ?
Darwin had his doubts .
In his notebook , he speculated on the uniqueness of animals : Darwin 's finches now no longer lived in the 6,000 - year - old world created by God in seven days , but on an archipelago that must have risen , not too long ago , at least in geologic terms , from the Pacific .
Once they had appeared , birds from the South American continent could have reached the group of islands .
Over generations , the animals changed and adapted themselves to their respective environments , finding their way into as yet unoccupied ecological niches .
In his notebook , he drew a branched genealogical tree showing how old species gradually evolve into new ones , or else they would die out , like the large mammals that Darwin had chiseled out of the stone in Patagonia .
In his thoughts , he slowly came closer to the question of the origin of humans .
At the London Zoo he studied the latest attraction , a female orangutan called Jenny .
In her face he recognised traits that babies also have .
" Man from monkey ? " he asked himself in his notes .
Idea of natural selection
Now the young researcher stood on the threshold of heresy .
While he made preparations for his wedding , Darwin also looked for the mechanisms through which species underwent change .
One evening he came across the bleak book An Essay on the Principle of Population written by the British economist Thomas Robert Malthus ( 1766 to 1834 ) .
In it , Malthus showed why the population was destined to explode in the course of a few years unless checked by hunger catastrophes or epidemics .
His calculations were simple :
Whereas the sources of food followed an arithmetic progression ( 1 , 2 , 3 , … ) , the rate of propagation followed a geometric one ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , … ) .
" Hence , it can be claimed with certainty that the population will double every 25 years unless controlled " , Malthus concluded .
Darwin immediately drew parallels in the natural world : " Every species must have the same number killed year [ after ] year by hawks and cold and other reasons , even one species of hawk decreasing in number must affect instantaneously all of the rest … .
One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying [ to ] force every kind of adapted structure into the gaps in the economy of nature , or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones . "
The idea of natural selection as the driving force in evolution was thus born .
Accordingly , there is a relentless competition for survival going on in nature .
Some individuals have an advantage because of certain characteristics they possess , which improve their chances of survival in the environment they inhabit .
Hence , their chance of bearing offspring is disproportionately higher so that these characteristics can be passed on from generation to generation .
The changes are no doubt too small to be observable from one generation to the immediate next one , but as a passionate geologist , Darwin was thinking in terms of entirely different timeframes .
" I now had a theory , finally , with which I could work , " he wrote later .
However , it was to take several years until it was published .
Life 's work shattered
One day in June 1858 Darwin received mail from overseas .
The sender , Alfred Russel Wallace , a young and enthusiastic natural scientist who had traveled around the world at his own expense , and earned his livelihood by exporting exotic animals .
Darwin had requested two years earlier the bellows ( lungs ) of pigeons and poultry breeds from the Malayan archipelago ; since then , Wallace had been in touch with the already well known private scholar .
The package , which was collected from the Moluccan island of Ternate , however , did not contain information about Malayan bird species that Darwin had requested , but a scientific manuscript of about 20 pages .
In an accompanying letter , Wallace requested that Darwin to forward the essay to Lyell for publication , if he felt it was significant enough .
He hoped his ideas would contribute to filling the " missing link " in the evolution of species .
As Darwin read the article , he saw his life 's work " shattered " : someone else had pulled ahead of him .
" Wallace could not have prepared a better resume if he had my handwritten draft of 1842 " , he finally wrote , in an embittered missive to Lyell .
Even the vocabulary was the same : Wallace , too , wrote of " variants " that had been eliminated through a " fight for survival " from their original species .
Darwin's comment in response was simple and to the point : " This has destroyed all my originality . "
Charles Lyell was not surprised .
He had urged Darwin time and again in the past to speed up his work , having read an article by a hitherto unheard of researcher that had appeared in a scientific journal that encompassed the essential arguments of the theory advanced by Darwin , and later even by Lyell himself .
But Darwin had ignored the dangers , informing his old teacher that only an extensive tome with appropriate footnotes would be capable of convincing the public of his theory .
Hesitatingly , he had revealed to a few other natural scientists his godless theory , over a period of nearly two decades : " It is as if one were confessing to a murder , " he wrote to his closest confidante , the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker .
And Wallace had even read Malthus 's work .
While he was confined to bed following a serious attack of malaria in Ternate , he applied the overpopulation theory of the British economist to the natural world , around 20 years after Darwin had done the same .
Now , was a rank outsider going to steal the well deserved laurels from the famous natural scientist Charles Darwin ?
Together with Hooker , Lyell hatched a plan that was to go down in the history of biology as a " delicate arrangement " .
Yes , they would publish Wallace 's manuscript , but only along with two extracts from Darwin 's work which would precede the article , so that their priority would be recognizable .
Charles Darwin , who was mourning the death of a son , consented .
" I will do everything I am told to do . "
And even Wallace consented to it after his return .
" Wallace never criticized this arrangement and acknowledged Darwin 's priority , " according to science historian John van Wyhe .
" He acknowledged without envy that he could never have documented the evidence of the mechanisms of evolution so well . "
At a meeting of the Linnaean Society of London on July 1 , 1858 , both works were read without receiving much attention .
The society 's annual report noted that the year 1858 had drawn to an end " without any discoveries that could revolutionize the research disciplines " .
Now out in the open , Darwin did not want to lose any time .
He completed his work in haste .
The day on which the work On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life was published , November 24 , 1859 , started a new epoch in biology .
This time , the response was overwhelming : all 1,250 copies of the book were sold out on the very first day of its appearance .
Under the chairmanship of Henslow , there was confrontation between supporters and opponents on June 30 , 1860 , at the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Oxford .
Darwin himself was ill and could not attend .
Nevertheless , the proceedings were heated .
When Bishop Samuel Wilberforce asked if Darwin 's close friend Thomas Henry Huxley had descended from the apes on his grandfather 's side or his grandmother 's side , he replied : " Had the question been addressed to me , whether I would rather have a miserable ape for a grandfather or a man highly talented by nature and with great influence and importance , but who uses his skills and influence merely for the purpose of bringing in ludicrousness into a serious scientific discussion , then I would without hesitation confirm my preference for the ape . "
Captain Fitzroy burst in on the commotion : Clad in military uniform and holding up a Bible , the former commander of the Beagle swore in the presence of all that he believed more in God than in human beings .
The book published by his travel companion of yore had apparently caused him a lot of pain .
It was not until 1871 that Darwin commented on The Descent of Man , on the origins of our own species .
Eleven years later , he died in his country home near London .
Until the very end , his wife Emma , with whom he had been married happily for 43 years , had watched by his bedside .
Darwin's ideas were to survive , his much quoted prophecy , which was the only place in the On the Origin of Species to give any insight into his own view on whether the " ape question , " was to become true .
It is said there : " Light will fall on the origin of man and his history . "
The data flow is truly horrible , painting a picture of an economy so weakened that it promises to engulf the recently passed stimulus package .
Fiscal authorities will be pushed to do more , and President Barack Obama recognizes the challenges and opportunities presented by this recession .
His recent budget proposal sets the stage for a bitter fight on the magnitude and composition of the government 's role in the macroeconomy .
Monetary policy will also be asked to do even more as well , and the question remains the same as last fall when it became clear the Fed was headed to the zero bound - when will Bernanke & Co. shift gears to an overtly inflationary policy direction ?
When will the focus of policy shift from the asset side of the balance sheet to the liabilities side ?
Last week 's revision to the 4Q08 GDP numbers was a fitting testament to the sad state of economic activity ; the - 6.2 % dive in output is shocking :
The composition of growth also to speaks to the damage to virtually every sector of the economy :
The only meaningful growth came in the form of import compression , a fall in real imports .
To be sure , some import compression was to be expected as the US off - shored some of its domestic weakness , and would be consistent with a rebalancing story .
But to be desirable , the compression would need to be moderate , signaling a softening of domestic demand - not a collapse .
Moreover , the rebalancing story required that export growth offset some of the domestic weakness ; the global meltdown ended that story fast and hard .
Relying on the rest of the world helped Japan stagger through the last two decades ; that support is no longer available to the US - or anyone , for that matter .
Moreover , despite the magnitude of the fourth quarter drop , and the time already spent in recession ( over a year according to the NBER ) , there is no sign that conditions are likely to moderate in the first half of this year ; we are all simply hope that cyclical dynamics wane and that fiscal stimulus meaningful supports growth in the second half of the year .
Note that the January read on durable goods indicates a downtrend in investment that is more consistent with the early stages of a recession , not the latter :
Likewise , one of my current personal favorite charts illustrating the collapse of demand at the end of last year , the inventory to sales ratio :
It is as if a decade 's worth of efforts to improve inventory management disappeared in a single quarter .
Note this indicates that the small inventory accumulation in 4Q08 does not suggest improvement as firms rebuild inventory early this year ; firms clearly need to continue shedding inventory well into 2009 .
Commentators quickly noted the GDP figures were the worst since 1982 .
Normally , that could be seen as comforting ; how much worse can it get ?
Only upside left , right ?
If only that were the case .
First , as I noted above , much of the data we saw at the end of 2008 was typical of an economy just heading into recession , not one that had already be in recession for nearly a year .
The early stages of this recession were so mild they could barely be called a recession ; it was only after the triple collapse of the US consumer , investment spending , and the global economy late in 2008 that the textbook recession dynamics took hold .
Second , not only did those dynamics take hold , they took hold with an unprecedented severity ( at least with respect to the post - war data ) .
And third , unlike 1982 , there is no room left for conventional monetary policy .
This last point is often lost on the general public .
I am often told by some " old - timer " that they remember the early 1980's and how it was much worse , inevitably remarking on the high level of interest rates at that time .
The response , of course , is that with high interest rates , there was amazing room for monetary policy to stimulate activity .
Indeed , high rates in the 1980's provided the room to support a 25 year consumer spending boom that only ended when savings rates finally hit the lower bound :
Which brings me back to the original question - having spent down conventional monetary ammunition over the past 25 years , when does Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke revert to a overtly inflationary policy ?
The answer :
When he no longer believes there is a way to financial engineer the US ( and global ) economies out of the current environment .
Then you are left with only two options - sit back and allow deflationary forces to take hold ( a true liquidationist position ) , or initiate the time honored process for eliminating a debt overhang , inflation .
But Bernanke has not given up hope , audacious though it may seem , that the answer is financial engineering .
Yves Smith noted last week :
... What is amazing is the degree to which Bernanke has been unable to process what has happened over the last year and a half .
It is n't simply that he is trying to restore status quo ante ; he seems to see the only possible operative paradigm as the status quo ante .
Worse , he has a romanticized view of it too .
We had a massive stock market bubble , followed by an even bigger asset orgy , with housing at the epicenter , but plenty of other types got dragged along with it .
Having asset appreciation fueled by debt is NOT how a healthy economy operates .
It is going to take some time for the excesses to work themselves through ...
This reminded me of a Bernanke speech from 2005 :
Some observers have expressed concern about rising levels of household debt , and we at the Federal Reserve follow these developments closely .
However , concerns about debt growth should be allayed by the fact that household assets ( particularly housing wealth ) have risen even more quickly than household liabilities .
Indeed , the ratio of household net worth to household income has been rising smartly and currently stands at 5.4 , well above its long - run average of about 4.8 .
With real disposable income having risen over the past few quarters , most consumers are in good financial shape - - a positive indication for household spending .
One caveat for the future is that the recent rapid escalation in house prices -- 11 percent in 2004 , according to the repeat - transactions index constructed by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight -- is unlikely to continue .
A plausible scenario is that house prices will either move sideways or rise more slowly during the next few years , eventually bringing the rate of return on housing in line with the relatively low prospective rates of return that we currently observe on virtually all assets , both real and financial .
If the increases in house prices begin to moderate as expected , the resulting slowdown in household wealth accumulation should lead ultimately to somewhat slower growth in consumer spending .
Leaving aside the issue of housing prices for a moment , consider the issue of household net worth .
I always feel that academics misinterpret balance sheets , particularly household balance sheets .
Here Bernanke is saying that debt is not a problem because it is matched by an asset of equal or greater value .
Ergo , you have positive net worth , so everything is good .
But that debt needs to be supported by a positive cash flow , and the many assets on household balance sheets generally do not generate cash flow , especially owner occupied housing assets .
This differs from a corporate balance sheet , where the assets are supposed to be combined in some fashion that generates a positive cash flow .
The cash flow that supports most household debt is independent of assets ; it is the result of employment income .
To be sure , perhaps some of those assets support the employment , such as a car .
But even in this case a Toyota Camry performs the same function as a Lexus .
Claiming the latter is necessary for employment is largely a fantasy .
Bernanke praises the power of the household balance sheet , and further supports his contention that households are financially strong by the disposable income growth at the time .
What he missed , however , was the importance of declining savings rates , which were quickly converging on zero .
When saving rates hit zero , free cash flow for households is gone , and without free cash flow , the ability to increase debt diminishes unless either interest rates fall further or we can divorce credit access from ability to repay .
In this speech , Bernanke effectively endorsed the illusion that asset value growth could replace ability to repay for underwriting purposes .
Debt accumulation and thus spending can be supported indefinitely as long as asset values increase .
I suspect that Bernanke still believes his basic framework was correct , even if underwriting conditions loosened more dramatically than desirable .
But with saving rates at zero this system was remarkably vulnerable to negative shocks to the consumer .
This , I believe , is one of two fundamental failures of the Bernanke system .
The first negative shock was the housing slowdown .
Again ignoring the housing price declines , just leveling prices was , as Bernanke indicated , sufficient to limit the debt accumulation that supported additional spending , and left spending to growth at the disappointing pace consistent with income growth .
But income growth was sure to slow as job growth slowed in response to housing and there was little in the way of easily accessible savings to compensate .
In addition , households were hit with a massive energy price shock and , with no room in income left to compensate , spending was forced to drop dramatically .
In short , by minimizing the importance of low saving rates ( a cash flow issue ) and emphasizing the role of increasing asset values ( a balance sheet issue ) , Bernanke fundamentally misunderstood the vulnerability of households to negative shocks to real income .
Now , however , saving rates are positive , albeit still very low by historical standards .
Still , there would be room for economic traction by bringing saving back down to zero .
Harder than it sounds as , unlike 1982 , we have limited room to reduce interest rates to encourage spending .
Moreover , household net worth is now eviscerated by housing and equity price declines , that consumers are cutting back in a desperate struggle to deleverage and rebuild net worth .
It is on this latter point that I believe the economic leadership in the nation still believe there remains possible policy traction .
The collapse in housing prices was the second fundamental blow to the Bernanke framework ; note that an actual decline in housing prices was not in his forecast .
So the key to restoring growth , in the Bernanke framework , lays in restoring housing prices , and asset prices in general .
This is the focus of policy - if we can jump start the debt markets , we can rebuild asset prices , and therefore thereby encourage a rebound in consumer spending .
This is , again , a balance sheet approach to household finances , and ignores the importance of tighter underwriting conditions , not to mention that this approach is limited as , over the longer term , if savings rates were forced back to zero , consumers will be pushed back from one precarious position ( weak economy ) to another ( no savings cushion ) .
Leaving aside those challenges , another problem is the one to which Yves alludes to - the persistent belief that current asset prices are currently " wrong . "
There appears to be little thought given to the likelihood that past prices were " wrong . "
Instead , policymakers appear to believe that prices have intrinsic values .
The trick is to get market participants to recognize those values .
The belief ( delusion ) that the current price is simply wrong is not limited to Bernanke ; it is pervasive among policymakers .
James Kwak directs us to an interview with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , commenting :
The idea that houses have a “ basic inherent economic value ” other than the prices they can fetch in the housing market is , I think , a fallacy .
And so the idea that therefore houses will naturally return to some “ basic inherent economic value ” that is higher than current market prices is , I think , wishful thinking of the kind that has hampered responses to this crisis from the beginning .
They could ; but they could just as well not .
The saddest part of policymakers who cling to the notion of intrinsic housing values is that economists long ago rejected the notion that such prices existed when they rejected the labor theory of value .
Is Bernanke a monetarist , neoclassicalist , or a Marxist ?
Value is determined by a constellation of social conventions at some point in time .
If the social convention is that financing is limited by ability to repay , then cash flow ( largely income ) , not asset appreciation , is the appropriate metric for valuing houses .
" Restarting " the credit markets alone will not alter this convention ; it was the willingness to disregard this convention that was the fundamental failure of credit markets .
This is not meant to imply that restarting credit markets is not a worthy effort .
The opposite is true ; functioning credit markets are important to economic growth ... but functioning likely means a return to conventional underwriting metrics , and thus housing prices will remain depressed .
Indeed , I think a good argument can be made that , under conventional norms , homes price should decrease until mortgage payments are less than the rental equivalent ( after accounting for the hassles and costs of home ownership ) .
Policymakers are assuming that restoring proper functioning in credit markets - and confidence in general - is equivalent to a housing price rebound .
They seem incapable of envisioning a world in which this is not the case .
This tunnel vision prevents policymakers of trying to devise policy which assumes that the many of the assets in the banking system are simply " bad . "
For Bernanke and Geithner , there are no bad assets .
Only misunderstood assets .
And therein lays the key to predicting when the Fed shifts gears ; when Bernanke abandons the notion that proper credit market functioning is alone sufficient to restore housing values ( asset values more generally ) to their former glory and support acceptable growth .
At that point , the Fed will again consider the wisdom of what it has defined as quantitative easing , an expansion of the balance sheet via a deliberate expansion of liabilities .
Until then , we can expect the Fed to continue its focus on financial engineering .

The so - called compromise stimulus bill is being decimated by the " bipartisan working group " that is attempting to remove $ 100 billion from the cost of the bill .
Greg Sargent has obtained an internal Senate memo describing the programs to be cut .
Here is a list of programs to be totally cut :
Total Reductions : $ 80 billion
Eliminations :
Head Start , Education for the Disadvantaged , School improvement ,
Child Nutrition , Firefighters , Transportation Security Administration ,
Coast Guard , Prisons , COPS Hiring , Violence Against Women , NASA , NSF ,
Western Area Power Administration , CDC , Food Stamps

Reductions :
Public Transit $ 3.4 billion , School Construction $ 60 billion
Increases :
Defense operations and procurement , STAG Grants , Brownfields , Additional transportation funding
So as you can see , it is simply more of the same neocon agenda .
More money for the DoD and less for Head Start ( pre-school for poor kids ) , Firefighting , the National Science Foundation , and the food stamp program , which not only helps poor people to eat .
but is also one of the most effective forms of fiscal stimulus we have .
These legislators should be ashamed that they refuse to help the most vulnerable among us .
Anytime they want to cut programs , it is those that we can least afford .

Fuck these people .
They do not have the best interests of our nation at heart .
It is doubtful that they are even capable of seriously legislating our problems any more .
They simply want to prove that they are right , no matter the cost and pain it causes so many among us .
It is outrageous and unaccpetable .
They , and we , should be ashamed of what is happening .
Bette Midler : Vegas Disappointment or Victim of Hard Times ?
( Video )
Well known entertainerbrought her show Bette Midler : The Show Must Go On to Caesars Palace in Las Vegas last February .
She replaced the wildly popular .
Midler started out strong but it looks like there could be signs of trouble .
Whether it is because of the state of the economy or lack of interest in Midler 's venue , the entertainer has not been able to sell out her shows .
Tickets sell for between $ 95 and $ 250 .
Is that too much ?
It is being reported that between December 30th and January 4th , Bette sold out only one performance .
The problem is that this is one of the busiest time periods for Vegas shows .
If she can't perform to a packed house during that time frame , she may indeed be headed for trouble .
Watch the video below of Midler performing her Vegas show and let us know what you think .

More than 100 students are staging a sit-in at Cambridge University in protest at the actions of the Israeli military in Gaza .
Members of Cambridge Gaza Solidarity say they intend to spend the weekend inside the university 's law faculty .
A spokeswoman said they wanted to show support for the Palestinians in Gaza .
Israel launched a three - week offensive against Hamas in Gaza in December .
A reported 1,300 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed .
Israel has since declared a ceasefire , while Hamas has announced a one - week cessation .
The Cambridge Gaza Solidarity spokeswoman said the students took action after similar occupations were staged at other UK universities .
A sit -in demonstration at the Clarendon Building at Oxford University was held on Thursday and thousands of people have protested in cities across the UK to call for an end to Israeli attacks on Gaza over the past few weeks .

( CNN ) --
Headaches , big and small , are among the most common health complaints .
Almost 90 percent of women and about 70 percent of men get tension headaches , the Mayo Clinic says .
Yet doctors still do n't know much about what causes them .
About 18 percent of women and 6 percent of men in the United States report having migraines .
In a new large - scale study published in the journal Neurology this week , researchers found that higher temperatures and , to a lesser extent , low air pressure , influence severe headaches .
But researchers are n't sure how temperature influences headaches , and others say that a slew of other factors could be involved in the connection .
" I think it 's more complicated than that , " said Dr. Joel Saper , director of the Michigan Head Pain and Neurological Institute in Ann Arbor , Michigan , who was not involved in the study .
Temperature and pressure may be indirect evidence of other causal factors .
The study looked at more than 7,000 patients who had come to the emergency room of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston , Massachusetts , between May 2000 and December 2007 , all of whom were discharged with a primary diagnosis of some kind of headache .
About 75 percent of these patients were women .
Researchers compared environmental factors such as temperature , air pollution and barometric pressure on the day of the patient 's visit with a day the week before and a day the week after .
They found that the risk of severe headache increases about 7.5 percent for each temperature increment of 5 degrees Celsius ( about 9 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
" Fairly consistently , it was warmer on the days that individuals came in than on control days before and afterwards , " said Dr. Kenneth Mukamal , lead author and physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center .
But as to why temperature is connected to headaches , Mukamal said researchers are n't sure .
The physiological connection is not well understood , he said .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Migraine with aura
But Saper said a lot of things happen on hot days that may influence headaches -- for instance , leaving an air - conditioned car to walk outside on a warm day , or being physically active and sweating a lot .
It 's not clear that temperature itself is the direct link , he said .
" There 's no evidence that there 's more headaches in hot climates than in cold climates , " Saper said .
" There are no more headaches in Miami Beach than they are in Boston . "
On the other hand , the idea that high temperatures and low pressure are linked to headaches is well known .
On a hot day , a person may become dehydrated , which leads to a headache , said Dr. Stephen Silberstein , professor of neurology at Thomas Jefferson Medical Center in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , who was not involved in the study .
About 18 percent of women and 6 percent of men in the United States report having migraines , the authors said .
Experts estimate that the cost of migraines in America is about $ 17 billion .
While the study found a weaker link between air pressure and headaches , Silberstein said a person going up to a mountain -- where the pressure is lower -- will have a greater chance of getting a headache .
Curiously , the study did not find any association between pollution and headaches , which is surprising given that pollution causes sinus problems , which lead to headaches , Silberstein said .
Researchers in the new study still do not rule out pollution as a factor , Mukamal said .
Migraines , unlike other headaches , are a specific type of chronic headache syndrome .
The condition runs in families and is more common among women , Mukamal said .
Menstrual cycles and other hormonal factors can influence migraines .
Doctors will sometimes ask migraine patients to keep diaries to see what might influence the headaches and determine how often they occur .
They help both doctors and patients track progress , monitoring whether the migraines become less frequent over time , Silberstein said .
Diet can also influence migraines , Silberstein said .
Starvation , alcohol and caffeine withdrawal are all important triggers .
Going to sleep at the same time every night and having time to relax are helpful for migraine patients , Silberstein said .
He also noted the importance of the environment in physical health and the implications that global warming could have on headaches .
The next step in headache research is to figure out if there are medications that could block the triggering effect of environmental factors on headaches , Mukamal said .
" This highlights the fact that there are very clear clinical consequences to the environment and they do n't just affect the old , and the sick , or kids , " Mukamal said .
" Even garden variety common problems , like migraines and headaches , which affect the whole range of the population , can clearly measurably be influenced by the environment . "

Sept .
Chinese malware brokers are spottedÃ‚Â sellingÃ‚Â a $ 37 tool kit that allows anyone to exploit this newly - discovered security hole in a component of Windows , calledÃ‚Â RPC - DCOM , which enables file and print sharing .
RPC - DCOM is built into all PCs of Windows XP vintage and earlier , some 800 million machines worldwide
Sept. 29 : Gimmiv first seen in the wild infecting a PC in Hanoi , Vietnam .
Over the next few weeks it manages to infect 200 more machines in 23 nations – most of which were in Malaysia .
Mistakes in the way it is coded limit its ability to spread .

Oct. 15 . MIT ’s Dr. Ronald Rivest publishes a cutting - edge securityÃ‚Â technique , called the “ MIT MD6 hashing algorithm . ”
Oct. 23 .
Microsoft issues a rare emergency patch for the RPC - DCOM vulnerability disclosedÃ‚Â — and exploited byÃ‚Â — the $ 37 malware kit .
Oct. 26 : Word spreads about the $ 37 Chinese toolkit ; Ã‚Â they are forced to give it away .
The release of the exploit code prompts many to craft malware that can seek out machines with the bug .

Oct. – early Nov. IsolatedÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Gimmiv attacks unfold against unpatched PCs in Asia .
Ã‚Â Sunbelt Software reverseÃ‚Â engineers one of the early attacks - in - the - wild .
Ã‚Â Sunbelt researcher Eric Sites discovers that gimmevÃ‚Â installs aÃ‚Â new Dynamic Link Library , or DLL , so that the next time the owner restarts his or her PC , a malicious Trojan takes root and continually runs in the background .
Every 10 minutes , it copies all registry information , all logons stored by the Web browser and a bunch of other information and sends it back to the attacker .
Security experts begin to worry that someone will get the bright idea to create a self - replicating worm to seek out unpatched PCs .Ã‚Â
“ If other bad people find out how to use this , we ’re big trouble , ” Sites predicts .
“ A Blaster - type worm could be created very easily , and wreak havoc . ”
Nov. 20 .
Conficker A , a self - replicating worm that scans Internet - wide for other unpatched PCs to infect , begins to spread .
Nov. 22 . Microsoft issues a securit alert recommending immediate patching .
Nov. 26 . Conficker A’sÃ‚Â “ domain generation algorithm ” activates .
Infected PCs begin trying to contact a different set of 250 web domains daily for further instructions .
late Nov. Security firm Damballa issues a Conficker A census : 500,000 infected machines .
Dec 1 . Conficker A - infected machines check in atÃ‚Â trafficconverter .biz , Ã‚Â following instructions hard - coded into Conficker .
“ This was not part of the domain generation algorithm , ” says F - Secure ’s Patrik Runald .
“ It attempted to do a download but the file was n’t there . ”
Trafficconverter is a site well known for fake security product .

This meansÃ‚Â the coding used to obscure communications inÃ‚Â Conficker A and Conficker B , unless patched , Ã‚Â are vulnerable to hacks .
mid Jan. to early Feb . Conficker A and Conficker B population of machinesÃ‚Â explodes , grabbing news headlines .
Estimates range from 3 million to 12 million machines infected .
Feb. 12 . Microsoft forms the Conficker Cabal ; offers $ 250,000 bounty for information leading to the arrest of Conficker ’s creators .
Feb 16 .
Conficker .
B++ is spotted for the first time .
It ’s protocol seems to be in direct response to Cabal ’s efforts to disable Conficker ’s communications strategy .
It no longer needs to contact internet rendezvous points for updates , instead these can be flashed centrally from any internet address .
( Source : BBC )
mid Feb.- Mar .
The Cabal works to stop PCs from connecting to the daily list of 250 rendezvous points .
This is accomplished by registering the known set of Conficker A and Conficker B domains , at least those that are n’t already registered .
Mar .
5 . Conficker C begins updating all PCs infected with Conficker B and B ++. Conficker C halts the Internet - wide scanning ; it organizes the infected PCs into P2P networks ; and it also embeds instructions for each infected PC , on April 1 , to begin checking a random group of 500 rendezvous points selected from 50,000 domains .
Finally , Conficker C also patches the security hole in the MIT MD6 hashing algorithm .
early March .
While working on this 60 - Minutes feature story , CBS News gets hit by Conficker , causing major disruption .
Mar. 31 . IBM announces that it has cracked Conficker ’s customized P2P client ; and can see ConfickerÃ‚Â P2P signatures across the globe .
Asia has 45 % of infections ; Europe 32 % ; South America 14 % ; North America 6 % .
Apr. 1 . All PCs updated with Conficker CÃ‚Â begin checking 500 rendezvous points randomly selected from 50,000 web addresses for further instructions .
Apr. 8 . An update begins spreading via P2P to Conficker C machines .
The update begins propagation anew , covers its tracks better , and installs Waledac antivirus pitches .

" Worse than thieves , murderers , or cannibals those who offer compromise slow you and sap your vitality while pretending to be your friends .
Compromisers are the enemy of all humanity , the enemies of life itself .
Compromisers are the enemies of everything important , sacred and true . "
~ L. Neil Smith
While the vast majority of emails I have received in response to my articles here and here , have been overwhelmingly positive , I have received quite a number from those who believe compromise with the state on the subject of concealed carry permits to somehow be positive , while others who continue in their support of the NRA have written to say , Neo , you must swallow the blue pill ; life is good , the NRA is our friend .
I am no psychologist , but I do understand the desire of those who have chosen to compromise feeling the need to be reinforced in their actions , so they attempt to convince others to do likewise .
Compromise is the path of least resistance .
It is my belief one cannot compromise with anyone whose goal is your destruction , for it is not the gun in the hands of a free man the tyrant fears , but the spirit of the man who possesses it .
Compromise destroys the spirit of liberty and converts it to one of accommodation .
Compromise bears bitter fruit .
On a bright sunny day in October of 1991 , then Suzanna Gratia went to lunch with her parents at Luby ’s restaurant in Killeen , Texas .
In order to be in compliance with an unconstitutional law that forbade the possession of a concealed weapon , Ms. Gratia compromised and left her .38 caliber pistol in her vehicle .
Suddenly , a madman , George Hennard , drove his truck into the cafeteria , got out of the truck and opened fire on those inside .
Ms. Gratia and her father , Al , turned over a table to use as cover .
Ms. Gratia stated she reached for her purse to retrieve her .38 , but then realized she had left it in her car .
Believing the madman was going to shoot everyone , Al Gratia , exhibited uncommon courage in rushing the killer .
Hennard shot him in the chest , an obvious mortal wound .
Ms. Gratia spotted a window , broken by another patron trying to escape , told her mother to follow her and then made her escape .
Her mother decided she could not leave her wounded husband , sat on the floor and cradled his head in her arms .
Hennard would return to where Mrs. Gratia sat and shoot her in the head .
The couple had just celebrated their 47th wedding anniversary .
Ms. Gratia , now Dr. Suzanna Hupp , has become a crusader for the Second Amendment .
Here she shows she inherited her mother and father ’s courage as she addresses the Charles Schumer led committee on banning assault weapons .
Notice she says , " I would much rather be sitting in jail with a felony offense on my head and have my parents alive . "
She also states " she made the stupidest decision of her life " when she decided to comply with the law and not carry her weapon .
Best of all was when Ms. Gratia Hupp explained to the tyrants on the committee the true meaning of the Second Amendment ; " the Second Amendment is not about duck hunting , and I know I am not going to make very many friends saying this , but , its about all of our rights to be able to protect ourselves from all you guys up there . "
What courage .
Those of you who are more than willing to compromise away our rights and freedoms are not fit to carry this woman ’s shoes .
God Bless you , Dr. Hupp , you are the epitome of courage .
The battlefield of freedom is littered with the bodies of those who believe in compromise .
Unfortunately , they usually manage to take some heroes with them .
Hope is not a method .
The Best of Michael Gaddy

Advertisement Google has lifted the lid on its first major upgrade to its global mapping software , Google Earth .
Google Ocean expands this map to include large swathes of the ocean floor and abyssal plain .
Users can dive beneath a dynamic water surface to explore the 3D sea floor terrain .
The map also includes 20 content layers , containing information from the world 's leading scientists , researchers , and ocean explorers .
Al Gore was at the launch event in San Francisco which , Google hopes , will take its mapping software a step closer to total coverage of the entire globe .
You can dive into the world 's ocean that covers almost three - quarters of the planet
Al Gore
In a statement , Mr Gore said that the update would make Google Earth a " magical experience " .
" You can not only zoom into whatever part of our planet 's surface you wish to examine in closer detail , you can now dive into the world 's ocean that covers almost three - quarters of the planet and discover new wonders that had not been accessible in previous versions . "
Approximately 70 % of the world 's surface is covered by water , which contains nearly 80 % of all life - yet less than 5 % of it has actually been explored .
Google Ocean aims to let users visit some of the more interesting locations , including underwater volcanoes , as well as running videos on marine life , shipwrecks and clips of favourite surf and dive spots .
Conservation organisations hope the tool will improve awareness of issues facing undersea life .
" With this , everybody can see the unbelievable beauty of our marine life and how incredibly threatened it is , " said Carl Gustaf Lundin , head of the global marine programme at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) .
" We hope this major technological innovation will get the public more involved in marine conservation and encourage governments and businesses to stop driving ocean species to extinction . "
Coloured worlds
The new features were developed in close collaboration with oceanographer Sylvia Earle and an advisory council of more than 25 ocean advocates and scientists .
Sylvia Earle , the National Geographic Society 's explorer in residence , said the new features would bring the blue planet to life .
" I cannot imagine a more effective way to inspire awareness and caring for the blue heart of the planet than the new ocean in Google Earth .
" For the first time , everyone from curious kids to serious researchers can see the world , the whole world , with new eyes , " she added .
There are also updates on the terrestrial side , including GPS tracking , virtual time travel ( where users can observe changes in satellite images , such as the 2006 World Cup stadium or the desertification of Africa 's Lake Chad ) and narrated tours of imagery and content in Google Earth .
There are also updates to the Mars 3D section , so if users have had enough of the blue planet , they can always look at the red one .

By Murray Bourne , 12 Jan 2009
There is math behind readability .
I 'm talking about readability in books and magazines , as well as readability on the Web .
Ever wondered why legal documents are so hard to follow and why it ’s such a chore to churn through certain books ?
Writers would like to know if their words will be understood by the intended audience .
There are several different readability tests that authors can use to get a handle on the readability of their work .
One of the best known tests is the Flesch Kincaid Readability Test which was developed by Rudolph Flesch .
Flesch was a mid-20th century expert in readability who wrote Why Johnny Can't Read .
This book criticized the " reading by sight " method , and advocated a return to learning to read using phonics .
How do you determine readability in a reliable way ?
Readability depends in part on word familiarity and length , and also sentence construction and length .
It 's not possible to quantify everything that is involved in readability ( for example , long words are not necessarily difficult to understand and not all short ones are easy to understand ) .
So some compromises are inevitable .
Flesch Reading Ease Score
The Flesch Reading Ease Score is calculated as follows :
206.835 − 1.015 × ( average words per sentence ) − 84.6 × ( average syllables per word )
A score of 100 means it is very easy to read , and 0 means it is almost impossible .
In general , the score indicates :
90 to 100 : Easily understood by an average 11 year old student
60 to 70 : Easily understood by an average 13 to 15 year old student ( Readers Digest level )
0 to 30 : College graduate level
A related score is the Flesch Kincaid Grade Level which gives an approximate grade level for a passage .
Its formula is :
0.39 × ( average words per sentence ) + 11.8 × ( average syllables per word ) − 15.59
Some Thoughts
As students read fewer books , and tend to scan for information on computer screens , I suspect the definition of " average 11 - year old " will need to be changed .
Also , college graduates do not read as much as their pre-Internet seniors did , and this will affect these calculations .
Of course , a mathematical analysis of a piece of writing will not tell you if the words make sense or it is an interesting story .
However , an understanding of these tests will help you to improve your writing .
Tools for Readability
Microsoft Word has an in - built tool which calculates the Flesch Reading Ease and Grade .
It is normally turned off by default .
Check your
Word help menu for advice on how to turn it on for your version .
You can also check readability using this online tool .
Apart from the Flesch score , it also lists the Coleman Liau index , ARI ( Automated Readability Index ) and SMOG .
Readability on the Web
As more teaching and learning is being carried out online , it is important for educators to know how to make Web pages as reading - friendly as possible .
There ’s a lot of advice on this topic on the Web .
Jakob Nielsen has done extensive eye tracking research and has several articles on Web readability .
Should Math Students - and Teachers - Care ?
You bet .
To be employable in the 21st century , you ’ll certainly need to know how to write well .
See the 5 Comments below .
More than 40 years after Joern Utzon was forced off the site of the Sydney Opera House , the building 's visionary designer was finally honoured by Australia today at a memorial service held inside the masterpiece that he never saw completed .
The Danish architect won an international design competition in 1954 but stormed off the project in 1966 after a row with the New South Wales government about spiralling costs .
He left Australia , vowing never to return , and relations only thawed in recent years , when he accepted an invitation to be principal design consultant on a revamp of the building .
Mr Utzon died last November , aged 90 .
Politicians , dignitaries and major figures in the art world came together yesterday to celebrate the legacy that he left Australia .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The federal Arts Minister , Peter Garrett , hailed the Opera House as " one of the defining symbols of Sydney and Australia " , and said it had played a significant role in the evolution of the nation 's cultural identity .
The service was attended by Mr Utzon 's children , Jan and Lin , and featured performances by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra , Opera Australia and the Australian Ballet , underlining the architect 's contribution to the country 's arts .
The Oscar - winning actress Cate Blanchett read from Shakespeare 's Cymbeline , while Neil Finn , from the band Crowded House , performed the group 's hit " Do n't Dream It 's Over " .
Despite the decades - long suspension of official contact , Australians adored Mr Utzon 's modernist icon , which opened in the shadow of the Harbour Bridge in 1973 .
The architect received warm letters from the public throughout his life , according to his son , who was also his professional partner .
Jan told the service that one woman wrote to say she had been planning to kill herself by leaping into the harbour but had changed her mind after seeing the Opera House 's distinctive roof of billowing sails reflected in the water .
While Jan has visited Australia regularly since 1999 to co-ordinate the redesign work , his father was too frail to make the journey from Europe .
Jan said he was sure his father " would have liked [ past ] events to happen differently " , but he had been delighted to be part of the Opera House project for so many years .
" The thing that touched him most was my accounts of how people used the building , how they loved the building , and of their respect for his work , " Jan said .
His sister Lin added : " He created a building so beautiful and so , in a way , self - evident that it seems as if God himself put it there . "

Mr Utzon , whose philosophy was to " work on the edge of the possible " , bet more than 200 others to win the competition to design the Opera House .
Work began in 1959 , but the construction schedule grew ever more elastic – a four - year project ended up taking 17 years – and the budget soared from A$ 7 m ( £ 3.4 m ) to A$ 100m .
Amid increasing public disquiet , Mr Utzon was sacked by the government .
His plans were scrapped , and the building 's interior was completed by a team of inexperienced local architects .
The epic falling - out enthralled Australians and later became the subject of an opera by the composer Alan John .
It was called Eighth Wonder and was performed at the Opera House in 1995 .
Yesterday , the New South Wales Premier , Nathan Rees , praised Mr Utzon 's creation – which is Australia 's biggest tourist attraction and the world 's busiest performing arts centre – as more than just a building .
" It binds us as a community , as a people , as a nation , " he said .
The service began with a traditional Aboriginal welcome ceremony at dawn on the steps of the Opera House .
Later , the internationally renowned indigenous Bangarra Dance Theatre performed inside the concert hall .
Mr Utzon , whose magnum opus won World Heritage status in 2007 , created a set of design principles to govern any future redevelopment .
The state government is considering a $ 1bn ( £ 480 m ) facelift of the building .
Obama Justice Department Urges Dismissal of Another Torture Case
Created : March 12 , 2009 18:46 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
In another move that suggests the Obama Department of Justice is not making many big policy breaks with its predecessor when it comes to the legal rights of Guantanamo Bay detainees , the department filed a brief renewing the government ’s motion to dismiss the case of Rasul v. Rumsfeld .
The case is very similar to the lawsuit filed by U.S. citizen and former enemy combatant Jose Padilla against former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo , which I ’ve been following .
The plaintiffs in Rasul v. Rumsfeld allege that former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other senior Bush officials are responsible for their torture ; prolonged arbitrary detention ; cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ; cruel and unusual punishment ; denial of liberties without due process , and preventing the exercise and expression of their religious beliefs .
According to their legal complaint , Shafiq Rasul , Asif Iqbal and Rhuhel Ahmed claim they traveled to Afghanistan in October 2001 to offer humanitarian relief to civilians .
In late November , they were kidnapped by Rashid Dostum , the Uzbeki warlord and leader of the U.S. - supported Northern Alliance .
He turned them over to U.S. custody – apparently for bounty money that American officials were paying for suspected terrorists .
In December , without any independent evidence that the men had engaged in hostilities against the United States , U.S. officials sent them to Guantanamo Bay .
Over the next two years , they claim — as does a fourth British man — that they were imprisoned in cages , tortured and humiliated , forced to shave their beards and watch their Korans desecrated , until they were returned to Britain in 2004 .
None were ever charged with a crime .
Dismissed at the urging of the Bush administration , the case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court .
In December , the case was sent back to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington for reconsideration , because the Supreme Court had ruled in Boumediene v. Bush that Guantanamo detainees have the right to challenge their detentions .
It was n’t clear what effect that ruling might have on the Rasul case .
Although some civil rights lawyers had hoped the Obama administration would change the government ’s position — or at least try to settle this case , which is at the very least an embarrassment to the United States – the former prisoners had no such luck .
Today , the Justice Department filed a brief arguing , as it did in Padilla ’s case against Yoo , that government officials are not liable for torture , abuse , denial of due process or religious rights , because the right of Guantanamo prisoners not to suffer those abuses at the hands of the U.S. government was not clearly established at the time .
That would seem to contradict previous statements by President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder that torture ( including waterboarding ) and other abuses are clearly illegal , now and always , and that the president ca n’t simply override that prohibition .
It also may discourage those who are hoping the president will eventually support prosecutions of former Bush officials for exactly those crimes .
Reached today , the lead lawyer on the case , Eric Lewis , a partner at the Washington - based law firm , Baach Robinson & Lewis , said he was “ disappointed ” but “ not surprised . ”
However , as I ’ve pointed out before in the context of the Yoo case , the defense does raise some serious questions about whether the Obama Justice Department really ought to be defending Donald Rumsfeld and his former colleagues in this case at all .
I ’ll be writing more about this case and others like it , as well as their implications , in the coming week .
Moderate GOP senator may be in jeopardy Rachel Oswald
Published : Wednesday March 11 , 2009
Print This Email This One of the few remaining moderate Republicans in the Senate , Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , is facing multiple primary challenges to his candidacy in 2010 from more conservative opponents .
This is to the delight of Democrats who feel they would have a better shot of grabbing another Senate seat in the general election if the pro-labor and pro-choice Specter goes down in the primary .
Roll Call reports Tuesday ( paid access ) that Specter 's base of suburban Philadelphia voters has seen a sharp drop in Republican registrations while Democrats have seen a spike in enrollment that can be attributed to many moderate Republicans switching parties since 2004 .
" The result is bad math for Specter , who will likely face a more conservative GOP electorate in the 2010 primary than he did in 2004 , " reports Roll Call .
Specter is expected to face a strong primary challenge from Club for Growth CEO and former Congressman , Pat Toomey .
There will also be challenges from anti-abortion activist Peg Luksik and Specter 's primary challenger in 1998 , Larry Murphy .
David Weigel of The Washington Independent writes of the situation , " Specters brand of liberal , pro-labor , pro-choice Republicanism has become less and less tenable in the Republican Party ; indeed , many conservatives blame the partys Republicans In Name Only ( RINOs ) for hurting their brand and paving the way for Barack Obamas victory . "
Though the shedding of moderate Republicans in recent years means that conservatives have a serious chance of besting Specter in the primary , their chances of winning in the general primary in a state that is generally trending less and less conservative are not good .
Reports Roll Call , " Whoever wins the GOP primary will likely get a hefty challenge from Democrats , who plan to target the seat in 2010 .
Former National Constitution Center President Joe Torsella has already announced his candidacy , and state Auditor Jack Wagner , Reps. Patrick Murphy , Allyson Schwartz , Joe Sestak and state Rep. Josh Shapiro have also been mentioned as possible Senate candidates .
National Democrats concur that any of them would have a better chance of beating Toomey in the general election than Specter , but that the seat will be targeted no matter what . "
Allahpundit , writing for Hot Air speculates of the situation , " Would losing the primary to Toomey actually help Specter ?
If the Democrats run a Blue Dog against him in a two - man race , conservative Republicans might cross over en masse to punish him for his stimulus betrayal .
If its a three - man race , conservative Republicans vote for Toomey , liberal Democrats vote for the Dem , and centrists from both sides opt  maybe  for Specter . "

INVERNESS , Scotland , Jan. 10 ( UPI ) --
Researchers in Scotland are going to try to determine if the side effects of type 2 diabetes can be managed through a diet full of oat - rich cereals .
The Scottish government 's Chief Scientist Office is providing $ 305,000 to finance a 16 - week trial involving 60 volunteers .
Researchers based in Inverness and Aberdeen will conduct the study , the BBC reported Friday .

The oats - diabetes study was organized by researchers at the University of the Highlands and Islands , the University of Aberdeen and the Rowett Institute .
" The aim is to develop new dietary plans which could improve diabetes control , delay the need for people with type 2 diabetes to start tablets or insulin to control their blood sugar , and potentially reduce the risk of some of the complications of diabetes , " said UHI Professor Sandra MacRury , who works at the school 's Department of Diabetes and Cardiovascular Science .
President Obama ’s pick for Treasury Secretary , Timothy Geithner , is being urged to lay the foundation for “ global governance ” by considering “ international taxation ” measures to loot more money from U.S. taxpayers .
The recommendation is included in the report , “ The Global Agenda 2009 , ” which is being considered by the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) , meeting in Davos , Switzerland , January 28 – February 1 .
The WEF is not an official government group but does include dozens of government , corporate and labor leaders at its annual meetings .
Media companies such as News Corporation ( parent of Fox News , the Fox Business Network , and the Wall Street Journal ) , CNBC , and Forbes are official sponsors of the WEF meeting .
News Corporation is listed as one of about 100 “ strategic partners ” of the World Economic Forum .
“ Look for live coverage on CNBC , all day every day , ” reports CNBC “ Squawk Box ” co-anchor Becky Quick .
“ We kick things off at 6 a.m. Eastern time Wednesday on Squawk , with serious interviews from the headliners . ”
Her report , however , fails to disclose that CNBC is an “ industry partner ” of the World Economic Forum this week .
CNBC is a subsidiary of General Electric , whose GE Capital is receiving a $ 139 - billion taxpayer - financed loan guarantee as part of the Wall Street bailout .
CNBC ’s sister networks are NBC and MSNBC .
Other “ industry partners ” of the WEF include Reuters , the British - based news agency .
A Reuters story about the meeting that starts on Wednesday sounds like a press release from the organization , hailing its “ achievements ” over time but failing to note that Reuters is a sponsor of this year ’s event .
CNBC is advertising a “ No Way Back – the Road to Recovery ” debate hosted at the conference by CNBC ’s Maria Bartiromo .
One of the participants is Steve Schwarzman , Chairman , CEO and co-founder of the Chinese - funded and partly owned Blackstone Group .
Representing Chinese economic dominance in what Henry Kissinger has labeled a “ New World Order , ” Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao is speaking to a special session of the conference on its first day .
The event ’s corporate sponsors , which pay about half a million dollars each to participate , include several failing institutions that have received tens of billions of dollars from U.S. taxpayers .
They include Bank of America , Citi , Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase & Co. , and Morgan Stanley .
These entities are termed “ Strategic Partners ” of the World Economic Forum .
But will CNBC highlight this kind of extravagant spending when the cable business network is helping sponsor the event ?
In a major embarrassment , the WEF has released a report , “ The Future of the Global Financial System , ” which acknowledges “ intellectual stewardship and guidance ” provided by a steering committee co-chaired by John Thain , the former Merrill Lynch & Co. chief executive officer who was recently ousted from Bank of America in a scandal .
Thain oversaw the disastrous sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America and was criticized for lavish spending on office decorations , including a $ 1,405 waste basket and $ 87,784 rug .
The other co-chair of the committee was David Rubenstein , co-founder and managing director of The Carlyle Group , who has been quoted as saying that China holds the key to the world economy ’s future .
One report notes that Rubenstein says Carlyle “ was an early investor in the Chinese marketplace , ” that its China office “ has hired many native - born Chinese , and the company is seeking to build its buyout and growth - capital businesses there . ”
“ The Global Agenda 2009 ” report says that “ sovereign states do not adequately address problems reaching across borders ” and that “ international taxation ” may be needed to generate the “ additional resources ” for “ global governance . ”
Could this become a source of new bailout money here and abroad ?
“ As current global governance problems come from market failures , sovereign failures and intergovernmental failures that cross boundaries , sacrificing sovereignty for greater gain may become an option , ” the report says .
The report says the U.N. ’s Law of the Sea Treaty , which is a top priority for Senate ratification under the Obama Administration , is a measure that has “ earned the acceptance and compliance ” of most nations .
The treaty would turn over oil , gas , and mineral resources to the U.N. and authorize access to them through payment of a global tax to a U.N. body .
The so - called “ Council on Global Governance ” of the World Economic Forum includes Anne-Marie Slaughter , dean of the Princeton University Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs who has been picked by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to run the State Department ’s Office of Policy Planning .
Slaughter wrote the 2004 book , A New World Order .
In terms of media interest and backing for the controversial event , one of the co-chairs is Rupert Murdoch , chairman of News Corporation , the Fox News Channel parent company .
Another co-chair is Kofi Annan , the disgraced former U.N. Secretary - General .
As director of U.N. peacekeeping , Annan was accused of ignoring genocide in Rwanda .
As Secretary - General , he was investigated for presiding over the oil - for - food corruption scandal involving Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq regime .
Annan , however , claimed that he was “ exonerated ” by a report issued by Paul Volcker , the former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman and now one of Obama ’s chief economic advisers .
In the past U.S. officials have been major participants in the World Economic Forum .
But it ’s not clear if any of Obama ’s top officials will be going to this year ’s event .
However , some of his labor backers , including Andrew Stern of the Service Employees International Union , and John Sweeney , president of the AFL - CIO , are listed as participants .
In addition to global taxes , “ The Global Agenda 2009 ” report urges creation of a global television channel .
“ Media has the capacity to connect the world , bridging cultures and peoples , and telling us who we are and what we mean to each other .
The media can also ensure that no voice goes unheard , ” it says .
“ We believe that this new moment also calls for a new media platform , across all media channels , a global non-profit ‘ CNN ’ providing a new form of independent journalism to inform , illuminate and deepen knowledge about issues that improve the state of the world . ”
The report does n’t explain how this new global TV channel will be financed .
But global taxes can not be ruled out .
Perhaps this new era of transparency and disclosure can start with disclosing details about media sponsorship and backing of the World Economic Forum and its plans for “ global governance . ”
Debugging doctests interactively
Jens W. Klein has just released a pretty cool doctest debugger tool called interlude .
It 's designed for a situation where you are writing doctests ( perhaps in the comments of your code ) and you think to yourself , hmm , what happens when I run this test ?
Instead of the back and forth run-test - edit cycle , well , why not just drop into a doctest session from your test suite , interact with the shell until you got it right , then copy / paste the session back into your comments ?
This little tool is genius .
And surprisingly simple : 11 lines long ( 3 of those are for the shell startup message ) .
Jens describes an installation process that involves invoking a custom doctest runner .
This can introduce a bootstrapping problem , especially if you are using a doctest runner like Nose because it's hard to customize the doctest runner .
Well , actually , this bootstrapping step is n't even necessary .
Here 's an example :
I have a doctest in a module I 'm working on called Fudge , for creating mock objects ( fyi , I 'll be releasing this code in a day or two ) .
Example :
class Fake ( object ) : " " " A fake object that replaces a real one while testing . " " " # etc ... def has_attr ( self , ** attributes ) : " " " Sets available attributes . >>> User = Fake ( ' User ' ) .provides ('__init__').has_attr( name= ' Harry ' ) >>> user = User ( ) >>> user.name ' Harry ' " " " self._attributes.update( attributes ) return self
I can run doctests for this with Nose like so :
$ nosetests -- with - doctest -- verbose Doctest : fudge .
Fake ... ok Doctest : fudge .
Fake.calls ... ok Doctest : fudge .
Fake.expects ... ok Doctest : fudge .Fake.has_attr ... ok
Let 's say I wanted to debug the doctest interactively .
All I have to do is add a call to interlude.interact ( ) from within my doctest :
def has_attr ( self , ** attributes ) : " " " Sets available attributes . >>> User = Fake ( ' User ' ) .provides ('__init__').has_attr( name= ' Harry ' ) >>> user = User ( ) >>> user.name ' Harry ' >>> import interlude >>> interlude.interact ( locals ( ) ) " " " self._attributes.update( attributes ) return self
... and next time I run the tests I get dropped into a shell that contains all variables from my doctest for me to explore :
$ nosetests -- with - doctest -- verbose Doctest : fudge .
Fake ... ok Doctest : fudge .
Fake.calls ... ok Doctest : fudge .
Fake.expects ... ok Doctest : fudge .Fake.has_attr ...
=========================================
Interlude DocTest Interactive Console - ( c ) BlueDynamics Alliance Note :
You have the same locals available as in your test - case .
Ctrl - D ends session and continues testing .
>>> user fake : User >>> user.name ' Harry ' >>>
And of course I can simply copy / paste that session back into my comments and remove the call to interact ( ) .
Pretty nice , huh ?
Good work , Jens .
You could also do this with pdb but having the doctest environment makes it as simple as copy / paste when you want to put the session back in your tests .

It 's incredible .
Just as 20,000 viewers signed an open letter to CNBC telling them to listen to Jon Stewart and hold Wall Street accountable instead of mindlessly repeating Wall Street talking points , NBC doubled down .
This morning , Meet The Press host David Gregory repeated what CNBC's Erin Burnett has been saying all along :
The public is ignorant .
If only the simpleton public understood what the Wall Street " experts " understand , we would n't be so populist and angry .

A hole allowing hackers to take control of Microsoft Exchange was just one " critical " issue the Redmond - based company promises it has fixed with a patch correcting a total of eight vulnerabilities in its programs , including the Internet Explorer browser , Office , and its SQL Server .
Three of the eight vulnerabilities patched yesterday were marked " critical " .
The most concerning is an issue with Exchange that would allow attackers to take over an Exchange server by simply forwarding a carefully crafted message to a corporate mail server .
Microsoft has admitted that the vulnerability can be exploited when a user opens or previews an email in the Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format ( TNEF ) .
A " blatant " vulnerability
Andrew Storms , nCircle Network Security Inc.'s security operations director , was baffled by the hack 's potential .
" What we 're seeing here is that you can send a message and take control of an Exchange server , " he said .
" I do n't remember an Exchange vulnerability that 's quite so blatant .
The functionality that the server provides is the way that you attack the system . "

Because even just the preview offers hackers the chance to control a corporate mail server -- a rewarding conquest , indeed -- the problem should take first priority amongst companies hoping to prevent a security disaster .
" This seems to be a pretty bad one , " remarked Wolfgang Kandek , security firm Qualys Inc. 's chief technology officer .
" This should be patched immediately ... "
The second significant vulnerability Microsoft has patched concerns its popular Internet Explorer 7 browser .
Two flaws include a problem in handling Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) and a memory corruption issue .
Although they might not sound it , Kandek assures that the holes are significant .
" This should be patched immediately , " he noted .
Other issues reportedly patched include a remote code execution vulnerability Microsoft says it first discovered late last year .
Similar holes filled in Microsoft 's Office software also prevent remote code execution , this time if exploited by a hacker employing a malicious Visio file .

Nvidia has so far guarded its GPU PhysX technology behind a large CUDA - shaped wall , meaning that anyone who wants to use it has to use CUDA too .
However , the company has revealed that this may not be the case in the future , as Nvidia is considering porting PhysX over to OpenCL ; the API that ’s also being used by AMD to accelerate Havok physics
In a recent Q&A session to coincide with the launch of Nvidia ’s APEX tools for games developers using PhysX , we took the opportunity to ask Nvidia ’s director of product management for PhysX , Nadeem Mohammad , about whether there were any plans to port PhysX over to OpenCL .
Mohammad revealed that he was n’t against the idea at all .
Mohammad told us , but added that Mohammad also pointed out that although Nvidia currently uses CUDA to accelerate PhysX on GPUs , the company ’ ssaid Mohammad , explaining that What ’s more , later on , Mohammad also described Nvidia ’s future plans for PhysX by sayingwhich implies little doubt that Nvidia is seriously considering this as an option .
So would this mean that owners of ATI cards could also take advantage of PhysX ?
Theoretically , yes .
Of course , Nvidia has publicly said that it will work with ATI on CUDA - accelerated PhysX for over a year , but it ’s an offer that ATI has yet to accept .
However , by using an open - standard API such as OpenCL , it ’s possible that ATI cards could support PhysX and miss out CUDA altogether .
Commenting on this possibility , Mohammad said that “ He also added that one good aspect of Nvidia using CUDA is that the company only needs toHe also then emphasised thatNvidia is clearly still committed to accelerating PhysX on GPUs via CUDA in the near future , but it looks as though a port to OpenCL is a very real possibility .
Should Nvidia port PhysX over to OpenCL , or would that result in unfair quality - control complications ?

Elizabeth Schulte explains why a majority of people who lose their jobs are barred from receiving unemployment benefits under the existing system .
IT WAS awful enough when Kenneth Brown lost his job in October .
But then the hotel electrician took another hit -- his former employer tried to block his unemployment benefits .
Brown had begun receiving benefits of $ 380 a week to try to support himself , his wife and three children .
Then the owners of the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center , just outside Washington , D.C. , filed an appeal , claiming he had been fired for being deceptive with a supervisor .
" A big corporation like that ... it was hard enough to be terminated , " he said .
" But for them to try to take away the unemployment benefits , I just thought that was heartless . "
When a Washington Post reporter showed up at Brown 's unemployment hearing in Maryland , the company dropped its appeal and refused to comment .
Kenneth Brown is n't alone in what he faced .
According to an Urban Institute analysis of Labor Department statistics , more than a quarter of people who apply for unemployment benefits have their claims challenged by their employer .
Employers are trying to wriggle out of the obligation to pay unemployment to laid - off workers .
( Eric Ruder | SW )
While unemployment benefits are paid out by the government , companies pay unemployment insurance taxes in most states .
Although the formula varies from state to state , a company 's unemployment insurance rates are in large part based on the amount of benefits their workers collect when they lose their jobs .
More and more companies are deciding that they can save money by blocking former employees from receiving benefits .
According to state and federal laws , workers who are fired for misbehavior or quit voluntarily are ineligible for unemployment benefits .
The proportion of claims that were challenged on the basis of so - called misconduct has doubled since the 1980s to 16 percent , according to the Urban Institute .
Laws in some states have made it easier for companies to block benefits , broadening the definition of employee misconduct and putting the burden on the worker to prove his right to receive benefits .
Thus , Texas and Florida have a higher rate of challenges " because the employers basically have to meet a lower bar to establish misconduct , " said Wayne Vroman , an economist and researcher at the Urban Institute .
The courts also typically favor employers in their rulings .
Some companies spend the extra money to hire firms that specialize in helping them challenge former employees .
The Post reported on a company named TALX , whose Web site boasted that it had removed " over $ 6 billion in unemployment claims liability annually . "
These are n't the only vultures waiting to prey off of the unemployed .
Some 30 states now provide debit cards through which unemployed workers can receive their benefits .
The catch : checking a balance or withdrawing the benefits that they are owed comes with a fee .
Citigroup , Bank of America Corp. , JPMorgan Chase and US Bancorp all have deals with states to handle the debit cards , with fees ranging from 50 cents to check a balance to a $ 20 overdraft fee .
In many states , the debit card is the only option for unemployed workers to collect their benefits .
According to an Associated Press report , " Some banks , depending on the agreement negotiated with each state , also make money on the interest they earn after the state deposits the money and before it 's spent .
The banks and credit card companies also get roughly 1 percent to 3 percent off the top of each transaction made with the cards . "
" They 're trying to use my money to make money , " said Arthur Santa - Maria , a laid - off engineer who lives just outside Albuquerque , N.M. " I just see banks trying to make that 50 cents or a buck and a half when I should be given the service for free . "
The AP calculated that Central Bank , which handles the cards for the state of Missouri -- with 94,883 people claiming unemployment benefits through debit cards -- stood to make an average of $ 6.3 million a year .
EXISTING UNEMPLOYMENT
rules already leave out thousands of workers .
Even though the majority of jobless workers contributed to unemployment insurance , only 36 percent collect benefits , according to the Department of Labor .
Individual states decide on eligibility rules .
Many deny benefits to several categories of workers -- for instance , workers who are looking for part - time work only ; workers who left their jobs for " compelling family reasons , " such as a child 's illness or domestic abuse ; or workers who had previously exhausted benefits and are now in training programs .
Many workers do n't even seek out benefits , because they think they are ineligible or are confused by the rules in their state .
As part of the recently passed stimulus bill , the federal government is allotting $ 7 billion to try to entice states into broadening the categories of workers who will receive benefits .
The legislation would also offer money to states that agree to update their unemployment insurance rules so they use the most recent payment information when determining a worker 's benefits .
Many states still exclude workers ' most recent three to five months of employment when determining if they have worked and earned enough to qualify for benefits , because the rules were instituted before widespread use of computers .
The stimulus plan will increase weekly benefits by $ 25 through 2009 and extend benefits for up to 33 weeks -- an immediate improvement for a growing number of workers .
Joyce Burke has been trying to find a job for more than a year after losing her job at Chase Bank in Westerville , Ohio .
" I 'm only getting $ 200 a week in unemployment , " Burke told the Columbus Dispatch .
" I 'd never been on unemployment before .
Now I eat one meal a day . "
The stimulus bill 's $ 7 billion is recognition that the safety net for unemployed workers as it exists today is grossly insufficient .
But much more is needed to overcome the injustices that face workers after they 've already suffered the blow of losing their job .
In this day and age , it ’s quite common to have to do some housecleaning on your computer to make room for more clutter .
While moving stuff around on my home computer and trying to figure out what data I had and where it could be moved to free up space on my hard drive , I ran across an old FITS data file from my college days .
The cryptic filename only told me that it was taken in May and that it was likely the 132nd image in a sequence .
I was curious and decided I would investigate it to see what I had uncovered .
Perhaps it was a dull star - field image from my data - collecting days in the study of dwarf novae ; I was n’t sure .
Mathematica was the most convenient tool I had handy for viewing FITS data , so I decided to take it for a spin .
It was obvious that it was n’t a star field , but some sort of extended object .
More investigations were needed .
What was it ?
FITS , being a data format , typically contains metadata that tells you all sorts of details about what is in the data section .
The header information is rather nonstandard from one file to the next , but can usually be perused for many tidbits of useful information .
From the header data , it was clear that this was taken through the Lowell 31 - inch telescope .
It also told me that the object in question is M87 and that this was a 300 - second exposure .
M87 is an interesting object because it ’s a large elliptical galaxy in a galaxy cluster .
A typical printed photograph of this region is usually highly overexposed to show many of the other surrounding galaxies .
Because it is overexposed , much of the information gets lost quickly in the glare .
Because the FITS data format is not a raster format , but has a much larger dynamic range of values that can be analyzed , it is possible to scale our view of the full collected data and overcome the limits of standard photographic techniques .
The image that follows is simply a brightened version of the default view .
In many ways , it resembles what we might usually see in a printed photo of this area , although it ’s unpolished .
The dark donuts are the shadows of unfocused dust grains in the image plane , either on the CCD itself or on the optics or filters .
The dust shadows can be reduced by doing image reduction , which involves some image algebra with calibration frames that I was lucky enough to find — a bias frame , which is essentially a constant frame that must be subtracted from all frames involved in the reduction process , and a flat - field frame , which is an image of a uniformly illuminated field that gives you a map of where the irregularities are .
You can divide each image frame by the normalized flat field to remove these artifacts .
After processing and some additional rescaling , we can get an image with less noticeable dust artifacts .
A more deliberate attempt to obtain such a clean image would have had better results , but this is n’t bad .
If we rescale the image again , we can bring out the odd protrusion seen in the original image .
We can zoom in for a closer analysis .
It turns out that this image , which was taken just to be a pretty picture to add to the visually boring data frames we had collected , contained a surprise .
What was unexpected is that we detected a rather famous structure at the core of M87 .
M87 is known to house a supermassive black hole .
As matter falls into the black hole , large relativistic jets of matter are spewed out .
The strange protrusion is one of these jets !
This picture was not intended to capture this ; it was an accident , but a wonderful surprise .
We can compare this short five - minute exposure to the much more famous image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope .
Obviously , my image is in a far more raw form than the one taken by Hubble , but to run across such a random tidbit of data and have Mathematica reveal such a surprise on my home computer is just plain cool !
It will be interesting to see if the new Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson reacts to this protest against the stupid and repressive Labour Government 's terrorism laws , and the inept way in which some of his officers interpret them :

Photographers snap into action over new law
Comedian Mark Thomas is to join with NUJ members in an event to highlight the threat of a new UK law that could be used against press photographers taking pictures of the police .
The Counter Terrorism
Act allows for the arrest and imprisonment of anyone whose pictures are " likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism " .
The union is joining with campaigners to organise a mass picture taking session outside London 's police HQ on Monday 16 February - the day the act becomes law .
Mark - who uses his comedy act to expose state and corporate wrongdoing - will be joined outside New Scotland Yard by renowned documentary - maker Chris Atkins , NUJ vice - president Pete Murray and a bevy of photographers .
Photojournalist and NUJ member Marc Vallée said : " The plan is simple , turn up with your camera and exercise your democratic right to take a photograph in a public place . "
There have already been cases of photographers stopped from working by police quoting anti-terror laws .
John Toner , the NUJ 's organiser who looks after freelance photographers , said : " Police officers are in news pictures at all sorts of events - football matches , carnivals , state processions - so the union wants to make it clear that taking their pictures is not the act of a criminal .
" Our members are photographers - not terrorists . "
Roy Mincoff , NUJ Legal Officer , said : " Photographers do not want to endanger the health and safety of the police or the public - but it is important in a democracy that they can do their jobs properly without facing unnecessary legal restrictions . "
The photo taking will start at 11 am outside New Scotland Yard on Broadway , London .

WITH three Afghan government ministries in Kabul hit by simultaneous suicide attacks this week , by a total of just eight terrorists , it seems that a new “ Mumbai model ” of swarming , smaller - scale terrorist violence is emerging .
The basic concept is that hitting several targets at once , even with just a few fighters at each site , can cause fits for elite counterterrorist forces that are often manpower - heavy , far away and organized to deal with only one crisis at a time .
This approach certainly worked in Mumbai , India , last November , where five two - man teams of Lashkar - e - Taiba operatives held the city hostage for two days , killing 179 people .
The Indian security forces , many of which had to be flown in from New Delhi , simply had little ability to strike back at more than one site at a time .
While it ’s true that the assaults in Kabul seem to be echoes of Mumbai , the fact is that Al Qaeda and its affiliates have been using these sorts of swarm tactics for several years .
Jemaah Islamiyah  the group responsible for the Bali nightclub attack that killed 202 people in 2002  mounted simultaneous attacks on 16 Christian churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 , befuddling security forces .
Even 9/11 itself had swarm - like characteristics , as four small teams of Qaeda operatives simultaneously seized commercial aircraft and turned them into missiles , flummoxing all our defensive responses .
In the years since , Al Qaeda has coordinated swarm attacks in Saudi Arabia , Tunisia , Turkey , Yemen and elsewhere .
And at the height of the insurgency in Iraq , terrorists repeatedly used swarms on targets as small as truck convoys and as large as whole cities .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown says that the current financial crisis should be viewed as an opportunity to create a " new global order " , ahead of a week of meetings with world leaders .
Speaking in London , Brown - due to meet the leaders of Japan , South Korea and China in the next seven days - renewed a warning against protectionism , urging countries to instead help set " new rules for this new global order " .
Brown , who will also meet the president of the World Bank , cautioned that if a consensus was not built supporting globalisation , " all our prosperities " would be imperiled .
He has previously argued for stronger international co-operation better to regulate financial institutions , and said on Monday that he wanted to work towards better cross - border regulation at a summit of the Group of 20 industrialised and developing countries in London in April .
His speech came just days after official data confirmed Britain was in its first recession - defined as two quarters running of negative economic growth - since 1991 .

One of the offending images removed by Google Google has removed dozens of photos from its new UK Street View service .
The street - mapping facility launched amid a fanfare of publicity but now the firm has been forced to pull some of the images after complaints .
It is thought the pictures removed contained revealing images of homes , a man entering a London sex shop , people being arrested and a man being sick .
A spokesperson for Google told the BBC that anyone could have their images removed if they asked .
" We 've got millions of images , so the percentage removed was very small , " Google 's Laura Scott told the BBC .
Google have replaced offending images with a black screen " We want this to be a useful tool and it 's people 's right to have their image removed .
" The fact there are now gaps [ in Street View ] shows how responsive we are , " she added .
Street View first launched in the United States in May 2007 and is already available in Japan , Australia , New Zealand , France , Spain and Italy .
The Netherlands version of the service also launched on Thursday , bringing the total number of countries covered to nine .
The imagery available comprises video taken along 22,369 miles of UK streets by customised camera cars .
SEND US YOUR PICTURES Michaela Livingstone managed to find herself on Google Street View .
Have you spotted anything unusual ?
Send pictures to yourpics@bbc.co.uk
Manic street features Street scenes in 25 UK cities from Aberdeen to Southampton can be viewed using the service .
Offending photos have been replaced by a black image with the message " This image is no longer available " .
However , many of the images can still be viewed by moving up or down a notch on the street .
Dr Ian Brown , a privacy expert at the Oxford Internet Institute , said he was not surprised that there were some offending images .
" This is exactly what you would expect from a service that relies on individuals to help Google not make mistakes , " he said .
" They [ Google ] should have thought more carefully about how they designed the service to avoid exactly this sort of thing . "
Many of the removed images can still be seen from a different angle Dr Brown said Google could have taken images twice , on different days , so offending images could have been easily replaced and protected privacy better .
Google says it has gone to great lengths to ensure privacy , suggesting that the service only shows imagery already visible from public thoroughfares .
It also uses face recognition technology to blur out faces and registration plates that appear in the images .
The Information Commissioner 's Office ruled in 2008 that the blurring was sufficient to ensure that privacy was maintained .

All I was after was a simple .INI file reader in C or C ++.
You know , to parse [ section ] and name=value lines for config files .
We needed it for an embedded Linux project , so it had to be small , portable and only dependent on the C and C++ standard libraries .
Maybe it ’s my embedded background that makes me defensive about my mild case of Not - Invented - Here syndrome .
Then again , perhaps I ’m in good company .
But surely there are tons of INI parsing libraries around , right ?
Well , kind of .
I found no fewer than 15 in under an hour .
But why is it that things like this are either way off the mark ( bloated or non-portable ) or they ’re very close , but just not quite what you want ?
Below is the list of INI file readers that I found , from bad to better .
Some of the ones that were n’t for me might well suit your application , so treat this as something of a non-exhaustive list of INI file readers :
Not for me
SDL_Config : Rather bloated … somehow 246KB of source code just to read an INI file does n’t do it for me .
I also admit to being a bit icked out by five levels of pointer indirection , for example : file -> internal_file -> global_group.multi_value_iterator = ...
ini.c by Carey Bloodworth : Small and in C , but has a funny API and is ripe with buffer overrun goodness .
GetPrivateProfileString API : Fine API , but of course Win32 only .
CIniReader by Xiangxiong Jian : C++ class , nice and simple , but Win32 only ( uses GetPrivateProfileString ) .
) . CIniFile by Ludvik Jerabek : C++ class , but uses loads of non-portable MFC helper classes .
Update : Ludvik ’s now added a portable version to this page .
Half way there
SimpleIni by Brodie Thiesfield : C++ , cross platform , and not really bad , but it just shows that “ simple ” is in the eye of the beholder .
Does one really want 110KB of heavy duty , template - driven C++ code just to read an INI file ?
Config by freejack : Tantalising … a C++ class with a nice API , only 5 KB of code ( as it should be ) , and optional environment variable expansion .
The problem ?
What it parses are not quite INI files , but his own special “ structured config files ” .
Which is all very nice , but not exactly INI - compatible .
( Admittedly this could easily be hacked into an INI reader . )
Boost .
Program_options : C++ , and not bad code , but it ’s more of a fully - fledged “ program configuration library ” than just an INI file reader .
Plus , we were n’t yet sure we wanted a dependency on Boost .
CIniFile by Silviu Simen : C++ class , a little better , but relies on the Boost .
Spirit parsing library .
M’s INI parser : C++ , not bad , small , portable and uses the STL , but relies on the re2c scanner generator , giving it another dependency and making the code harder to read ( and modify ) .
So very close
minIni by CompuPhase :
So very close , does just what you want ( also writes INI files ) , and in only 17KB of portable C source , great for embedded systems … but re-reading the INI file for every name=value pair you need somehow just does n’t sit right .
pair you need somehow just does n’t sit right .
CDataFile by Gary McNickle :
This one looks decent — small , C++ , uses the STL instead of MFC or its own fancy dictionary type … I probably would have used this had I seen it sooner .
libinifile by Anders Lövgren :
This one ’s quite good too .
Minimal , portable , low memory footprint , but a slightly unusual API ( partly to give it the low memory footprint ) .
I might well have used this one too , had I found it sooner .
libini by Simon White : Plain C , SWIGgable , fairly small , though has a bit of an odd API ( and I ’m struggling to see why a simple INI file reader needs a 665 KB configuration script :-) .
iniParser by Nicolas Devillard :
This is the one we ended up using .
Small ( about 32 KB of source ) and fast .
The only minor drawback is that it implements its own dictionary type in C , and we ’re using the STL which already has one .
( Still , in C , what else can you do ? )
Also , it looks like it ’s been around forever and is well tested .
INI Not Invented Here ( INIH )
Of course , in the time it took to investigate all these , I could have easily written my own .
And , being unable to help myself , I did . :-)
So I present you with my own offering : INI Not Invented Here , a.k.a.
INIH or simply ini.h .
It contains a small C function , ini_parse ( ) , that parses an INI file and executes the given callback function for each name=value pair parsed ( think SAX ) .
The reason I used the callback style is so you do n’t have to load the whole file into memory if you do n’t need to — good for embedded systems .
Plus , I wanted to be able to use the parser easily in C , but not implement a dictionary - like structure in C .
For a more user - friendly , lookup style API if you ’re using C++ , I ’ve wrapped ini_parse ( ) in a class called INIReader , which has Get ( ) and GetInteger ( ) methods ( all I needed ) .
And it ’s easy to sub-class INIReader if you need fancier GetXYZ ( ) functions .
Show us the code
UPDATE : I ’ve moved the code from here to its own Google Code project at http://code.google.com/p/inih/ — enjoy !

The top secret UFO files compiled by Denmark ’s Air Force over the past 30 years have finally been declassified and opened to public perusal .
Some 15,000 reported UFO sightings are detailed in the files , offering plenty for UFO buffs to drool over .
The Danish government decided to release the files because they felt “ there was nothings secret in the files . ”
The Copenhagen Post reports that most of the sightings remain unidentified because there was not enough precise information to make a judgment .
Many of the sightings , however , were found to be aircraft , weather phenomenon and the like .
But not all the sightings were over Danish territory , and rumor has it one sighting over Greenland is drawing particular attention from UFO enthusiasts .
The Greenland incident happened on 5 January 1981 , when a square flaming object appeared over the frozen tundra near Thule Air Base .
The object disappeared as suddenly as it appeared .
Interestingly , the neighbouring American military base recorded the exact same thing .
Danish Air Force Captain Thomas Petersen is an expert on the UFO files , and told the Copenhagen Post that the Air Force ’s primary concern is defending Denmark against outside threats .
“ UFOs are not a known threat , ” Peterson teasingly commented .
This month 's Seventeen tells the story of Brooke , a high school student whose naked cell phone photo got her kicked off the cheerleading squad .

Brooke ( her last name does n't appear in the article ) and a female friend took a naked picture of themselves after a shower .
The girls say they did n't send the photo to anyone , but soon it ended up making the rounds at school .
Brooke 's boyfriend was mad , not because someone tried to embarrass her , because " everyone knew what his girlfriend looked like naked . "
The creepiest part : someone sent the principal an unmarked envelope with the photo in it , and the principal reacted by booting Brooke off the cheerleading team for being " a bad representative of the school and squad . "
Basically , Brooke was punished because someone else chose to send a naked picture of her to an authority figure .
That person , who presumably wanted to humiliate her , was rewarded .
Sure , keeping naked pictures on your cell phone is dumb — and the Seattle Post - Intelligencer reports that Brooke did this once before — but is it wrong ?
Even if you 're a teen , taking pictures of yourself for your own ( or your partner 's ) enjoyment is n't a moral failing , it 's just unwise .
Brooke does n't deserve any more punishment than the humiliation she got at school — and she did n't even deserve that .

Even more disturbingly , some teens have been charged with disseminating child pornography for " sexting " nude pics of themselves to their boyfriends .
According to Dalia Lithwick in the new Newsweek , three girls in Pennsylvania were brought up on child porn charges for " sexting " their boyfriends , and girls in Ohio and Michigan were charged with felonies for similar " crimes . "
Lithwick says one in five teens has taken or posted naked pictures of him or herself .
She continues :
A recent New York Times article [ link added ] quotes the Family Violence Prevention Fund , a nonprofit domestic - violence - awareness group , saying that the sending of nude pictures , even if done voluntarily , constitutes " digital dating violence . "
But do we truly believe that one in five teens is participating in an act of violence ?
Experts insist the sexting trend hurts teen girls more than boys , fretting that they feel " pressured " to take and send naked photos .
Paradoxically , the girls in the Pennsylvania case were charged with " manufacturing , disseminating or possessing child pornography " while the boys were merely charged with possession .
If the girls are the real victims , why are we treating them more harshly than the boys ?
Some girls may truly feel pressured to participate in sexting , and in some cases a teen 's desire to send nude pictures of herself could be an indicator of bigger problems , like abuse .
But if that 's the case , sexters need help , not prosecution .
And in some cases , all a teen may need is a talking - to about the dangers of digital media and the potential consequences of his / her choices .
Whether or not sexting is an indication of deeper problems , we agree with Lithwick : " Child - pornography laws intended to protect children should not be used to prosecute and then label children as sex offenders . "

WHEN President Obama speaks before Congress and the nation tonight , he will be facing some of his toughest critics .
Grammar junkies .
Since his election , the president has been roundly criticized by bloggers for using “ I ” instead of “ me ” in phrases like “ a very personal decision for Michelle and I ” or “ the main disagreement with John and I ” or “ graciously invited Michelle and I . ”
The rule here , according to conventional wisdom , is that we use “ I ” as a subject and “ me ” as an object , whether the pronoun appears by itself or in a twosome .
Thus every “ I ” in those quotes ought to be a “ me . ”
So should the president go stand in a corner of the Oval Office ( if he can find one ) and contemplate the error of his ways ?

A parasitic wasp lays its eggs into a caterpillar , at the same time delivering a hybrid virus ( Image : Alex Wild/myrmecos.net )
A historical viral infection gave some insects genes that allow them to parasitise their caterpillar hosts , a new study finds .
Many species of wasps lay their eggs inside caterpillars .
To make this possible , the wasps ’ have a secret weapon in the form of a dose of virus - like particles that are injected along with the eggs .
Not only do these disable the caterpillars ’ immune system to stop it attacking the eggs , they also cause paralysis and keep the host from pupating – turning the caterpillar into an eternally youthful larder and nursery for the wasp grubs .

A closer look at these particles reveals that , although they look like viruses , they contain genetic material from the wasp , which is transcribed into the caterpillars ’
DNA – causing production of the very toxins that bring about their downfall .
Ancient infection
Essentially , the caterpillars produce their own poison , says Jean - Michel Drezen , a molecular biologist at the National Center for Scientific Research ( CNRS ) in Tours , France , who led the study .
Now Drezen ’s team says it has identified traces of a roughly 100 - million - year - old viral infection that gave rise to the unique wasp - virus hybrids .
Scientists first identified the particles in the 1960s , yet did n’t know what to make of them .
They resemble other viruses under the gaze of an electron microscope , but their genomes do n’t match those of any other known virus .
Some scientists suggested that the wasps independently evolved the ability to produce the virus - mimicking particles , says James Whitfield , an entomologist at the University of Illinois in Urbana - Champaign , who had a hunch that true viruses were involved .
Wasp hijackers
“ The spectre arose that the wasps were doing really clever genetic engineering that looks just like a virus but is really a wasp invention , ” he says .
The new study casts doubt on this possibility , though .
Drezen ’s team identified up to 22 viral genes expressed in wasp ovaries , yet not housed in the virus particles .
The sequences matched those of an obscure family of insect pathogens , called nudiviruses .
These genes produce proteins that form the coat of nudiviruses , as well as package DNA into virus particles .
Viruses usually stuff their own DNA into these capsid shells , along with the occasional host stowaway .
The wasps , it seems , have hijacked the entire system to shove its genes into the virus particles .
Drezen is still piecing together this evolutionary puzzle , but he thinks parasitic wasps were infected with a nudivirus roughly 100 million years ago .
‘ Lottery win ’
Gradually , the wasp and virus coevolved to a mutually beneficial relationship : viruses save the wasps the trouble of producing their own toxins , while the viruses live on in the wasp genome .
Viruses “ won the lottery big time if you ’re thinking about their genes , ” says Whitfield .
The sinister nature of this practice wo n’t surprise anyone familiar with parasitic wasps .
Some turn their victims into mindless zombies , left only barely alive until the wasp eggs hatch .
Yet another species keeps fly larvae alive long enough so it can survive the winter , thanks to an antifreeze compound made by the flies .
Charles Darwin even used one family of parasitic wasps as evidence for natural selection , writing to a colleague : “ I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars . ”

I know what you ’re thinking , but do n’t worry , there ’s nothing wrong with your eyes .
CNBC is reporting that Microsoft is planning on opening up its own line of Microsoft branded stores in an attempt to emulate the success of Apple ’s retail stores .
Microsoft ’s new endeavor seems to raise more questions than it answers , and it ’s perplexing why Microsoft is attempting to follow Apple into the cut - throat business of retail when a number of other high profile stores from other tech companies have ended in failure .
One of the bigger problems with a Microsoft store is the fact that there ’s simply no need for them .
You can walk into any electronics store and immediately see what Microsoft products are out on the market .
Walk into your local Best Buy and you ’re bombarded with a never - ending display of machines running Windows .
In that regard , comparisons to Apple retail stores are misguided to the extent that Apple ’s foray into the retail world was rooted in necessity .
In the early 2000 ’s , there were n’t that many places for Mac users to peruse and purchase Apple hardware and software .
Not only that , but the few places that did happen to sell Apple products were often staffed by employees with no familiarity with Apple products , and they would often direct users to machines they were familiar with – Windows machines .
The necessity for a Microsoft store aside , one also has to wonder what products in particular Microsoft is planning to showcase .
Dell machines ?
HP machines ?
Sony Vaio’s ?
Netbooks ?
Smartphones ?
They might all be running Microsoft software , but the user experience for each machine can vary in a number of different ways , and if anything , such a setup might end up confusing customers who ca n’t figure out why the trackpad on one machine works a lot differently than the trackpad on another , or why some machines have built in webcams and others do n’t .
Microsoft , of course , could remedy this by only housing consistent high quality hardware , but you ’re still left with the problem of not showing consumers anything they have n’t already seen before .
Microsoft is also planning on showcasing Windows Mobile devices at its stores , but again , the potential for customer confusion among the wide variety of Windows Mobile enabled smartphones might end up confusing customers as opposed to attracting them .
Also , until Windows Mobile 7 becomes available , the current line up of Windows Mobile devices will have a hard time competing against the iPhone , the G1 , any BlackBerry device , and the upcoming Palm Pre .
In this respect , Microsoft ’s problem in regards to mobile software is n’t visibility , but rather an issue of quality .
Ultimately , Microsoft ’s problem is the fact that it ’s been the dominant company in Software for over 15 years now .
It ’s the classic case of being the victim of your own success .
When you have 98 % ( now 90 ) of the market , the only place to go is down .
Windows 7 might be an operating system blessed by the UI gods themselves , but the fact remains that Microsoft does n’t need to sell upgrade copies of its new OS in order to be successful .
Any customer buying a new PC will automatically be purchasing Windows 7 , so in that regard , Microsoft ’s success is already built in .
At best , a Microsoft Store might be able to convince users thinking of switching over to Apple from doing so .
But entering the vicious retail business to keep that small segment of users seems like more trouble than its worth .
The situation is exacerbated even more when one takes the floundering economy into account .
With all that said , I do n’t see how a Microsoft branded store would be anything but bad news for the good folks up in Redmond .
Dozens of white - owned farms in Zimbabwe have reportedly been invaded by supporters of President Robert Mugabe this month as the long - time opposition joined a national unity government .
Some suspect this is part of an attempt by hardline Mugabe supporters to scuttle the agreement .
Catherine Meredith , 40 , tells the BBC what happened to her farm .
On February 6 , a crowd of 30 men showed up on our land .
Most of them were young , many of them wearing [ President Mugabe's ] Zanu - PF T - shirts .
I was away in South Africa visiting my son at university but my husband had stayed behind .
We had a feeling that something could happen so we decided one of us should stay .
They told my husband that our farm was now being taken over by a local businessman .
Their manner was boastful and arrogant .
When I came back from South Africa a few days later , I was advised by the French embassy not to return to the farm ( I 'm originally from France ) .
This is because in 2008 there were similar invasions of white - owned farms and it got quite violent .
Back then , there were people threatening to kill us and we had to leave our farm for some time .
This time , there was less violence , but I was in touch with my staff on the mobile from Harare .
They told me the invaders had been menacing towards them and stopped them from working .
This made my staff very angry , but they were under strict instructions from me not to lose it .
' Rent - a - crowd '
After a week , my husband and I returned to the farm .
In the meantime we had obtained a court order in Harare saying the squatters had no right to our land .
Past farm occupations by so - called war veterans have turned violent
The crowd was still there .
The atmosphere was very tense , very unpleasant .
We calmly handed the eviction papers to the leader of the pack .
We want to follow the law by the letter .
The local sheriff was with us .
He explained to them that they had no right to be there .
They kept saying they had n't been violent .
But that is n't true .
Last week they seized a member of my staff and pushed his face to the ground to get him to hand over the keys to our garden gate .
Then , 17 of them broke into our garden .
Luckily , the police for once stuck up for us and prevented them from breaking into our house .
These squatters are arbitrary people who have been paid to squat on our farm .
We call them ' rent - a- crowd ' .
But generally the local police have n't been very helpful .
Despite the eviction order , they have n't tried to force the squatters off our land .
They claim they have n't got the manpower to help us .
' Greedy people '
There are several reasons why these people have invaded our land now , just as a new unity government emerges .
Either it 's a last push from Zanu - PF to seize all commercial white farms .
The businessman who ordered the invasion is a Zanu - PF member - He seems to be a collector of farms
Or it 's an attempt by the old regime to endanger the new government and show that it is n't working .
Or it 's just the last attempt of a group of greedy people who do n't own their own farm to grab one from others .
Although the men that invaded our farm were wearing Zanu - PF T - shirts , it does n't necessarily mean they are members of the party .
They might just be one of the few t- shirts they own - Zanu has handed out so many .
But the businessman who ordered the invasion is a Zanu - PF member .
He seems to be a collector of farms - he already owns three others that he has taken by force .
Financially this has cost us a great deal .
The man who ordered the crowd to seize our land has allowed his cattle to walk through our maize fields .
This has partly destroyed our crops .
Emotionally , it 's absolutely draining .
You think you are protected by the law and then this happens .
All of our children are grown up and have moved away and thank goodness for that .
Otherwise we would have to worry about their safety as well .
On the surface , this invasion seems more peaceful than the one last year .
But there are still about 12 of them on our land and you never know what they are capable of .
They drink and smoke pot quite a bit , and it worries me .
I have lived here since I was 23 .
Zimbabwe is my home now , I would n't know where else to go .
My husband was born in this area and he speaks Shona .
We belong here .
We are not giving up .
We strongly believe that change is coming to Zimbabwe .
My feeling is that we are very near the end of these troubles .
We have a new prime minister now .
I 'm 100 % confident that in five years ' time , I 'll still be living on this farm .

1 . The Governor General is a made up job , with zero authority .
Its equivalent in the American Government would be the Secretary of Education .
2 . The prime minister is the Canadian head of government .
Like the president , but without all the cool limos or helicopters or personal plane .
Your president is kind of like a G.I .
Joe figure now that I think about it .

William Shatner , star of the 1982 hit T.J. Hooker , made headlines in Canada last week when he announced he would like to run the country one day .
The announcement came when Shatner was responding to a letter from a fan requesting that he put himself forward for the position of Governor Generalof Canada .
The actor , also known for playing the role of William Shatner in a variety of different films , replied to the fan stating that if he was to serve any role in Canadian government , it would be that of the Prime Minister .
As far as Bill Shatner is concerned , ceremonial roles are bullshit .
A Canadian Walk of Famehonoree , Shatner has never served in any sort of political role before , nor expressed any interest in public policy , nor possesses any leadership experience outside of that gained on a cheaply made television show that was canceled 40 years ago .
Yet , despite these setbacks , his " fresh " face might be an asset in Canadian politics , where the existing leadership of all the parties are
The Medieval European Knight vs .
The Feudal Japanese Samurai ?
By J. Clements
ARMA Director
From time to time it is interesting to ponder the outcome of an encounter between two of history 's most formidable and highly skilled warriors : the Medieval European knight and the feudal Japanese samurai .
The thought of " who would win " in an actual fight between these martial experts of such dissimilar methods is intriguing .
Who would emerge victorious or who was historically the better fighter is a question occasionally raised , but it is really a moot question .
In the case of comparing a knight to a samurai , each warrior used armor , weapons , and methods oriented towards the particular opponents of their day and age .
Therefore , neither can be looked upon as being universally more effective under all conditions against all manner of opponents .
In one sense , it is like asking who are better soldiers , jungle fighters or ski troops ?
It depends upon the situation and the environment .
Still , it 's an interesting encounter to consider .
Having some small experience in the methods and weaponry of each , as well as a few cross- training opportunities , I offer my humble thoughts on the matter .
The Scenario First of all , we must ask where is it these two lone warriors would meet ?
Under what circumstances ?
Since the conditions of this imaginary fight could play a major factor , it can be proposed that such an encounter would best take place on a flat , firm , open field with no cover and plenty of room to maneuver .
Though each is an accomplished horseman , it would also be conducive to have the single - combat duel occur dismounted , alone , on foot and without use of missile weapons .
Interestingly , the same climate and weather for each would be just about right .
There are a great many intangibles to consider here .
The ability of each combatant to read or size up their opponent and the threat they posed would be an important consideration .
Are both to be briefed on the nature of their opponent and his armaments ?
Or will the encounter be a blind one in which neither knows anything about their adversary ?
We might want to just assume that each of our ideal combatants has been informed to some degree regarding the other and therefore mentally prepared and composed .
Of course , if we are supposing a clash between two " typical warriors " , we must also ask exactly what will be considered typical ?
The knights of circa 1100 and the samurai of circa 1200 were roughly evenly matched in equipment .
But the same comparative warriors during the 1400's for instance , were quite dissimilar .
Each of the two historical warriors in question did fight with equivalent technologies , under fairly similar climates and terrain , and for similar reasons .
But it 's difficult to think in terms of a " generic " Medieval knight or a " standard " samurai warrior .
With respect to a European knight , it 's not easy to choose what nationality , and what type of warrior from which portion of the overall Middle Ages .
With the samurai though , we are dealing with a single , homogenous culture and one in which versions of their historical martial traditions have survived , in one form or another , fairly intact .
Thus we have a somewhat better idea of the average samurai 's training and ability through the centuries than compared to contemporary European warriors .
Then again , it 's sometimes argued that today 's version of modern civilian budo ( " war ways " ) is not equivalent to the historical military bujutsu ( " war skills " ) of the samurai .
At the same time , while we may not have an extant tradition of knightly martial arts any longer , we however do have volumes of actual training manuals from the era describing in technical detail for us just what their skills and methods at the time were all about .
As for the knight , are we assuming he will be a maile clad Norman with sword and kite shield from the year 1066 ?
An English or French chevalier of 1350 in partial plate with arming sword ready for duel in the champ clos ?
Will he be an Italian condottieri from 1450 resplendent in full regalia ?
Or will he be a Teutonic knight of circa 1400 in a head - to - toe suit of articulated Gothic plate - armor and bastard sword ?
Will the samurai be wearing the older box - like Muromachi armor and armed with a tachi blade ?
Or will he wear the later close fitting Kamakura period do - maru armor and use the more familiar katana ?
For that matter , would the samurai be allowed to use both his long katana and his wakizashi short sword together ?
These are significant matters that get at the heart of why such a question as who would " win " or who is the " better " fighter ( or even whose equipment was better ) really is unanswerable .
Of course , for the sake of engaging discourse let us hypothesize just what would happen if these two comparable individuals , each highly trained and experienced in the respective fighting skills of their age , were to meet on the battlefield in single combat to the death (! ) .
As an amusing historical diversion we can at least make an educated guess to what would possibly be , not the result , so much as some of the key decisive elements of such an encounter .
The Warriors
We can reasonably assume that the personal attributes such as individual strength , speed , stamina , age , health , and courage , are fairly consistent between such professional warriors .
Assuming we can somehow control for these attributes , we could match combatants with some equality .
It would not be unrealistic to believe on a whole that neither was likely decisively stronger or faster than the other .
Although , we can't discount physiology as a factor and this reasonably would be an advantage for the European ( 16th century samurai armor examples are sized for men around 5 ' 3 " - 5 ' 5 " , while European armor from the same period and earlier would fit men ranging from just under 6 ' to about 6 ' 5 " ) .
Although , other evidence suggests average European heights in the 16th century were just above 5 feet .
Interestingly , while the European concept of physical fitness among knights by the 15th century emphasized the classical Greco - Roman youthful physique of a narrow waist and broad shoulders on a lean frame , the Japanese ideal was one of a more mature man having a wider base and broader middle –no doubt reflecting the natural ethnographic characteristics of each race , but also influencing the fighting techniques they employed .
To what degree this occurred is worth contemplating .
We might also want to consider the forms of warfare each swordsman was experienced in and focused upon .
The early samurai engaged in a ritualized style of warfare where individual champions might fight separate battlefield duels following established protocols , as opposed to a later mounted archery style of combat amidst pike formations of lesser foot soldiers .
Their clan warfare was decidedly feudalistic yet with acquiring and honor and renown also being a goal .
Skirmishing was not also uncommon and there were a few large scale military expeditions to Korea and surrounding islands .
But most combat occurred in the environment of the home islands .
Whereas in contrast , knights emphasized mounted shock warfare with couched lances , and off the field a concern for chivalric and judicial duels as well as tournaments of all kinds .
The Western way of war for knights was directed more at a traditional battle of annihilation as part of an overall campaign of conquest .
Yet , individual challenges , whether to the death or not , were frequent .
Knightly arms and armor were the result of a dynamic interaction of Latin , Celtic , and Germanic cultures as well as Turkish and Arabic influences .
The environment knights fought under was extensive and diverse , ranging from the cold of Scandinavia to the deserts of the Middle East , from the plains of Western Europe to the deep forest of the East , and the swamps , fields , and mountains in between .
There is also no question that athleticism , physical fitness and conditioning were integral parts of knightly chivalric virtue as considerable literary and iconographic evidence from the period testifies .
As a youth , Samurai were not generally trained for any longer length of time than were knights or in any greater diversity of accomplishments .
Along with combat training and courtly graces , a knight was typically taught to dance , swim , read poetry , play chess , to hawk and to hunt with a team , as well as fight as a unit in battle .
Yet , in tournament and joust he was also tutored to excel as an individual .
We cannot overlook the role that culture might play in this contest .
Samurai warriors existed in a hierarchical and conformist culture that rewarded obedience and loyalty over individuality .
Knights existed in a more complex and fluid society that emphasized self - expression with a long tradition of reliance on individual initiative .
Both cultures had experience fighting against outsiders and foreigners : the Europeans encountered the Turks , Mongols , Saracens , and others ; the Japanese encountered the Koreans , Chinese , Mongols , and others .
Thus , in considering the historical record on cross-cultural collisions in different locations , would we want to give the edge to the more socially diverse Europeans on this ?
On an individual basis then , we must consider what effect might be played by the quality of fatalism within the samurai code of bushido , or rather the resolute acceptance of death that motivated the fiercest samurai .
But then , we cannot overlook the quality of piety and faith that could motivate a noble knight to great feats , or of the ideals of chivalry that he might uphold to the death .
It 's possible a Medieval European knight would have a certain disdain and scorn for his foreign , " pagan " adversary .
Of course , the Japanese warrior 's well - known attitude of proud invincibility and readiness to die for his lord could equally make him vulnerable to an unfamiliar foe .
Contempt for life and contempt for a dangerous , unknown opponent you might underestimate can be a disastrous combination .
While courage is important , fighting spirit alone is insufficient .
There are surely intangibles here that we cannot be measured with any reliability .
These and other non-quantifiable , psychological factors aside , we are left with weapons , armor , and training .
The Armor Armor changes things in swordplay .
If you 've never trained in it , you can't imagine how it affects your movements and execution of even simple actions .
It has been said that while Europeans designed their armor to defeat swords , the Japanese designed their swords to defeat armor .
There is a certain truth to this , but it 's a simplistic view .
The better Japanese armor was constructed of small overlapping lacquered metal scales or plates tied together with silk cords in order to specifically resist the slicing cut of the katana .
It allowed good freedom of movement while offering excellent protection .
But if it got wet , the silk cords soaked up water and it became terribly heavy .
Though the earliest styles of samurai armor were designed with large square plates more as a defense against arrows , the later forms were intended primarily to be used by and against similarly equipped swordsmen and to lessen the tremendous cutting capacity of their swords .
It was durable , effective , and provided for ample movement .
But how would it hold up to the stabs of a narrowly pointed knightly sword ?
This is an important question .
Medieval European armor was designed and shaped more to deflect strikes and absorb blunt force blows from lances and swords .
A knight 's armor varied from simple byrnies of fine riveted maile ( " chainmaile " ) that could absorb slices and prevent cuts , to well - padded soft jackets , and metal coats - of - plates which were designed equally to protect from concussion weapons as penetrating thrusts .
Maile armor existed in numerous styles and patterns but arguably reached its zenith in 15th century Western Europe , where closely - woven riveted links could resist any drawing slice as well as being proof against many slashes and thrusts from swords .
Maile of such equivalent was not used in Japan .
Generally speaking , European plate armor was designed primarily as a defense against sword points and other bladed weapons , whereas , Japanese armor was primarily designed more as a defense against arrows and spears .
Significantly , it frequently had open feet and hands and a design that permitted archery .
The knight 's encased armor by contrast was idealized more for mounted charge with lance and or for dismounted close - combat .
Japanese heavy armor contemporary with the period of the High Middle Ages knight was not considerably lighter than European plate .
A complete suit of fully articulated rigid plate - armor , which has been described as unequaled in its ingenuity and strength , was nearly resistant to sword blows and required entirely different specialized weapons to effectively defeat it .
With its tempered steel and careful curved fluting it was just invulnerable to sword cuts - even , it can be surmised , those of the exceptionally sharp katana ( some high - ranking 16th century samurai lords actually owned pieces of contemporary European armor , gifts and purchases which they even wore into battle - they did not prize them merely as exotica ) .
Plate - armor for foot combat was well - balanced , maneuverable , and sometimes even made of tempered steel .
It was well - suited for fighting in , and is far from the awkward , lumbering cliché presented by Hollywood .
Unless you 've worn accurate well - made plate of this kind , it is impossible to really know how it influenced the way a knight would move .
Without the necessary weapons designed intentionally to face and defeat plate armor , any fighter armed with a sword alone would have difficulty ( katana or not ) .
Indeed , full European plate armor with maile might very well damage the keen edge on particularly fine katanas .
After all , we should not forget that despite the katana 's vaunted cutting ability , the samurai were able to successfully rely on their armors as defense against it .
There is every reason to imagine knightly armor would have been just as , if not more , effective .
If we therefore assume the armors to be more evenly matched , say maile and partial plate for the knight as used around 1250 , things would get more interesting .
However , the samurai did often carry an excellent thick dagger which would have been quite useful .
Curiously , each warrior was highly skilled in using their respective armor- piercing daggers and with close - in grappling ( something not generally known about actual knightly fencing skills ) .
The Shield We must consider whether the knight in this hypothetical duel will be armed in the familiar shield and short sword style or will use only a single long - sword ?
If armed with a shield , we must ask what kind ?
Will the knight employ a center - gripped type with front umbo or one worn by enarme straps ?
Will the shield be the highly effective " kite " shape with its superb defense or one of the smaller , more maneuverable convex " heater " styles ?
How about a thick steel buckler ( a fist - gripped hand shield ) ?
There 's a reason virtually every culture developed hand - held shields for close - combat and why they continued to be used literally for thousands of years .
They were very effective .
In 15th century Europe , it was only the combination of the development of full plate armor and two - handed swords combined with heavy pole - arms and powerful missile weapons that finally reduced the long reigning value of the shield in warfare .
The Medieval style of sword and shield fighting is distinctly different from the two - hand grip and quick full - arm slashing cuts of Kenjutsu .
Medieval short swords are properly wielded with more of a throw of the arm and a twist of the hips while making passing steps forward or back .
Strikes are thrown from behind the shield while it simultaneously guards , feints , deflects , or presses .
A sword and shield is a great asset over a single sword alone .
Fighting with sword and shield offers a well - rounded and strong defense that safely permits a wide range of both direct and combination attacks .
A sword can cut quite well from almost all angles around or underneath a shield .
Indeed , since the shield side is so well guarded , the opponent is the one limited to attacking to only one side – the non-shield side .
While a large shield does indeed close off a tremendous amount of targets to an attacker , it also limits , to a far smaller degree , freedom to attack by the shield user .
As it comes out from behind their shield to strike , an attacker 's weapon can be counter - timed and counter - cut –and this is indeed one tactic to employ against a shield user .
Yet a shield user 's attacks are not at all one sided .
A shield can be used offensively in a number of ways and at very close range .
Katanas are powerful swords used with strong techniques , but thinking they could simply cleave through a stout Medieval shield is absurd .
Even with a katana a shield cannot simply be sliced through .
Medieval shields were fairly thick wood covered in leather and usually trimmed in metal .
Not only that , they were highly maneuverable , making solid , shearing blows difficult .
More likely , a blade would be momentarily stuck in the rim if it struck too forcefully .
Unlike what is seen in the movies , or described in heroic literature , chopping into a shield 's edge can temporarily cause the sword blade to wedge into the shield for just an instant and thereby be delayed in recovering or renewing an attack ( and exposing the attacker 's arms to a counter - cut ) .
Shields without metal rims were even favored for this very reason .
Kenjutsu ( Japanese swordsmanship ) , though consisting of very effective counter - cutting actions , also has no real indigenous provisions for fighting shields .
Although a skilled warrior could certainly improvise some , those unfamiliar with the formidable effectiveness and versatility of a sword and shield combination will have a hard time .
The shield was not used the way typically shown in movies , video games , stage - combat , or historical role - playing organizations such as the SCA .
Fighting against a Medieval shield is not simply a matter of maneuvering around it or aiming blows elsewhere .
If a warrior does not really know the shield , or has n't faced a good shield fighter , then they can not be expected to know how to ideally fight against it .
The Samurai's Sword
In major battles among each warrior , a suit of armor was typically worn and a sword wielded in one or two - hands .
For the knight , the primary weapons had always been the long lance and the sword , and to a lesser degree the polaxe , dagger , and mace .
The sword was always the foundational weapon of a Knight 's fencing training .
For the samurai however , the sword was but one of three major weapons along with the bow and arrow and the yari ( thrusting spear ) .
We should consider that , despite their later acquired reputation for swordsmanship , the samurai 's primary weapon was , in fact , not the sword .
The sword really did not even become a premier weapon of samurai culture and reach its cult status until the mid to late 17th century when the civil warring period ended .
It is something of a myth that every individual Japanese samurai was himself an expert swordsman ( no more true than every wild West cowboy was an expert gunfighter ) .
After all , the expression so associated with bushido is " the Way of the horse and bow " , not " the Way of the sword . "
Besides , unlike knightly chivalric tales and combat accounts , the majority of single combats between samurai described in feudal Japanese literature took place with daggers not swords .
But for sake of discussion , let us assume such for both fighters in this imaginary case .
As a sword , the Japanese katana is unmatched in its sharpness and cutting power .
Furthermore , it is particularly good at cutting against metal ( – but no , it only cuts through other swords in movies and video games ! ) .
However , Medieval plate armor is well known for its resistance to cutting , and cutting at a moving target hidden by a shield or a greatsword is not easy .
While the edge of a katana is very strong with a sharp cutting bevel , it is a thick wedge shape and still has to move aside material as it cuts .
Though this is devastating on a draw slice against flesh and bone , it is much less effective against armors .
Realizing this , several styles of Japanese swordsmanship devised specific techniques not to cut at armor , but to stab and thrust at the gaps and joints of it just as the Europeans did against their own plate armor .
The primary technique for fighting nearly any kind of armor with most any kind of sword is not to cut but to thrust at the gaps and joints .
Except for major interaction in Korea and encounters against the Mongols , the katana developed in comparative isolation and is not quite the " ultimate sword " some of its ardent admirers occasionally build it up as .
The katana 's exceptionally hard edge was prone to chipping and needed frequent re-polishing and its blade could break or bend the same as any other sword might (... and no , they wo n't slice through cars or chop into concrete pillars either ) .
It was not designed to take a great deal of abuse , and is not as resilient in flexibility nor intended to directly oppose soft or hard armors as some forms of Medieval swords had to be .
The katana 's design was not set in stone .
It was changed and altered over the centuries like any other sword , being slowly improved or adapted to the different needs and tastes of their users in terms of cross section , curvature , and length .
In the 13th century for instance , their points had to be redesigned because they were prone to snapping against the metal reinforced " studded " leather armor ( essentially equivalent to European brigandine or armor ) of the Mongols and Chinese .
By the 18th century their blades , no longer used earnestly against armor , tended to be made longer , lighter , and thinner for classroom practicing .
True , the Japanese feudal warrior did have their own form of greatsword in the long no dachi blades , these however were employed specifically by lower ranking foot - soldiers against horses ( and presumably , on occasion against pikes ) .
So , we cannot draw an equivalency between these and Medieval greatswords used in knightly fencing arts or to the true two - handers of 16th century European battlefields .
Over all the katana was a very well - rounded design : excellent at cutting and slicing , yet good at thrusting , and suitable for armored or unarmored fighting on foot or horseback , either one or two - handed .
It was a carefully crafted and beautiful weapon reflecting generations of artistry and fearsome necessity , but it was still only a sword –a man-made tool of well - tempered and expertly polished metal .
Though the details of manufacture differed , they were made by the same fundamental scientific processes of heating and hand - working metal by shaping and grinding as were other fine swords around the world throughout history .
Regardless of how they are designed or constructed , all swords have the same goals and perform the same functions : that of guarding against attacks while delivering their own lethal blows .
The Knight 's Swords Having equipped our samurai , we must turn to the sword to be used by our knightly combatant .
It must be understood there was such a great diversity of knightly swords and armor types .
European swords were , in a sense , always specialized rather than generalized designs : there were ones for foot combat , ones for horseback , single and double - hand ones , straight and curved ones , ones for armored and for unarmored fighting , ones for tournaments , ones for civilian duelling , ones ideal just for thrusting or for cutting only , and ones only for training .
A knight 's arming sword was typically a one - handed weapon originally ( but not always ) intended specifically for use with a shield .
Their blades are wide and fairly thin and rigid , with chisel - like edges intentionally designed for cutting through maile armor and deep into flesh and bone with a quick , forceful blow .
They were light , agile , and stiff , yet very flexible to withstand the trauma of use .
They too varied with time from the wider , flatter kinds to those rigid , tapering , sharply pointed and well suited for stabbing both plate and laminated armors .
The later wide - based and acutely pointed style of bastard sword was superb at thrusting .
So , even though Japanese armor for the most part was made up of the same quality steel as went into their weapons , European blades would likely not encounter anything especially difficult with it that they did n't already face .
Although the Medieval sword and shield combination was fairly common , longer blades useable in two hands were in widespread use from about 1250 to roughly 1600 in Europe .
When we talk about Medieval European longswords or war - swords ( or even greatswords ) , we are not dealing with a single uniform style .
There were wide , flat blades with parallel edges well suited to powerful cuts .
Later , swords specifically designed for facing heavier armor had narrower , much more rigid blades of diamond or hexagonal cross-sections that tapered to hard , sharp points .
They were used to whack and bash at armor before stabbing and thrusting into joints and gaps .
They were also employed as short spears and even warhammers , yet were still capable of cutting at more lightly armored opponents .
The difference between these two European blade forms is significant and once more underscores the distinction between the manner of using a katana and a straight Medieval European sword .
The tapering blade form has a different center of balance and is often a lighter blade .
Its point of percussion is located farther down the blade and its fine point is capable of making quick , accurate , and strong thrusts .
The wider style can make a somewhat greater variety of strikes and delivers more effective cuts overall .
But the later is more agile and easier to guard and parry with .
It can also more easily employ its versatile hilt in binding , trapping , and striking .
Its proper techniques and style of use is rarely depicted with any accuracy in movies and staged performances .
Almost never is the proper historical usage shown with its tighter movements , various thrusts , and infighting with the hilt .
The reach factor also cannot be overlooked .
Although a skilled fighter can effectively use a short blade against a long blade or vice versa , and although neither longswords nor katanas had standardized lengths , overall the katana in general is significantly shorter than European two - handed swords and great - swords .
A longer two - edged weapon does have advantages - especially if used by a taller man against a smaller with a shorter single - edge weapon .
Surprisingly though , the weights between the two weapons are actually very similar and vary within the same degrees .
Surprisingly , the longsword or greatsword is arguably a more complex weapon that the katana .
Though there were single - edge versions , it generally has two edges that can be used , as well as a versatile crossguard and pommel permitting a variety of specialized techniques .
Another element to consider is that European swords could be used in " half - sword " techniques where the second hand literally grips around the blade itself to wield the weapon in bashing , deflecting , binding , and trapping in all manner of ways that virtually make it a pole - axe or short spear .
This was especially effective in fighting against plate armor .
We must ponder would this be unusual for the samurai or just very similar to fighting with a short staff ?
Either way , with its especially sharp edge , a katana is not employed quite like this .
Knightly blades could be excellent swords , but are often denigrated merely as crude hunks of iron while samurai swords are venerated and exalted sometimes to the point of absurdity by collectors and enthusiasts ( something the Japanese themselves do not discourage ) .
Bad films and poorly trained martial artists reinforce this myth .
The bottom line is that Medieval swords were indeed well - made , light , agile fighting weapons equally capable of delivering dismembering cuts or cleaving deep into body cavities .
They were far from the clumsy , heavy things they 're often portrayed as in popular media and far , far more than a mere " club with edges . "
Interestingly , the weight of katanas compared to longswords is very close with each on average being less than 4 pounds .
The Swordsmanship
It can be difficult for those not familiar with the nature of a Medieval longsword or greatsword to understand its true manner of use , since the general public as well as martial artists of Asian styles are far more familiar with the katana 's style .
So , if instead of a shield and sword we match a knight with a longsword or greatsword against the katana armed samurai this could make a significant difference .
But , we must not fall into the mistake of judging the Medieval longsword in terms of what we know about classical Japanese fencing .
It is a mistake to think the straight , double - edged Medieval sword with cruciform - hilt is handled like a curved katana .
While there are certainly similarities and universal commonalties between the two styles of swordsmanship ( such as in stances and cuts ) , there are also significant and fundamental differences .
They each make the same basic seven or eight cuts and can thrust .
But as a curved blade with an especially keen edge , the katana is superior in the potential use of quick , short slices .
Yet , as a long , straight blade tapering to a keen point , the longsword is a better thruster .
Additionally , its dual edges , enabled by a graspable pommel , allow it to attack along more lines than just eight standard cuts .
Having two edges to work with can quickly permit back - edge and reverse cuts .
This permits a far larger number of strikes from different angles .
These back edge cuts make up a significant portion of how the straight longsword was wielded and have seldom been appreciated or correctly demonstrated .
The katana is wielded in a quick - flowing manner with a torque of the grip as well as a push of the hips .
Pulling a curved blade in this way makes it slice as it shears .
The footwork is more linear with short quick hopping ( even shuffling ) steps .
In contrast to the slicing slash of a curved , single - edged , Japanese blade , Medieval swords were made for hacking , shearing cuts delivered primarily from the elbow and shoulder and employing wide passing steps .
The actions are larger with more fast whirling actions as the two edges are employed , the pommel alone gripped , or the hands changed to different positions on the hilt ( such as placement of the thumb on the flat of the blade or upon the lip of the cross ) .
As a straight blade it strikes more with a point - of - percussion on the first 6 - 8 inches of blade down from the point as opposed to the curved katana which uses more of just the first few inches .
If we bring into the equation the Medieval bastard - sword with compound - hilt of side - rings and bar - guards as well as the waisted or half - grip handle using various methods of holding , this could also be a significant factor .
Such hilts allow for a variety of significant one or two - hand gripping options and gives superior tip control for thrusting and edge alignment .
When contrasting these two styles of sword we should probably also keep in mind a number of points .
We classify each as longswords because both were blade weapons designed for the same purpose , killing .
It is from this fact that they even have any similarities we can compare .
Differences between them are result of the particularities of their functions and the ways they accomplish their goals .
We should also keep in mind that Japanese swords and sword - arts reflect a living tradition , and one with a long standing interest group in the West promoting its study .
While in contrast , our Medieval heritage has for decades had virtually nothing but Hollywood fantasy and role - players misrepresenting it .
From this , it can be seen that a direct comparison of a European sword to a Japanese one is not possible .
They are " apples and oranges " , so to speak .
They 're both fruit , both delicious , but you can do different , though very similar , things with each .
Educated Guesses
As our hypothetical fight ensued , any number of things might happen .
In the course of striking at one another , a chance blow by either side could possibly end the fight .
The katana may or may not be able to make a lethal or incapacitating cut ( something difficult to do against plate armor , let alone a maile coat with a shield ) .
But the knight , unfamiliar with the aggressive style or nature of his opponent , might throw out a strike that makes him vulnerable to a well - timed counter - attack .
Of course , the samurai might also underestimate the power of the Medieval sword 's cleaving blows and agile thrusts , even against his armor .
The average European two - hand sword is longer in handle and blade than the average katana by several inches to as much as a foot or more and is not at all slow .
It has a versatile hilt used for binding , trapping , and parrying .
But the katana is also a fast weapon that cuts strongly and guards well and comes in a variety of lengths .
Despite its considerable reach though , there are numerous techniques for infighting using the long - sword 's " half " guards and there are many techniques for striking with a shield .
But then the katana is very good at close - in slices , which a straight blade cannot effectively do nearly as well .
Of course , against good armor such actions can be negligible and fighting against shields was relatively unknown in Japan .
So on one hand , the knight 's fighting style –either of close - in sword and shield clashing , or large passing steps with long - reaching shearing cuts and plunging thrusts with a longsword or greatsword –might prove decisive .
On the other , the intense , focused , counter - cutting style of the samurai with his razor - keen blade and own experience in armored fighting might prove decisive .
Then again , maybe they 'd kill one another ?
It could be argued that the samurai by nature could have a tactical advantage in attitude and fortitude as a result of the psychological elements of his training and fighting methods .
He is well - known to have integrated unarmed techniques into his repertoire as well as having a keen sense of an opponent 's strengths and weaknesses .
Still , much of this is intangible and subjective .
Besides , although not widely appreciated , it is now well - documented ( particularly from Medieval Italian and German fighting manuals ) that European knights and men- at - arms fully integrated advanced grappling , wrestling , and disarming techniques into their fighting skills .
They also studied considerably on tactics and the military " sciences . "
There is no evidence to the myth that knightly martial culture was any less sophisticated or highly develop than its Asian counterparts –its traditions and methods only fell out of use with the social and technological changes brought about by advances in firearms and cannon .
While it is known that the average samurai had a large inventory of unarmed fighting techniques at his disposal , these too would be unlikely to play a part against a shield wielding warrior .
Some could suggest that the samurai was simply a better swordsman and more tenacious warrior and would likely out - fight his European counterpart .
Others could say , " No way , " and argue a skilled , superbly conditioned knight in full plate armor using either a sword and shield combination or a longsword would be near invulnerable and brutally overpowering .
Still others could rightly point out that such over - generalized statements either way are un-provable conjecture .
There are so many elements to address and practitioners who are experienced in one form of sword art or familiar with only one type of blade and not others will tend to favor what they 're familiar with .
It is rare to find individuals with a deep grasp of the attributes of each method and the arms involved .
Those who think the Medieval sword and shield was and is just a " wham - bam , whack - whack " fight are as greatly misinformed as those who imagine the katana was handled in some mysterious and secret manner and can cut through anything as if it were a light - saber .
Those who presume the use of Medieval long - sword merely involved a brutish hacking are also under a tremendous delusion .
It is a mystery how such beliefs can be held independently of those who today assiduously study and train in the subject as a true martial art , and spend years in practice with the actual weapons .
Perhaps this ignorance is due to watching too many movies or the influence of fantasy - historical societies with their costumed role - playing .
Medieval and Renaissance sword fighting is often viewed by the uninformed as a wholly subjective matter either consisting of merely brute force and ferocity , or else incapable of reasoned analysis and discernable principles .
Both are equally inaccurate .
It is sad when leading modern fencing masters ( experienced only with the dueling style of light foils , epees , and sabers ) will issue naïve , unschooled statements about how Medieval swords " weighed 20 pounds " or could only be used for " clumsy " bashing and chopping .
There is a definite prejudice that the modern refined fencing sport is " superior " to earlier , more brutal methods .
Without going into the history of warfare , it 's important to state it is a myth that personal combat in Europe was entirely crude , cumbersome , and never an art .
It may perhaps be true that , only in a modern cultural context , it cannot compare to the surviving systematized traditions of feudal Japanese sword arts .
However there is sufficient evidence surviving that when paired with contemporary research has given us a much better under - standing of the function and use of Medieval and Renaissance European arms and armors to confirm that they consisted of a highly effective and dynamic " Science of Defence . "
Keeping our hypothesis broad
To be fair , while there is an extraordinary amount of nonsense and fantasy surrounding historical European swords and sword arts , there is a good deal of myth and ignorance on the true teachings of historical Japanese fencing .
While there is today an active subculture promoting and preserving historical Japanese bujutsu or practicing modern budo and a great deal is also known about their practice , the equivalent can not yet be said for " lost " Medieval or Renaissance fighting arts .
But , at least for the latter , there are dozens of surviving technical guides from the period describing the actual methods and techniques of knights and men- at - arms in great detail .
So , given the complexities of the question of what kind of knightly arms and armor from what period we could consider in a hypothetical knight - samurai encounter , it might be easier to just imagine an unarmored duel , sword against sword , without shields .
Let 's assume that our gladiatorial fantasy would be fought by two respective 15th century warriors with single swords alone .
In this way we essentially have two fighting men both experienced in using a long sword as well as fighting unarmored .
This solves a lot of questions .
But even here the issue is problematic .
We still need to ask what kind of katana and what kind of longsword ?
What length of blade and handle ?
There was no standard generic model for either weapon , after all .
So , assuming that we choose two weapons of comparative dimensions , we could make the knightly longsword of the cruciform - hilted , double - edged , slightly tapering variety .
Under this scenario , the katana would have a slight advantage , we could imagine .
It 's adept in unarmored cut and thrust fighting where the slightest wound from its keen edge could perhaps sever a hand or disabled an arm .
It could also thrust well and might even threaten a pressing or slicing draw if close in .
The half - swording techniques of the longsword would also not be nearly as viable here , though its hilt design might prove very useful .
While the longsword would be menacing in its quick and long - reaching thrust , its stabbing attacks would perhaps not be that unfamiliar to a samurai use to facing spears .
On the other hand , the knight would himself not be that unused at all to facing a curved single - edged blade , likely being skilled in or familiar with such ones as the falchion , badelaire , messer , long Grossemesser , and even Turkish scimitars .
So again , the outcome of the match would come down to intangibles of personal attitude and individual prowess .
As to the issue of the deadliness of thrusting wounds versus cutting ones , well , the historical and forensic evidence does favor the lethality of stabs -- but only in contrast to lacerating flesh wounds not deep cleaving blows .
Considering the many issues brought out in describing the modern reconstruction of historical European martial arts , contrasting them with the practice of Asian fighting arts is a legitimate area of speculation .
If we had a time machine and for depraved research wanted to go back , grab a hundred random Medieval knights and an equal number of samurai , match them one on one and throw them at each other , we might be able to come up some statistical averages ( and some serious ethical problems , as well ) .
In one sense we are talking about very different approaches to armed personal defense in this comparison .
But , then again it's all the same when reduced to two armed combatants facing one another in antagonistic combat .
There are many universal commonalities and shared fundamentals between both European and Japanese feudal warriors , but there were also significant technical and stylistic differences in their respective approaches .
If not , their martial histories and their arms and armors would not have been so distinct .
So what can we really know ?
As can be seen , there are just far too many variables and unknowns to make a judgment either way for such a theoretical question as who could defeat whom between knights and samurai .
The fight cannot be reduced to any generalized statements about who had the overall historical advantage in skill or who had the superior array of arms and armor .
In matters like this we certainly cannot not invoke mystical principles or endless " what ifs " and still engage in intelligent conjecture .
All we can do is give an opinion of questionable value .
Still , it is an intriguing comparison to ponder objectively .
There is so much unnecessary emotion encountered when fervent proponents of one or the other schools of swordsmanship speculates wildly on this topic .
Amusingly , before reflexively reacting with a strong opinion one way or another when thinking about this subject , we might want to stop and ask ourselves to ponder the same imaginary contest between two samurai , for example , a Muromachi era versus say , a Kamakura one .
Or we could do the same for the knight , posing the problem of who would defeat whom , an 11th century Flemish knight or a 14th century Burgundian one ?
By doing this simple mental exercise we can see the inherent problems of arguing one way or another over such imaginary fights .
Keeping in mind that live demonstrations speak louder than any words , hopefully this writing has cleared away some of the prejudice on behalf of both kenjutsu students and Medievalists .
I personally give only limited credit to occasions of cross -sparring by modern practitioners of each respective art , as they seldom can meet under mutually agreeable or equally advantageous conditions for very long .
Personally , while I admire the techniques and principles of kenjutsu as generally being highly effective ( but not specifically its modern methods of instruction ) , I cannot disregard the proven efficacy of the sword and shield method .
Nor can I ignore the formidable utility and versatility of an excellent European longsword or great sword when combined with superior European armor –and the difficulty it offers when posed against the single sword .
But a fine katana can be a truly awesome sword .
I have long been an admirer of its form and function .
However , not all of them were superb weapons and typically the quality of European blades is erroneously denigrated and dismissed .
Also , my own understanding of the German and Italian longsword and great - sword methods of fence from the late 14th to early 17th centuries gives be considerable doubt that a skilled knight of any era would encounter anything too unfamiliar in facing a samurai swordsman of any era .
There are many other factors that still could be raised when speculating on a hypothetical combat between a knight and a samurai .
In the end though , my own answer to the question of who would win is that it is unanswerable ... but would be an awesome experiment .
Being a great warrior is a matter of individual ability and technical factors that are not exclusive to any one culture or time period .
The better fighter wins a fight , and whoever does win is therefore considered the better fighter –or at least the luckier one .
See also : Katana vs. Rapier - Another Fantasy Worth Considering Longsword and Katana Considered End Note : Noel Perrin in his history of how Feudal Japan largely abandoned firearms ( Giving Up the Gun - Japan 's Reversion to the Sword , 1543 - 1879 ) , alleges how , " The distinguished twentieth - century arms collector George Cameron Stone ( author of the compendious but flawed 1934 glossary of arms and armor ) once took part in a test in which a sixteenth - century Japanese sword was used to cut a modern European sword in two . "
( Perrin , p. 11 ) .
Perrin however is mistaken .
His reference cited is erroneous as Stone on page 318 only claimed : " The two traditional tests of a fine [ Japanese ] blade were –first , it should be able to cut a common blade in two without having its edge nicked ; second , if it was held in running water with the edge upstream and a lotus was allowed to float against it the stem should be cut .
The first has been done many times ; I know of no recorded case of the second , but the perfection of the edge and the ease of cutting with it makes it not improbable . "
( Stone , p. 318 ) .
Thus , Stone never said he personally took part in any such test or that they even involved any European blades .
The 1670 English translation of the 1669 work , Atlas Jappennensis , gives a statement by the Dutchman Arnold Montanus as saying of the Japanese , " Their Faulchions or Scimeters are so well wrought , and excellently temper'd , that they will cut our European blades asunder , like Flags or Rushes " .
( Perrin , p. 11 ) .
What has not been pointed out is that Montanus 's account is actually not all that impressive .
He was referring not to Medieval swords or wide European military blades , nor even to slender rapiers , but to the narrow transition smallswords of the 1660's .
Further , he evidently was not citing any occurrence which took place in combat , but while held stationary in an example of test - cutting .
Even then , the breaking and cutting of slender light smallsword blades occurred in Europe itself and by single - hand swords of far less quality than the katana .
Small - swords ( as well as early 17th century rapiers ) were after all rigid blades never intended for resisting the impacts of cutting blows .
An account of the battle between English and Scots at Killiecrankie in 1689 described how " pikes and smallswords were cut like willows " by broadswords as well as how " pikes , smallswords and muskets " had been " snapt asunder by the athletic blows of the Lochaber axe and broadsword . "
( Thomas C. Jack , History of the Highland Regiments , Highland Clans , etc. from Official and Authentic Sources , Vol. I , Edinburgh .
1887 , p. 105 ) .
It should also be added that Montanus himself was not a warrior , swordsman , or expert fencer , and like many gentlemen of his day wore a costume sword as a jewelry accessory , therefore his opinion on both blades and cutting quality should be taken in context .
As well , writing in 1854 of his time among the tribal clans of the Caucasus , Ivan Golovin recorded : " As proof of the excellence of Circassian arms , I may state , that the barrels of Russian muskets have been cut into two parts , in the battle , by a stroke of the shashka .
Russian officers could not do better than adopt those sabres . "
( Golovin , Ivan .
The Caucasus .
Trübner & co. , London 1854 , p. 150 ) .
The shashka is a short , gently curved , somewhat slender , single - edged and single - hand sword , often without a cross hilt and usually having a one - piece hooked handle .
Circassia was a region north of the Caucasus Mountains on the northeast coast of the Black Sea in southwest Russia .
Perrin also stated that after visiting a Buddhist temple of warrior - monks in 1560 , a Jesuit priest reportedly said their swords cut through armor " as easily as a sharp knife cuts a tender rump . " ( Perrin , p. 11 ) .
As with so many statements , Perrin provided no contextual source as evidence for this claim .
Whatever such a Jesuit might have witnessed , it was certainly not Medieval European armor the monks were not cutting and it can be highly suspect that they could even cut through Japanese armor ' otherwise why ever even build and wear the stuff .
Japanese sword blades , superb cutting instruments though they are , were regardless not designed for splitting open European plate armor ' the best armor ever produced . '
Yet another documented account survives of gun barrels supposedly being cut by European swords .
This was being more credulous , given what is known of both sword as well as steel quality from the era , unless the account refers to the thinner walls of muskets barrels :
There was an overall decline in the general quality of military swords acknowledged in late 18th century England , such that one account in 1783 stated : " an English officer would not trust his life to the hazard of the probable failure of his English sword - blade , upon any consideration whatever . "
As a result London sword - sellers tried to import better German swords .
A manufacturer from Birmingham , Thomas Gill , responded by offering to make blades as good as or better .
By 1786 , a contract was divided among several British and one German sword cutlerer to fill an order of 10,000 horseman 's swords for the East India Company .
A public examination and trial of the blades was then commissioned by Gill to prove his product .
A machine was used to force each blade to curve edgewise from 36 to 29.5 inches .
From Gills ' English company 2650 swords passed the test with only 4 failing .
Of the German swords 1400 passed with 28 being rejected .
From other British cutlers only 2700 passed with 1084 being rejected and the rest being deemed unfit to even bear the required test .
In addition to this test Gill also proved the quality of his blades by striking them flat - wise on a slab of cast - iron , and then edge - wise on cylinder of wrought - iron .
" For the latter purpose a gun- barrel was frequently used ; and it is stated that the swords were so tough , though made of cast steel , that , after cutting a gun-barrel asunder the blade might be wound round the barrel like a ribbon and afterwards restored to its original straightness , excepting at the point . "
( Craik , George Lillie and Charles MacFarlane .
The Pictorial History of England During the Reign of George the Third .
C. Knight , UK 1843 , p. 684 . )
Thus , ironically , the only documented historical accounts of gun barrels in combat being actually cut through by swords are European .
In their history of Japan , historians James Murdoch and Isoh Yamagata point out : " The Jesuits and the Koreans are at one in asserting that the Chinese army of counter - invasion was a thoroughly efficient force , and they are also in accord as regards its equipment … it was very strong in cavalry , all the horse - men being in iron mail ‘ on which the best swords of Japan could made no impression . ' "
( James Murdoch , A History of Japan During the Century of Early Foreign Intercourse 1542 - 1651 .
Chronicle , Kobe Japan , 1903 . p. 343 ) .
Given this performance against Chinese maile armor , it does give question to how effective they would be against the strength of well - made Medieval European byrnies let alone even stronger plate armor .
One respected book on the subject in referring to the Mongol invasions of Japan in the 13th century , noted , " In these brief but telling encounters , the Japanese had their first opportunity to test their equipment and military skills against those of a foreign enemy . "
They noted the samurai armor " while effective against the arrows and swords of the Mongols provided the wearer was mounted , proved ill - suited to fighting on foot ; most of its considerable weight was taken by the shoulders " and " imposed severe restrictions on walking . "
They add , " Swords , and in particular the points , chipped against Mongol armour , which contemporary illustrations and descriptions reveal to have been long , skirted coast made from hide and heavy fabric sewn together , worn with iron helmets fitted with leather hoods .
Why this should have been a problem when for centuries swordsmen had apparently been cutting through Japanese armour to great effect is a mystery ' in all probability they did cut through Mongol armour but became trapped by the layers of thick leather and , being rather delicate , broke as they were wrenched free . "
Which of course begs the question from the authors how they can explain how it was such " delicate " swords would break against soft armors yet cut through hard ones unscathed ?
( See : I. Bottomley , & A. P. Hopson .
Arms and Armour of the Samurai .
The History of Weaponry in Ancient Japan .
Brompton Books , 1988 . p. 49 ) .
Curiously , in The Connoisseur 's Book of Japanese Swords ( Kodansha International 1997 , p. 21 ) , author Kokan Nagayama contended , the " Japanese warriors had never before encountered such an enemy ( the Mongols ) , who was protected by leather armor and wielded a very stout sword ' clearly superior to theirs ' in a unique style of fighting . "
Some swordsmiths thereafter altered their designs to narrow the temper lines and extend them around the point because " blades with wide temper lines reaching near to the ridge line look gorgeous , but tend to break . "
Note to the Reader : Though I run an organization and website dedicated to historical European swordplay and fighting arts , I appreciate all swords of the world and consider each separately as a tool within their own cultural and martial context .
So , I 'm often perturbed at the prejudice and ignorance that results from the influential popular media in regard to many of them , particularly the hype that surrounds Japanese swords .
For what 's its worth , I offer my opinion here in the most even - handed and objective manner possible for me given my considerable experience and familiarity with historical European arms and armor and authentic Medieval & Renaissance combatives .
As well , being a former member of the Houston Token Kai , ( Japanese sword appreciation society ) and having had the privilege of knowing several collectors , museum curators , and a blade polisher , I 've had the opportunity over the last decade to handle more than a hundred genuine Japanese swords , ranging from mid-13th to early - 20th century pieces .
I 've even had the rare pleasure to briefly wield several in floryshing and practice .
I 've also handled and personally examined in museums and private collections more than 200 antique European swords of all types from bronze - age to 19th century specimens as well as numerous ones from the Middle East , Africa , the Pacific Rim , and Central Asia .
In addition to the hundred or so different sword forms -- both European and Asian , antique and modern -- that I 've test - cut with against a wide assortment of materials , I 've also cut with numerous Japanese swords ( in this case , early - 20th century specimens and modern reproductions ) as well as attended several test - cutting demonstrations .
Combined with my two and a half decades of fencing study with Medieval and Renaissance swords , and years of teaching them , I therefore feel uniquely qualified as a full - time practitioner to write this piece .
Sadly , it 's all too common to encounter individuals who feel appreciation of one culture 's fighting arts must to come at denigration of another .
Such adolescent reactions are a reflection of the reader 's insecurity and immaturity .
While we welcome intelligent discussion , before sending us any rebuttal email on this piece ( or its companion article ) we request you consider this as well as read through the entire article first .
Additionally , please , do not waste our time and yours by emailing embarrassingly juvenile claims about how samurai " would have just used their Ki " or " everyone knows katanas could cut through any other swords " or that " Medieval armor was super heavy and clumsy . "
It should be abundantly clear that we deal here in physical reality and verifiable historical facts not fantasy derived from some video game or anime .
Thank you .

I have to admit I 'm more impressed with Ignatieff than I thought I would be .
So far he seems to be doing a good job as leader of the party , and here 's why :
1 ) Grumbling within the party has virtually disappeared .
It always surfaced now and then with Dion but Ignatieff seems to be much better at keeping the party united .
The party probably has Dion to thank for this , actually , as without his disastrous leadership there would n't have been so much of a desire for anybody to replace him , and given that Ignatieff almost won the leadership during the last convention anyway while Dion kind of snuck in due to voting rules and a desire for a moderate leader , there were quite a few within the party that never really regarded him as the legitimate leader in the first place .
2 ) Ignatieff seems to know how to speak to the West .
This seems to be his international experience showing itself , as he does n't come across as a person that favours one region over another , and with that favoratism usually comes blame ( real or implied ) , which is what can drive a lot of people to vote for the other party .
This article is one of many that I 've seen over the past few days on speeches he 's given in the West , and he seems to understand the importance of energy in that part of the country and does n't want to do anything to alienate the region .
Here 's what he said today :
The trip west was Ignatieff 's second in as many weeks .
With an eye on the next election , Ignatieff is trying to distance himself as a leader from his party 's historic failings in the region .
" God knows this party has made mistakes out in the Western Canada and I know them , " Ignatieff said in Regina several weeks ago .
He also had words for former Liberal leader Stephane Dion 's Green Shift plan , which was nearly as unpopular in the west as Pierre Trudeau 's national energy program .
" I think you can't win elections if you are adding to the input costs of a farmer . . . or a trucker , " Ignatieff said in a news conference in Edmonton Friday .
" You got to work with the grain of Canadians and not against them . "
" I think we learned a lesson in the last election . "
But Ignatieff emphasized the Liberals are not backtracking on the environment agenda .
" Our goal is very simple -- to reduce the amount of energy input into everything we do , " he said .
I wrote yesterday that Ignatieff might be able to win the next election without having to exert all that much effort , if the country does n't see him as trying to grab power ( as was the case with the coalition ) and if the country gets a bit bored with Harper .
I think the overall impression of the political situation right now is that 1 ) The Conservatives are n't the most beloved party at the moment but they won the election as a minority so let them continue to govern for the time being ;
2 ) If the Liberals show signs that they 've learned from their past election defeats then they 'll probably be given another chance .
What will probably be Ignatieff 's greatest challenge in the next election ( whenever it is ) will be keeping the so - called troops in line .
Voters do n't like melodrama in their politicians , and if it looks like Liberal Party candidates are too eagerly chomping at the bit or too inclined to try to demonize the Conservative Party as opposed to presenting their own vision for the country , they 'll be punished again .
Ignatieff is probably going to have to draft up a list of things for candidates not to say , such as do n't try to make comparisons to George Bush and the Conservatives anymore ( Bush is long gone and those comparisons do n't work anyway ) , do n't call them neo -cons or fascists , do n't call them racist , do n't say anything that makes it look like you are taking votes for granted , and so on .
Oh , and for Ignatieff himself : no mentioning Barack Obama too much .
Though they apparently have a number of mutual friends , people do n't really appreciate trying to ride on another person 's coattails .
I think Ignatieff 's smart enough to avoid this though .
The brain 's center of memory and navigation , once considered too disorganized to decode , may soon be unlocked .
Using a brain scanner , researchers were able to determine the location of people standing in a virtual room from the activity in their brains .
" We could read their spatial memories , so to speak , " said study co-author Eleanor Maguire , a University College , London , cognitive neuroscientist .
" There must be a structure to how this is coded in the neurons .
Otherwise we could n't have predicted this . "
Maguire 's team focused on the hippocampus , a region of the forebrain responsible for processing spatial relationships and short - term memories .
As people move , hippocampal activation helps them know where they are .
In Alzheimer 's patients , disorientation and memory loss go hand in hand .
But animal studies have n't been able to link specific hippocampal activities with memories , and rat studies suggested that spatial memories were actually stored randomly .
There seemed to be no pattern , at least not a pattern that scientists could decipher and apply .
Maguire 's study , published Thursday in Current Biology , challenges that notion .
And though it 's far too soon to pull memories directly from a brain , the findings suggest future avenues of research on Alzheimer 's and other forms of dementia .
" How these millions of hippocampal neurons work is a fundamental question in neuroscience , " said Maguire .
" We still do n't know how the hippocampal neural code is organized to support memory and activation . "
The researchers used an fMRI machine to measure hippocampal blood flow in four subjects who navigated a room in virtual reality .
They focused on groups of neurons identified by Maguire in an earlier study of London taxi drivers , whose hippocampi were hyperdeveloped by years of mental navigation through the city 's mazelike streets .
After analyzing activation patterns and correlating them with a record of test subjects ' movements , Maguire 's team found that patterns could actually be used to predict location .
The results " are an intriguing first step toward using fMRI to read out information about visuo - spatial scenes , " said Arne Ekstrom , a University of California at Los Angeles cognitive neuroscientist who was not involved in the study .
Ekstrom cautioned that the findings , relying on a bird 's - eye fMRI view of just one part of the hippocampus , do n't explain what 's happening in individual neurons or across the entire structure .
Further studies will incorporate more test subjects than the four men included in this study , and involve other types of memory than spatial .
Though the findings fit with earlier demonstrations of visual memory 's reconstruction from visual cortex activation patterns , study co-author Demis Hassabis , a London - based artificial intelligence researcher , cautioned that full - blown mind reading is still decades away .
More relevant , said Hassabis and Maguire , are potential insights into how memory deteriorates .
" We 're learning more and more about how memory is laid down , " said Maguire .
" We can begin to understand how pathological processes erode memories , and think about how we might help patients in a rehabilitation context , to make the most of what memories they have left . "

( CNN ) -- Nearly 7,000 Mexican soldiers and federal police arrived in the U.S. - Mexico border city of Ciudad Juarez this week to restore security to a city plagued by a long - standing , bloody drug war .
Mexican federal police patrol in Ciudad Juarez earlier this week .
Random vehicle checkpoints , patrols of masked soldiers and police in SWAT gear are some of the signs of the massive military buildup ordered by Mexico 's president , Ciudad Juarez police spokesman Jaime Torres Valadez said Thursday .
Another 1,500 soldiers are expected to join the 3,500 that rolled into Juarez earlier this week to support municipal police in street patrols and ultimately take control of their operations , Torres said .
In addition to the army troops , about 3,000 federal agents arrived to carry out investigations Torres likened to those of the FBI in the United States .
" They 'll stay as long as necessary , " Torres said , in the city across the border from El Paso , Texas .
Extreme violence among warring drug cartels and the Mexican government has long plagued Juarez and the state of Chihuahua , but the situation has been getting worse .
Last month , the city 's chief of police was obliged to quit after threats from organized crime to kill a policeman every day that he remained on the job .
And this week , the U.S. Consulate in Juarez specifically warned Americans to avoid an area southeast of the city .
" There has been a dramatic increase in drug related violence in the Guadalupe Bravo area and there is no indication that the situation will improve in the near future , " the consulate said on its Web site .
Watch how drug killings are making Americans wary of Mexico »
President Felipe Calderon 's security cabinet met in the city last week to devise a strategy to combat narcotraffickers .
The federal government is footing the bill for the troops ' wages and food , and the municipal government is paying for their gas and living expenses , Torres said .
Surveillance cameras will be installed throughout the city to help police stem executions and assassinations in the streets , scene of many of Juarez 's 1,600 killings in 2008 .
Police advised residents to carry identification with them at all times to ensure that encounters with law enforcement in the streets and at vehicle checkpoints proceed as quickly as possible , Torres said .
" It 's necessary to keep the peace , " Torres said in a telephone interview as he sat in his car , waiting in line at a police checkpoint .
" For me , it 's safe .
If there are more soldiers , I feel safe . "
But human rights advocates say the military presence creates a police state in a region where confidence in law enforcement is low .
" The increase in law enforcement brings elements that create an environment conducive to the violation of human rights , " said José Luis Armendáriz González , president of the Chihuahua State Commission of Human Rights .
" What are the limits of their power ?
The risk for wrongful detentions , raids of homes increases when there 's no clear line . "
Armendáriz said the focus on troop numbers detracts from improving the quality of investigation and crime - fighting techniques .
" We 've been battling the criminal elements with force and gunfire for years now with few results , " he said .
" I believe it 's necessary to pass to a second phase that focuses on intelligence and infiltrating the criminal organization to hit all levels . "
Others say the stronger law enforcement presence is producing results .
" In the last seven days , we 've had no more than five reported deaths .
Before that , the average was six a day , " Sen.
Ramón Galindo Noriega said in an interview Wednesday .
" Maybe it 's a coincidence , but I believe the presence has generated an environment of greater security and this is congruent with the numbers that we have this week . "
Galindo , a lifelong Juarense who sends his children to schools in Juarez and owns businesses there , said more troops are the only answer to a problem that has transformed Juarez from a center of industry and commerce to a major battleground in the war among drug cartels .
" What we had before was a state that was under the control of crime .
It was a state that did n't permit a normal life .
People left , businesses closed .
There was fear in the streets , an environment of fear that we had to take radical measures to eradicate , " he said .
" I believe the people are content with the presence of the army .
They feel safer in the city , calmer in the streets . "

A 7.9 magnitude earthquake about 200 km ( 130 miles ) south - east of Tonga has triggered a tsunami in the South Pacific , but no damage is reported .
The quake hit at 0618 local time ( 1818 GMT ) at a depth of 10 km ( 6.2 miles ) .
The tremor , which residents from Fiji to New Zealand reported feeling , was followed two hours later by an after - shock of 5.3 magnitude .
A regional tsunami warning was issued , but withdrawn just over an hour and a half later .
' Got off lightly '
A resident of the Tongan capital Nuku'alofa said there was no sign of significant damage or of a tsunami after the shallow quake .
Caroline Holden , a seismologist with New Zealand 's Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences , said this was surprising .
" Quite remarkable , given the magnitude of it .
We might have gotten off lightly , " the national police commander , Chris Kelly , said .

" The house really moved , the trees were swaying and the ground was rippling , " he said .
People in low lying areas of Fiji fled for higher ground , officials said , and schools and government offices were closed .
New Zealand seismologist Craig Miller said " a long , low rolling motion " from the quake was reported by residents on the east coast of New Zealand 's North Island - more than 3,000 km ( 1,875 miles ) from the quake 's epicentre .
Tonga resident Pesi Fonua told the Associated Press the quake had lasted for " something like 20 seconds " but he had seen no damage .
Police spokesman Niua Kama told the agency residents did not appear to take the warning seriously .
" People are out on the roads , laughing at the warning , " he said .
They were not moving back from the coast despite tsunami warnings , the spokesman added .
Several earthquakes have been felt in Tonga recently and an undersea volcano has been erupting off the coast of the main island Tongatapu , although it was not considered to be a threat to people in the area .
MARIO LIVIO IS an astrophysicist , a man whose work and worldview are inextricably intertwined with mathematics .
Like most scientists , he depends on math and an underlying faith in its incredible power to explain the universe .
But over the years , he has been nagged by a bewildering thought .
Scientific progress , in everything from economics to neurobiology to physics , depends on math 's ability .
But what is math ?
Why should its abstract concepts be so uncannily good at explaining reality ?
The question may seem irrelevant .
As long as math works , why not just go with it ?
But Livio felt himself pulled into a deep question that reaches to the very foundation of science - and of reality itself .
The language of the universe appears to be mathematics : Formulas describe how our planet revolves around the sun , how a boat floats , how light glints off the water .
But is mathematics a human tool , or is reality , in some fundamental way , mathematics ?
Or , put another way : " Is God a Mathematician ? "
This is the title of Livio 's new book , in which he joins a long line of modern thinkers who have questioned " the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics , " in the words of Nobel Laureate Eugene Wigner .
Livio , an astrophysicist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , concludes that math has to be thought of , at least in part , as a human invention .
That 's a profoundly weird notion in a world where math has always had special status , untainted by people 's opinions and biases .
Religion , politics , and picking a great work of art can all incite vigorous debate , while 2 + 2 = 4 has always seemed like a cold , hard fact .
Math is n't a figment of our imagination , but perhaps it is n't quite as far from great art as we thought .
IDEAS : Can you imagine an alternate universe in which we invent a different type of math ?
What might that look like ?
LIVIO : Let me start with this silly idea - the isolated jellyfish .
Imagine that all the intelligence resided not in humans , but in some isolated jellyfish at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean .
This jellyfish - all it would feel would be the pressure of the water , the temperature of the water , the motion of the water .
Would this jellyfish have invented the natural numbers - 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and so on ?
I think probably not , because there 's nothing to count there - everything this creature would have felt would have been continuous rather than discrete , so this creature might have invented a completely different type of mathematics .
IDEAS : So , instead of jellyfish math we have math that reflects our abilities ?
LIVIO : Why did the ancient Babylonians and Greeks and so on start with arithmetic and geometry ?
I think that largely this is because of our particular perception system .
We are very , very good at seeing edges of things ; we can very well tell what is an object , what is the background of the object ; we can tell individual objects very well , we can also tell very well whether a line is straight or not , just with our eye .
Worlds.com CEO
Thom Kidrin is putting the entire virtual worlds industry on notice :
His company claims the idea of a scalable virtual world with thousands of users is its patented intellectual property , and Thom told us he intends to sue anyone who refuses to enter into licensing negotiations -- including giants such as Second Life and World of Warcraft , a property of Activision Blizzard ( ATVI ) .
Already , Korean gaming firm NCSoft , maker of City of Heroes and Guild Wars , has been sued by Worlds .
( In East Texas no less , a jurisdiction infamous in intellectual property circles for plaintiff - friendly rulings in patent cases . )
Thom told us if he succeeds in his litigation , he " absolutely " intends to pursue follow - up suits against industry leaders Second Life and WoW .
Last December , when hitherto - unknown Worlds.com claimed to hold a patent for the virtual worlds idea dating from the 1990s , we were highly skeptical .
Whatever one thinks of Second Life , there 's no doubt that service was the brainchild of Linden Lab founder Philip Rosedale , who pitched the idea around Silicon Valley for years before gaining VC funding to make it happen .
But Worlds.com 's
Thom filled us in on his backstory : Back in 1997 , a developer created the Steven Spielberg - backed Starbright World , part of the Starlight Starbright Foundation 's work with seriously ill children .
Even in the fledgling virtual worlds industry , very few people heard of Starbright World because its creators shunned publicity , seeing their product as a private wonderland for sick kids .
Eventually a collection of Starbright patents , which do n't cover virtual worlds per se but an architecture for enabling thousands of simultaneous users in a 3D virtual space , passed from the original creators to the current Worlds.com management .
Lawyers from General Patent Corporation encouraged the Worlds.com team to aggressively pursue licensing deals .
Thom insists he 's not out to put anyone out of business , he just wants to be paid licensing fees for what he considers his lawful intellectual property .
But we can't imagine the potential targets of any patent infringement action will interpret the demand for licensing fees as anything less than a legal shakedown .
We consulted legal experts like Virtual Law author Ben Duranske about the case , and Worlds.com may have a tough time in court based on a wealth of " prior art " available to any patent defense .
But we 'll keep a close eye on this one as it progresses through the courts .
Whenever issues of who owns a technology and how much it 's worth are decided by judges and juries , the results are always unpredictable .
Organ transplants for foreign tourists banned
By Wang Zhuoqiong ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-02-11 07:43
The Ministry of Health ( MOH ) Tuesday reiterated that organ transplants for foreign visitors holding tourist visas are prohibited and medical institutions involved in the illegal practice will be dealt with harshly .
China opposes organ transplant for foreign tourists in accordance with international practice , said Mao Qunan , spokesman of the MOH at a press conference .
" Due to the lack of organ donors , shortage of organs is a problem in all countries , not just China .
Priority must be given to domestic patients in urgent need of an operation , " he said .
" If we started allowing organ transplants for tourists , the existing order will be disturbed . "
The ministry said domestic medical institutions that wish to conduct organ transplants should get approval from the provincial health departments , which must first report to the MOH before giving their nod .
Domestic hospitals must also prohibit their doctors from performing organ transplants while traveling overseas as tourists , it said .
So far , the ministry has granted over 160 medical institutions the license to conduct such operations since China issued the Provisions on Human Organ Transplant on May 1 , 2007 .
In another development , the ministry yesterday urged health department and hospitals to be alert for the bird flu virus as most human infection cases occur in spring .
Eight people were found to have contracted the H5N1 virus since last December .
Five of them have died .
Meanwhile , the ministry urged health authorities and hospitals to strengthen hospital administration to prevent medical accidents in the wake of four anesthesia - related deaths .
The ministry attributed four of the deaths in the southern province of Fujian last year to " loose hospital administration , " said Mao .
The Collapse of '09
The " Panic of ’ 08 " will be followed by " The Collapse of ’09 . "
In 2008 , when the world ’s largest financial firms and equity markets crumbled , Wall Street ’s woes preoccupied
the media .
In 2009 , the focus will broaden to include a range of calamities that will leave no sector unscathed .
Next in line is retail , which accounts for some 70 percent of consumer spending , 26 percent of which is holiday sales .
After the numbers are tallied to reveal a dismal retail Christmas , more big chain bankruptcies will follow .
Besides leaving masses unemployed , defunct retailers will leave behind thousands of empty stores .
Who will rent them ?
Nobody !
Add to these empties commercial space vacated by defunct financial firms and an array of troubled businesses , from restaurants to architectural firms , to high tech operations , to offset printers , etc. , etc .
The inescapable result ( that we predicted over a year ago and is only now being discussed in the business media ) is a commercial real estate bust that will be costlier , wreak greater havoc and prove more intractable than the residential market decline .
Because most people do n’t live and shop on Wall Street , the " Panic of ’ 08 " was viewed by Main Street as if from afar – even though many were losing money .
But when commercial real estate crashes it will hit much closer to home .
The depressive atmosphere of thinly shopped , half - vacant malls will strike emotional chords and all the senses .
In office buildings , vacant floors and empty cubicles will dampen the workday spirit of the still - employed ; ever present reminders of laid - off friends and colleagues and of the fragility of employment .
Abandoned , untended business and industrial parks will highlight the already mournful scene .
In cities studded with soaring towers and new construction predicated on eternal economic growth , streets lined with " For Rent / For Sale " signs will complement stilled cranes and uncompleted buildings .
As retail and commercial real estate collapse , the credit card sector and all its interrelated processing and back office support businesses will suffer and be forced to scale back .
Hordes of consumers who have been living off credit cards and racking up debt to the limit will lack the funds to service their debt … much less pay it off , and they will be forced to default .
Given the nearly $ 3 trillion in consumer debt at risk ( excluding auto and mortgage ) an inevitable default snowball will add momentum to the in - progress Collapse of ’09 .
While we alone predicted the " Panic of ’ 08 " ( and even took out the domain name " Panicof08.com " on 7 November 2007 ) , we are not alone in predicting a Depression .
The " D " word is being uttered – in some cases by those who have the most to lose and whose best interests are not served by spreading gloom and doom .
" The world and country are in a depression , " said celebrity tycoon Donald Trump .
He then later softened the blow , downgrading it to a " virtual depression . "
" Virtual " to the few who will never have to worry where the next dollar will come from , it will be painfully real and hardly virtual to the multitudes who are and will be worrying .
The virally proliferating Greatest Depression is the Trend of Trends for 2009 .
Even so , beware !
Over the course of free - falling 2009 , the word from most official sources will be " recession , " and from the few mainstream trophy pessimists ,
" deep recession . "
For example , the oft - quoted naysayer , Nouriel Roubini , New York University professor of economics , forecasts a two year recession … not Depression .
On the sunnier side of Wall Street , the Federal Reserve predicts the US economy will contract only through the middle of 2009 and pledged , " In any event , the Committee agreed to take whatever steps were necessary to support the recovery . ”
What " steps ? "
The Bernanke Two - Step ?
Adjust interest rates or print more money ?
Neither stopped the credit crisis from worsening , the real estate market from tanking or the stock markets from crashing .
It was Fed finagling , Washington deregulation and Wall Street ’s compulsive gambling that created the crisis .
To trust or to seriously consider pronouncements , analyses and predictions made by any of these sources is an exercise in willful self - deception .
Yet , with pensions , IRAs , 401 ks , stocks and mutual funds evaporating , many of those most affected deny reality and take hope that forecasts made by proven incompetents will miraculously restore their losses .
Throughout the many years leading up to what we term the " Greatest Depression , " The Trends Research Institute provided copious data and Globalnomic analysis to support our forecasts of economic upheaval .
In the past year alone , we have provided so much hard evidence ( housings starts , home sales , foreclosures , bankruptcies , bank failures , unemployment figures , stock indices , leading economic indicators , retail sales , etc. ) that further elaboration should be superfluous .
Those waiting to hear the " D " word from economic experts , talking heads and TV anchors before taking action will most certainly regret their indecisiveness .
Absent from the economic scenarios ranging from second quarter recovery , deep recession and " virtual " depression are the multiplicity of social , environmental , health , political , emotional / psychological and geopolitical factors that point beyond just Depression .
They point to The Decline and Fall of Empire America .
Well before Inauguration Day , Barack Obama was cast as the next Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
If he follows in FDR ’s footsteps he could freeze deposits by declaring a " holiday " to stop a run on the banks .
While FDIC insurance may cover deposits , even after banks reopen , withdrawal amounts may be restricted .
( As the Argentine government did in 2001 - 2002 . )
Author ’s Note : Suspicious of the soundness of the banking system , I requested to withdraw a substantial sum from our Key Bank account , leaving funds sufficient to cover ongoing business operations .
First they tried to dissuade me , then they stonewalled me , and finally they turned openly hostile .
I was forced to sign a series of documents , including one acknowledging that since I was carrying a large sum I could be the target of a robbery .
To enhance that possibility , the teller slammed down the bag of cash on the counter and publicly announced the sum .
Despite repeated requests in the days preceding my withdrawal to get the cash in hundreds , they gave it to me in twenties , making for a bag five times the size and more robber - friendly .
When I complained to the bank manager who had processed the request , the response amounted to " take it or leave it . "
This will not be an isolated event .
If you attempt to withdraw a large chunk of money from your account , negotiate the details in advance and anticipate possible hassle and obstruction .
We ’ve heard similar accounts from clients and Trends Journal subscribers who , over the past several months , tried to close out mutual funds , 401ks and assorted sinking equities .
They were dissuaded , cajoled , belittled and arm - twisted by brokers desperate to keep their accounts .
Many caved in under the pressure , did n’t close them and lost most of what they had .
So , we leave you with a Greatest Depression consideration :
How safe is your money ?
How sound is your bank ?
At the end of November , Citigroup , once America ’s largest bank , was on the rocks .
Fifty - two thousand employees were laid off .
In just three days its stock lost more than half its value .
Rumors swirled that Citi was so desperate they were looking to sell or split up the company .
Is your money deposited in a local bank whose reputation you can bank on ?
Are you with a teetering giant or a poorly - managed regional ?
If either of the latter , it would be in your best interest to assess the risks .
Take some out if you think there is risk ; take it all out if you think there ’s high risk .
You may consider spreading it around and even banking abroad … after all , this is the Global Age .
Suppose we take an expression in x and y , built by nesting simple primitives : product , average , sin ( pi*_ ) , and cos( pi*_ ) .
These four operations map arguments in the range - 1 to 1 to results in this same range .
Thus , at any point with - 1 <= x , y <= 1 , our expression built from these primitives will return a value between - 1 and 1 .
By scaling the answer to a grayscale value 0 - 255 , we can plot the function in this 2 - by - 2 square .
( From three such expressions , we can get red , green , and blue values for each point . )
What you get is some very nifty art !

Here 's another anecdote to put in your UK - is - doomed file :
Guardian : Police are preparing for a " summer of rage " as victims of the economic downturn take to the streets to demonstrate against financial institutions , the Guardian has learned .
Britain's most senior police officer with responsibility for public order raised the spectre of a return of the riots of the 1980s , with people who have lost their jobs , homes or savings becoming " footsoldiers " in a wave of potentially violent mass protests .

Add that to the UK 's decision to abdicate free speech , its declining national IQs among native britons , a culture of hooliganism , a dwindling energy business and the potential for spread from the rest of Europe and you 've got a nice stew of destruction .
Civil unrest :
It 's not just for China anymore .

An 18 - year - old from Mississauga yesterday made the unprecedented request to be granted custody of his two younger brothers in hopes of bringing an end to a decade of family " warfare . "
" My concerns are not as to ( which parent ) is ' right ' or ' wrong ' ... but how to bring back some sanity to our family , " says the teen 's eight - page affadavit to the court .
" My brothers and I are close .
I think we have become closer with all the conflict .
I am determined to make sure they are not harmed . "
The teen claims his parents ' ongoing conflict has turned his siblings into " subjects of some social engineering experiment . "
There are many issues involved , but at its core the case is about parental alienation , or warring parents using their children as weapons against each other .
The soft - spoken teenager , who will soon turn 19 , says his 12 - and 14 - year - old brothers are " at risk of serious harm , " and he 's prepared to put his education on hold , move out of his father 's subsidized apartment and apply for welfare – or sue his parents for support – so he can raise his brothers and " end the conflict . "
The two boys have been in foster care since last December , after they declined to participate in what the older brother considers " voodoo science " – a controversial family workshop by U.S. parental alienation expert Randy Rand – and then refused to return to live with their mother , the custodial parent .
The mother , concerned about her sons ' mental stability and the ongoing alienation , had the younger ones admitted for an assessment by a child and adolescent psychiatrist at St. Joseph 's Health Centre .
After five weeks , the doctor became concerned the children felt " so trapped in the legal system , " and that it might create a dangerous sense of despair , so he recommended that they be taken into Children 's Aid Society care .
The court filings paint a picture of a severely dysfunctional family and , according to the teen 's lawyer , Jeffrey Wilson , one of the most " extreme " cases of parental alienation to come before a family court judge in Ontario .
None of the family members can be named , along with identifying details of the case , by court order .
The mother , who separated from the father in 1999 , has accused him of an orchestrated campaign to turn the boys against her .
She fears the teen is an " agent " of the husband and really trying to help him win custody through a back door .
The father and eldest son have accused her of physically abusing the boys .
The teen asked Justice Steven Clark to make him a party to the ongoing court case yesterday in a Brampton courtroom .
He also asked Clark to forbid parental alienation experts from having anything more to do with his brothers .
" My brothers have ended up being committed in a hospital against their wishes , committed to live somewhere they do not want to live , exposed to psychiatrists who have attempted to carry out experimental therapy with them at the risk of severe harm to them , and if their lawyer will not do anything to stop this , I believe I have the right as their brother to be as concerned about them as each of my parents , " he says in his affidavit .
The teen said he 's done " a lot of homework now on `parental alienation ' and those who believe it to be a `science . ' " and recognizes that he has to fight for his brothers on his own because his father has been " tainted " by the court proceedings .
" I am almost 19 years of age .
Neither my mother nor my father ought to be able to prevent me from taking all the necessary measures to protect my brothers and present my own plan ( for raising them . ) "
His mother 's affidavit stresses that the teen , who holds down a part - time job and completed Grade 12 despite the stress of the case , has neither the income nor the ability to care for his siblings .

" The best thing ( he ) could do now is get on with his life , and get treatment for his alienation from me , as per court orders , " the mother 's affidavit says .
" This would be in his best interest , and provide the best example for his brothers . "
His father is unemployed and lives in assisted housing , so is unable to provide any real financial support to him , the mother says .
A ruling on the teen 's request for standing is expected April 20 .

Dilbert and Dogbert sit outdoors .
Dilbert asks , " You know what I hate ? " Dogbert asks , " What ? " Dilbert continues , " I hate it when hundreds of people get together and throw a surprise birthday party for me . "
Dogbert responds , " It 's amazing how nature protects us from the things we hate . "
Israeli drivers in Rosh Ha'ayin were met with an unusual sight Sunday evening , when a man dressed as Spiderman decided to use his superpowers to engage commuters sitting in evening traffic .
Several drivers on the scene called the traffic police hotline to report the superhero 's unique participation in the traffic jam .
The man leapt from vehicle to vehicle , occasionally attempting to lasso cars with an apparent ' web ' made of ropes .
Policewoman Ayala Cohen and police volunteer Uriel Dozriv arrived at the Rosh Ha'ayin junction , only to have their police car assaulted by a ' spider web ' .
The two were able to subdue the man easily , upon getting out of the vehicle .

After taking the man into police custody , cops discovered that he was a 24 - year - old resident of Ariel .
He was sent to a psychiatric evaluation .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - A decline in output of Russia ’s star asset , oil , could provide a rare opportunity for foreign firms to gain more access to its energy sector , even though the sting of Moscow reneging on previous deals still hurts .
Speaking at the World Economic Forum last week in Davos , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin surprised investors by calling for “ mutual access ” to energy assets to boost greater energy security .
He added Russia should not revert to “ isolationism ” .
Analysts said that the weight of the global financial downturn could soften resource nationalism .
“ At least for 2009 , or as long as this crisis persists , the problem will lead to a controlled opening ( to the West ) , ” Cliff Kupchan , Director of Europe and Eurasia at Eurasia Group , told Reuters .
“ Let ’s not forget that PSAs ( production - sharing agreements ) were granted in times of weakness , ” he added , referring to contracts signed between the then - indebted government and cash - rich foreign energy firms in the 1990s .
Russia has since said it will not issue any more .
But striking a rare note of reconciliation , Putin told Davos that Russia remains open to foreign investment .
Energy security should come from mutual interdependence and “ the exchange of assets without any double standards , ” he said .
With a steadily devaluing rouble , a reserve pile that has shrunk by a third since August , and cash - strapped Russian oil and gas firms , Russia could let Westerners back in the game .
A senior executive at a western oil firm that operates in Russia told Reuters on condition of anonymity that majors are more likely to look at buying smaller oil companies which are facing financial difficulties .
New deals , if any , will not resemble those from the years following the break up of the Soviet Union in 1991 in which Russian businessmen and foreign firms alike grabbed resources .
Instead , they could involve minority stakes in projects and the swallowing up of small firms , such as highly leveraged Urals Energy .
Gone are the days when 50:50 ventures could be created on the model of TNK - BP , a firm co-owned by BP and a quartet of Russia - connected billionaires .
Last year ’s takeover of London - listed , Russia - focused Imperial Energy by India ’s state - run ONGC was the year ’s only acquisition involving foreigners in the energy sector and surprised investors across the board .
FROZEN YAMAL
Potential deals could also involve gas by developing crucial , largely unexplored regions of Russia , such as the frozen Arctic peninsula of Yamal in the northwest .
Russia counts on Yamal -- which needs investments of up to $ 60 billion ( 42.19 billion pounds ) and should produce 250 billion cubic metres ( bcm ) of gas per year by 2020 -- for the bulk of its gas supply to Europe in decades to come .
Russia exports 150 bcm of gas to Europe annually .
“ Gazprom needs to develop Yamal at the moment .
If anyone would be needing Western capital , it would be Gazprom , ” said analyst Igor Kurinnyy of ING in London .
Gas export monopoly Gazprom , which has a debt of around $ 60 billion , is the sole operator on Yamal and has said it wants its first field , Bovanenkovskoye , to come on stream in 2011 .
The world 's largest gas firm has said it is considering U.S. majors Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell for liquefied natural gas LNG.L projects in the region .
Analysts said Shell could swap its share in Sakhalin - 2 on the Pacific island by the same name , which it was forced to reduce from a majority stake two years ago , for a slice of Yamal .
“ We will be keen to do more in Russia , ” Shell ’s Chief Executive Jeroen van de Veer told reporters on a conference call last week , adding that the firm had learned its “ lessons . ”
Some , though , could still be deterred , said Peter Zeihan , vice president of analysis at U.S. - based geopolitical intelligence firm Stratfor .
“ Russia is probably at the bottom of the list of every single major Western company , ” he said .
He added that companies were discouraged by the history of past dealings and the geological complexity of some reserves there .
GREENFIELDS
In a JPMorgan report issued from Moscow in January , analysts said they had marginally reduced their output targets for Russian oil companies for 2008 - 2010 .
Analysts Nadia Kazakova and Andrey Gromadin said brownfield developments were coming back into focus as greenfield investments have proved to be “ extremely expensive due to lack of infrastructure and drained resources from traditional regions ” .
Russia ’s January oil output rose slightly compared to December to 9.7 million barrels per day ( bpd ) , which is higher than an average forecast of around 9.62 million bpd for the year 2009 by analysts polled by Reuters , which is 1.6 percent less than last year ..
But greenfields -- gas in Yamal and oil in East Siberia -- needed developing for the long term .
“ If you invest in Russia ... you will have all kinds of different political circumstances over that period so you have to take a long - term view , ” Shell ’s Van de Veer said .

Judd Gregg was Mr Obama 's second nominee for commerce secretary Republican US Senator Judd Gregg is withdrawing as President Barack Obama 's nominee for commerce secretary .
Mr Gregg made the decision because of policy differences with the Obama administration , he said in a statement .
His nomination was announced last week and he was expected to become the second Republican in the Obama cabinet .
The White House said Mr Gregg had earlier pledged to " embrace " the president 's agenda , and expressed regret at his " change of heart " .
The BBC's Jonathan Beale reports from Washington that this is another blow for President Obama 's efforts to shape his cabinet and to reach out to Republicans .
Mr Gregg 's decision will also raise more questions about the vetting process used to pick his new cabinet , he adds .
Mr Obama has already lost four nominees for senior posts .
The president had originally picked New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson for the commerce post , but he withdrew over an investigation into a state contract given to his campaign donors .
Tom Daschle , who was to become the new secretary of health , and Nancy Killefer , Mr Obama 's choice to oversee budget and spending reform , both pulled out last week over questions about their payment of taxes .
Late on Thursday , the Senate confirmed Leon Panetta as head of the Central Intelligence Agency .
Mr Panetta is a former chief of staff in Bill Clinton 's White House .
' Irresolvable conflicts '
Mr Gregg said in a statement that he had been honoured by his selection and that he admired President Obama 's " willingness to reach across the aisle " .

But he said he had found there were " irresolvable conflicts " on issues including Mr Obama 's economic stimulus package and the country 's census .
" Prior to accepting this post , we had discussed these and other potential differences , but unfortunately we did not adequately focus on these concerns , " the statement said .
" We are functioning from a different set of views on many critical items of policy . "
Shortly after Mr Gregg announced his decision to withdraw , the White House issued a statement saying the Republican senator had offered his name for the commerce secretary post .
" He was very clear throughout the interviewing process that despite past disagreements about policies , he would support , embrace , and move forward with the president 's agenda , " the statement said .
It said it then became clear that Mr Gregg " was not going to be supporting some of President Obama 's key economic priorities " .
" We regret that he has had a change of heart . "
' Time to act '
The $ 789bn ( £ 547bn ) US stimulus package has been widely criticised by Republicans , who say it will lead to wasteful government spending .
Explaining his decision to reporters on Thursday , Mr Gregg said he had always been a " fairly strong " fiscal conservative , and that " it just became clear to me that it would be very difficult day - in and day - out to serve in this cabinet " .
But members of both houses of Congress said they had reached a deal on the package this week after the two houses had passed differing versions of the bill .

Mr Obama is expected to sign the final version of the bill as soon as Congress approves it .
On Thursday the president made his latest pitch for the bill as he toured a Caterpillar plant in East Peoria , Illinois .
He said Caterpillar , which has announced more than 20,000 layoffs , would be able to rehire some employees after the stimulus plan is passed , the Associated Press reported .
" It is time for Congress to act , and I hope they act in a bipartisan fashion , " he said .

The first new mainline steam engine to be built in Britain for nearly five decades has made its first long - distance passenger trip into London .
The train set off from Darlington at 0745 GMT and arrived at London King 's Cross station shortly after 1400 GMT .
The £ 3 m Peppercorn class A1 Pacific engine was built in Darlington over 18 years with donations from enthusiasts .
Hundreds watched Tornado arrive in London .
Passenger John Warren described the journey as " absolutely phenomenal " .
Tornado pulled 13 carriages , equating to about 500 tons , and ran at speeds of up to 75 mph .
Additional passengers were picked up at York and the train passed through stations including Newark , Peterborough and Potters Bar before arriving in London .
In these dark days , to have something like this is absolutely brilliant
Passenger John Warren
The journey took twice as long as the regular rail service and was delayed by 30 minutes following electrical problems near Peterborough unrelated to the steam engine .
Mr Warren , from Whittlesey , Peterborough , was one of the first passengers to step off the train .
He said : " Thousands of people were at the sides of the tracks waving as we went by .
" In these dark days , to have something like this is absolutely brilliant . "
Derek Bryne travelled to York from Seaford , East Sussex , to catch Tornado after his wife bought him tickets for his 75th birthday .
He said the atmosphere on board was " unbelievable " .
" Everyone was so friendly .
They were all of the same ilk and wanting to travel , " he added .
The train is apple green , the colour carried by the first 30 Peppercorn class A1s , and it began taking fare - paying passengers on 31 January .
Robert Morland from the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust said : " We built it to the original plans and drawings which came from 1948 , so the engine is completely new but it is as it would have been as one of the original engines . "
Although it does of course create some smoke , actually pulling 500 people with a steam engine is quite ... efficient
Robert Morland , A1 Steam Locomotive Trust
The train 's headlamps , signalling system and onboard voyage data recorder or " black box " are powered by electricity , he added .
Mr Morland denied the steam engine posed a health risk .
" The approach to steam has changed in the last few years but once you have your engine fully certified for the mainline there is n't really a problem , " he said .
" Although it does of course create some smoke , actually pulling 500 people with a steam engine is quite an efficient way of transporting people . "
Trust chairman Mark Allatt said the journey marked " the end of another chapter in the story of a project that many said could not be completed " .

Kidnapped 7 - year - old rescued in S Philippines
Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article Top Philippine defense officials on Sunday said the military is maintaining the pressure on hostages - holding kidnappers in the southern islands of Jolo and Basilan while refraining from jumping on the forcible rescue operations .
Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. told reporters here that he will not call the pull - out of marine soldiers in the jungles of Jolo island , encircling Abu Sayyaf militant who hold three employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) -- Swiss Andreas Notter , Italian Eugenio Vagni and Filipina Mary Jean Lacaba -- since their abduction on Jan. 15 in nearby Patikul town .
Teodoro said the decision is being made by the Crisis Management Committee , chaired by Sulu Governor Abdusakur Tan and includes other agencies , like the Armed Forces of the Philippines ( AFP ) to secure the safe release of ICRC hostages .
The three in captive earlier appealed for government negotiation in local media interviews sanctioned by their captors .
Abu Sayyaf militants had repeatedly urged the military to withdraw from the tension - filled Jolo island as a precondition to free the hostages .
AFP chief Gen. Alexander
Yano said a pull - out or reduction in military cordon will slacken the pressure on kidnappers and allow them to roam around in larger areas .
" As I have always mentioned , we have a range of options from the most benign to the most violent - that is the final military option , " Yano said , adding " it 's a complex situation that have to be addressed in a complex manner . "
He said the safety of the hostages is the top concern .
Meanwhile , the military authorities said the same pressure is being put on kidnappers hold at least five hostages , including a Sri Lankan non-government organization worker , in the nearby island of Basilan .
Commodore Alex Pama , chief of the military 's Task Force Trillium and concurrent chief of the Naval Forces Western Mindanao , said the kidnappers are being restricted in a relatively small zone that is under military supervision around the clock .
But he said there is no actual rescue operation for the hostages ' safety concern .
At least five hostages snatched by the Al Qaeda linked Abu Sayyaf and affiliated gangs during the past month remain in captive in Basilan .
The latest victim is Omar Jaleel , a Sri-Lankanmember of the Non-Violent Peace Force , who was snatched in his office - resident Lamitan City on Feb. 13 .

Netflix is the latest media company to integrate with social - networking Web site Facebook , whose huge community of young , tech - savvy users could help drive growth of the online DVD rental service 's subscriber base .
Starting on Tuesday , Netflix users can use Facebook Connect -- software that links individual Facebook pages to third - party Web sites -- to share their ratings of Netflix rentals with their Facebook friends , the companies said in a statement .
" Intuitively , the folks streaming ( Netflix movies ) on the laptop tend to be the under - 25 crowd , " Netflix spokesman Steve Swasey said .
" You could make the leap that it is the more tech - savvy ... the early adopter crowd ... but Facebook is becoming more mainstream . "
Movie ratings will appear on Netflix subscribers '
Facebook pages if they opt into the program , and will link back to the correlating movie page at Netflix.com , the companies said .
The tie - up puts Netflix 's brand and its fast - growing online streaming service - - a major growth driver for its subscriber base -- in front of more than 175 million active Facebook users through what is essentially a marketing channel .
Facebook Connect , launched last year , was expected to transform the social network from a private site where activity occurs entirely within a walled garden to a Web - wide phenomenon where software makers , with user permission , can tap member data for use on their sites .
Among others , early partners included CBS , Disney - ABC , Discovery.com , and Hulu , jointly owned by News Corp and NBC Universal .

Commenting on the latest Israeli one - directional onslaught against the Palestinians of Gaza Strip , the Israeli 10th TV channel has disclosed that the Israeli genocidal forces had used half of its air force and had launched at least 2500 air raids against Gaza Strip .
The television military correspondent stated that the Israeli warplanes had dropped more than a thousand tons of explosives , including white phosphorous and DIME ( Dense Inert Metal Explosive ) bombs , during three weeks on the virtually unarmed densely populated 360 square Kilometers Strip .
He added that the shells fired by tanks , artillery , gunboats , and infantry were not included in those fired by the air force .
After a whole week of continuous air bombardments Israel sent in its elite foot soldiers ; 30,000 of them , and called in 10,000 of its reservists .
Armed with the latest weapons of mass murder , covered with an umbrella of free reigning air force , and accompanied with raining shells of heavy artilleries , they drove their tanks into the civilian towns murdering civilians and destroying every structure in their path .
Living outside of Gaza one cannot fully understand the barbarity of this genocide especially when the Western media had barely covered any of its atrocity .
To gain a slight idea of its enormity one should remember that , during the 6 - days war of 1967 , this same Israeli army was distributed on four fronts ; Egyptian , Jordanian , Syrian , and Lebanese , and it was fighting regular armies .
Now the whole brunt of this army is concentrated on a small strip against unarmed and untrained civilian population .
Latest official count was 1350 murdered , 40 % of them were children , and 5300 were injured ; mutilated and amputated .
It was reported that 80 % of the injured were the victims of burning phosphorous bombs .
More dead are being discovered under the rebels , and many seriously injured are expected later on to die .
Israeli tanks had left several city blocks completely destroyed without any homes or structure standing .
The tanks shelled homes and apartment towers .
Due to the small size of Gaza Strip Palestinians had to build vertically .
Many apartment towers went up 15 - 20 stories high with each story containing 6 - 8 apartments .
A total of 20,000 buildings were completely or partially burnt and damaged .
The UN has reported that more than 50,000 Palestinians are left homeless and are now crowded into 50 emergency shelters .
An estimated of 50,000 more are living with relatives and in tents they erected on the ruins of their homes .
The Israeli bombardment targeted everything in Gaza including government buildings , police headquarters , banks and business offices , the main university , 67 schools sheltering civilians , shopping centers and market places , factories , water , sewer , and electricity infrastructures , private homes and apartment towers and charity organizations .
Farms , including their animals , were also targeted and hundreds of acres of crops and fruit groves were incinerated .
Religious buildings , where civilians usually seek shelter , were specifically targeted .
Israeli fighter planes had completely destroyed 41 mosques , and partially damaged 51 others .
One church was also targeted .
Even cemeteries were not spared ; 5 of them were bombed .
Although the Israeli army was given the exact GPS co-ordinates of every UN structure , as asserted by Christopher Gunness , the UNRWA spokesman , Israeli F - 16 planes had repeatedly dropped phosphorous bombed on UN schools knowing very well that hundreds of civilians had taken shelter there .
At least 45 children and women were burnt and murdered there .
The UN headquarters in Gaza City was also hit with three , not just one , phosphorous bombs burning tons of humanitarian aid and food stuff .
The fire kept on burning for three days .
UN - flagged humanitarian convoy was also shelled killing one driver .
Medical centers and paramedics were not spared .
The Red Crescent Al - Quds hospital in Tal el - Hawa neighborhood was hit by Israeli shells and caught on fire .
Other two hospitals ; Al - Wafa and Al - Fata hospitals , were also shelled , leading the World Health Organization to express its deep concern about the serious implications of such bombardments .
16 other smaller health clinics and 16 ambulances were also damaged .
Medics were targeted and prevented from helping the injured .
Ten of them , including two doctors , were murdered .
Media centers were particularly targeted .
Local and international news reporters were prevented from entering Gaza .
Those , who were able to enter , were directly targeted .
The Al - Shuruq office tower housing several international and Arab media outlets was directly hit .
Two cameramen working for Abu Dhabi TV were injured , while the offices of Reuters News Agency , Fox TV , Sky , and Al - Arabiya TV offices were damaged .
Another raid had damaged the headquarter offices of Al - Resala newspaper .
Similar to all their previous wars the Israeli soldiers had committed massacres against Palestinian unarmed civilians .
They have used internationally banned weapons such as phosphorous bombs , DIME , and depleted uranium , as reported by international physicians , eyewitnesses , and military experts .
Israeli soldiers had mutilated the bodies of their victims to instill terror in the hearts of people hoping they will leave Gaza .
Israeli soldiers herded many families in one building using them as human shield , and then later on bombed the building on top of them .
They shot civilians , mainly children , directly and at point blank .
The bodies of some children were found shot several times ; as many as 18 bullets in the body of a 12 years old girl , and 12 bullets in the body of her 2 years old sister .
Israeli soldiers had wiped off whole Palestinian families .
Al - Samuni family lost 11 members , Abu Aisha family lost 6 , Batran family lost 6 , al - Rayyan family lost 15 and al - Balousha family lost 5 sisters .
Other families , too many to mention here , were either murdered or incinerated by the phosphorous bombs .
The Israeli army has been carrying out a deliberate indiscriminate mass murder .
During the first Intifada , 1987 � 1993 , they murdered 1162 Palestinians .
During the second Intifada , 2001 - 2006 , they murdered 5500 Palestinians .
Now , in a short period of three weeks , they murdered 1350 Palestinians .
This onslaught is a holocaust since the many tons of phosphorous bombs , dropped on Gaza cities , had burnt civilians to the bones , burnt their homes and buildings , and burnt their fields and crops .
This is the holocaust that the Israeli Deputy Defense Minister , Matan Vilnai , had threatened Palestinians with when he stated : " the more Qassam fire intensifies and the rockets reach a longer range , they will bring upon themselves a bigger shoah ( holocaust ) because we will use all our might to defend ourselves . "
One cannot help but wonder how could a group of people , who claim to be the victims of a holocaust , commit another holocaust against another nation .
What is it that feeds , perpetuates and intensifies this Judaic genocidal spirit although all Arabs , including Palestinians , had offered these Zionist Jews many agreements of coexistence , peace and security ?
The answer comes through their media outlets , through the words of their scholarly educators , and through the teachings of their Rabbis .
" All of the Palestinians must be killed ; men , women , infants , and even their beasts " cries the religious opinion of Rabbi Yisrael Rosen , the director of the long - established Tsomet Religious Institute .
He wrote that Palestinians are like the nation of Amalekites , who attacked the Israelite tribes led by Moses on their way to Jerusalem .
He stated that the Lord sent down in the Torah a ruling that allowed the Jews to kill the Amalekites , and that this ruling is known in Jewish jurisprudence .
The Torah states : " Annihilate the Amalekites from the beginning to the end .
Kill them and wrest them from their possessions .
Show them no mercy .
Kill continuously , one after the other .
Leave no child , plant , or tree .
Kill their beasts , from camels to donkeys . "
Rosen stated that Amalekites are not a particular race , but rather all those who hate and oppose the Jews ; Christians and Muslims .
Many leading Israeli Rabbis support Rosen�s views .
Israel�s former Sephardic Chief Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu advocated carpet bombing of Gaza stating that " there is absolutely no moral prohibition against the indiscriminate killing of civilians during massive military offensive on Gaza " ( The Jerusalem Post , 30 May , 2007 ) .
His son Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu amplified his father�s genocidal call stating : " if they don�t stop after we kill 100 , then we must kill a thousand , then we must kill 10,000 and even a million "
Many Rabbis had argued that Palestinians in Gaza are not innocent civilians and that during war time it is not individuals but nations the Israelis are fighting .
( It seems that Hitler had adopted this Telmudic teaching when he persecuted all European Jews )
Israeli educators , scholars , and politicians , openly , advocate the annihilation of all Palestinians .
Dr. Nachum Rakover , a legal scholar , opined " They voted for killers and sent them to kill us .
To call them ( civilians ) innocent is a tragic comedy � civilians are partners of the killers " Eli Yeshai , Israeli official in the Orthodox Shas party argued that " extermination of the enemy is sanctioned by the Torah " Many other politicians called for the need for " wiping off Gaza from the face of earth " , and " annihilating of every moving thing there . "
The right - wing Israeli politician Avigdor Lieberman proposed nuking Gaza following the US example when it dropped the atomic bomb on Japan during WWII .
This " ideology of annihilation " is by no means a minority opinion in Israel , but represents a mainstream in the Jews of Israel as well as Jews in the West ( US ) .
The popular attitude is " if it was right by God to order us to commit genocide during Biblical time , why can�t it be right to commit genocide now .
Has God changed his mind ? "
Indeed Judaic god is a racist genocidal god .
Watch and listen here to an example of how Israeli Jews are brainwashed and indoctrinated into the ideology of annihilation by their rabbis and scholars through Israeli media .
Watch Max Blumenthal�s videotape of a group of messianic Orthodox Jewish Chabad - Lubavitch exhibit this ideology in NYC in January 11 , 2009 .
The Israeli spokesman , Nachman Abramovic demonized Palestinian children stating " They may look young to you , but these people are terrorists at heart .
Don�t look at their deceptively innocent faces , try to think of the demons inside each of them �
I am absolutely certain these people would grow to be evil terrorists if we allowed them to grow� would you allow them to grow to kill your children or finish them off right now ?
� honost and moral people ought to differentiate between true humans and human animals .
We do kill human animals and we do so unapologetically .
Besides who in the West is in a position to lecture us on killing human animals .
After all , whose hands are clean ? "
Human animal mentioned by Abramovic refers to the Judaic religious belief that Jews are Gods chosen people ; the elite and the pure - blooded , while all others ( non-Jews , Goyims , gentiles ) are animal souls incarnated into human bodies to serve the Jews .
Killing a human animal is just a sport like hunting deer or birds .
Another Israeli spokeswoman , Tzipora Menache , stated that she was not worried about negative ramifications the Israeli onslaught on Gaza might have on the way the Obama administration would view Israel .
She said " You know very well , and the stupid Americans know equally well , that we control their government , irrespective of who sits in the White House .
You see , I know it and you know it that no American president can be in a position to challenge us even if we do the unthinkable .
What can they ( Americans ) do to us ?
We control congress , we control the media , we control show biz , and we control everything in America .
In America you can criticize God , but you can�t criticize Israel "

NEW �YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Bernard Madoff , who stole billions from investment clients , was ordered jailed Thursday after pleading guilty to all 11 criminal counts in one of Wall Street 's biggest swindles ever .
" I operated a Ponzi scheme , " said Madoff to the packed courtroom , after U.S. District Judge Denny Chin told him to explain his crimes .
" I thought it would end quickly , but it proved impossible , " said Madoff , who stole from thousands of victims through his investment firm .
" I am ashamed for these criminal acts .
I always knew this day would come . "
U.S. District Court Judge Denny Chin remanded the 70 - year - old to jail following his confession .
He was taken to Manhattan Correctional Center , near the courthouse in lower Manhattan .
He could face a maximum 150 - year sentence .
His sentencing was set for June 16 .
Madoff admitted that he never invested his clients ' money , and that he deposited the funds into a " Chase Manhattan " bank .
" When money was requested , I paid it out from the Chase account , " he said .
As Madoff wrung his hands and made other nervous gestures , the judge suggested that he pour himself a glass of water .
Madoff had successfully avoided detention after his December arrest , posting $ 10 million bail and cloistering himself with his wife in their $ 7 million Manhattan apartment .
He was able to remain in his residence , despite accusations from federal prosecutors that he tried to hide his assets from seizure by mailing diamond - studded jewelry to relatives .
Only a fraction of the missing money has been recovered .
The investors
Madoff created a decades - long scheme in which new investments were used to fund payoffs to earlier investors , to falsely create the appearance of legitimate returns .
Richard Friedman , an accountant who said he lost $ 3.1 million to Madoff , told CNN that he hopes Madoff is sentenced to the full 150 years and that he " lives a very long life " in prison .
" The crime is really unimaginable , " said Friedman .
" It 's not just a typical Ponzi scheme .
It affects society as a whole .
You do n't just have to be a Madoff investor to be affected by this . "
Friedman also blamed the Securities and Exchange Commission for allowing the scheme to go undetected for so long , and said that Madoff 's family members are probably complicit and should go to prison .
" There 's no way he could have acted alone , " said Friedman .
" There had to be other people involved .
The whole family , as far as I 'm concerned , once proof becomes available , should be thrown in jail . "
In Thursday 's court proceeding , Madoff faced many of his alleged victims -- with 50 courtroom seats reserved for them .
Some of the investors entrusted all their savings to his firm , Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC .
But not all is lost for these burned investors .
They could be eligible for $ 500,000 from the Securities Investor Protection Corp. , a government entity that provides funds to victims of failed brokerage firms , according to Irving Picard , the court - appointed trustee for the liquidation of Madoff assets .
Fuming at the SEC
At a Feb. 20 meeting at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan with several hundred Madoff investors , Picard said that $ 650 million had been recovered thus far .
He said the assets would be divided among the creditors , commensurate to how much they put in .
Many of the investors seem to be angrier with the SEC than with the man who stole their money .
At the Bankruptcy Court hearing , 77 - year - old investor Raymond Spungin , who claimed he lost $ 700,000 to Madoff , yelled , " We 're not just the victims of Madoff ; we 're the victims of the incompetence and irresponsibility of the SEC ! "
He was answered with loud applause from the crowd of ripped - off creditors .
The SEC had been alerted to Madoff 's fraudulent behavior by whistleblower Harry Markopolos , a Boston accountant who repeatedly contacted the commission but was ignored for his efforts .
" I gift - wrapped and delivered the largest Ponzi scheme in history to them and somehow they could n't be bothered to conduct a thorough and proper investigation , " he said , in testimony to the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets on Feb .
4 .
But the times are changing .
In January , Mary Schapiro assumed the role of SEC chairwoman , after the former chair , Chris Cox , resigned under severe criticism .
Schapiro on Wednesday requested more funds for the commission to ramp up enforcement and examination staff .
Also , the SEC is taking steps to centralize whistleblower tips to better follow leads , rather than have them funneled through separate departments .
Markopolos , in testimony , said he 's already alerted to the SEC to two new fraud cases , but provided no further details .
Allan Chernoff CNN senior correspondent and Julian Cummings , Laurie Segall and Deborah Brunswick of the CNN New York bureau contributed to this report .
It began as a subprime surprise , became a credit crunch and then a global financial crisis .
At last week ’s World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , Russia and China blamed America , everyone blamed the bankers , and the bankers blamed you and me .
From where I sat , the majority of the attendees were stuck in the Great Repression : deeply anxious but fundamentally in denial about the nature and magnitude of the problem .
Some foretold the bottom of the recession by the middle of this year .
Others claimed that India and China would be the engines of recovery .
But mostly the wise and powerful had decided to trust that John Maynard Keynes would save us all .
I heard almost no criticism of the $ 819 - billion stimulus package making its way through Congress .
The general assumption seemed to be that practically any kind of government expenditure would be beneficial -- and the bigger the resulting deficit the better .
There is something desperate about the way economists are clinging to their dogeared copies of Keynes ’ “ General Theory . ”
Uneasily aware that their discipline almost entirely failed to anticipate the current crisis , they seem to be regressing to macroeconomic childhood , clutching the Keynesian “ multiplier effect ” -- which holds that a dollar spent by the government begets more than a dollar ’s worth of additional economic output -- like an old teddy bear .

They need to grow up and face the harsh reality :
The Western world is suffering a crisis of excessive indebtedness .
Governments , corporations and households are groaning under unprecedented debt burdens .
Average household debt has reached 141 % of disposable income in the United States and 177 % in Britain .
Worst of all are the banks .
Some of the best - known names in American and European finance have liabilities 40 , 60 or even 100 times the amount of their capital .
The delusion that a crisis of excess debt can be solved by creating more debt is at the heart of the Great Repression .
Yet that is precisely what most governments propose to do .
The United States could end up running a deficit of more than 10 % of GDP this year ( adding the cost of the stimulus package to the Congressional Budget Office ’s optimistic 8.3 % forecast ) .
Nor is that all .
Last year , the Bush administration committed $ 7.8 trillion to bailout schemes , in the form of loans , investments and guarantees .
Now the talk is of a new “ bad bank ” to buy the toxic assets that the Troubled Asset Relief Program could n’t cure .
No one seems to have noticed that there already is a “ bad bank . ”
It is called the Federal Reserve System , and its balance sheet has grown from just over $ 900 billion to more than $ 2 trillion since this crisis began , partly as a result of purchases of undisclosed assets from banks .

Just how much more toxic waste is out there ?
New York University economist Nouriel Roubini puts U.S. banks ’ projected losses from bad loans and securities at $ 1.8 trillion .
Even if that estimate is 40 % too high , the banks ’ capital will still be wiped out .
And all this is before any account is taken of the unfunded liabilities of the Medicare and Social Security systems .
With the economy contracting at a fast clip , we are on the eve of a public - debt explosion .
And similar measures are being taken around the world .
The born - again Keynesians seem to have forgotten that their prescription stood the best chance of working in a more or less closed economy .
But this is a globalized world , where uncoordinated profligacy by national governments is more likely to generate bond - market and currency - market volatility than a return to growth .
There is a better way to go : in the opposite direction .
The aim must be not to increase debt but to reduce it .
This used to happen in one of two ways .
If , say , Argentina had an excessively large domestic debt , denominated in Argentine currency , it could be inflated away -- Argentina just printed more money .
If it were an external debt , the government defaulted and forced the creditors to accept less .
Advertisement
Today , America is Argentina .
Europe is Argentina .
Former investment banks and ordinary households are Argentina .
But it will not be so easy for us to inflate away our debts .
The deflationary pressures unleashed by the financial crisis are too strong -- consumer prices in the U.S. have been falling for three consecutive months .
Nor is default quite the same for banks and households as it is for governments .
Understandably , monetary authorities are anxious to avoid mass bankruptcies of banks and households , not least because of the downward spiral caused by distress sales .
So what can we do ?
First , banks that are de facto insolvent need to be restructured , not nationalized .
( The last thing the U.S. needs is to have all of its banks run like Amtrak or , worse , the IRS . )
Bank shareholders will have to face that they have lost their money .
Too bad ; they should have kept a more vigilant eye on the people running their banks .
Government will take control in return for a substantial recapitalization , but only after losses have been meaningfully written down .
Those who hold the banks ’ debt , the bondholders , may have to accept a debt - for - equity swap or a 20 % “ haircut ” -- a disappointment , but nothing compared with the losses suffered when Lehman Bros. went under .
State life - support for dinosaur banks should not and must not impede the formation of new banks by the private sector .
It is vital that state control does not give the old , moribund banks an unfair advantage .
So recapitalization must be a once - only event , with no enduring government guarantees or subsidies .
And there should be a clear timetable for “ re-privatization ” -- within , say , 10 years .
The second step we must take is a generalized conversion of American mortgages to lower interest rates and longer maturities .
About 2.3 million U.S. households face foreclosure .
That number is certain to rise as more adjustable - rate mortgages reset , driving perhaps 8 million more households into foreclosure and causing home prices to drop further .
Few of those affected have any realistic prospect of refinancing at more affordable rates .
So , once again , what is needed is state intervention .

Purists say this would violate the sanctity of the contract .
But there are times when the public interest requires us to honor the rule of law in the breach .
Repeatedly in the course of the 19th century , governments changed the terms of bonds that they issued through a process known as “ conversion . ”
A bond with a 5 % return was simply exchanged for one with a 3 % return , to take account of falling market rates and prices .
Such procedures were seldom stigmatized as default .
Another objection to such a procedure is that it would reward the imprudent .
But moral hazard only really matters if bad behavior is likely to be repeated , and risky adjustable - rate mortgages are n’t coming back soon .
The issue , then , becomes one of fairness :
Why help the imprudent when the prudent are struggling too ?
One solution would be for the government - controlled mortgage lenders and guarantors , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , to offer all borrowers -- including those with fixed rates -- the same deal .
Permanently lower monthly payments for a majority of U.S. households almost certainly would do more to stimulate consumer confidence than all the provisions of the stimulus package , including tax cuts .
Advertisement
No doubt those who lost by such measures would not suffer in silence .
But the benefits would surely outweigh the costs to bank shareholders , bank bondholders and the owners of mortgage - backed securities .
Americans , Winston Churchill once remarked , will always do the right thing -- after they have exhausted all other alternatives .
If we are still waiting for Keynes to save us when Davos comes around next year , it may well be too late .
Only a Great Restructuring can end the Great Repression .
It needs to happen soon .
Gaza 's 1.5 million people are facing a food crisis as a result of the destruction of great areas of farmland during the Israeli invasion .
According to the World Food Programme , the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation and Palestinian officials , between 35 % and 60 % of the agriculture industry has been wrecked by the three - week Israeli attack , which followed two years of economic siege .
Christine van Nieuwenhuyse , the World Food Programme 's country director , said : " We are hearing that 60 % of the land in the north - where the farming was most intensive - may not be exploitable again .
It looks to me like a disaster .
It is not just farmland , but poultry as well .
" When we have given a food ration in Gaza , it was never a full ration but to complement the diet .
Now it is going to be almost impossible for Gaza to produce the food it needs for the next six to eight months , assuming that the agriculture can be rehabilitated .
We will give people a full ration . "
The FAO estimates that 13,000 families who depend directly on herding , farming and fishing have suffered significant damage .
" Before the blockade and the attack , " said Ahmad Sourani , director of the Agricultural Development Association of Gaza , which runs programmes with charities such as Britain 's Christian Aid , " Gaza produced half of its own food .
Now that has declined by 25 % .
In addition , a quarter of the population depends on agriculture for income .
What we have seen in large areas of farmland is the destruction of all means of life .
" We have seen a creeping process of farmers being forced out of the buffer zone around Gaza 's border .
Before 2000 we could approach and farm within 50 m of the fence .
After Israel 's evacuation of the settlements in 2005 , the Israeli army imposed a buffer of 300m .
Although it is elastic , now there are areas , depending on the situation , where farmers cannot reach their farms in safety within an area of over a kilometre .
It is indirect confiscation by fear .
My fear is that , if it remains , it will become de facto .
Bear in mind that 30 % of Gaza 's most productive land is within that buffer zone . "
The wholesale destruction of farms , greenhouses , dairy parlours , livestock , chicken coops and orchards has damaged food production , which was already hit by the blockade .
Buildings heavily damaged during Israel 's Operation Cast Lead included much of its agricultural infrastructure .
The Ministry of Agriculture was targeted , the agriculture faculty at al - Azhar university in Beit Hanoun largely destroyed , and the offices of the Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committees in Zaitoun - which provides cheap food for the poor - ransacked and vandalised by soldiers who left abusive graffiti .
Although international and local officials are still gathering figures , they believe that scores , perhaps hundreds , of wells and water sources have been damaged and several hundred greenhouses have been levelled , as well as severe damage inflicted on 60,000 - 75,000 dunums of Gaza 's 175,000 dunums ( 44,000 acres ) of farmable land .
As well as the physical damage done by Israeli bulldozers , bombing and shelling , land has been contaminated by munitions , including white phosphorous , burst sewerage pipes , animal carcasses and even asbestos used in roofing .
In many places , the damage is extreme .
In Jabal al - Rayas , once a thriving farming community , every building has been knocked down , and even the cattle killed and left to lie rotting in the fields .
In al - Atatra , Ahmad Hassan , 65 , the overseer of an orchard that once had hundreds of lemon and orange trees , surveyed an area flattened by bulldozers .
" This was the well , " he said , showing a pile of bulldozed concrete .
" We can clear the ground in two weeks .
Then what ?
The well is gone .
The pump has been destroyed .
And where will the trees come from to replant the land ? "
Van Nieuwenhuyse said : " Already , the price of meat has tripled since the Israeli operation began .
What is more worrying is the situation over vegetables .
Protein we can help with , but before this there were already deficiencies in the diet .
Now they will have to rely on Israel . "
It was a view echoed by Hassan Abu Etah , the deputy agriculture minister in Gaza .
" It has all been hugely damaged .
And it affects all of Gaza , not simply the farmers .
We produced some of what we needed .
It makes you wonder whether they wanted to change Gaza from production to consumption . "
In the heavily damaged village of Khuza 'a , near Khan Younis , Salam Najar surveyed the no-go zone that extends from the last houses in the village to the border fence where Israeli farmland begins .
" Most of the families here have farmed that side .
Now no one feels safe to go there .
They have destroyed it all . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
More than one - third of all weapons the United States has procured for Afghanistan 's government are missing , according to a government report released Thursday .
U.S.- issue M249 squad automatic weapons are shown at a camp in Kandahar in December .
The U.S. military failed to " maintain complete inventory records for an estimated 87,000 weapons -- or about 36 percent -- of the 242,000 weapons that the United States procured and shipped to Afghanistan from December 2004 through June 2008 , " a U.S. Government Accountability Office report states .
" Accountability lapses occurred throughout the supply chain , " it says .
The Defense Department spent roughly $ 120 million during that period to acquire a range of small arms and light weapons for the Afghan National Security Forces , including rifles , machine guns and rocket - propelled grenade launchers .
The military also failed to properly account for an additional 135,000 weapons it obtained for the Afghan forces from 21 other countries .
" What if we had to tell families [ of U.S. soldiers ] not only why we are in Afghanistan but why their son or daughter died at the hands of an insurgent using a weapon purchased by the United States taxpayers ?
But that 's what we risk if we were to have tens of thousands of weapons we provided washing around Afghanistan , off the books , " Rep. John Tierney , D - Massachusetts , chairman of the House Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs , said at the start of a congressional hearing on the report .
The military is unable to provide serial numbers for 46,000 of the missing 87,000 weapons , the report concludes .
No records have been maintained for the location or disposition for the other 41,000 weapons .
The report urges Defense Secretary Robert Gates to " establish clear accountability procedures for weapons while they are in the control and custody of the United States " and direct those " involved in providing these weapons to track ( them ) by serial number and conduct routine physical inventories . "
The GAO review comes as numerous senior officials -- including President Obama -- are expressing serious concern over the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan .
On Wednesday , eight Taliban suicide attackers struck Afghan government buildings and a prison in Kabul , killing at least 19 people in a coordinated attack that the Taliban said was in retaliation for the mistreatment of prisoners , according to Afghan officials .
The attacks raised new questions over the effectiveness of the ongoing $ 16.5 billion U.S. effort to train and equip Afghan security forces .
Officials from the State and Defense departments intend to request an additional $ 5.7 billion in assistance for the Afghan army and police in fiscal year 2009 , according to the report .
The Obama administration is conducting a top - to - bottom review of U.S. policy toward both Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan .
The president will likely make a decision on sending additional troops to Afghanistan " in the course of the next few days , " Gates said Tuesday .

Stargate Universe 's scientist , the talented Robert Carlyle , explains how some deadly decisions help to make SGU the darkest Stargate of them all .
Plus , find out who'll be filling our crucial Gate - banter void .
Spoilers ahead !

We were excited to catch up with Robert Carlyle , the eldest castmember of the new Stargate Universe clan , at the Sci Fi Channel Upfronts .
Thankfully , this seasoned actor spared a few moments to set us straight about SGU — turns out it 's full of death and darkness and a very funny David Blue .
We know so little about your character .
What else can you tell us ?
I play Dr. Nicholas Rush .
He 's a scientist .
He 's a little bit in his mind , but he has his reasons , which will remain secret for the moment .
I guess what makes this Stargate different from the previous shows in the franchise is , it 's a lot darker than the other ones .
This has less to do with interaction with an alien race and more about survival on the ship itself .
Advertisement
Rush takes these people through the Stargate onto what they think is another world , and in fact it 's actually a ship .
It 's a massive ship called called Destiny .
It was a ship that was launched hundreds of thousands of years ago by the Ancients themselves , and is now floating through space .
No one was ever meant to be there .
The team that is there is ill - equipped to be there .
So the first six or seven episodes are actually all called " Air , " " Fire , " " Water " and " Earth " because it 's about surviving amongst that , it 's more drama - based and more character - driven .
From what we 've read it sounds like there is a darker angle , can you expand about how much more darker these characters really are , will we be actually dealing with death ?
Certainly , certainly .
In the first three hours there are three deaths .
It 's very heavy .
There 's a suicide by episode six , as well .
Because these people are in the far reaches of the universe , never to come home .
That 's the thing Rush explains , that it 's impossible to go back .
And they do n't know where else to turn .
And you said your character is a bit out of his senses ?
Well not really , from his point of view , but the others think that he 's maybe losing it .
But he does things for a reason .

Who have you enjoyed working with on this cast ?
We 've got a great cast [ including ] Justin Lewis .
David Blue is a terrific young actor .
Brian J. Smith , he 's new but he 's terrific also .
Elyse [ Levesque ] is the best .
Alaina Huffman ... there are some terrific actors there .
And we had to , because as I said this show is about about the characters and has less to do with alien races .
Advertisement
Do you still get to keep that wonderful Stargate banter that we all treasure so much ?
David Blue , particularly [ does ] ... he 's naturally funny anyway , he plays a kind of a comic relief , I guess , on the show .
Advertisement
We knew it !
His character as the " slacker genius " sounded so much like a young McKay , but we know Blue will make it his own , plus he was adorable on Ugly Betty .
Thank you Robert Carlyle with all this darkness talk my expectations are climbing higher than they 've ever been before .

I mean holy cow that 's a lot of deaths , plus a suicide , should be interesting .
Perhaps in this series the dead will actually stay that way .
I believe in you SGU , bring on your dark Gate , we 're ready .
Picture from Subduction Leads To Orogeny .
From giant salamanders the size of grown men , to fish that turn inside out and bladder - infesting sea creatures , the world is full of some truly bizarre ( and at times frightening ) creatures .
Yet they each serve an ecological purpose and these strange animals are fascinating in their own right .
Chinese Giant Salamander

Something tells us these giant salamanders were never called for in any witch ’s recipe .
Seriously , look at that thing !
That lives under some people ’s porches !
The United States is also home to a giant salamander called the Hellbender , and it ’s …well , the name fits .
However , it is not as endangered as the shockingly strange - looking Chinese cousin .
The Chinese giant salamander can grow to be nearly six feet long .
Giant Coconut Crab
( Image via kottke )
This is not shopped .
This is not a hoax .
That is a giant crab on a garbage can .
They ’re native to Guam and other Pacific islands .
Coconut crabs are n’t endangered , per se , but due to tropical habitat destruction they are at risk .
In WWII , American soldiers stationed in the Pacific theater wrote home with tales about entire atolls being covered in the armor - plated giants .
These crabs can crack a coconut in one swipe ; but they ’re generally too slow to be very dangerous to humans .
Children pass lazy afternoons by picking the crabs off tree trunks and watching them crash to the ground ; it ’s reportedly great fun .
And kind of messed up .
Angora Rabbit

The nightmare of every new boyfriend , this fluffy creature looks like a science experiment crossing a Sasquatch and a kitten gone wrong .
It ’s just a rabbit , however .
They were exceptionally popular in the 17th and 18th centuries among European nobility as lap pets , and many different hybrids were bred to suit changing tastes of different royalty .
The angora rabbit is still popular to this day .
Cantor ’s Giant Soft Shelled Turtle
( Image via Sharenator )
The Pelochelys cantorii , or Cantor ’s Giant Soft Shelled Turtle , is one of the most unusual looking animals on earth and certainly one of the most odd looking turtles in existence .
Yet few people have seen it or know about it .
It ’s not a sea turtle – the Cantor prefers to inhabit inland , close to streams and wetlands .
It grows very large , with adult shells often spanning more than six feet .
They are native to Cambodia but are very rare .
Star Nosed Mole
( Image via Purple Slinky )
Pucker up .
The star nosed mole is a tenacious creature , able to withstand severe cold and burrow easily through ice to make its home and find food .
It lives in Canada and the East Coast of the United States .
It favors a high protein diet of clams , snails , small rodents , mollusks and worms .
It ’s not a very big creature – about the size of a hand .
But its 22 nose tentacles are hard to miss .
They help the mole find food .
Climbing Fish
( Image via 7is7 )
People were shocked to find the fish with “ hands ” – and now scientists are even more shocked to find a fish that happens to be a skilled rock climber .
It would seem the march of evolution is indeed inexorable .
Lithogenes wahari is a type of catfish with specialized pelvic fins that act as gripping “ hands ” to climb rocks , walls and other terrain .
The fish is incredibly rare and the most recent sighting occurred after twenty years of research .
There are actually a number of so - called walking fish although not all are true fish .
Angler Fish
Some guys just ca n’t catch a break .
The male angler fish is 1/20th the size of the female angler fish .
The huge , traumatizingly ugly spiny fish with the glowing “ fishing rod ” lure you saw in Finding Nemo ?
That ’s the female .
The male is that tiny little blob attached to his horrific goddess that you never noticed .
He burrows in with his teeth and she “ feeds ” him ex-utero style until he eventually loses his eyeballs , then internal organs and finally his life .
By then , she ’s got his sperm so it does n’t matter .
Anglers are deep - sea fish , but that does n’t mean they ’re safe from threat .
Candiru
Did you hear the one about the Amazonian fish who swam up a penis , took up residence in said penis owner ’s bladder , and could not be extracted due to its umbrella - like spines ?
It ate away at the man until he hemorrhaged .
Though evidence of candiru extraction surgeries are mostly secondhand , enough discussion exists in the scientific body of literature to confirm the dreadful possibility .
( Legends of penectomy are almost certainly false , however . )
The slick , slim , small Candiru frequently lodge themselves in larger fish and animals and are nearly impossible to remove .
( By the way , there are actually far more poisonous fish in the world than there are snakes .
Just something to think about . )
The moral of the story : do n’t pee in the Amazon .
Hagfish

The Pacific Ocean Hagfish has a disgusting way of defending itself .
When under attack , it oozes a suffocating slime from its many pores that envelops its predator in a fatal mass of fibrous goo .
The hagfish , unfortunately , sometimes falls prey to its own defense mechanism , but normally it twists itself into knots to escape the gelatinous goop .
Firefox 3.1 Facing Late Arrival ; Will It Ship With TraceMonkey ?
by Ostatic Staff - Feb. 24 , 2009
Digital Arts Online has a thorough break down of some of the snags the Firefox development team has encountered as it continues work on the browser 's 3.1 release .
TraceMonkey , the JavaScript engine that 's responsible for the browser 's performance boost , seems to be what 's holding its actual release back .
According to the forum posts the article points to , both Firefox developers and those focusing specifically on TraceMonkey agree that a decision has to be made -- but whether it 's better to release Firefox 3.1 without TraceMonkey , release Firefox with TraceMonkey disabled by default , or give the developers a set amount of time before making the decision at all -- might be a sticking point .
Mozilla 's vice president of engineering , Mike Shaver , says that pulling TraceMonkey from Firefox 3.1 is unlikely , and that in the grand scheme of things , it 's better to release the browser working well , no matter how long it takes .
I agree with this line of thought to some extent -- an application that is n't usable should n't be rushed to market simply to reach a deadline .
But the browser market is a little different -- with competition from Chrome , and Internet Explorer 8 's release coming up quickly -- would Mozilla do better to finish up and release what is already a fairly solid product , and continue to work on TraceMonkey until it 's ready for integration ?
It 's a tough call , because at the very least , it means Mozilla has to re-imagine what it ideally wanted the 3.1 release to be -- and determine what it 's willing to put on hold until a later release .
That is , without a doubt , disappointing for all the development teams involved .
Waiting until Mozilla 's vision of 3.1 is realized perfectly , however , is potentially dangerous .
Shaver emphasizes that the developer discussions are n't a " revolt " -- I believe this wholeheartedly .
It seems a good sign -- that the developers ( and management ) are passionate , enthusiastic , and willing to discuss ( maybe heatedly , at times ) the software they are working on .
Mozilla says that it 's likely now that Firefox 3.1 will ship in the second quarter of this year , and will probably see another beta version or two before it is ready for the release candidate designation .

Wandering Poles May Explain Ups And Downs Of Ancient Mars Shoreline
A view of Mars as it might have appeared more than 2 billion years ago , with a low - latitude ocean filling the lowland basin that now occupies the north polar region .
Topographic deformation of features that ring the basin , which are hypothesized to be shorelines formed by an ancient ocean , suggests that Mars experienced significant true polar wander -- reorientation of the planet relative to its rotation axis -- that brought the planet into its present rotational state .
The margins of the ocean shown here account for the topographic deformation that would have resulted from this reorientation .
Sinuous features near the top of the image are valleys carved by large floods that may have supplied the ocean water .
The image was generated using Viking Orbiter images and topographic data from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter on board the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft .

Berkeley CA ( SPX ) Jun 13 , 2007
A paper in this week 's issue of Nature by University of California , Berkeley , geophysicists demolishes one of the key arguments against the past presence of large oceans on Mars .
Even from Earth , a large plain surrounding the planet 's north pole looks like a sediment - filled ocean basin .
In the 1980s , Viking spacecraft images revealed two possible ancient shorelines near the pole , each thousands of kilometers long with features like those found in Earth 's coastal regions .
The shorelines - Arabia and the younger Deuteronilus - date from between 2 and 4 billion years ago .
In the 1990s , however , NASA 's Mars Global Surveyor mapped the Martian topography to a resolution of 300 meters , and found that the shoreline varies in elevation by several kilometers ( more than a mile ) , rising and falling like a wave with several thousand kilometers from one peak to the next .
Because shoreline elevations on Earth , measured relative to sea level , are typically constant , many experts rejected the notion that Mars once had oceans .
UC Berkeley scientists have now discovered that these undulating Martian shorelines can be explained by the movement of Mars ' spin axis , and thus its poles , by nearly 3,000 kilometers along the surface sometime within the past 2 or 3 billion years .
Because spinning objects bulge at their equator , this so - called " true polar wander " could have caused shoreline elevation shifts similar to those observed on Mars .
" When the spin axis moves relative to the surface , the surface deforms , and that is recorded in the shoreline , " said study coauthor Michael Manga , UC Berkeley professor of earth and planetary science .
" On planets like Mars and Earth that have an outer shell , or lithosphere , that behaves elastically , the solid surface will deform differently than the sea surface , creating a non-uniform change in the topography , " added primary author Taylor Perron , a former UC Berkeley graduate student now a postdoctoral fellow in Harvard University 's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences .
Perron 's calculations show that the resistance of Mars ' elastic crust could create several - kilometer elevation differences for features like a shoreline , in accord with topographic measurements .
The Arabia shoreline varies in elevation by about 2.5 kilometers , while the Deuteronilus shoreline varies by about 0.7 kilometers .
" This is a beautiful result that Taylor got .
The mere fact that you can explain a good fraction of the information about the shorelines with such a simple model is just amazing .
It 's something I never would have guessed at the outset , " said co-author Mark Richards , professor of earth and planetary science and dean of mathematical and physical sciences at UC Berkeley .
Richards goes so far as to add , " This really confirms that there was an ocean on Mars . "
Richards pointed out that the tilt of the rotation axis of a planet actually remains fixed relative to the sun , but the crust moves relative to this axis .
The question remains : What caused Mars ' rotation axis to move relative to the crust ?
Any major shift of mass on a planet - within the mantle , or between the mantle and the crust to form a volcano , or even via impact from outer space - could cause a shift of the rotation axis because a spinning planet is most stable with its mass farthest from its spin axis .
Richards has modeled true polar wander in Earth 's past that was generated by the upwelling of hot mantle in the interior of the planet , which some scientists claim shifted our planet 's rotation axis 90 degrees some 800 million years ago , tipping the planet on its side .
Perron , Manga , Richards and their colleagues calculate that on Mars , an initial shift of 50 degrees from today 's pole , equal to about 3,000 kilometers on the surface , would be sufficient to disrupt the Arabia shoreline , while a subsequent shift of 20 degrees from today 's pole , or 700 kilometers , would have altered the Deuteronilus shoreline .
Interestingly , today 's pole and the two ancient poles lie in a straight line equidistant from the planet 's biggest feature , the Tharsis rise , a bulge just north of the equator that contains Mars ' most recent volcanic vent , Olympus Mons .
Tharsis is the largest volcano in the solar system , and formed about 4 billion years ago , not long after Mars solidified .
Dynamically , the relative positions of Tharsis and the pole path is exactly what would be expected for any mass shift on Mars that is smaller than the Tharsis rise , since the planet would reorient in a way that keeps Tharsis on the equator .
" This alignment is unlikely to occur by coincidence , " the team wrote .
Manga has a hunch about the mass shift that precipitated the tilt of Mars ' rotation axis .
If a flood of water had filled the Arabia ocean about 3 billion years ago , to a depth some have calculated at up to several kilometers , that mass at the pole might have been enough to shift the pole 50 degrees to the south .
Once the water disappeared , the pole could have shifted back , then shifted again by 20 degrees during the deluge that created the Deuteronilus shoreline .
Because it 's unclear whether the two shorelines represent separate inundations or whether one is the receded shoreline of a larger sea , an alternative scenario features the Arabia ocean receding to the Deuteronilus shoreline , shifting the pole from 50 to 20 degrees .
Then , once the Arabia ocean disappears entirely , the pole returns to its current position .
Richards is skeptical of this , however , pointing out that thermal convection within the hot interior of Mars could also have caused the poles to wander .
" There must certainly be thermal convection in Mars now because Olympus Mons had new lava flows very recently , within the last 100 million years , " he said .
" But the jury 's still out . "
Manga said , too , that the source of the water , while unknown , must have produced a deluge greater than any observed on Earth , since huge canyons are cut in the flanks of the Tharsis rise .
The water may have evaporated , but it may also have sunk back into underground dikes , frozen near the surface but possibly liquid below .
The study , whose coauthors include Jerry X. Mitrovica and Isamu Matsuyama , will appear in the June 14 issue of the British journal Nature .
Mitrovica , who is with the Department of Physics at the University of Toronto in Ontario , Canada , and was a visiting Miller Professor at UC Berkeley , and Matsuyama , who is with the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington in Washington , D.C. , have developed models for the effect of polar wander and internal dynamic processes on the surface deformation of Mars .
The work is part of UC Berkeley 's BioMars project , funded by NASA 's Astrobiology Institute .
The research also was supported by UC Berkeley 's Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science , the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the NASA Mars Data Analysis Program .
Terrorism has become a rather elastic , overused term , especially since George W. Bush declared his global war seven and a half years ago .
After the 9/11 attacks , the Bush administration applied the term wholesale to a handful of foreign countries and what appeared to be entire populations .
Recognizing an opening , other governments eagerly latched on , sometimes brandishing the word as a weapon against political opponents .
Under surveillance : death penalty opponents pray as they protest Maryland 's death penalty in 2005 .
( Chris Gardner / Associated Press )
But few entities , it might be said , jumped in with the enthusiasm of the Maryland State Police .
The vigilant troopers did n't even need to look overseas for their targets .
They found their terrorists right here , in the Quaker halls , churches , campuses , community centres and neighborhood gathering spots of the most prosperous state in the union .
Oppose the death penalty ?
Must be a terrorist .
Oppose the Iraq war ?
Terrorist .
Anti-abortion ?
Interested in human rights ?
Opposed to government policy in general ?
Terrorist , terrorist , terrorist .
Possible crime : human rights
The details are still dribbling out , but it appears that for at least three recent years , the state police antiterrorism unit spied upon , infiltrated and documented groups of Marylanders who had the nerve to disagree with the policies of their government .
The police acknowledge that at least 53 individuals made their terrorist - watch list but the real number could be much higher .
The troopers zeroed in on Roman Catholic nuns , human rights activists and church groups .
They monitored animal rights advocates and cyclists pushing for more bicycle lanes .
They opened a dossier on Amnesty International .
( That group 's crime was listed as " human rights . " )
The troopers created files with titles like : " Terrorism : Anti-War Protesters , " and " Terrorism : Anti-Govern , " and " Terrorism : Environmental Extremists , " and " Terrorism : Pro-Life . "
To Maryland 's finest , even Quakers , the ultimate pacifists , constituted a " security threat group . "
It 's all out there
The troopers , of course , never wanted the public to hear about any of this .
It would all still be secret , shielded in the name of national security , were it not for discovery laws and some smart lawyers .
Now , some of their investigative reports , albeit redacted , are out in the open .
And what they describe is fascinating — a naked , unvarnished police view of legitimate dissent in one of the world 's most democratic countries .
Most of the reports made public so far describe the infiltration of anti-death penalty groups in 2005 and 2006 , when Maryland was preparing for two executions , which are rare in this state .
Undercover police attended meetings and compiled lists of attendees who were then duly labeled and given police files of their own .
Mike Stark , a national board member of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty , was described as a " socialist " in one undercover dispatch and an " anarchist " in another .
Students of political science might find that contradiction in terms amusing , but Stark does n't .
Death penalty activists , Stark told me this week , know they are generally regarded by police as pro-criminal , even subversive .
" As activists , " he said , " we consciously try to fight against that sentiment . "
But to be labelled a terrorist in an official file ?
" Creepy and disconcerting . " said Stark .
Law - abiding terrorists
The spying produced some strange scenes .
In one teleconferenced conversation with a death row prisoner , an undercover policeman in a Washington - area church wound up offering the condemned man words of comfort and support : " Be strong , " he urged .
But the agent was actually more interested in the call 's other participants .
One of them , doctoral student Shane Dillingham , was later classified as a terrorist .
His possible crime was listed as anarchism .
Weirdly , the undercover agents stressed repeatedly that none of the activists they were spying upon ever promoted violence or illegal activity .
Quite the opposite .
They constantly urged their colleagues to respect the law .
At one rally , an anti-death penalty group handed out cards declaring that " in the spirit of Gandhi , Dorothy Day , Martin Luther King , Aung San Suu Kyi , and countless others , we believe injustice must be met and challenged .
We engage only with love and respect for the inherent dignity of all human beings . "
The undercover trooper reported that sentiment and yet the investigation continued .
In fact , the terrorist - chasers eventually extended their surveillance to all manner of social activists .
Ratepayers beware
This week , the Washington Post reported that consumers fighting a steep increase in Maryland electricity rates were also targeted by the troopers , while members of the DC Anti-War Network , which opposes the Iraq war , were designated white supremacists and terrorists .
No explanation was given for that assessment .
In the spirit of post - 9/11 co-operative law enforcement , the Maryland troopers shared their investigative files with other agencies , ensuring that the " terrorists " they 'd uncovered were entered into at least one national database .
This effectively cast these people into the secret realm of lists used to deny security clearances , employment and even airline flights .
" No one at Maryland State Police , " concluded an independent investigation of the troopers ' excesses , " considered whether it was appropriate to transmit information about peaceful protest groups to a federally - funded criminal intelligence database . "
In fact , Stephen Sachs , the former U.S. attorney who conducted the investigation after accounts of the police spying started appearing in newspapers , was evidently even more astounded by the attitudes of the many senior troopers he interviewed .
" While the Maryland State Police employees with whom we spoke recognized that the individuals and groups under investigation here were not ' terrorists , ' under any reasonable and accepted definition of that word , " wrote Sachs , " none seemed to consider that a government agency 's decision to label someone a terrorist , particularly when that label is included in an external database , could cause serious harm to that person 's reputation , career and standing in the community . "
Furthermore , reported Sachs : " Many of the troopers and commanders whom we interviewed maintained , essentially , that it is better to be safe than sorry , and that even a remote risk to public safety justifies the infiltration of groups that plan lawful protests and demonstrations . "
' Am I being paranoid '
The Maryland State Police never laid a single charge of sedition or any other related crime against its targets .
Officially , the force now regrets the spying .
Its current director has called it " a waste of resources " and the troopers are reportedly in the process of " purging " their files .
Stark is not comforted .
" What does that mean ? " he asked during an interview .
" They 've already put it into an interagency database .
How many times has it been downloaded by various field agents and other agencies ?
How many times has it been re-indexed , reincorporated , merged into other databases , put on backup tapes that might be restored onto something else years from now ?
" Information is never destroyed .
And then someday , it 's like you do n't get on a plane .
Am I being paranoid ? "
Probably not .
As Ottawa engineer Maher Arar can explain , your name can stay on lists down here even when you 're cleared ( as Arar was by the Canadian government ) .
Guilt or innocence does n't necessarily have anything to do with it .
And of course , the Maryland troopers were n't the only police organization in the country hungry for a counterterrorism mission after 9/11 .
They 've just had the misfortune of being dragged into the spotlight .
There have been unspecific reports of other municipal and state forces doing the same sort of work .
In his investigation , Sachs concluded that the constitutional rights of the troopers ' targets were infringed .
" Group advocacy and group dissent are part of the DNA of American democracy , " he wrote .
" Groups formed to express political and moral beliefs , and to seek changes in government policy , have long been viewed as guarantors of political and cultural diversity , as protectors of dissident ideas from suppression by the majority , and as agents of legal and social change . "
The state police did n't return my request for a discussion of dissent .
And no one involved in any of the spying has been demoted , fired or reprimanded .
In fact , the lead undercover agent has been promoted , twice .
Members of Colombia ’s largest rebel group live openly on or near several Indian reservations in western Venezuela with at least the tacit approval of President Hugo Chavez , indigenous leaders here charge .
Although the border area has long absorbed Colombian refugees fleeing decades of war , members of the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia have become visible as never before in the last two or three years , buying supplies , looking for medical assistance and forging relationships with indigenous women , said Venezuelan Congressman Arcadio Montiel , a Wayuu Indian .
Leaders of several Indian communities clustered around this town in a wild rain forest area that forms the border with Colombia told The Times over the weekend that the FARC ’s presence is harming their culture and youth .
“ They have replaced the caciques , or chiefs , as authority figures and so who do the youths now want to emulate ?
The rebels , ” said Javier Armato , a Yupa Indian who is a former Zulia state deputy and onetime Chavez supporter .

During his 10 years in office , socialist Chavez , a fierce critic of the United States , has often expressed admiration and affinity for the FARC .
In 2007 , Chavez said his country shared a border not with Colombia , but with territory controlled by the FARC .
Chavez has toned down his pro-FARC rhetoric since March , when Colombian officials said data from a laptop recovered in a raid on a rebel camp in Ecuador indicated that the Venezuelan leader may have had contact with FARC leaders , even offering them material support .
Chavez denied any such contact .
“ Chavez sees the rebels as a line of defense in the event of U.S. interference or a civil war , ” said Montiel , another former Chavista who broke with the president over the presence of the FARC in his home state , Zulia , and joined splinter party Podemos .
He was interviewed last week in Caracas , the Venezuelan capital .
Montiel and several community leaders say the FARC operates camps in the Perija Mountains to the west , where they say the rebels rest and recruit and train Venezuelan Indian youths .

In an interview last year , Chavez political advisor Alberto Muller Rojas acknowledged the presence of Colombian rebels , saying that Venezuela has been a safe haven for more than 1 million Colombians fleeing war over the last several decades .
Muller Rojas said the rebels are more Colombia ’s responsibility than Venezuela ’s , as long as they do n’t harm residents .
But Indian leaders here say the rebels are slowly corrupting their cultures with arms , drugs and values that are anathema to their ways .
They are also slowly taking control of Indian lands by squatting and by marrying indigenous women
On many Saturdays , rebel mule trains descend from the rugged Perija Mountains through the two dozen Indian communities that surround this town , indigenous leaders said .

After parking their mules in foothill pastures , the rebels continue on by bus into Machiques , the nearest big city , to make telephone calls , run business errands and go to a market , they said .
The supplies are taken back up into the mountains .
At other times , they suddenly appear at doorways , seeking food , clothing or medicines .
“ They do n’t pay for anything , it ’s always for ‘ solidarity . ’
But you ca n’t say no to them .
Nor can you complain about them to others , because someone might inform on you , ” said one indigenous leader , who requested anonymity because of security concerns .
One reason more rebels are visible in Venezuela is the much more aggressive pursuit by Colombian armed forces under President Alvaro Uribe .
But Montiel said it ’s also because the rebels are here at the “ pleasure ” of Chavez .

An official at the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees in Machiques , which provides help to 800 Colombians registered as refugees , said that nobody from his office has had direct contact with Colombian rebels , but that he has received an increasing number of complaints from Indians over the last two years .
Some in the government insist that the supposed rebels are actually displaced Colombian civilians .
But all indigenous leaders interviewed here last weekend disputed that .
“ Everyone in the area knows who the displaced are because they register with the U.N.
Believe me , the people we see are FARC .
How do we know ?
Because they identify themselves as such , ” said one local leader , who like others interviewed declined to give his name for fear of reprisal
A Roman Catholic priest in the region says the rebels ’ presence has brought acts of terrorism .
“ I ca n’t talk to you about them because they ’ll kill me , ” said the priest , who also requested anonymity for security reasons .

Although there is a National Guard post 20 miles southeast of here , leaders say the Venezuelan armed forces make no effort to monitor or control the rebels ’ presence , said Armato , who has had to live in the state capital , Maracaibo , since he first denounced the rebels several years ago .
There is a general climate of insecurity in the border area , with the Chavez government blaming it on Colombian paramilitary forces who cross the border to chase the rebels , while ranchers say the rebels are responsible for a recent wave of kidnappings
“ Instead of making friends with the guerrillas , Chavez should be defending the diversity and plurality of the nation , ” Montiel said .

これは大昔の本で読んだモデル。
.
ビールジョッキを置くコースターというのがありますよね。紙でできてたりする、冷えたグラスの外側に付く水滴がテーブルに垂れるのを防ぐ、丸っこいやつ。あれが宙に浮いている状態を想像してください。
上から砂が少しづつ落ちてきます。砂時計の砂が落ちてくるみたいな感じ。さらさらした砂です。これが少しづつおちてきてコースターのほぼ中央に当たります。
砂はコースターの上に徐々にたまっていきます。
よくみると、砂はまずある程度真っ直ぐつみあがり、あるポイントで積みあがった砂が崩れる、という事を繰り返すのに気が付くはずです。で、全体として円錐形に砂が積みあがります。
やがて砂はコースター全体を埋め尽くし、その上に1つの円錐形を築きます。砂が崩れると一部は山に引っかかるものの、残りはコースターの縁から下に落ちていきます。
コースターの上にどれぐらいの山が築けるかは、砂の性質に依存します。コースターが円形なら、円錐形の頂上の角度は砂の性質にだけ依存し、ここれとコースターの面積から自動的に積み上げることができる山の高さが決まります。
さらさらの砂であれば頂上の角度はあまり鋭くなりません。湿ったような、粘々した砂の場合、頂上の角度は結構鋭くなります。
これが Sandpile on the coaster というモデルです 。
.
「 ある個人がどれぐらいの問題を解けるか」を定性的に説明するときに
Sandpile on the coaster モデルを使います 。
コースターの面積はその人がどれぐらい物を知っているのかを表します。面積が広いほど、モノを良く知っている。
砂の性質は、その人が自分が持っている知識に対してどれぐらい応用力があるか、を表します。粘っこいほど応用力があり、さらさらしているほど応用力が無い。
そして砂山の高さはどれぐらい複雑な問題を解けるか、を表します。
物をよく知っている人はコースターの面積が広いので、たとえさらさらの砂でも相応の高さの山を築けます。応用力のある人は砂が粘っこいのでコースターの面積が狭くても、相応の高さの山を築けます。
.
あなたの周りに頭の良い人がいて、ほとんど何も知らないのに問題をすいすい解けるとしましょう。この人は多分、砂が粘っこいのでしょう。彼と同じぐらい問題を解くにはどうすればいいか?
コースターの面積を増やせばよいのです。そうすれば、愚鈍な頭でも同じぐらい問題を解けるようになります。
コースターの面積を増やすのに、自分の頭の中に全部記憶するのは得策ではありません。本を多く読み、どこに何が書いてあるのかを把握し、その本をきちんと確保して、必要になったらいつでも参照できるようにしておくこと。それによってコースターの面積を広げ続けることができるようになります。
ようするに馬鹿ほど予習が大事と言うことです。
.
じゃぁ、逆に。粘っこい砂の持ち主の場合は?
コースターの縁の辺りを良く見てください。多くの場合、さらさらした砂は縁を超える砂粒は見つかりません。これに対して粘々した砂の場合、半粒分ぐらい砂が縁をはみ出していることがあります。
そう。応用力がある人は、コースター自身の面積より「ほんの少し」ですが大きな面積に対して円錐形を築いているのです。
そこで、コースターを板状のものではなくレース状の…つまり小さな穴の開いたものに変える事を考えます。
さらさらした砂の場合、穴から砂は落ちていきます。穴の分山の高さは低くなってしまう。下手な穴の開き方をしていると、あるポイントから先は、コースター上に砂がちょっぴり乗っているだけで、残りは全部穴から落ちていくため高さが稼げない…と言う状態になったりする。
しかし、粘っこい砂の場合、砂が互いに互いを支えあって、砂の穴を埋めてしまいます。その上に山を築いていきます。結果、コースターに穴なんか無かったかのように振舞う。
これは何を意味しているかと言うと、応用力のある人間ほど、基礎が大事、と言うことです。基礎が判れば応用は自力で利かせることができる。だから同じだけコースターの面積を広げるならば、徹底して基礎を学ぶ。そうすることでコースターの面をレース状に拡大する。小さな穴がたくさん開いている状態のほうがあいていない状態よりも同じ面を埋めるのに必要な面積は少なくて済みますから、その分早く埋め尽くせる。
逆に応用の効かない人間は、あちこち手を広げずに、じわじわと学習を進めるしかない。
.
コースターの面積を広げたとします。さらさらした砂の人の場合、砂はすぐコースター上に散らばり、山の高さが高くなり始めます。すぐまた縁から落ち始めますが。
粘っこい砂の場合、砂はなかなかコースター上に散らばりません。時折山が崩れてコースター上に広がると、なかなか高さが稼げなくなったりする。なまじっか従来のパターンが高効率だったので、コースターを広げるとむしろ一時的に効率が悪くなる。
このため、粘っこい砂タイプの人はなかなかコースターの面積を広げようとしない。つまり、応用力があるタイプほど知識の集積をないがしろにしがちで、それ故に微妙なところで成長が止まりやすい。なまじっか賢い上に、面積を増やしてもすぐ結果につながらないのでいらいらするわけですね。
応用力の無いタイプは、新しいことを学習すると即、それが成果につながるので、いったんそのことを自覚させればゆっくりと学習し続けるようになる。その代わり、このタイプは急速に成長することがありえない。
.
自分の砂のタイプをどうやって変えればいいのか、このモデルでは説明してくれなかった、と記憶しています。コースターの面積を効果的に広げろ、としか。
私がいろんな本に手を出しながら、ずーっと本を読み続けるようになったのは、このモデルの話を何だったかの本で読んでから、です。英語で覚えているので、多分小学校3,4年の頃読んだのだと思います。
ふと思い出したので、書いておくことにしました。

Having got tired of the Texas heat and absence at itself in the air conditioner car , the graduate of engineering faculty Scott Douson has solved a problem in rather original image .
Instead of laying out 1200 dollars for installation of the automobile air conditioner , the guy has decided to save money and make all , having established on a roof ... The usual house air conditioner .
The result is well visible on the photo : the ugly box on a roof , worsening aerodynamics and increasing fuel consumption , but , nevertheless , the initial purpose is reached – the heat is defeated : )
A leaflet distributed on yesterday 's ( Sat 28 Mar 09 ) ' Put People First ' march in London .
The leaflet argues against reformist demands as a response to the crisis and in favour of a radical transformation of social relations .
The “ financialised ” economy of endless credit is bankrupt , but there 's no going back to the world before it .
The boom years are over .
The global financial Ponzi schemes took hold late last century because , as Margaret Thatcher put it , there was no alternative under capitalist economic “ laws ” .
The world economy was already bankrupt : it could n't bleed enough profit out of people to keep going without debt delirium and financial scams .
But let ’s not forget that it was our struggles that forced the bosses to “ globalise ” their economy , touring the world looking for new sources of profits and creating more concentrations of troublesome workers as they went .
Now capital can't squeeze enough work out of us to pay for itself , let alone provide for our basic needs .
Now the scams do n't work any more , and no amount of “ reform ” will make the problem go away .
BREAKING THE LAWS
Yet none of this means the productive powers of human labour and intelligence in the 21st century can’t fulfil human needs , if only we were n't forced to obey an irrational economy 's “ laws ” .
It is only by resisting the day to day logic of capitalist “ laws ” that we will ever be in a strong enough position to put an end to the system itself .
Unlike money , houses are not evaporating , but people are being evicted – this is one obvious area for organised resistance .
Another is redundancies .
Workers are being laid off with only the bare minimum pay - off required by law , and often being cheated of even that .
We are not interested in “ saving jobs ” – let ’s face it , there are some jobs that no one in their right mind would want to save !
It ’s not our problem if the company is no longer profitable , it ’s just a question of the balance of forces , of how much disruption we can cause – solidarity strikes , occupations , blocking roads …
We do n’t care if it ’s the boss , the state , or Gordon Brown ’s sister - in - law who pays !
We want money to live on .
Even in small company that goes bankrupt it ’s worth resisting ( like the workers who recently occupied the packaging company in Dundee ) .
Even the crappiest little company has valuable assets – grab them before the boss does !
It ’s not all doom and gloom , even in these miserable debt - ridden islands .
In early February workers in the engineering construction industry in the UK ( Lindsey refinery and dozens of other sites ) put illegal solidarity strikes ( and tea - breaks ! ) firmly back on the agenda .
In Ireland there have been mass demonstrations against wage cuts in the public sector .
The new punishments planned for the unemployed will be hard to enforce when there are no jobs to force people into : the private Job Centre contractors are already panicking at the idea .
A dole system overwhelmed by sheer numbers will be ripe for collective troublemaking .
" YOU'VE GOT 1 HOUR TO LEAVE THE FACTORY , FAILURE TO TURN IN YOUR WORKWEAR WILL RESULT IN A DEDUCTION OF £ 25 "
And we ca n’t expect the unions to fight for us .
We all know what happened at Cowley when BMW laid off 850 temps without warning .
The union knew this would happen three weeks in advance but did n’t tell the workers !
Unions exist to negotiate the rate of exploitation .
They have an interest in managing the crisis , not in turning it to the workers ’ advantage .
GET RID OF CAPITALISM BEFORE IT GETS RID OF US
If capitalism is “ reformed ” and left to try and stand without its shattered financial crutch , what might the promised “ return to normality ” be like ?
Economic “ laws ” will demand that we make sacrifices : drastic wage cuts with longer working hours when any work is going ; perpetual job insecurity and mass unemployment while welfare benefits disappear ; shutdown of public health , housing , transport and education services .
Individual competition of all against all for every imagined “ opportunity ” , more violent crime and more violent policing , ethnic and religious sectarianism as substitute for social solidarity , and that old favourite social safety valve and economic powerhouse : war .
And what if we try to put crippled capital out of its misery ?
Nothing is certain , and there 's no chance things will be easy .
But nothing is going to be certain or easy anyway .
The economy as we 've known it is going down one way or another , on their terms or ours .
If we agree to “ make sacrifices ” and go meekly into under - funded redundancy , we 'll simply be letting the former owners and creditors loot everything of value from the wreckage .
Only if we act together now to seize what 's ours , refusing the “ owners ” what they think we owe them , is there a chance that the world resulting from the chaos will be worth living in .

Special correspondent Oscar Swartz reports .
STOCKHOLM – As the landmark trial of The Pirate Bay wrapped up its first week Friday , the prosecutor fought to tie the last two defendants to the daily operation of the world 's most notorious filesharing site .
Four defendants in all are accused of contributory copyright infringement for allegedly deliberately facilitating the making available of copyrighted works to the public .
Establishing intent is crucial for a crime to have been committed under Swedish law , and the prosecutor and civil plaintiffs have tried to show that the overriding purpose of The Pirate Bay is to encourage unlawful sharing of copyrighted material .
With the Pirate Bay trial half over , the defendants have reason to be hopeful .
First , the government stunned observers on Tuesday by dropping half the charges in the joint criminal - civil prosecution , resulting in a partial acquittal .
And despite aggressive questioning by the prosecutor and a battery of entertainment industry lawyers , defendants Gottfrid Svartholm Warg and Fredrik Neij stuck to the story that the sole purpose of The Pirate Bay is to let internet users transmit whatever material they want .
Warg and Neij were never public people , and that showed in their sometimes awkward testimony .
But Friday 's first witness , Peter Sunde , aka Brokep , is The Pirate Bay 's official spokesman , and he 's accustomed to the spotlight .
He wore a grey hoodie as he took the stand to defend the website , even as he sought to distance himself from its operations .
The first questions posed to Sunde by prosecutor Hakan Roswall focused on his ideology , prompting Pirate Bay supporters in the blogosphere to cry foul .
Referring to the open- culture activist organization that founded The Pirate Bay the prosecutor asked : " Is it correct that the Pirate Bureau discusses copyright and is critical of copyright as it is today ? "
" What is your personal opinion on copyright ? " the prosecutor followed up .
When recording industry lawyer Peter Danowsky asked the same question later , Sunde fired back .
" That is a political question , " Sunde said .
" Is this a political trial or a legal trial ? "
Danowsky 's answer : " In what way is copyright a political question ? "
Danowsky then produced printouts of news articles on The Pirate Bay , pointing out statements made by Sunde .
One exhibit came from a 2006 Wired.com article , from which Danowsky read the last paragraph aloud : " We 're also into educating people about the consequences of piracy .
We 're teaching them how to do it . "
Sunde said that he meant that The Pirate Bay educates people about filesharing in general .
He quoted the paragraph before to show that his statement was a response to MPAA , which claimed that it was " educating people about the consequences of piracy and getting involved . "
Likeable with a boyish face , Sunde can argue with die - hard enemies on TV and still carry a winning smile while his opponent resorts to cursing .
He testified Friday that he was " only " a media contact for the website , and that he never actively participated in the acts charged by the prosecutor –namely , " organizing , systematizing , programming , financing or running " Pirate Bay .
But Danowsky confronted Sunde with e-mail printouts taken in the 2006 police raid , which seemed to show that Sunde was more involved than he 's acknowledged .
Carl Lundström , a wealthy 48 - year old businessman , has a far more tenuous connection to the site , and he did not face any ideological questions on the stand .
The prosecutor tried to tie Lundström to The Pirate Bay as a " co-owner , " but Lundström claimed that he has only sold hosting and internet services to the site 's operators .
Fredrik Neij , one of the young defendants , was hired by Lundström 's CTO as a network technician in 2004 , while Neij was already running the then - tiny filesharing site .
Lundström admitted giving The Pirate Bay 's crew moral support and sympathy , but said he'd rejected becoming a business partner with them , finding the prospect too legally risky .
" I did n't want to get into potential illegal things when I had 50 employees , " he stated .
The court adjourned for the weekend , with testimony set to resume Tuesday afternoon .
Among the scheduled witnesses is John Kennedy , the chairman of the International Federation of Phonographic Industries - the international version of the RIAA .
The trial is expected to wrap up at the end of next week .
The three civilian law judges , and a fourth professional judge , will decide the defendants ' guilt or innocence by a majority vote .
In the event of a tie , the professional judge 's vote will prevail .
Friday night , Sunde will play DJ at a party arranged by the Pirate Bureau .
Stockholm 's digerati are expected to turn up to show support for The Pirate Bay .

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 24/2/2009 ( 4235 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
Opinion
When a nation cannot safeguard its citizens against freezing in the dark , nor control how much energy it exports , nor set the price at which citizens can buy back their own energy from foreign transnational corporations , it is not an energy superpower , it is an energy satellite .
" A colony or satellite is a people who lose control of their resources to a foreign power , " according to Gordon Laxer , political economist and director of the University of Alberta 's Parkland Institute .
" Canada is prohibited from using its oil to supply half its citizens during international shortages .
No other country is forbidden from using domestic resources to provide for its own citizens . "
As citizens of a democracy , Canadians naturally expect their own government to put them first in any and all emergencies .
" What are governments for if they 're not going to do that ? "
Laxer wonders .
" I think the Canadian government wants to focus on American energy security , not Canadian , because they see their interests not as protecting Canadians , ( but ) as being consonant with the corporate interest ... "
Oil shortage emergencies are coming .
The International Energy Agency 's 2008 report states the era of Peak Oil is imminent .
Once the current economic crisis is over , the world will begin experiencing a unending and worsening series of oil supply shocks .
Canada , alone among major industrialized countries , has stripped itself of its energy sovereignty and now faces a succession of severe crises .
Canada has no Strategic Petroleum Reserve ( SPR ) .
It exports 65 per cent of its oil and 59 per cent of its natural gas to the U.S.
In 2007 , it imported 50 per cent of its oil refinery needs , including a small amount of refined oil , from the U.S.
Most of those imports come from unstable Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) nations such as Iraq and Algeria .
Canada 's pipelines do not serve about 40 per cent of Canadians -- 92 per cent of Quebec 's oil is imported , as is 75 per cent of Atlantic Canada 's and 36 per cent of Ontario's .
The Sarnia - to - Montreal pipeline built by the Trudeau government to carry western oil east was reversed in 1999 and now carries imported oil west .
There are plans to reverse its flow again , shipping Alberta oil , not to eastern Canada , but most of it on to Portland , Me. , for tanker shipment to Gulf Coast refineries .
Canada has deliberately chosen not to put the essential interests of its own people above the interests of the U.S .
Prompted by former Alberta premier Peter Lougheed and the Calgary oil patch , prime minister Brian Mulroney signed the Canada - U.S. Free Trade Agreement ( now the North American Free Trade Agreement ) in 1989 .
Its proportionality clause gives the U.S. first access to Canada 's oil and gas .
Even if Canadians experience shortages , Canada cannot reduce the proportion it exports to the U.S. below a moving three - year average .
Canada can cut exports , but it must cut domestic usage proportionately .
Peak Oil makes the proportionality clause even more perverse .
As the twin threats of climate change and oil scarcity intensify , Canadians will be doubly punished .
Every unit of energy they save through conservation will go to the U.S. , locking us into an ever - upward spiral of export obligation .
If Canada were not enmeshed in NAFTA , it would be self - sufficient in oil , Laxer says .
And if it reduced its per-capita consumption of oil to that of Britain and France , it would not need a drop of tarsands oil .
If Canada were not caught up in NAFTA , it might still have a National Energy Board with teeth .
The Mulroney government gutted the board of its regulatory powers , the most important being to ensure energy security for Canadians , including the requirement there be a 25 - year surplus of gas before any exports could flow .
Today , Canada has just nine years of proven natural gas reserves and an ever - increasing amount is dedicated to extracting oil from the oilsands .
A year ago , Laxer interviewed Matt Simmons , a former fundraiser for president George W. Bush , now head of the largest oil investment bank in the world .
He asked Simmons what would happen in an oil crisis .
" He said governments often do n't take care of their own people well , but they sure as hell are n't going to take care of foreign citizens , " Laxer says .
When he inquired if Canada needed a SPR , Simmons ' reply was : " Do Canadians use oil ? "
In May 2007 , Conservative MPs stormed out of a Commons committee meeting on Canada - U.S. energy sharing .
Laxer had just posed these two questions in his testimony :
" Why is Canada discussing helping to ensure American energy security when Canada has no energy policy and neither plans nor enough pipelines to get oil to Eastern Canada during an international supply crisis ? "
" Instead of guaranteeing the U.S. energy security , how about a Canadian SPP , a Secure Petroleum Plan for Canada ? "
The chairman simply shut down the committee amid opposition charges of a cover-up .
To date , Laxer 's questions remain unanswered .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) -
Who said bras are only for women ?
A Japanese online lingerie retailer is selling bras for cross - dressing men and they ’ve quickly become one of its most popular items .
Since launching two weeks ago on Rakuten , a major Japanese web shopping mall , the Wishroom shop has sold over 300 men ’s bras for 2,800 yen ( $ 30 ) each .
The shop also stocks men ’s panties , as well as lingerie for women .
“ I like this tight feeling .
It feels good , ” Wishroom representative Masayuki Tsuchiya told Reuters as he modeled the bra , which can be worn discreetly under men ’s clothing .
Wishroom Executive Director Akiko Okunomiya said she was surprised at the number of men who were looking for their inner woman .
“ I think more and more men are becoming interested in bras .
Since we launched the men ’s bra , we ’ve been getting feedback from customers saying ‘ wow , we ’d been waiting for this for such a long time ’ , ” she said .
But the bra , available in black , pink and white , is not an easy sell for all men .
The underwear has stirred a heated debate online with more than 8,000 people debating the merits of men wearing bras in one night on Mixi , Japan ’s top social network website .

How can you get CCTV cameras to not only record , but to recognise patterns of behaviour - and potentially prevent serious crimes ?
Dima Damen is one of hundreds of PhD students around the world working hard on a challenging problem : how do you make CCTV smart ?
Later this year , she 'll finish her studies at the University of Leeds having created prototype computer vision applications to detect bicycle theft and carried objects .
Her research work is a small step towards building the smart CCTV systems of the future .
Nobody would like to spend their time staring at a CCTV image of a bicycle rack and trying to spot a thief .
Prompted by her PhD supervisor , Professor David Hogg , Damen realised that a computer vision application could help detect suspicious activity .
" I thought that whatever vision could do would certainly be better than the current situation , " she says .
The need was clear - half a million bicycles are stolen each year - but how could it be done ?
" In computer vision , there are techniques to track people when they 're walking in front of the camera , " says Damen .
She then realised that if a smart CCTV system tracked people dropping off and picking up their bicycles , perhaps any differences could be noted .
In computer vision terms , this meant comparing moving blocks of pixels from different times .
The initial tests - where 11 out of 13 simulated thefts were successfully detected - involved using clothes ' colouring to compare individuals and raising a theft warning when they looked different .
People - watching
" The hard bit , actually , is to link the drop at the beginning of the day to the pickup at the end of the day , " says Damen .
Another part of her PhD work at Leeds is to detect carried objects based on shape and colour .
" The application that we developed is capable of highlighting all the objects that have been carried , " says Damen .
" Now , we are at the stage of doing the final step , which is people going into buildings with objects and leaving without them . "
Dr James Orwell works in the Digital Imaging Research Centre at Kingston University London , and appreciates the wider issues .
" If you wanted to try and cover everywhere , you 'd need a whole army of people watching CCTV , " says Orwell .
" That 's essentially the driver for this technology - it 's automation , it 's doing things more efficiently . "
Like other researchers in the field , Orwell is driven by the intellectual excitement of solving computer vision problems , which , invariably , rely on complex mathematics .
The biggest challenge today ?
Researchers in Australia are aiming to provide robust recognition of faces from low - resolution CCTV footage .
Tracking people effectively in cluttered conditions - such as a busy street - is another goal and a Kingston PhD student , Alberto Colombo , is working on just such a project .
To do this with smart CCTV , Orwell says you look for " invariants " in the image data such as shape , size , or clothing colour .
" You can track people and you can even track people between cameras . "
It 's not just people in the frame for smart CCTV .
Norbert Buch , another PhD student at Kingston , is working on motion silhouettes to distinguish between vehicle types for urban traffic analysis .
His project is funded by Transport for London .
So what would we like smart CCTV to do in future ?
Orwell talks about the " gold standard " of a human operator who , intuitively , can spot anomalies .
For example , a person wearing a bright pink ski jacket on a railway station platform may stand out - but more significant is somebody who does n't get on to three successive trains .
Smart CCTV finds meaning in what you see and that , in computer vision terms , requires high - quality data from more cameras , better definition , and a faster frame rate .
Your digital camera with built - in face detection illustrates simple video analytics - the technology that analyses video for objects , people , or behaviour .
Computer vision academics are already trying their new algorithms on hundreds of gigabytes of Home Office CCTV test data .
This research involves looking at abandoned baggage , parked vehicles , doorway surveillance , sterile zone object tracking , and multiple camera tracking .
" There are hundreds of PhD students in the world chipping away at these problems .
Everybody agrees on the basics , " says Orwell .
Today , face recognition is achievable in controlled environments with face detection possible in uncontrolled environments .
" I think in five years ' time you 'll see usable results in face recognition in uncontrolled environments , " Orwell adds .
Another notable project is being carried out by Professor James Davis and PhD student Karthik Sankaranarayanan at Ohio State University .
They are developing a computerised surveillance system that attempts to recognise whether a person is acting suspiciously .
By analysing and modelling behaviour patterns , the system learns what 's normal and what 's not .
" If you 're doing something strange , we want to be able to detect that , and figure out what 's going on , " says Davis .
The system may spot people who stop in an unusual place , wander suspiciously around car parks , or leave a bag behind .
Big Brother Britain
Should we worry about smart CCTV 's growing abilities ?
It concerns Liberty , AKA the National Council for Civil Liberties , which points out that Britain is currently the most - watched nation in the world .
" Technology in this area has come a long way from when CCTV videotapes first came on the scene .
Unfortunately legislation has not kept up , " says Isabella Sankey , Liberty 's director of policy .
" Sophisticated systems that can identify and track individuals need proper regulation so that appropriate safeguards can be built in . "
Being intelligent about using smart CCTV will be important too .
Former Beirut hostage Terry Waite has spoken out against attempts to extradite self - confessed Pentagon hacker Gary McKinnon to face a US trial .
Waite , who since his release in 1991 has become a human rights and police campaigner , argues that the US military should thank McKinnon for exposing security holes in its systems .
McKinnon 's recent diagnosis of Aspberger 's syndrome ought to prompt a decision by US authorities to drop the prosecution against McKinnon .
McKinnon claims he was only looking for suppressed information about anti-gravity propulsion systems and other UFO technology he reckons is being held from the public when he broke into US military systems .
He admits hacking but denies doing any damage , against US claims that he was the " biggest military hacker of all time " .
Waite said McKinnon 's behaviour was " hardly that of a serious spy " and described his motives as " pretty harmless " adding " The Pentagon ought to thank him for exposing the vulnerability of their systems , " the Press Association reports .
The former Church of England envoy urged common sense in the handling of the case , while emphasising that he supports law enforcement efforts to " track down and stop illegal activity " on the web , the BBC adds .
A judicial review on whether the Home Secretary was right to allow extradition proceedings against Gary McKinnon to proceed despite his health problems has been scheduled for 9 and 10 June .
The hearing has become McKinnon 's best hope of avoiding a US trial after failed appeals that went all the way to the House of Lords last year , and a more recent decision by UK prosecutors not to put McKinnon on trial on this side of the Atlantic .
McKinnon 's long - running campaign against extradition has gained celebrity support over recent months .
Alongside Waite other eminent sorts who have come out in support of McKinnon include the UK Government 's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation , Lord Carlile of Berriew , former Police frontman Sting and London Mayor Boris Johnson . ®
The sexsomniac builder who forces himself on his wife in his sleep
During his waking hours Tim Draper , 33 , is a loving and devoted husband to his wife Amanda , 34 .
But as soon as he falls asleep he turns into an aggressive sex- crazed ' monster ' who gropes his partner before holding her down and ripping off her nightdress .
Builder Tim - who wakes up every morning with no memory of what he has done - suffers from a rare sleep disorder called sexsomnia .
Devoted wife Amanda Draper with her husband and sexsomniac Tim Draper
The Drapers , who live in Ontario , Canada , have been together 14 years and married for four .
A night - vision camera was placed in the Draper 's bedroom to record Tim 's actions for a TV documentary .
It shows
Tim forcefully fondling his wife while she continually pushes his hand away .
Experts believe sufferers are driven by subconscious primeval instincts to mate .
Amanda - who frequently has to leave the marital bed in the middle of the night - explained : ' It happens about every other night and is really bad once a week .
' He has ripped my nightgown to the point where buttons have come right off and he has torn big holes in my under - clothing .
' He uses force to keep me down .
It 's scary .
He does n't hit me but I do get marks on my arms from him holding me down .
Devoted wife Amanda Draper with her husband and sexsomniac Tim Draper , who wakes up every morning with no memory of what he has done
' At first it was terrifying but I know it is not really Tim doing it .
I 'm almost used to it by now but I always wonder whether I 'm going to get a good night 's sleep .
' All the experts we have seen just shake their heads because they do n't understand what is causing it . '
On being shown footage for the first time what he does in his sleep a shocked Tim said : ' It 's painful .
To me , that 's just a monster .
It 's very extreme .
Tim Draper has a rare sleep disorder that means he tries to force his wife to have sex while he is asleep
' I feel bad that it happens .
I have no idea what goes on .
My body is doing what it wants without me having any control over it .
' It 's like Jekyll and Hyde .
I wake up without any notion of what I 've done .
I feel guilty about it but I also have no control over it .
I really wish I did .'
Tim talks to a documentary crew about his experiences
Tim believes he has suffered from sexsomnia since his teens but was only diagnosed with the condition this year .
He cannot remember anything that happens during his sleep and only knows he has misbehaved if he wakes up to find Amanda asleep on the sofa in the lounge .
After watching the footage the following day , Amanda - who never lets
Tim have sex with her in his sleep - says : ' I know it 's not his fault and it's not him because I would not have married the person he is when he 's sleeping . '
Doctors have prescribed Tim with a sedative called clonazepam , which is used to treat anxiety and insomnia and keeps him in a deeper state of sleep .
However , the drug has only made a slight improvement to curbing his nocturnal sexual activities .

AT ITS deepest level , nature is random and unpredictable .
That , most physicists would say , is the unavoidable lesson of quantum theory .
Try to track the location of an electron and you ’ll find only a probability that it is here or there .
Measure the spin of an atom and all you get is a 50:50 chance that it is up or down .
Watch a photon hit a glass plate and it will either pass through or be reflected , but it ’s impossible to know which without measuring it .
Where does this randomness come from ?
Before quantum theory , physicists could believe in determinism , the idea of a world unfolding with precise mathematical certainty .
Since then , however , the weird probabilistic behaviour of the quantum world has rudely intruded , and the mainstream view is that this uncertainty is a fundamental feature of everything from alpha particles to Z bosons .
Indeed , most quantum researchers celebrate the notion that pure chance lies at the foundations of the universe .
However , a sizeable minority of physicists have long been pushing entirely the opposite view .
They remain unconvinced that quantum theory depends on pure chance , and they shun the philosophical contortions of quantum weirdness .
The world is not inherently random , they say , it only appears that way .
Their response has been to develop quantum models that are deterministic , and that describe a world that has “ objective ” properties , whether or not we measure them .
The problem is that such models have had flaws that many physicists consider fatal , such as inconsistencies with established theories .
Until now , that is .
A series of recent papers show that the idea of a deterministic and …

Jack Cafferty says Republicans are missing a golden opportunity to redeem themselves .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The Republican Party is becoming a cartoon .
Where to start ?
Bobby Jindal : " I 'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as Obama . "
Good OF a speaker ?
How about not as good at eighth - grade grammar either .
It 's embarrassing .
Sarah Palin ?
Billing the taxpayers for her kids to travel to official events the children were n't even invited to ?
She finally agreed to pay back the state for that money she took .
Her per diem charges to the state in the amount of $ 17,000 while she was living at home instead of in the governor 's mansion ?
She has now agreed to pay the taxes owed on that money .
Another tawdry grab at a few dollars that did n't belong to her .
Michael Steele , the newly elected chairman of the Republican National Committee , down on his knees apologizing to the helium - filled poster boy of the conservative right ?
Pathetic .
If the Republicans are ever to emerge from the long dark night they have created for themselves it will have to be without pandering to the right wing nuts that comprise Rush Limbaugh 's radio audience .
Did n't they learn anything in the last election ?
All of which is to say the GOP is blowing it big time .
They were handed a golden opportunity to redeem themselves with the election of Barack Obama -- a chance to line up and in unison condemn the evil their party put in the White House the previous eight years .
The country had had a bellyful of George Bush , Dick Cheney , and the rest of the messengers of darkness in Washington who had sold out the principles of the Republican Party in favor of huge deficits , a doubling of the national debt , and a growing intrusion of the federal government into people 's private lives .
But instead of getting on board the change train and recognizing the incredible amount of damage their people had done to the country , Republicans go blithely along as though nothing has happened .
They 're busy obstructing Obama 's programs and criticizing the Democrats ' spending plans that are aimed at trying to bring the country out of a horrible recession .
I hate to break it to them , but a lot has happened .
And they 're not going to like any of it .
The latest NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll shows the Republican Party 's favorability rating at an all - time low .
President Obama 's is at an all - time high .
The same poll shows that Republicans are getting most of the blame for the partisanship that hinders governmental progress .
And perhaps most telling , when asked which party is best equipped to lead the country out of recession , the Republicans trail the Democrats by a stunning 30 points .
And while all this is going on , the GOP ran a straw poll on who the party 's nominee should be for president in 2012 .
Ready ?
Mitt Romney finished first followed by Bobby Jindal , Ron Paul and Sarah Palin .
The Republican Party is marching double - time down the road to irrelevance and they do n't even know it .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jack Cafferty .

Merge History , DAGs and Darcs
One of the popular complaints about CVS and Subversion ( before 1.5 ) was the lack of merge history .
In a nutshell , merge history is remembering what has been merged and taking that information into account on future merges .
In a bucket ?
In something bigger than a nutshell , merge history is a lot more complicated .
Unless you completely eschew branching , you are going to frequently find yourself wanting to take some changes you made in one place and re-apply them somewhere else .
When you do this , you want your version control to make it painless .
Without merge history , it is very difficult to make change migration painless , since the tool will try to do things that have already been done .
A common example is the case of two branches that occasionally want to merge changes from one side to the other .
Here I have two branches of development .
On two occasions , somebody merged changes from branch ( b ) over to branch ( a ) .
( Arrows go from a changeset to its parents . )
Without merge history , this can be a real pain .
When branch ( a ) tries to grab changes from changeset 5b , CVS does n't remember that 3 b and 2b have already been applied .
So it attempts to apply them a second time , resulting in conflicts , pain and frustration and a general fear of branching .
One of the coolest things about DAG - based version control tools is that the DAG is an expression of merge history .
We interpret arrows in the DAG to mean " ' I 've got this " .
So , when it comes time to do merge from 5b over to the ( a ) branch , we can use information in the DAG to know that 3 b and 2b are already done .
I 'm not saying the algorithm to use this information properly is trivial , but there are multiple implementations , and they work pretty well in practice .
For example , Git has a repuation for excellent and painless branching and merging , and the DAG is the main reason why .
Cherrypicking
But a DAG is just one implementation of merge history , and it is definitely not perfect .
An arrow in a verson control DAG goes from child to parent .
It tells us that the child contains all of the changes in the parent .
And its grandparents .
And its great grandparents .
And so on .
But what if this is n't true ?
Consider the following picture :
I want to create changeset 4 .
I want to start at changeset 1 , and then I want to apply the changes from changeset 3 , but NOT the stuff in changeset 2 .
This operation is sometimes called " cherrypicking " .
I do n't want to merge all changes from one branch to another .
I just want to pluck one changeset ( or one part of a changeset ) and apply it as a patch to some other place .
How do I represent this in the DAG ?
I can't .
I could draw an arrow from 4 to 3 ( shown above in red ) .
This would correctly say that 4 contains the changes in 3 , but it would INCORRECTLY claim that 4 contains the changes in 2 .
OR , I could draw no arrow .
Effectively , my merge history would simply not record the fact that 4 is really 3 converted to a patch and applied to 1 .
In either case , something bad is going to happen next time I merge from one branch to the other :
If I draw that lying arrow , I will not be given the chance to apply changeset 2 , because the merge history believes I already did it .
If I do n't draw any arrow , the tool will expect me to deal with changeset 3 , because there is no merge history recording the fact that I already did it .
Neither of these problems is disastrous enough to make the evening news , but still .
DAG - Like Things
It 's tempting to think that the problem lies in the way I defined my DAG lines .
Perhaps a line should mean " just you , not your parents ? "
But then I would I need to have a line from every changeset to every one of its ancestors .
This would be completely infeasible .
Or perhaps we need two kinds of DAG lines ?
Regular lines are the normal case .
They imply recursive inclusion .
We 'll draw them in black .
Red lines are for cherrypicking .
When a red line points to a changeset , it says , " I 've got this , but not its ancestors . "
Red lines imply shallow inclusion .
But now our DAG is not really a DAG anymore .
If we 're going to use a DAG , we 'd like to be able to use the decades of computer science research about how to deal with them .
AFAIK , all the well understood algorithms about DAGs assume there is only one kind of line .
For example , is changeset 3 a leaf ?
Well , maybe .
If you ignore the red lines , then 3 is a leaf .
But if red lines count , then 3 is an interior node .
Many CS algorithms become less useful when questions start getting answered with " maybe " .
Darcs
So , even though the DAG is a pretty good representation of merge history , it is n't perfect .
Darcs is an attempt to build a better solution to the problem .
Several weeks ago I divided version control tools into two groups :
Those where the history is a Line .
Those where the history is a Directed Acyclic Graph ( a DAG ) .
But darcs does n't really fit in either of these categories .
Its model of history is certainly not a Line .
But it 's not really a DAG either , at least not in the same way as Git and Mercurial .
A darcs changeset records the full merge history at the patch level .
Darcs has a nice well - defined algebra of patches which allows it to accomplish some very clever things .
But while I consider the concepts behind Darcs to be fascinating , I also consider them to be raw and unproven in practice .
I can't see how the algorithm would scale to big problems .
And people who know darcs are always talking about the possibility of the merge algorithm going exponential .
Darcs seems to have a more complete representation for merge history .
But that does n't mean there is any practical algorithm for making use of that information .
For now , I must consider darcs to be in the category of research , not development .
Final Thoughts
Merge history is a very hard problem .
Some of the imperfect solutions have found their way into common usage and proven themselves to be quite practical .
But there is a lot more that could be done .
Need a thesis topic for your PhD in computer science ?
Go find a better solution to the merge history problem .

If you left this week 's Apple event a little underwhelmed , it 's because most of 3.0's new features have been available via Cydia and the App Store .
Here 's how to enable iPhone 3.0 's biggest additions today .
Advertisement
Since many of iPhone 3.0's features were deliberately blocked by restrictions in the official SDK , for several of these apps , you 'll have to jailbreak .
But do n't you just love that we already have the definitive tutorial on jailbreaking your phone to hold your hand through the process ?
That said , a lot of these features are available via free and paid apps in the App Store too .
Advertisement
So start with jailbreaking , then get yourself downloading these apps to get that fresh 3.0 experience before the software even drops .
Cut and Paste : Clippy ( Cydia , Free while in Beta )
Apple 's ridiculously delayed cut and paste solution looks slick .
Slicker than Clippy , the best unofficial C+P solution , which still gets the job done though .
One limitation is that you can only reliably copy and paste where you have access to the keyboard ( so grabbing web snippets other than URLs is tough ) , but if you 're staying in the main text - input apps , it works .
Copying text from web pages is technically possible now , but it 's extremely buggy and crashes Safari .

GPS Turn - by - Turn : xGPS ( Cydia , Free )
i Phone 3.0 is totally fine with turn - by - turn GPS apps , as long as you bring your own maps to the table ( Google 's can't be used due to licensing issues ) .
xGPS does use Google 's Maps , and does turn - by - turn brilliantly with active GPS tracking .
Advertisement
Tethering : iPhoneModem / PDANet ( Cydia , Free )
We 've got you covered with another detailed tutorial on tethering your iPhone to your Mac ( with iPhoneModem ) or Windows machine ( with PDANet ) .
Keep in mind , the iPhone has always supported tethering —
iPhone 3.0 simply brings an official software tool to do it , but it 's still up to the network carriers to enable the feature ( and set the pricing ) .
Tethering via these jailbreak solutions works in the meantime , but be careful with how much data you use to not raise any eyebrows at the Death Star .

Email Multiple Photos : Emailpix ( App Store , $ 3 )
There have been several official apps touting multi-photo emailing , but for the most part they 've been sloppily implemented .
Emailpix does it fairly smoothly , though , and gives you a choice of resolution to send to save time .
Granted , it takes a while , and emails are sent from Emailpix 's server , so you may not want to use it for your nude self portraits .

Bluetooth File Transfer : iBluetooth ( Cydia , Free 15 - day trial )
i Bluetooth lets you pair with your computer to send and receive files .
It 's kind of buggy , but does work ( try setting up a PIN code if you can't get your phone to pair initially ) .
Advertisement
Universal Search : Search ( Cydia , Free )
It does n't search your applications or your iTunes music like the 3.0 version , but Search is great for the most valuable searching situation : email .
It also searches contacts , notes , SMS and the web .
If you have a ton of apps , consider pairing Search with QuickGold , a Quicksilver - like app launcher that can also search your contacts , SMSs and Safari history in addition to apps .
Advertisement
Accelerometer Controls : mCoolPhone ( Cydia , Free Trial / $3 )
The " shake to shuffle " feature in OS 3.0 is kind of lame , and while mCoolPhones can't touch your iTunes functionality , it lets you assign shake events to various other phone functions , like answering calls .
Advertisement
Notes Sync : iPhoneNotes ( Mac- only desktop App , Jailbreak required .
Free )
To pull off native notes sync , make sure you have OpenSSH installed on your jailbroken phone and grab iPhoneNotes , which will import all of your notes and also sync back any text file you have on your computer .
Advertisement
Background Apps / Push Notifications : Backgrounder ( Cydia , Free )
i Phone 3.0 will attempt to solve the multitasking problem by providing a long - awaited framework for push notifications , which will allow apps to get your attention when they 're not running .
But it stops short of true background multitasking , which most Cydia apps are capable of ( especially services like SSH ) .
You can use Backgrounder to force official App Store apps to keep running even when you switch away to another app .
It 's great for keeping IM apps open and signed in while you do other things .

Landscape Keyboard : iRealSMS ( Cydia , € 10 ) and EasyWriter ( App Store , Free )
Ah , the beloved landscape keyboard .
In iPhone 3.0 it 's coming system - wide ( finally ) , but you 've been able to get one in the most important typing apps ( email and SMS ) for a while .
For email , try the free EasyWriter App Store app , and for SMS , there 's iRealSMS , which also adds a number of other features for hardcore texters like quick - replying and advanced sorting .
Advertisement
MMS : SwirlyMMS ( Cydia , $ 8 ) and Get MMS ( App Store , $ 4 )
MMS is a major hole , and its implementation via unofficial apps thus far has been shoddy .
The best is SwirlyMMS , but even that does n't work very well with AT&T's MMS provider , which most people will obviously be using .
But if you 're not on the Death Star , give Swirly a try .
Advertisement
Get MMS , on the other hand , makes receiving MMS messages via AT&T 's annoying web interface a little easier .
It takes a screengrab of the login and password AT&T sends , and lets you save the attached video or photo .
Advertisement
Voice Memos : Epiphany ( App Store , $ 2 )
There are a million and a half voice recorders in the App Store , but we love Epiphany , which buffers its recordings and only goes back in time to grab the important parts when you tell it to .
It ca n't send the clip via MMS like iPhone 3.0 will be able to , but it will easily sync with your computer via wi-fi .
Adding Features Still Missing From iPhone 3.0 :

Video Capture : Cycorder ( Cydia , Free )
The biggest thing Apple still has yet to add into iPhone 3.0 is video recording .
Thankfully , Cycorder is incredibly capable .

Flash : iMobileCinema ( Cydia , Free )
iMobileCinema is a deep , deep beta plugin for Safari that supposedly enables Flash videos for a few sites .
Its major compatibility claim though , with Google Video and YouTube , is moot because Apple 's YouTube app catches these URLs and plays them fine .
A good project to keep an eye on though .
So as you can see , the majority of iPhone 3.0's feature additions are already needs that have been addressed by third - party devs .
Of course , most of these apps will not be as elegant as Apple 's native solution , but it shows that iPhone 3.0 is largely about catching up .

The jailbreak world is big .
If you know of any apps not covered here that address any of these features , please let everyone know in the comments .

It 's long been known that if you want someone to do something ( especially if that " something " is contrary to what they 're likely to do in the first place ) , give them an " expert " advice .
But why is that ?
Emory University Neuroscientist Greg Berns and colleagues have found the answer : a brain - scanning study of people making financial choices found that when given the so - called expert advice , the decision - making parts of their brains often shut down .
In the study , Berns ' team hooked 24 college students to brain scanners as they contemplated swapping a guaranteed payment for a chance at a higher lottery payout .
Sometimes the students made the decision on their own .
At other times they received written advice from Charles Noussair , an Emory University economist who advises the U.S. Federal Reserve .
Though the recommendations were delivered under his imprimatur , Noussair himself would n't necessarily follow it .
The advice was extremely conservative , often urging students to accept tiny guaranteed payouts rather than playing a lottery with great odds and a high payout .
But students tended to follow his advice regardless of the situation , especially when it was bad .
When thinking for themselves , students showed activity in their anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex — brain regions associated with making decisions and calculating probabilities .
When given advice from Noussair , activity in those regions flat lined .

I have to admit to only having a sketchy knowledge of those games except for Zuma which was a really fun little puzzle game I last played on an old Nokia a few years back .
Anyway , they are presumably all fun little casual games which will pas a few minutes while you ’re waiting for a taxi to the pub and they will presumably be well priced so might just be perfect for these economically depressing times .

More than 26,000 packages of wieners have been ordered pulled from store shelves across Eastern Canada after they were mistakenly shipped despite some of the hot dogs testing positive for Listeria , Maple Leaf said today .
While the company said the risk to the public is extremely low , it added it was “ clearly not acceptable ” that the 450 - gram packages of Shopsy ’s Deli Fresh All Beef Frankfurters and Maple Leaf Hot Dogs made it to market .
“ In this particular case we had human error , ” said Michael McCain , president and CEO of Maple Leaf Foods ( TSX : MFI ) .
“ Product was released out of quarantine .
It should n’t have been .
“ We ’ve taken corrective action against both the individuals responsible and the situation . ”
The recall is another public relations blow to Maple Leaf , which has been dealing with the aftermath of one of the largest food - borne illnesses in Canadian history .
The company has agreed to pay up to $ 125,000 to individuals with serious and long - lasting physical injuries resulting from a listeriosis outbreak linked to one of its Toronto plants last summer .
The outbreak killed at least 20 people and triggered the largest meat recall in Canadian history .
Concerns about the hot dogs were raised when some of the products produced at a Hamilton plant tested positive for one type of Listeria .
The company tests for all six types of Listeria even though only one — Listeria monocytogenes — is dangerous to human health .
It was not clear what type of Listeria was responsible for the latest recall .
Instead of being held in quarantine for further testing , the product was accidentally released , said spokeswoman Linda Smith .
“ Clearly this is unacceptable to us , given that we have extraordinarily stringent protocols and a culture of food safety , ” she said .
No illnesses have been reported by anyone who consumed the hot dogs and the company said it ’s confident that the risk to human health is low .
Since Listeria is so pervasive , positive test results are a good sign that Maple Leaf ’s safety scanning is working , McCain said in an interview .
“ It ’s a bit of a leap of faith but I ’m very hopeful that people will see this is actually a good news story , that these protocols and our commitment to those protocols result in action that years ago would never even have been detected , let alone acted upon . ”
The recalled hot dogs may have been in the marketplace for about a week and it ’s expected all the remaining products will be back in the company ’s control by Wednesday , Smith said .
Shopsy ’s Deli Fresh All Beef Frankfurters carrying the product code 20730 and UPC 6487520730 , with a best before date of April 22 and 23 , are affected by the recall .
The recalled Maple Leaf Hot Dogs Original products have product code 22356 with UPC 6310022356 and a best before date of April 23 .
Consumers who purchased the products should call 1-800 - 568-5801 for more information about a refund or replacement .

Dalai Lama extolls ' freedom ' of chastity Agence France - Presse
Published : Friday November 28 , 2008
Print This Email This The Dalai Lama , the exiled Tibetan spiritual and temporal leader , on Friday said sex spelt fleeting satisfaction and trouble later , while chastity offered a better life and " more freedom . "
" Sexual pressure , sexual desire , actually I think is short period satisfaction and often , that leads to more complication , " the Dalai Lama told reporters in a Lagos hotel , speaking in English without a translator .
He said conjugal life caused " too much ups and downs .
" Naturally as a human being ... some kind of desire for sex comes , but then you use human intelligence to make comprehension that those couples always full of trouble .
And in some cases there is suicide , murder cases , " the Dalai Lama said .
He said the " consolation " in celibacy is that although " we miss something , but at the same time , compare whole life , it 's better , more independence , more freedom . "
Considered a Buddhist Master exempt from the religion 's wheel of death and reincarnation , the Dalai Lama waxed eloquent on the Buddhist credo of non-attachment .
" Too much attachment towards your children , towards your partner , " was " one of the obstacle or hindrance of peace of mind , " he said .
Revered by his followers as a god-king , the Dalai Lama arrived in Lagos on Friday on a three - day visit following an invitation from a foundation to attend a conference .
He has made no political speeches in the west African country .
He leaves Friday night for the Czech Republic and then on to Brussels to address the European Parliament before heading to Poland , where he is due to meet with French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
The 73 - year - old Nobel Peace laureate has been a mainstay on the diplomatic stage ever since he fled his native land for neighbouring India in 1959 .
Still based in northern India , the Dalai Lama has increasingly been in the spotlight since protests in Tibet turned violent in March this year , just months before the Chinese capital Beijing hosted the Summer Olympic Games .
Regarded by his many supporters outside China as a visionary in the vein of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King , the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his accent on non-violence to achieve change .
However , he is reviled by the Chinese government , which has branded him a " monster " and accused him of trying to split the nation .
After absorbing the information in Organizing Test Suites with Test : : Class and Reusing Test Code with Test : : Class , you 're probably beginning to understand how Test : : Class can make managing large codebases easier .
If you 've worked with test cases before , you 've likely realized that test code is still code .
Well - organized test code is easier to work with than poorly organized test code .
Auto - discovering your test classes
There 's too much repetitive boilerplate in these tests .
We can make them easier .
The first problem is the helper script , t/run.t :
#!/usr/bin/env perl - T use lib ' t / tests ' ; use Test :: Person ; use Test :: Person :: Employee ; Test :: Class ->runtests ;
Right now , this does n't look so bad , but as you start to add more classes , this gets to be unwieldy .
What if you forget to add a test class ?
Your class might be broken , but if the test class does not run , how will you know ?
Autodiscovering test classes helps :
#!/usr/bin/env perl - T use Test :: Class :: Load qw<t/tests > ;
Test :: Class ->runtests ;
Tell Test :: Class :: Load ( bundled with Test :: Class ) which directories your test classes are in and it will find them for you .
It does this by loading attempting to load all files with a .pm extension , so keep any helper test modules ( which are not Test : : Class tests ) in a separate directory .
Using a common base class
Another useful technique of programming in general is to factor out common code .
I 've demonstrated this already , but there 's room for improvement .
Both test classes have a method for returning the name of the class being tested .
It 's possible to compute the name of this class , so why not push this into a base class ?
Add this to t/tests / My / Test / Class.pm :
package My :: Test :: Class ; use Test :: Most ; use base qw < Test :: Class Class :: Data:: Inheritable > ; BEGIN { __PACKAGE__->mk_classdata(' class ' ) ; } sub startup : Tests ( startup => 1 ) { my $ test = shift ; ( my $ class = ref $ test ) =~ s/^Test ::// ; return ok 1 , " $ class loaded " if $ class eq __PACKAGE__ ; use_ok $ class or die ; $ test -> class ( $ class ) ; } 1 ;
In Person : : Employee , delete the class method .
In Person , delete the class and startup methods , and inherit from My :: Test : : Class instead of Test : : Class .
Now , class will always return the current class under testing .
The new Test :: Person class looks like :
package Test :: Person ; use Test :: Most ; use base ' My :: Test : : Class ' ; sub constructor : Tests ( 3 ) { my $ test = shift ; my $ class = $ test - > class ; can_ok $ class , ' new ' ; ok my $ person = $ class -> new , '... and the constructor should succeed ' ; isa_ok $ person , $ class , '... and the object it returns ' ; } sub first_name : Tests ( 3 ) { my $ test = shift ; my $ person = $ test -> class - > new ; can_ok $ person , ' first_name ' ; ok ! defined $ person -> first_name , '... and first_name should start out undefined ' ; $ person -> first_name ( ' John ' ) ; is $ person -> first_name , ' John ' , '... and setting its value should succeed ' ; } sub last_name : Tests ( 3 ) { my $ test = shift ; my $ person = $ test -> class - > new ; can_ok $ person , ' last_name ' ; ok ! defined $ person -> last_name , '... and last_name should start out undefined ' ; $ person -> last_name ( ' Public ' ) ; is $ person -> last_name , ' Public ' , '... and setting its value should succeed ' ; } sub full_name : Tests ( 4 ) { my $ test = shift ; $ test->_full_name_validation ; my $ person = $ test -> class -> new ( first_name => ' John ' , last_name => ' Public ' , ) ; is $ person -> full_name , ' John Public ' , '... and setting its value should succeed ' ; } sub _full_name_validation { my ( $ test , $ person ) = @_ ; my $ person = $ test -> class - > new ; can_ok $ person , ' full_name ' ; throws_ok { $ person -> full_name } qr/^Both first and last names must be set / , '... and full_name ( ) should croak ( ) if the either name is not set ' ; $ person -> first_name ( ' John ' ) ; throws_ok { $ person -> full_name } qr/^Both first and last names must be set / , '... and full_name ( ) should croak ( ) if the either name is not set ' ; } 1 ;
The test results for Test :: Person :: Employee are :
All tests successful .
Files=1 , Tests=32 , 1 wallclock secs ( 0.33 cusr + 0.08 csys = 0.41 CPU )
There 's an extra test , due to the ok 1 found in the My :: Test : : Class : : startup method .
It gets called an extra time for the loading of My :: Test : : Class .
Tip :
If you must load your at BEGIN time , override this startup method in your test class -- but be sure to provide a class method .
Run individual test classes
When I develop tests , I hate to leave my editor merely to run tests from the command line .
To avoid this , I a mapping in my .vimrc file similar to :
noremap , t :! prove -- merge - lv %< CR >
When writing tests , I hit ,t and my test runs .
However , doing this in a test class does n't work .
The class gets loaded , but the tests do not run .
I could add a new mapping :
noremap , T :! prove - lv -- merge t/run.t<CR >
... but this runs all of my test classes .
If I have several hundred tests , I do n't want to hunt back through all of the test output to see which tests failed .
Instead , I want to run a single test class .
I altered my mapping to include the path to my test classes .
noremap , t :! prove - lv -- merge - It/tests %< CR >
I also removed the Test :: Class -> runtests line from t/ run.t ( or else I 'll have my tests run twice if I run the full test suite ) .
Because I use a common base class , I added a line to My :: Test : : Class :
INIT { Test :: Class -> runtests }
Regardless of whether I 'm in a standard Test :: Most test program or one of my new test classes , I can type ,t and run only the tests in the file I 'm editing .
If you run the tests for Test : : Person : : Employee , you 'll see the full run of 32 tests because Test : : Class will run the tests for the current class and all classes from which it inherits .
If you run the tests for Test : : Person , you 'll only see 15 tests run -- the desired behavior .
If you prefer Emacs , add this to your ~/.emacs file :
( eval - after - load " cperl - mode " '( add - hook ' cperl - mode - hook ( lambda ( ) ( local - set - key " \C- ct " ' cperl- prove ) ) ) ) ( defun cperl - prove ( ) " Run the current test . " ( interactive ) ( shell - command ( concat " prove - lv -- merge - It/ tests " ( shell - quote_argument ( buffer - file - name ) ) ) ) )
That will bind this to C-c t and you can pretend that you 're as cool as Vim users ( just kidding !
Stop the hate mail already ) .

In my previous post entitled , CodeIgniter : PHP Development Fun – Part 1 , I talked a little about my excitement regarding CodeIgniter .
So far , I have found the learning curve to not be too steep and continue on my trek to develop my own website with the framework .
Today , I wanted to talk about what I have been working on with CodeIgniter .
I decided I wanted to make my own versions of Popurls , or AllTop .
This is something I could have done in an hour or two with WordPress and some plugins as well as a bit of Simple Pie usage , but on CodeIgniter , it has taken a little longer , but the excitement I experience as each piece works is much greater than if I had done the hack job of using WordPress for something it was n’t intended for .
The first step for me was coming up with my database and then adding some information to it , and using the scaffolding feature in CodeIgniter , I was able to do this quite easily .
Unfortunately , this was n’t perfect as I was using two tables , and taking information from one table , to be used to reference the other was a pain in the butt .
I decided to create my own administration panel to control the input of data into my site .
There were only three pieces of data that I wanted to have to input : the site name , the URL and selecting which category I wanted it to be in .
At first , I coded the category selection system in a convoluted way before realizing how silly it was .
Much of the mistakes I have made in programming thus far have been planning and logic mistakes that could have been avoided if I had taken the time to really sit down and think through my plans .
My Administration Panel
Creating my administration panel was as simple as adding another view with the relevant form , and creating a function to insert the information into my database .
I first had to create a function in my front .
php controller related to showing the administration panel view , and showing the right categories in my option box .
[ php ]
function add_blog ( )
{
$ data [ ‘ query ’ ] = $ this ->db-> get ( ‘ niches ’ ) ;
$ this ->load -> view ( ‘ admin_view ’ , $ data ) ;
}
[ / php ]
Then I needed to create a form in my admin_view .
php file to fill out the details of the site I was adding .
The following is of course without the requisite xhtml that should surround the form and create a layout to look pretty .
[ php ]
echo form_open ( ‘ front/ submit’ ) ;
echo “ Site Name : ” .form_input ( ‘ name ’ ) ;
echo “
Site URL : ” .form_input( ‘url ’ ) ;
echo “
“ ;
echo “ “ ;
foreach ( $ query - > result ( ) as $ row ) :
echo “
“ ;
echo form_close ( ” ) ;
[ / php ]
And lastly , I needed a function in my front .
php controller for putting that inputted information in the database which was as simple as :
[ php ]
function submit ( )
{
$ this ->db->insert ( ‘ sites ’ , $ _POST ) ;
redirect (‘ front/add_blog ’ ) ;
}
[ / php ]
I know I ’ve been bad , as I have n’t locked down my little administration panel yet , but this does show how easy it is to manage a database with CodeIgniter , from querying the database , displaying rows , and then inserting information into another table , I would have needed to write a lot more PHP had I done this without a framework .
Also , if you know of a way to do this with less code , better code or have any thoughts or opinions on these CodeIgniter posts , please let me know in the comments below .
At the presidents town hall meeting I was truly disappointed by the presidents response to the question about legalizing marijuana .
Drugs should be legal !
No one can argue that the nabuse of drugs are a scourge on our society .
However , as bad as the effect of drug abuse on our society is , the effect of prohibition is worse .
If recreational drugs were legal , under controlled conditions as is the legal drug alcohol , hundreds ( perhaps even thousands ) of lives would be saved each year .
Criminal and terrorist organizations would be denied a major source of income .
Crime would be reduced .
Doctors can use any efficacious treatment that will benefit the patient most .
Billions of tax dollars could be diverted to useful and successful programs .
The economy would grow and provide benefit for more people .
The social benefits would be manifold .
Many of the deaths that are now pigeonholed as ' drug overdose ' are , in fact , caused by drugs that are purer than the users ' accustomed dose .
This will cause an overdose by merely taking the dose to which they are accustomed .
Other deaths are caused by the drugs being ' cut ' ( diluted ) with impure or dangerous substances .
At present drugs are cut with anything from relatively harmless things such as baking soda , powdered sugar , lactose and corn starch to poisons like strychnine and arsenic .
Legal drugs would fall under the supervision and standards of the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) thereby insuring cleaner , purer drugs at consistent dosages .
In addition , intravenous and intramuscular drugs could be packaged in single use syringes that are designed to be destroyed by the act of using them once .
Thus preventing the reuse and sharing of needles .
This will reduce the spread of AIDS , hepatitis and many other types of infection .
Hence , more lives saved , as well as reducing the burden on public resources since many drug abusers cannot afford to pay for medical treatment .
Legal drugs will take the drug trade out of the hands of criminals and terrorists .
It will make it more difficult in the future to have attacks of the nature of the attack on our Marines in Lebanon , the American Embassy in Kenya and the World Trade Center by terrorists who are , in part , financed by the drug trade .
It will eliminate the kind of war that is currently being waged on our southern border .
Wars for territory that are waged on our streets will be reduced .
Many of the drive - by shootings that have become commonplace in our inner cities will be reduced .
We will not only save the lives of the dealers who are the targets of these shootings but the innocent bystanders , too often children , who get caught in the crossfire .
Speaking of saving children ...
Legalizing drugs with the appropriate regulation and control would severely limit the access of drugs to children .
Just as minors cannot legally buy alcohol , they would not be able to walk into a state regulated drug store and buy drugs .
Under the present conditions drug dealers do n't care if the customer is 5 years old or 50 .
' If you got the green you got the dope . '
Consequently , more lives saved .
Let us now discuss crime .
Legalizing and regulating drug production and sale will quickly eliminate a whole plethora of crimes relating to those endeavors .
Crimes such as smuggling , producing and selling drugs would cease to be profitable .
These crimes would cease to be , except perhaps , for a few diehard adventurers .
Or in those locales where the local community has mandated that it remain illegal ( After all , their is still a thriving ' Moonshine ' industry despite the legality of alcohol ) .
We would also eliminate the crime of possession of drugs .
It will also limit the availability of funds to finance other crimes such as illegal gambling , prostitution , gunrunning , extortion and terrorism .
Drugs will likely be cheaper .
The supply would be relatively consistent .
Market forces such as ' supply and demand ' will be less of a determining price factor .
Nor will the ' risk ' factor to dealers and smugglers affect price .
The cost of producing most illegal drugs is minimal , particularly in an industrial setting .
Therefore , legalization will make the drugs more affordable thereby reducing crimes such as burglary , mugging and prostitution .
The laws we enact to legalize and regulate drugs must include severe , mandatory penalties for the violation of those laws .
In addition , crimes committed while under the influence of drugs and crimes committed for the purpose of obtaining drugs must be dealt with more severely than crimes committed for mere profit .
I would like to propose that criminals motivated by an addiction to drugs be treated as the sick people that they are .
That they 're conviction require a mandatory , indeterminate stay at a drug treatment facility until such time as the addict is declared , by a proper medical authority , not only free of the addiction , but unlikely to return to drugs .
Then , when the addict is cured of their illness they can be returned to the sentencing authority to determine if further criminal penalties are in order .
It would also be nice if the people who comprise said medical authority , as well as parole boards and other agencies with the responsibility for releasing criminals into society be held personally responsible for those decisions .
But , I suppose that is too much to ask .
Mandatory drug testing in critical industries , massive drug education efforts and a changing social climate as relates to the non-acceptance of drug abuse by the general public in recent years has been more effective in the control of drug use than prohibition ever was .
Another cost factor for drugs which will be eliminated is one that is not talked about very much , but it 's effect on society is just as devastating , although not as obvious .
That is the cost of corruption .
The money that drug traffickers now expend for policemen , judges and public officials .
I want to say here that the vast majority of policemen and judges ( I 'm not so sure about politicians ) are honest , hardworking public servants .
Nevertheless , they are human , mostly underpaid and overworked and some will succumb to temptation .
There is today a ' revolving door ' justice system with it 's plea bargaining .
early paroles and assorted rules that make it difficult for police and judges to do the job of taking criminals off the streets and keeping them off .
This gives rise to a level of frustration and cynicism that is enormous .
It is an atmosphere ripe for corruption .
The surprising thing is that there is not more of it !
This is a tribute to the men and women of the law enforcement and criminal justice community .
Corruption , however , does exist and imbrues the character of the individuals that engage in it , as well as diminishing the institutions that depend on them .
Also , we cannot forget the people in our financial institutions who knowingly ' launder ' ( legitimatize ) the ill - gotten gains of the criminals who engage in these activities .
In addition , the elimination of drug crimes and the reduction of drug related crimes will reduce the burden on the prison system by more than half .
It will free law enforcement officers to concentrate on other , more pressing , matters .
( I.E. Bernie Medoff , AIG , Etc. )
It will allow judges to put away more dangerous criminals and to keep these people off the streets longer when prison overcrowding becomes less of a consideration .
In addition , the prison authorities can concentrate more on rehabilitation than control .
Let 's talk economics now !
The legalization of drugs will , first of all , create jobs .
Jobs in agriculture growing the plants .
Prosperity and freedom to many third world countries and their citizens .
Much of these drugs are now grown by warlords and criminals who oppress their people .
Jobs in the manufacturing of drugs .
Jobs in the distribution and wholesaling of drugs .
As well as jobs in the retail sector .
Then there are the tax revenues .
The taxes that will be paid by the industries that manufacture drugs .
The taxes paid on the incomes of those who find jobs in the drug industries .
The ' sin ' taxes that will most likely be levied on drugs .
If the taxes on alcohol and tobacco are any indication every dollar spent on drugs will be 60 ¢ to 70¢ , perhaps more , will be taxes .
Not to mention local sales tax .
A portion of the ' sin ' tax can be earmarked for effective drug rehabilitation and drug awareness education .
After all it is only fair that the people who are the problem be a part of the solution .
Some of that money might also be used to develop drugs that are not addicting or physically harmful but will provide the pleasure that drug users seek .
Would n't it be nice that when a drug abuser matures enough to no longer need to use drugs to hide from their life , they can make a choice to stop .
A choice unobstructed by a physical dependency .
While moderate users can enjoy their pleasure without fear of addiction .
Further , the reduction of drug dealers who provide a negative role model to the young people in a community is a social benefit that can not be denied .
Today young people , especially in the slums and ghettoes of the inner cities , are given a mixed message .
They are told by their families , spiritual leaders and teachers to be hard working , honest and law abiding in order to have a good and prosperous life .
Then they look around and see , all too often , people who live by these ideals struggling in poverty and unhappiness at worst , struggling to make ends meet at best .
Driving old beater cars ( when they can afford cars ) , living in rundown homes , imprisoned in their homes afraid to walk the streets .
While the drug dealers , pimps and thieves seem to own the streets , ride around in flashy new cars , live in classy houses and apartments and always seem to have money .
Not only does this send a confusing message to the children .
It creates disrespect for those people they should respect most .
Children will feel they have been deceived by parents , clergymen and teachers when the lessons they are taught do not conform to the reality they see around them .
Legalization will , to some extent , eliminate those negative role models .
Then the children will only have corporate executives and politicians to look to for negative role models
I realize that the drug problem is an emotionally charged issue to
many people .
There are no accurate figures on the extent of drug use and drug abuse in this country .
Estimates indicate that between 5 and 15 % of the people in this country abuse themselves with drugs .
The number of moderate drug users is practically unknown .
However , if we use as an indicater the ratio of moderate alcohol users to the number of alcohol abusers perhaps that will give us an indication .
The people who use recreational drugs and medicinal drugs for recreation moderately are often discrete , quiet , responsible people who go to work every day .
They mow there lawns on the weekend and have their friends and neighbors over for dinner .
However , because of the illegal nature of their activities they must keep it discretely behind closed doors , often hiding from their children even their mates .
These estimates vary to some extent with the rise and fall of the economy .
Poverty is a great stimulus to drug use and drug abuse .
Perhaps some of the billions of dollars that will be saved by ending the , so - called , ‘ War on Drugs ' could be used to help reduce poverty .
Estimates also indicate that there is no appreciable change in drug abuse figures from when drugs were legal to when they were n't .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States sharply criticized China on Wednesday in its annual report on human rights , one week after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton soft - pedalled rights concerns during a visit to Beijing .

The State Department report also took aim at Russia , where it said civil liberties were “ under siege , ” and noted a global outbreak in restrictive laws on non-governmental groups and the media , including the Internet .
In an examination of human rights in more than 190 countries during 2008 , the report roundly criticized many of its usual targets , including Afghanistan , North Korea , Cuba , Iran , Iraq , Sudan , Syria , Somalia , Myanmar and Zimbabwe .
“ The most serious human rights abuses tended to occur in countries where unaccountable rulers wielded unchecked power or there was government failure or collapse , often exacerbated or caused by internal or external conflict , ” said the report , which regularly draws the anger of foreign governments targeted for criticism .
The report covers the final year of President George W. Bush ’s administration , which had been criticized for its own human rights record , including interrogation methods used on suspected militants and detention without trial at the Guantanamo prison .
President Barack Obama , who took office five weeks ago , has ordered Guantanamo closed in a year and adopted a tougher line against the possible torture of terrorism suspects .
Clinton , criticized last week for putting concerns about China ’s human rights issues on the back burner , said promotion of human rights remained “ essential to our foreign policy . ”
“ Not only will we seek to live up to our ideals on American soil , we will pursue greater respect for human rights as we engage other nations and people around the world , ” she said .
The U.S. report was harsh on China , saying its human rights record “ remained poor and worsened in some areas . ”
“ The Chinese government increased detention and harassment of dissidents , petitioners , human rights defenders and defence lawyers , ” it said , adding the abuses peaked around high - profile events such as the Olympic Games held in Beijing last summer .
‘ SERIOUS ABUSES ’
“ Other serious human rights abuses included extrajudicial killings , torture and coerced confessions of prisoners , and the use of forced labour , including prison labour , ” the report said .
The United States has long accused China of human rights abuses and pressed Beijing to grant greater autonomy to Tibet , but on her visit last week Clinton said their joint efforts to ease the global financial crisis , fight climate change and curb North Korea ’s nuclear ambitions came first .
But Clinton told reporters on Wednesday “ as secretary of state , I will continue to focus my own energies on human rights , and will engage as many others as I can to join me . ”
“ I am looking for results , ” she said .
“ I am looking for changes that will actually improve the lives of the greatest numbers of people . ”
Human rights groups , which had criticized Clinton ’s stance on China last week , praised the report ’s criticisms of China and Russia .
“ The U.S. government ’s own evidence points to dire circumstances for the Chinese people that can no longer be ignored , even as the United States works with China on other pressing issues , ” said T. Kumar , Amnesty International ’s advocacy director for Asia and the Pacific .
The U.S. report said civil liberties in Russia “ continued to be under siege , reflecting an erosion of the government ’s accountability to its citizens . ”
The conflict between Russia and Georgia had led to civilian casualties and the indiscriminate use of force , and government pressure had led to an increase in assaults on journalists , it said .
The Russian failure to solve the murders of journalists such as Anna Politkovskaya , a Kremlin critic killed in 2006 , has sparked a wave of new concerns about political freedoms .
Three men accused of helping in Politkovskaya ’s murder were acquitted in a Russian court and authorities have not identified who ordered the killing or captured the gunman .
The report also found evidence around the world of more burdensome restrictions on the media and the Internet , and a boomerang effect in countries where human rights campaigners have pushed for more freedoms .
“ Some countries increased repression in response to popular efforts to secure respect for human rights , ” the report said , pointing to Vietnam and China in particular .
“ Many courageous human rights defenders who peacefully pressed for their own rights and those of their fellow countrymen and women were harassed , threatened , arrested and imprisoned , killed , or were subjected to violent extrajudicial means of reprisal . ”
There was an incredible , heated argument over the ' British jobs for British workers ' strikes .
This largely centred on how much that slogan really characterized the strike , and how much that was a media myth .
When the strike was resolved , I suggested that given that the basis of the strike was the idea that British and Italian workers were in competition , and given that trade unionists than promised to target other refineries employing ' foreign workers ' , starting with Staythorpe in Newark , the Left should n't complacently claim a victory .
Well , look at this : Workers marching in Staythorpe , with a prominent chant being : " What do we want ?
Foreigners Out ! "
This is poison for the labour movement .
To their credit , both Mark Serwotka , general secretary of the PCS union , and Tony Woodley , joint general secretary of Unite , have signed a statement opposing the British jobs for British workers slogan .
Not all union leaders are being so principled .
In this next video , Derek Simpson addresses the workers and - partly because he has been so useless to his members for so much of the time - has a rough time .
But he still defends the slogan ' British jobs for British workers ' while pretending that this in no way implies an attack on ' foreign workers ' :
Simpson might think that by pandering to the government on the one hand and to nationalist arguments on the other , he will get some improvement in labour rights .
But that is n't what is happening here .
Once more , instead of demanding more employment , the union is demanding that Polish and Spanish workers are replaced by British workers .
How can this strategy not end terribly ?
How is it not a grubby disgrace to the working class movement ?

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Ballistic missiles could be Israel ’s weapon of choice against Iranian nuclear facilities if it decides on a pre-emptive attack and deems air strikes too risky , according to a report by a Washington think - tank .

Israel is widely assumed to have Jericho missiles capable of hitting Iran with an accuracy of a few dozen meters ( yards ) from target .
Such a capability would be free of warplanes ’ main drawbacks -- limits on fuel and ordnance , and perils to pilots .
Extrapolating from analyst assessments that the most advanced Jerichos carry 750 kg ( 1,650 lb ) conventional warheads , Abdullah Toukan of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said 42 missiles would be enough to “ severely damage or demolish ” Iran ’s core nuclear sites at Natanz , Esfahan and Arak .
“ If the Jericho III is fully developed and its accuracy is quite high then this scenario could look much more feasible than using combat aircraft , ” he said in the March 14 report , titled “ Study on a Possible Israeli Strike on Iran ’s Nuclear Development Facilities . ”
Israel , whose jets bombed Iraq ’s nuclear reactor in 1981 and mounted a similar sortie over Syria in 2007 , has hinted that it could forcibly deny Iran the means to make an atomic bomb .
But many experts believe the Iranian sites are too distant , dispersed and protected for Israel ’s warplanes to take on alone .
Israel neither confirms nor denies having Jerichos , as part of an “ ambiguity ” policy veiling its own assumed atomic arsenal .
Sam Gardiner , a retired U.S. air force colonel who runs war games for various government agencies in Washington , cast doubt on the usefulness of ballistic missiles against Iran , noting , for example , the robust fortification at Natanz .
This , he said , would required that attackers “ burrow ” into the targets using multiple , precision - guided bombs dropped by plane : “ The American conclusion is that the only way to get deep enough is to put a second warhead into the hole of the first . ”
Loath to see further destabilization of a combustible region , the Obama administration has championed engaging Iran diplomatically .
Some U.S. officials have signaled unhappiness at the idea of Israel going it alone against its arch - foe .
REPRISALS
Toukan , whose 114 - page report frowns on the prospect of unilateral Israeli action , said a Jericho salvo could draw an Iranian counter - attack with Shehab missiles .
Other reprisal scenarios include Iran choking off oil exports , hitting U.S. Gulf assets , or ordering proxy attacks on Jewish targets abroad .
Some Israeli experts have been dismissive of the Shehab threat , citing intelligence assessments that Iran has deployed fewer than 100 of the missiles and that , if fired , most would be destroyed in mid-flight by Israel ’s Arrow II interceptor .
“ Under such circumstances , we would expect little more than a repeat of the Gulf war , ” said one ex-general , referring to Iraq ’s firing of 40 Scud missiles at Israel during the 1991 conflict .
Those attacks inflicted damage but few casualties .
The Arrow II also provides some protection for Jordan , an Arab neighbor of Israel and which Toukan saw becoming “ Ground Zero if a ballistic missile exchange takes place . ”
He noted that any Jericho strikes on Iran -- which has denied seeking nuclear weapons but vowed to retaliate if attacked -- would be complicated should Tehran obtain the most sophisticated version of Russia ’s S - 300 air - defense system , which can tackle ballistic missiles as well as invading planes .
Israel could face a further difficulty in mounting a sneak Jericho attack because its strategic air bases are located near population centers .
The unannounced test launch of what was believed to be a Jericho III outside Tel Aviv last year became public knowledge within minutes .
But that may be the extent of Iran ’s forewarning .
According to an Israeli defense consultant , only the United States and Russia have put up satellites capable of spotting ballistic missile launches in real time , “ and it ’s highly unlikely that the Iranians would get access to that information . ”
The consultant , who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity , played down the notion of ballistic missiles being used for conventional attacks :
“ You look at any major Western military , and you ’ll see that such strikes are the purview of manned warplanes , while ballistic missiles are reserved for nuclear - strike scenarios . ”
Praise Mitt Romney .
Three years ago , the former Massachusetts Governor had the inadvertent good sense to create the " universal " health - care program that the White House and Congress now want to inflict on the entire country .
It is proving to be instructive , as Mr. Romney 's foresight previews what President Obama , Max Baucus , Ted Kennedy and Pete Stark are cooking up for everyone else .
In Massachusetts 's latest crisis , Governor Deval Patrick and his Democratic colleagues are starting to move down the path that government health plans always follow when spending collides with reality -- i.e. , price controls .
As costs continue to rise , the inevitable results are coverage restrictions and waiting periods .
It was only a matter of time .
They 're trying to manage the huge costs of the subsidized middle - class insurance program that is gradually swallowing the state budget .
The program provides low - or no-cost coverage to about 165,000 residents , or three - fifths of the newly insured , and is budgeted at $ 880 million for 2010 , a 7.3 % single - year increase that is likely to be optimistic .
The state 's overall costs on health programs have increased by 42 % (! ) since 2006 .
Like gamblers doubling down on their losses , Democrats have already hiked the fines for people who do n't obtain insurance under the " individual mandate , " already increased business penalties , taxed insurers and hospitals , raised premiums , and pumped up the state tobacco levy .
That 's still not enough money .
So earlier this year , Mr. Patrick appointed a state commission to figure out how to control costs and preserve " this grand experiment . "
One objective is to change the incentives for preventative care and treatments for chronic disease , but everyone says that .
It sometimes results in better health but always more spending .
So - called " pay for performance " financing models , on the other hand , would do away with fee for service -- but they also tend to reward process , not the better results implied .
Philips '
Master LED bulb has the same form factor as the old - fashioned kind , making it " simple for people to use and feel good about using . "
The bulb draws just 7 watts but gives off light equivalent to 40 watts ' worth , and lasts 45,000 hours , as opposed to the 1,500 of its incandescent predecessors .
Already available in Europe , the Master LED should make its way to North American shores sometime before July .
Another interesting Philips product is their LivingColors LED lamp , which contains just four LED bulbs -- two red , one blue , one green -- that can be controlled to produce 16 million different colors .
Dragging your finger around the iPod - like touch wheel on the remote produces different hues .
Priced at around 120 Pounds , the LivingColors has been available in Europe since ' 07 , but there 's no word as to when it might come ' Stateside .
A former diplomat at the centre of events in the run-up to the Iraq war revealed yesterday that the government has a " paper trail " that could reveal new information about the legality of the invasion .
Carne Ross , who was a first secretary at the United Nations in New York for the Foreign Office until 2004 , told MPs : " A lot of facts about the run-up to this war have yet to come to light which should come to light and which the public deserves to know . "
There were also assessments by the joint intelligence committee which had not been disclosed , Ross told the Commons public administration select committee .
He told the inquiry that the intelligence made it " very clear " that Saddam Hussein did not pose a significant threat to the UK , as was being claimed at the time by ministers , and that tougher enforcement of sanctions could have brought his regime down .
He said he tried to inform ministers about his misgivings over the developing momentum towards war , taking them aside during their visits to New York or having brief conversations in their car to the airport .
But he said he was aware that speaking out too often or too openly - even in internal debates - about his concerns about the government 's policy direction would damage his career by winning him a reputation as a " naive troublemaker " .
Ross 's evidence , by video link from New York , came days after Jack Straw , who was foreign secretary at the time , used the first ministerial veto under the freedom of information act to ban the release of cabinet minutes on the decision to go to war .
" I feel very strongly that there has still not been proper accountability and scrutiny into what happened in Iraq , " Ross said .
" There should be a full public inquiry or parliamentary inquiry into the decision - making that took place .
Hutton and Butler are by no means sufficient to that purpose and it is disgraceful that the government pretends that they are ... if we had those systems of accountability and scrutiny then leaking and other more aberration behaviour from civil servants would be less necessary . "
He was one of four " whistleblowers " who yesterday gave evidence to the committee .
They also included Katharine Gun , a former GCHQ translator who revealed the organisation was tapping phones of countries that were against the Iraq war ; Brian Jones , the most senior expert on chemical weapons at the Defence Intelligence Staff ; and Derek Pasquill , a former Foreign Office official who leaked documents about rendition and Muslim groups who were hostile to the UK receiving government money .
Jones and Ross never leaked any information to the press .
Jones instead complained to his superior that he thought the intelligence dossier on weapons of mass destruction was being exaggerated but was told that there was " one secret piece of information which could not be shared with [ him ] " because it was too sensitive .
He told MPs that when the WMD dossier was published and he saw the difference between the foreword by the prime minister and the contents he " thought the intelligence services were going to be crucified " .
But he instead he found that most MPs , with a few exceptions , supported the government .
" I feel that you gentlemen [ the MPs ] have been either deliberately or accidentally misled and these incidents have not been followed up .
I think that there has been a great laxity and that wo n't encourage people like me or my colleagues to come to you , " he said .
Tony Wright , the chairman of the committee , agreed with the allegation .
" I think you are absolutely right to castigate parliament , which I think has behaved abysmally in this matter - endless bleating about the need for an inquiry but a complete failure to insist upon one , " he said .
Gordon Brown has promised to look at an inquiry after all the troops come home from Iraq .
From the ' read in between the lines ' files :
Cisco 's big Unified Computing blade server push yesterday pulled in a lot of partners , among them Red Hat .
There are a number of things that make the Red Hat / Cisco partnership extremely interesting from my point of view that indicate the importance of Linux to Cisco and of Cisco to Linux .
Among them is the fact that from day one Linux will be a key operating system for the Cisco Unified Computing System ( UCS ) .
1 ) For one , while Cisco had many partners joining its release , only EMC , VMware , BMC , Accenture and Red Hat got their own unique press releases listed on the Cisco website .
2 ) In the Red Hat release on the Cisco site , there is a video from Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst that exposes some really interesting facts .
Among them is the fact that Red Hat and Cisco have joint beta site customers ( plural ) for the Unified Computing System .
That 's A BIG DEAL .
During Cisco 's press conference yesterday , Cisco claimed to have only 10 beta sites for UCS in total .
That means that at least 20 percent ( and maybe more if you consider that several means more than one ) of Cisco 's UCS business will be Linux from day one .
Cisco and Red Hat have worked together on high speed messaging related to RDMA - remote direct memory access ( something I reported on earlier this month that both Red Hat and Cisco use ) .
Cisco is a top contributor to Linux overall , working on its own as well as with partners Red Hat and MontaVista Software .
Having Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a key operating system on the massive Cisco blade server will bring Linux to a scale that is industry leading in many respects .
With scale comes improvements , and since Red Hat is open source , those improvements will find their way into the Linux mainstream at some point benefitting the wider community .
NOUAKCHOTT ( Reuters ) - Mauritania ’s military junta expelled Israeli diplomats and shut the embassy on Friday after freezing ties with the Jewish state over its invasion of Gaza .

Mauritania was one of only three Arab countries that had full diplomatic relations with Israel and the closure of the embassy in Nouakchott leaves just Egypt and Jordan .
Mauritania ’s communications minister said the move was a result of a decision taken at a meeting of Arab leaders in Doha in mid-January following Israel ’s invasion of Gaza .
“ We informed them of the decision to suspend relations at the time of the summit in Doha , and it is now being executed , ” El Kory Ould Abdel Mola told Reuters .
“ The embassy is closed . ”
Another Mauritanian official said Israeli diplomats had been given 48 hours to leave the northwest African country .
Staff were seen leaving the building .
“ Israel has decided to close its embassy in Nouakchott , ” the embassy said in a statement .
“ The ambassador is on vacation . ”
An Israeli Foreign Ministry official who declined to be identified said he could not confirm the expulsion and suggested the timing of the decision could be linked to a planned visit to Nouakchott by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi .
“ Maybe they are just showing they ’re tough , ” the official said .
Gaddafi heads the African Union and is trying to mediate in the political crisis Mauritania has endured since the first democratically elected president was overthrown last August and General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz took over .
“ The decision was dictated by the Libyan guide ( Gaddafi ) , ” said Ahmed Abdallah , a senior member of the anti-junta alliance the National Front for the Defense of Democracy .
“ He said he would not come to Nouakchott if they did not cut relations with Israel . ”
Ousted President Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi returned to the capital on Friday for the first time since the coup and was due to fly to Libya to meet Gaddafi .
An official close to junta leader Abdel Aziz said that after the Doha summit , the foreign ministry had sent a letter to the Israeli ambassador advising him to leave .
Abdel Aziz announced the decision to freeze relations at a summit of Arab nations in Doha , Qatar , in January .
Qatar said at the time that it would freeze its own relations with Israel , which are at a lower level than full diplomatic ties .
Most other Arab countries also froze Israel ’s trade missions in their capitals after Israel ’s offensive in Gaza .
Nouakchott , in common with other cities across the Arab world , saw protests against the Gaza attacks earlier this year .
Twitter Chatter During the Super Bowl

Moon Day , 2003
I saw it happen .
I witnessed the end of the world .
And since I 'm the only human who saw it , I 'm going to write it down , even though there wo n't be any more generations of humans to read it .
Somehow I need to .
Perhaps another species will learn from our experience .
Probably not .
Certainly we never imagined how dangerous a galaxy we grew up in .
Context : even though born decades after Cernan made the last bootprint on the Moon , I 've dreamed of going into space for as long as I can remember .
I 'd lie in bed at night and imagine my bedroom suddenly transformed into zero G. I 'd push myself off from a wall , feeling the exquisite back - pressure of pure inertia as I squeezed my fingers to launch myself ; I 'd do lazy back flips and twists in mid-air , then use my toes to spring from the opposite wall .
I occupied myself with all the usual space - kid stuff : model rockets , reading astronaut memoirs , even joining one of the groups lobbying for more taxpayer money for socialist space programs .
But even in high school I 'd faced the fact that the only way I 'd ever make it to orbit would be to turn myself into a politically - correct government funded parasite , then spend a career in a program completely decoupled from the true human destiny in space .
No thanks ; I 'd rather program computers .
Then came the Fourth of August : decapitation .
Amid the shock and chaos that ensued , only a few ( far wiser than this high school kid ) imagined that the destruction of Washington would indirectly open the road to the stars .
Like so many of the private initiatives that sprang up in the years of recovery and the dawn of the Republic , the Band of Billionaires and the GEOSPACE corporation they founded would invigorate industries grown sclerotic from decades of regulation and inspire a generation to realise their dreams , working toward their own personal future beyond the home planet .
It sure was that way for me .
In my junior year of college , I changed my major to aerospace , and started to catch up on thermogoddamics , fluids , and all the real engineering I 'd ignored while fooling around with computers .
It would take me an extra year to graduate , but equip me for a career in space .
After the obligatory master 's degree , flight school indenture , National Service as a militia pilot , and five years of working up the ladder at GEOSPACE , I 'd made it off - planet as an interorbital ferry pilot ( the word “ shuttle ” having become as disreputable as “ appeasement ” and “ root cause ” ) , driving technicians and gear back and forth between the Low Earth Orbit logistics base and the GEOCans .
After economics finally prevailed over national pride , it was obvious that sprinkling dozens of satellites around geosynchronous orbit was an insane way to go about global communication .
Far wiser to concentrate everything in a small number of geostationary platforms ( visionaries always fastened on the minimum of three , but actually six ultimately made the most sense ) , cross - linked by high bandwidth lasers .
On each GEOCan ( supposedly from “ GEOSPACE Communication Array Node ” , but really because the pressurised module resembled a beer can ) , tenants shared solar panels , transmitters and phased array antennas , but supplied their own switching , signal processing , and beam directing gear .
The six GEOCans were hardly high tech , but then nothing GEOSPACE did was , really .
But they made money — cubic acres of the stuff .
The GEOCans were actually based on the design of the laboratory modules for the grotesque “ International Space Station ” that scattered debris all over China two years after the decapitation .
Once the GEOSPACE engineers ripped out all the gold - plating and safetyland silliness , what remained was a suitable pressure vessel and logistics system for the GEOCans .
This was my third trip to a GEOCan as pilot — this time GEOCan Asia , above Singapore at 105 degrees East ; what a view !
We 'd embarked three tonnes of cargo and five technicians at the GEOSPACE LEO base for the run uphill .
Like most logistics missions , we'd top up station keeping fuel , but most of our cargo was changeouts for gear in the racks inside the GEOCan — signal processors , amplifiers , and so forth .
The techs understand this stuff ( or at least how to hook it up ) ; I just drive the bus .
After docking , completing the propellant transfer , hooking up the life support system in the GEOCan to the consumables and scrubbers in the ferry , and checking the atmosphere in the GEOCan , my work was done until it was time to undock and burn Earth transfer orbit .
The techs were busy in the GEOCan removing old gear and installing the new , muttering to themselves in Russian , Chinese , Korean , Japanese , and English , and bitching to one another in the latter .
I was floating in my ferry pilot 's seat , listening to the chatter on the intercom , but mostly alternating between studying and looking out the window .
Studying — my next career goal ( it seems so trivial , now ) was to land a first officer 's seat on a GEOSPACE Trans - Atmospheric Transport , then move up after a couple of years to captain .
Flying back and forth from Omaha spaceport to low Earth orbit may not seem as romantic as boosting up to where the Earth looks the size of a soccer ball , but it pays a lot better , plus you get to sleep in your own bed every night and shower regularly .
With the majority of TAT flights already going to the first GEOSPACE Orbital Hotel ( dubbed “ Sin Star ” by the fundies — beats me what so disturbs them about zero - G volleyball ) , and the tourist sector growing rapidly as volume drove the costs down , that 's where the money was .
Besides , with luck and enough seniority in the left seat of a TAT , I 'd be in line to command a lunar ferry once GEOSPACE started to open the Moon to tourism .
Now , GEOSPACE could possibly afford to lose a ferry with a bunch of techs and some comm gear .
The insurance would cover it and , Hell , we all fought to get our jobs .
But losing a TAT with 70 tourists returning from holiday would in all likelihood sink not only the space tourism business but GEOSPACE as well .
To be entrusted with one of those vehicles you had to be the very best of the very best .
Which I was , of course .
All I had to do was prove it .
So , there I was , reviewing the TAT systems manual for the thousandth time in preparation for my first “ informal ” interview with the chief of the TAT crew office next month .
I can hand fly anything with better L/D than a watermelon , but there 's only so much a meat computer can absorb in a given amount of time from prose like , “ If the primary yaw RCS fails and the prime FCS fails over to the backup yaw RCS and the RCS anomaly annunciator fails to indicate the fault , the master caution and warning system will indicate status 5104 , which may be queried on the primary or backup flight display system .
But if the backup FCS is active , no indication of the failure of primary yaw RCS will be given if the RCS anomaly annunciator has also failed . ”
Imagine seventeen thousand pages of this , and eventually being tested on all of it in the simulator .
Mine eyes , having thoroughly glazed over , gazed upward from the screen toward the ever - fascinating Earth almost centred in the cockpit window .
Suddenly , what is that ?
An impossibly brilliant star came into view from the right , moving toward the Earth with an angular velocity you simply never see in space .
It may have been bigger than a point source , but I do n't think so .
It took no more than a second to cross the two Earth diameters from where I first spotted it to the point of impact not far from the illuminated limb , a bit north of the equator .
All Hell broke loose .
The impact instantaneously ejected a plume of plasma , which began to rise outward at a speed much slower than the impactor arrived .
I 'm not sure about my perception of time from here on .
There was no camera to record it , and when you 're seeing something you 've never , ever , expected to see , time gets elastic .
I remember my parents talking about feeling that way when “ the twin towers fell . ”
I 'm too young to remember that .
Whatever the timing , this is what happened .
The Earth seemed to shudder , then the ocean began to blow off into a steam cloud which visibly inflated the atmosphere and turned it white as it progressed along a spherical front from the point of impact .
Then the Earth , which now seemed puckered near the impact point on the right limb where the plasma was dispersing into space , belched out a spout of incandescent magma from behind the dark left limb .
The spout may have gone into orbit ; there may be a new Moon .
Too bad there wo n't be any lovers to see it .
The white wave continued to spread around the globe as the shock wave progressed and the oceans vaporised .
It moved slower than one might expect , but advanced at an absolutely constant rate : the curtain of extinction ringing down upon the biosphere .
Then a shudder happened about 270 degrees from the point of impact and a white band began to propagate outward in both directions from there .
When all of these converged behind the dark limb something happened which looked like a secondary ejecta event , but I 'm not sure about that .
Moments after the impact I keyed the intercom to the techs in the GEOCan .
“ Folks , something 's happened .
Get up here right away . ”
I was n't trying to demonstrate sang - froid — I'm a pilot with more than 3000 hours and that 's how I talk .
One by one , they floated onto the flight deck and looked out the window .
All of us were struck silent by what we were witnessing .
We 'd lost the feeds from everything on Earth within 20 seconds of the impact .
The cross-feeds from the other GEOCans were still up but nothing but carrier .
By the time anybody spoke , Earth was a featureless white ball with ejecta coalescing into an arc around it .
I described the arrival of the impactor and the events before they 'd arrived on the flight deck .
Vasily shook his head and said , “ We 've known this risk since Tunguska , and what have we done — nothing .
We go to space so monkeys can chatter at one another . ”
Yutaka disagreed , “ This was not an impact by a solar system body . ”
He turned to me .
“ Peter , how long did you say it took for the impactor to come in from the point where you spotted it ? ”
“ About a second to cross two Earth diameters ” , I replied .
Yutaka drew his computer from its holster and tapped away for a few seconds .
He paused , shook his head , tapped some more , then said slowly , “ Whatever it was , it came in at about ten percent of the speed of light .
Dynamically , that object did n't belong to the solar system , or for that matter the galaxy .
It was going … ” , tap , tap , tap , “ more than seven hundred times too fast to be gravitationally bound to the Sun , and sixty times the escape velocity of the galaxy . ”
“ So what was it ? ” , asked Jiang .
I pondered the question .
“ Well , there are really only two possibilities ” , I said .
“ An impactor 's first acquiring relativistic velocity by successive random gravitational encounters , then managing to hit a target the size of the Earth is something so fantastically improbable it 's unlikely to have happened anywhere in the universe since the big bang .
So if that 's what happened , we have just witnessed the single worst case of bad luck since Creation . ”
“ Other possibility ? ” , asked Vasily .
“ That we 've just witnessed the deliberate destruction of the Earth by hostile aliens . ”
We talked about these issues for several hours and then , having nothing more to say and nothing to look at besides the white ball our home planet had become , one by one we went to sleep .
Maybe you find it hard to imagine going to sleep after watching the destruction of your entire species , but eventually you get tired enough and sleep overtakes you .
It 's not like we expected a wake - up call next morning .
The next day we monitored and tried calling on all frequencies the GEOCan could access .
The GPS constellation remained on the air , but the ephemeris in the satellites showed no update since the impact .
The other GEOCans maintained their laser links with ours , but all indicated no uplink from Earth or LEO and our transmissions relayed through them elicited no reply .
We were the only crew above LEO at the time of the impact .
The clearly visible expansion of the atmosphere as the oceans flashed into steam had been more than enough to bring down any satellite in LEO , including the logistics base , Hotel , and any TATs en route .
We had supplies for 12 days at GEO even though we'd only expected to stay for three .
With nothing better to do , we spent most of the day in rather maudlin recollections of Earth .
Our crew , all young , male , and apart from Jiang , single , probably took the end of human history better than most might have , but there 'd be no way to repeat the experiment with other humans .
We were it .
Three days passed .
We did routine housekeeping , scanned Earth and the other GEOCans for signals , finding nothing .
We took pictures of the coalescence of the ejecta from the impact into a ring which now seemed to be punctuated by the core of an inner moon .
There was nothing else to do .
All of us were mission - oriented people , so we did our jobs .
It seems crazy , but what was the alternative ?
I mean , otherwise , we might be fired .
Around mid-day , four days after the impact , the ship arrived .
Yutaka , Jiang , and I were on the flight deck when it appeared like a streak of light and seemed to instantaneously stop twenty metres in front of the ferry .
It was huge , about 100 metres in diameter , perfectly spherical .
The surface was primarily white , but with sub-structure that appeared fractal and seemed to constantly change .
A tube extended from the craft toward our front docking port , where it engaged the drogue and triggered the contingency rescue hard dock .
Over the intercom we heard , “ Please open the hatch ; we need to talk to you . ”
This in midwestern American English .
When I cracked the hatch , there was no residual pressure differential , but the smell could knock you down .
They floated through the hatch , one after another , five in all .
If you 're big on diversity , these are your kind of aliens .
Two almost resembled greys out of a Whitley Streiber nightmare — dinky , big almond - shaped black eyes , gracile limbs , egg - shaped heads … but leathery ears , like a fox bat .
Two more were vaguely lizard - like , but not all that creepy .
They stood erect on two stumpy legs and had no obvious tail .
Then there was the one with the tentacles on his ( her , its ? ) face which smelled like …well , I 've never smelled anything like that before … brrrr .
They all seemed to have no difficulty breathing our atmosphere and if we smelled as bad to them , they gave no sign of it .
They seemed to have a strong sense of hierarchy .
After speaking briefly to each member of the crew , each in his own mother tongue ( colloquially , and without obvious accent ) , one of the greys approached and addressed me as “ captain ” .
I denied the rank , but the grey insisted , “ Based on our study of your species , one speaks for all on your ships . ”
With assent from the techs , I accepted that responsibility .
In bad situations , I like to get out in front of things , and this was about as bad a situation as I could imagine .
I put my hands on my hips and asked the grey who stood before me , “ Was it you who destroyed our world ? ”
“ It was . ”
“ Why ? ”
The grey replied , “ Because your planet presented an unprecedented risk to peace in the galaxy . ”
I paused , held my breath for a few seconds , then said , as calmly as I could manage , “ Unprecedented risk ?
You have interstellar travel ; you destroy entire planets with relativistic bullets , and you have no apparent compunctions about planetary ecocide .
And you call us a risk ? ”
The grey raised its head and fixed me with its huge black eyes .
They 're not hypnotic — just black — nothing there at all , not even a reflection .
It said , “ We monitor electromagnetic emissions of all planets crossing the technological threshold .
Never before have we found one which represents such a grave peril .
Your species posed a threat so immediate , so acute , that not to act would have been negligent .
We are not aggressors ; we are galactic peacekeepers .
We do not interfere with the development of any civilisation unless it threatens all of us who have renounced warfare .
“ Your United Federation of Planets , with its incessant conflict and meddling with other developing civilisations in direct violation of its own Prime Directive and our Fundamental Charter presented a clear and present danger to us .
With warp drive , which we do not possess , and cloaking and subspace communications which enabled your Federation vessels and facilities to elude our sensors , we had no alternative but to act preemptively and decisively in self defence .
We could not risk a conflict with your Federation . ”
Vasily was the most enthusiastic Trekker on board .
He flashed crimson , then shouted ,
“ But there is no Federation , no warp , no cloaking , no subspace .
That 's nothing but science fiction . ”
The aliens looked at one other and exchanged some words in a language none of us understood .
Then the grey turned back to me and spoke .
“ We know science .
What is fiction ? ”

What drove Charles Darwin to his extraordinary ideas on evolution and human origins ?
Adrian Desmond , with co-author James Moore , argue in a new book that the great scientist had a " sacred cause " : the abolition of slavery .
A powerful symbol ( Courtesy of the trustees of the Wedgwood Museum ) " It makes one 's blood boil , " said Charles Darwin .
Not much outraged the gentle recluse , but the horrors of slavery could cost him a night 's sleep .
He was thinking of the whipped house boy and the thumbscrews used by old ladies in South America , atrocities he had witnessed on the Beagle voyage .
The screams stayed with him for life , but how much did they influence his life 's work ?
Today you can still read of Darwin's " eureka " moment when he saw the Galapagos finches .
Alas , his conversion to evolution was n't so simple , but it was much more interesting .
It did n't occur in the Galapagos , but probably on his arrival home .
And new evidence suggests that Darwin 's unique approach to evolution - relating all races and species by " common descent " - could have been fostered by his anti-slavery beliefs .
Family feelings
After circumnavigating the globe ( 1831 - 6 ) , Darwin settled in London .
Here in 1838 he formulated his theory of " natural selection " , after which he became increasingly reclusive , particularly following his move to Down village in Kent .
He refrained from publishing a word on evolution until 1858 - not even a brief , priority - grabbing paper , as was his way with other projects .
His hesitance is understandable .
Evolution was execrable to his Cambridge friends .
BBC'S DARWIN SEASON The Genius of Evolution Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
One naturalist called it " abominable trash vomited " out by revolutionaries ; and radicals did , indeed , deploy a self - sustaining evolution to undermine the creationist miracles on which Anglican power rested .
Darwin's gouty Cambridge professor , Adam Sedgwick , used " contempt , scorn , and ridicule " to trash one " filthy " evolution book in 1844 .
Darwin , sensitive about his reputation , wisely laid low .
So why devise such a beastly theory in the first place , if it threatened ignominy ?
Was there some integral moral gain ?
Consider another question .
Why was Darwin 's evolution uniquely defined by common descent , the joining of races and species through shared ancestry ?
Darwin's common descent image is so obvious today that we forget to question where it came from .
' Man and brother ' Common descent in Darwin 's younger day was ubiquitous in anti-slavery tracts .
Consider the words of the famous cameo , depicting a kneeling slave asking " Am I Not a Man and a Brother ? "
That cameo was in fact the brainchild of the pottery - dynasty founder , Josiah Wedgwood , Darwin 's grandfather .
New evidence shows how indebted Darwin was to this anti-slavery heritage .
Darwin knew that going into print would have invited derision Darwin 's uncle Jos Wedgwood sold the firm 's London showroom , and ploughed the proceeds into an anti-slavery society , and in the 1850s ( with American slavery still flourishing ) the Wedgwoods continued using labels showing the slave under Britannia 's banner , which read " God Hath Made of One Blood All Nations of Men " .
The anti-slavery agitator Thomas Clarkson - the man who rode 35,000 miles collecting statistics in the sea ports on the evil trade - was another bankrolled by Josiah Wedgwood .
With a Wedgwood wife and mother , Darwin saw abolition as a " sacred cause " too , and in his culminating work , the Descent of Man ( 1871 ) , he placed Clarkson at the moral apex of humanity and called slavery a " great sin " .
Such family feelings explain why , as a 16 - year - old at Edinburgh University in 1826 ( in a period often dismissed by historians ) , Darwin could spend 40 extra- curricular hours with a freed slave from Guyana studying taxidermy and become his " intimate " friend .
And this when many visiting Americans saw any black / white friendship as " revolting " .
Torture accounts Darwin witnessed slavery everywhere in South America .
The Beagle 's own supply ship on her previous trip had originally been a slaver , and , once sold , it reverted to slaving .
While Darwin was on the continent , it was again disgorging chained Africans .
Darwin's journal of the voyage ( 1845 ) gives a damning account of the tortures he saw or heard of ; but of all the " heart - sickening atrocities " , the worst for him were the stories of masters threatening to sell the children of disobedient slaves .
Darwin was appalled at the treatment handed out to slaves
As an outsider , he was " powerless as a child even to remonstrate " .
But within weeks of the Beagle 's return , he developed a science which undercut the slave - master 's notions .
Many plantation owners considered slaves a separate species , an animal to be exploited as such .
Blacks and whites shared no joint ancestry .
Yet the Darwin - Wedgwood maxim made the slave a " Man and a Brother " .
Darwin opened his first evolution notebook in 1837 , damned slave - holders for their separate species view , then pushed common parentage to the zoological limit .
Since species were only extended races , they too must share an ancestry .
He moved from talking of the common " father " of mankind to an " opossum " - like fossil as the father of all mammals .
Human genealogy became the model for his famous " tree of life " .
Fossil evidence None of this minimizes the importance of Darwin 's Galapagos and Pampas observations .
The giant tortoises , mockingbirds and finches varied from island to island , and this became clearer to Darwin after London Zoo 's bird expert John Gould analysed his finches in January 1837 .
Then Richard Owen ( the man shortly to give the world the " dinosaurs " ) diagnosed Darwin 's fossils .
Darwin thought that some were " rhinos " ( Old World mammals ) , yet Owen showed that they were indigenous giant armadillos , sloths and anteaters .
So extinct animals were being succeeded by related living types .
This evidence remains crucial , but it was the way Darwin marshalled it that concerns us .
Assuming the tacit truth of racial " brotherhood " allowed him to join the bloodlines into a common descent configuration .
And he did so in 1837 - 8 , just as the West Indies slaves were being released ( technically freed in 1833 , they were forced to serve an " apprenticeship " which effectively kept them in bondage till 1838 ) .
This freedom filled Darwin with a sense of pride and he declared that " we ... have made a greater sacrifice , than ever made by any nation , to expiate our sin " .
He certainly had .
All too clear
His common descent imagery was unknown elsewhere in natural history , beyond racially unifying works such as James Cowles Prichard 's Researches into the Physical History of Mankind .
That book traced animal races to common ancestors in order to prove that all humans could have descended from Adam .
Darwin , preparing to write the Origin of Species , scribbled inside his copy of Prichard : " How like my Book all this will be " .
It was n't so .
He remained a worried man and in the later 1850s dropped humans from his publishing plans because the subject was " so surrounded with prejudices " .
But even though the Origin of Species ( 1859 ) skirted people , no one doubted that they remained at its core .
Darwin's " bulldog " T.H.
Huxley , who took over the fight for human evolution , said that when it came to uniting black and white ancestries , he " was pleased to be able to show that Mr Darwin was for once on the side of orthodoxy " .
Darwin could have wished for no more .

He is co-author with James Moore of Darwin 's Sacred Cause ( Allen Lane )

Different ways of seeing stats
What are we to make of all those stories that warn of lifestyle dangers and slap a giant " % " sign in the headline ?
Michael Blastland introduces the Risk - o - meter to his regular column .
In response to your e-mails after the last column , and the everyday fog of statistics about risks , I 've produced what I hope is a better way to see the numbers .
From bacon to booze , risks often make headlines : " CANCER UP X PERCENT IF YOU DO Y " - you know what I 'm talking about .
So I 've devised a simple but different way of seeing stories , with a click - by - click Risk - o - meter .
Click through the examples below to see why those percentages easily mislead - and why it pays to ditch percentages and talk instead about the numbers of real people .
A BETTER WAY TO SEE THE RISKS {current} of {total} NEXT BACK
Two caveats .
First , links between a food and a health hazard ( or benefit ) do not always indicate a direct cause .
Second , some studies have produced different numbers to the ones here .
The benefit of moderate alcohol , for example , is at the conservative end of estimates .
Some studies suggest it can be far more beneficial .
We 'll bring out the Risk - o - meter if stories like these have drifted into abstract meaninglessness and we 'll convert them into something more human .
To be fair , governments and epidemiologists ( people who study patterns of illness and their causes ) do need to know the percentages - but do n't need the media to tell them .
The rest of us , who might rely on the news for guidance , deserve something more relevant .
•
Go Figure hopes from time to time to bring you arresting ways of seeing data .
How the numbers look often changes how we understand them .
New ideas for data visualisation - like animation in graphs - are causing a buzz among people who use lots of stats , among them the news media .
Not everything we offer will be cutting edge , but we hope it will stimulate .
Here 's an idea ( see image below ) called parallel sets , designed to show data with categories that divide into other categories .
This one shows passengers on the Titanic , male and female , by class of ticket , and by survival , and is designed by Robert Kosara of the University of North Carolina .
Take a moment to explore it and let us know what you think .
Below is a selection of your comments .
Brilliant !-
I work as a CFO of a bank and this graph would be ideal in understanding risk across a portfolio for example .
You could depict numerous dimensions on a single page rather than labor through the numerous tables dissecting the data ..
Would definitely use it at my workplace !
Thomas George , Kuwait
This graph is a very rich in information and provides terrific comparisons .
It reveals so much about the times .
I 'd love to see one like this on newspaper front pages explaining wealth distribution , health care and insurance in the USA , contributions to and extent of environmental change ...etc .
Pete , Portland , Oregon
What an excellent series of articles - I never knew they existed !
It 's especially good to see these on the BBC site as , I 'm afraid to say , the BBC are often rather casual in their approach to science reporting .
Thanks for that .
Ian Gray , Brighton , UK
It seems a bit bias to only look at colorectal cancer , breast cancer and coronary heart disease .
It is possible to pick the diseases accordingly so the outcomes turn out in favor / against , when comparing percentages to numbers .
What about the +/- effects of alcohol on all other sorts of diseases ?
For it to be relevant for the average person like myself , it would make sense to look at the +/- of alcohol and bacon relative to all cancers / diseases in general as oppose to 2 or 3 .
Emad , Calgary , Canada
As a visual learner I thought this was a very clear and easy way to read and understand the data .
Brilliant !
Sue Baker , Leek , GB
This is the first time I 've seen this way of representing sets , and it 's nicely intuitive .
However , the vertical axis introduces a mental bias - the impression that travel class was the most influential factor in outcome , which may or may not be true , given the information displayed .
I also would suggest it would make more sense to keep the most coincident sets lined up vertically ie : move the male dominated crew category to the far right and move the survived category dominated by females to the left .
Lisa K , Durham NC
My first impression was " What a mess ! " - it is not immediately clear what is being shown , and we are used to " a picture being worth ... "
But after spending some time on it , I was shocked to see that almost no second class men survived , while almost all first class women did .
I 'm still not convinced that this one diagram is preferable to three diagrams concentrating on sex v class , class v survival , and sex v survival .
Roy Sayers , Leeds
In looking for clear and concise methods of communicating quantitative data I 'd suggest looking at Japanese books and newspapers .
Their level of maturity in the use of graphical techniques is way better than ours , and they have many great ways to communicate in diagrams and figures .
My experience is that the Japanese public are much more educated in the use of graphs and visual aids , and we could learn a lot from them .
Peter Cumpson , Newcastle - upon - Tyne
Ooh , I like this - it makes me really think about what this image is trying to convey .
Rather than just skimming my eyes over another bar graph .
This tells us things like a majority of the male crew did not survive , and about half of the female crew members perished .
I just realised that I can't stop thinking in percentages though - must be the lack of numbers .
Hena Faqurudheen , Mumbai , India I applaud you innovative risk visualisation approach .
I have seen friends and family drop needed medications or change diets because of a news story that discusses substantial percent risk changes that only if you investigate turn out to be changes in low overall risks .
Your idea of displaying overall risk is right on and might help people key in on changing behaviour related to their highest overall risk factors .
Bravo .
John Shanklin , Shoreham , New York
It is visually a beautiful graph but lacks an immediate content message .
It may work for technical presentations , but not for the average reader .
A graph should help CLEARLY and QUICKLY convey a message better ( or more efficiently ) than text would .
This is asking too much of the reader because it takes too much time to understand the message .
It may work for a technical paper where you are interested in the analysis , but not necessarily in a mass - media publication where the reader is largely interested in gaining awareness .
Ruben Moreno , Oakton , VA USA Florence Nightingale 's original pie charts were much easier to read than this .
Caroline Keef , W Yorks
Really like the parallel sets graph , took me about five seconds to work it out , then I realised it 's a really good way to present complex data sets .
When will my spreadsheet software be able to produce one of these for me ?
Simon , Bristol , UK I have absolutely no idea how to read that graph .
My guess is as follows - it looks at though possibly the highest percentage of survivors within a group / class is if you were travelling in first class ( looks as though roughly a third , or just under a half survived ) ?
Paul Spargo , Cardiff , Wales I took a little time to understand the image .
It is so unlike any data presentation I personally have seen before that my first reaction was to be puzzled .
After a minute or two to read the headings , it was n't at all hard to understand and I thoroughly enjoyed following the various strands .
I found it gave me a lot more information in one place that I normally see in reports and gave me the opportunity to start linking variables together and getting a better overall picture of the data .
J Howe , Bolton UK
I like the way you can look at the dynamic from different perspectives like " what type of people survived " or " did all of first class survive and everyone else perish " .
A surprise for me is the sheer numbers of crew compared to passengers and the chances of survival of a male first class passenger was about 1 in 4 .
Remarkable way of showing the data and engages debate .
I think I 'll take a copy .
Dave Tyrer , Leeds Visualisation is the key to understanding complex ( and somewhat obscure ) dataset , especially in statistics .
This graph demonstrates that if you really want to commute by Titanic you better be female and pay an hefty fee for your ticket .
Armando Forlani , London
It took a moment to understand the Titanic chart but once it " clicked " it made good sense .
Its hard to put that much data in one chart and it was an intelligent and clever way to do it .
I also liked the way the risk data was presented in the story .
Risk is sometimes a difficult subject to explain as there is often more than one reason for the outcome ( similar to the Titanic data ) .
Joel Baumbaugh , San Diego , California
I remember a geography professor in a lecture deliberately misusing statistics : " 70 % of Finland is forest & 35 % of Finland is water .
This does not leave much room for the Finns . "
Duncan Peet , Edinburgh Great way to show stats .
But how about actual figures ?
It tells me that third class male passengers were way more than female passengers and most of them did not survive .
But there is no clue as to how many male passengers actually survived .
Do n't parallel sets display actual figures and numbers ?
Sourav Basu , Salt Lake City , Utah Very interesting way of showing multi-faceted data .
Takes a little time to figure it out but worth the effort .
It would be improved if you could mouse over or select in some way so that one group became highlighted .
Or perhaps show the numerical data in a similar fashion ?
Geoff , Caledon , Canada
I studied statistics as part of my degree in the late 70s , qualified as a chartered accountant and am now a finance director .
All this has taught me to ask the right questions when statistics are quoted at us .
Too few people question , or are in a position to question the stats .
What questions were asked ?
What was the population ?
What was the sample ?
Is the pronounced interpretation of the result the only one that can be placed upon it ?
I have now got my children questioning the information they are fed : and this is where education really needs to get children thinking , so that they ask the right questions and not just repeat the information given as if it is " the truth " .
As for this chart , it took some understanding but I liked it and it is a useful way of showing certain types of multi- layered data in a two - day chart .
Interesting .
Richard Wyatt , Huntingdon , Cambridgeshire Interesting article proving that percentages really mean nothing unless put it to context .
Every week a new statistic ( normally as a percentage ) comes out telling us we are all going to die sooner , but as shown above the effect is normally very small on a personal level .
On another note the parallel sets diagram is an amazingly concise way of showing the data , I may start using it myself .

Action packed !
These little robots have some fast moves , battling it out for fame and glory .
Funny stuff .
Liberals love to blame poor Black and Hispanic performance in American public schools on the lack of school quality , e.g. lack of updated textbooks , no laptops for kids , etc .
This has been the standard liberal narrative for decades ( I ’m an SF liberal myself , btw ) .
But does this assessment match the data ?
Does it match what students and teachers see every day in American schools ?
Does it match what we see in society ?
No .
If either of the following statements were true , Asian and Indian kids would be performing poorly in American public schools as well :
American public schooling is simply poor altogether , and it ’s impossible to do well American public school is biased against non-whites , which is why blacks and hispanics do so poorly
But Asian and Indian kids are academically dominating .
These students are n’t just outperforming Blacks and Hispanics in the same exact schools , they ’re also outperforming White students .
Why is that ?
How are Asians and Indians doing so well in an academic environment that ’s supposedly hard to thrive in ?
The answer is culture .
Some cultures are conducive to academic performance , and others are not .
Quite simply , the problem is n’t poor schools , the problem is poor parenting .
One fallback defense against this is often that of socio- economic status , e.g .
“ Well , this is simply because these high - performing Asians come from rich families , and the Hispanic kids are poor … ”
But this does n’t stand up under scrutiny .
Here ’s a clip from an article in the L.A.
Times on this very subject , titled “ Trying to Bridge the Grade Divide ” .
To begin with , the eight students agreed on a few generalities : Latino and Asian students came mostly from poor and working - class families .
According to a study of census data , 84 % of the Asian and Latino families in the neighborhoods around Lincoln High have median annual household incomes below $ 50,000 .
And yet the Science Bowl team is 90 % Asian , as is the Academic Decathlon team .
I find it highly ironic that liberals claim to be the ones interested in protecting minorities , yet they are the ones championing this horribly destructive narrative of “ bias against non-whites ” in the academic environment .
Most Indians are pretty dark , and yet they graduate high school , attain bachelors degrees , and graduate degrees at higher rates than Blacks , Hispanics , and Whites .
And no , it ’s not time to start looking for a pro-Asian or pro-Indian bias .
We need to stop looking for ways to avoid unpleasant truths .
Some cultures excel at raising children who succeed , and some cultures do not .
The longer we choose to avert our eyes from this painful fact , the more harm we do in the name of equality .
This simply has to stop . ::

WASHINGTON 
On the plane , no longer Air Force One but now Special Air Mission 28000 , they talked about the speech .
George W. Bush , the former president , was heading home to Texas with his inner circle , having just left the Capitol , where his successor first thanked him for his service and then proceeded to discredit it .
The Bush team had worked assiduously to make the transition smooth for the incoming President Obama and stayed out of the way as he used the postelection period to take leadership of the economy even before being sworn in .
And now , as far as some of them were concerned , the new president had used his inaugural lectern to give the back of the hand to a predecessor who had been nothing but gracious to him .
“ There were a few sharp elbows that really rankled and I felt were not as magnanimous as the occasion called for , ” Karen Hughes , a longtime Bush confidante , said in an interview .
“ He really missed an opportunity to be as big as the occasion was and , frankly , as gracious as President Bush was as he left office . ”
Dan Bartlett , another top adviser , used similar language .
“ It was a missed opportunity to bring some of the president ’s loyal supporters into the fold , ” he said .
Marc A . Thiessen , the chief White House speechwriter until this week , added : “ It was an ungracious inaugural .
It was pretty clear he was taking shots . ”

Gonzo Filmmakers in Action The Yes Men 's Brilliant Plan to Fix the World
Can ridiculous inflatable costumes and anti-corporate publicity stunts save the world ?
The PR guerillas known as the Yes Men hope so .
In Berlin to promote their new film , the duo sat down with SPIEGEL ONLINE to talk about their unique form of political activism .
This site has been created to provide a forum for gay men , lesbians and their families and friends to share their stories .
The common denominator is Mormonism with the hope that those who are journeying therein will feel less alone after reading these stories .
For many decades now the Mormon Church has provided a less than hospitable environment for its gay and lesbian members , leaving most of us to find our own way out of the confusion , condemnation and guilt .
It can be a pretty lonely road and sometimes just knowing that somebody else is going through the same things we are helps make the journey a little easier .
Rather than going to battle with the Mormon Church over its beliefs and practices this site focuses on the first - person narratives of those who are impacted by it all .
Sometimes we get so caught up in the doctrine that we forget the human toll involved in a one - size - fits - all plan .
Hopefully these stories will help put a more human face on the complex issues of religion and sexuality and generate a greater feeling of acceptance and understanding .
Some of the stories you read here may not always use people 's real names for obvious reasons .
In some instances , authors may choose to remain anonymous because they 're not yet out to family , friends or the church .
In an ideal world none of this would be necessary - but we 're still worki ng on the ideal world thing and until we get it figured out name changes and anonymity are sometimes necessary .
Your story is welcome here if you feel inclined to share it .
Please click on the appropriate link for more details .
In the meantime , have a look around and catch a glimpse of what life is all about for those of us who have been or still are , gay and Mormon .

Injuries could have a lasting effect on Palestinian children , doctors say
By Heather Sharp
BBC News , Jerusalem
The pictures keep coming .
The blood - spattered young faces , the glazed eyes , the limp small bodies .
The latest figures from Palestinian health officials say 205 children are among some 600 people who have died in the Gaza war .
In the chaos , there are no statistics for how many are among the at least 2,900 injured .
As medics work flat out to save as many young lives as they can , child psychiatrists in both Gaza and southern Israel fear some children will never recover from the psychological damage done as the bombs , shells and rockets fall .
Dr Iyad Sarraj , director of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme , says " so many people " are telephoning his workers - although the organisation 's headquarters lies abandoned with shattered windows and broken furniture after it was damaged in an Israeli air strike .
" It 's really terrible for children here now , " he says .
" I have been through so many of these kinds of things and this is the worst . "
Long - term impact
He talks of a boy he treated five years ago .
Grappling in the dark after his house was hit in an air strike on a Hamas militant next door , he felt something wet .
" He realised it was the flesh of his sister who was blown into pieces .
He was in such a state .
He could n't eat or smell meat for three years after that .
I am sure he will suffer some kind of long - term psychological impact , " Dr Sarraj says .
" This sort of thing must be happening right now as we speak . "
He can barely leave his home for fear of the fighting , and has been unable to visit the hospitals where he has watched television pictures of traumatised , badly injured children arriving .
" These children need help more than anyone .
They look frightened , horrified , bewildered .
They need a lot of attention but they can't receive it because their families are so terrified , " he says .

But the effects of the war are plain even among his own family .
His stepdaughter Nour Kharma , 14 , barely spoke in the days immediately after she heard her school friend and basketball partner , Christina , 15 had been killed in an Israeli airstrike .
" She was in such turmoil , in a depressive mood , in really bad shape .
She was always in tears , " he says .
" In the end I asked her to write about it . "
" [ When I heard , ] I threw the phone and started crying " Nour reads , in crisp English .
" Her parents did the best they can do .
But it was n't enough , so the result was dying .
What if my parents can't protect me ?
Will I die too ? "
She weeps quietly on the other end of the phone .
" I feel very sad .
I keep remembering her .
I really miss her , " she says simply .

Salwi Tibi of Save the Children , who lives in the north of Gaza City close to some of the most intense ground clashes , has also been monitoring the impact on children .
She talks of a two - and - a - half year old boy from Beit Lahiya , scene of heavy fighting , who was taken lifeless to the local hospital .
" He was not injured , his health was OK .
The doctors told me the child died because of the shock from the sound of the shelling , " she said .
And she thinks her own daughter , Malak , 7 , is typical of many children affected by the war .
Palestinian children have lived with a fear of sirens for months
She began wetting her bed on the first day of the airstrikes .
" Wherever I go she follows me - even to the bathroom .
As soon as she hears the shelling she puts her fingers in her ears , closes her eyes and shouts " stop them , stop them , " says Ms Tibi .
" She can't sleep alone , she wants to sleep close to me and she puts her arms around my neck . "
" If I had a computer I would let her listen to music and play games so she would forget , but there is no electricity , everything is silent , so all she can hear is shelling and bombing . "
It is exactly these symptoms that are also prevalent among the children of Sderot .
The Israeli town close to Gaza has been hit by many of the 10,000 Palestinian rockets fired into southern Israel over the past eight years .
Four people have been killed and 100 people injured in the region since the start of the air campaign .
No figures are available for the number of children , although one victim was a baby injured in the face .
Dalia Yosef , a psychotherapist and Director of the Resilience Centre , says her workload has increased with the rocket fire in the run-up to and during the war .
Any child under eight in the town has only known a life with just 15 seconds to reach shelter whenever the warning siren sounds .
" He has experienced the world as not safe - his house is not safe , his yard , his daycare centre is not safe it influences the whole circle of the child 's life , " she says .
Yossi Haimov , 10 , had gone out to play after school with his eight - year - old sister when he was hit by a qassam rocket in February 2008 .
" It splintered his hand and now he can't use it , " his father , Tashkent , said .
" The bone was completely destroyed from the shoulder down .
Only half of his shoulder is still there . "
" He is definitely still traumatised , " says Mr Haimov .
Previously a keen footballer , Yossi is no longer always outside with his friends .
" Now he 's scared all the time he 's afraid to get hurt or get knocked over .
Sometimes he gets very upset and nervous and he has panic attacks . "
Research from Sderot says about 30 % of children there show signs of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ; Mr Sarraj says about a third of Gazan children are suffering from psychological symptoms that needed intervention .
" Your mind does n't ask from where the stress is coming .
It does n't matter if you live in Sderot , Gaza or in New York .
This is the reaction of the human , " says Ms Yosef .

I have just been sent a beautiful hardback edition of the Origin of Species from Penguin , which not only has a cover design by Damian Hirst but a blurb from him too .
I do n't rate his words much more highly than his art , but in this case they actually have something to tell us : they are the clearest possible example of the use of Darwin as a religious object .
I know that out in the creation / evolution wars on the net , " Darwinism " is a term used by people who do n't understand evolutionary biology and who want to equate science with religion as alternate and competing ways of reaching the truth .
I am not trying to do that .
I think that science is a distinct mode of thought and practice and religion is n't and can turn almost anything to its purposes .
So I want to use " Darwinism " as a term meaning what people who do n't understand evolutionary biology think that it says , whether they 're for it or against it .
In this sense .
Hirst is clearly a Darwinist .
" Darwin 's idea , ' Evolution Through Natural Selection ' actually explains the
meaning of life ; " Hirst writes .
He continues , spattering commas in his excitement : " it is the biggest single idea ever , its breadth and scope enormous , its means so perfectly economic , its capacity to shock and excite persist , to this day . "
I do n't want to draw attention to his rhythmic alternation between hyperbole and horseshit .
That 's common to all sorts of advertising prose .
What 's interesting is that the attributes of overwhelming power and perfection which he ascribes to natural selection are those which once would be applied to God , and , after God failed , were applied to Art.
Hirst and his friends , if they are Artists , stand as a pretty final testimony to the failure of Art to connect us to transcendent truth ; so what remains but science ?
The connection is made quite explicit in the next section of Hirst 's blurb :
Such emotion and passion over a search for essential truth is also the substance of Art , such belief and relevance its goal .
The myriad ways of understanding and expressing the beauty of life are a constant inspiration .
There 's an infinite number of ways to get to the same point .
A scientific theory is being bent here here into doing something that it simply cannot manage to .
Hirst 's Darwinism has nothing to do with evolutionary biology .
Natural selection does n't and could n't explain the meaning of life except to point out that death is essential to the process .
Life is individual and the only measure of success that natural selection offers is posthumous : to have as many descendants as possible .
Hirst 's encomium might make more sense if it were taken as praise of the book , rather than the theory of evolution by natural selection .
The Origin is a splendid book , and Darwin was a very good writer .
But that has nothing to do with the merit of his theory , which would be just as true if only Wallace had discovered it – and who reads Wallace today ?
But in this too it is an example of Darwinism – which is distinct from evolutionary biology – becoming a quasi- religious cult .
The emulation of Darwin 's heroic virtue and his passionate search for truth in science replaces the emulation of holy men and their search for truth in god .
Is this really progress ?
I think it might be or it would be if the practice of science could ever become as widespread as the practice of prayer .
Behaving as scientists are supposed to do – looking humbly and devotedly for the truth wherever it may be found – is a morally good thing .
But there 's no reason to suppose that science ever will in fact become a mass pursuit .
All the figures that we have suggest that it is a less and less popular career path .
And treating Darwin , or any other scientist , as a wonder - worker just turns science into a priesthood .
That does n't do anyone any good , neither scientists nor the rest of us .
Darwin was a good man and his theory was a great one .
But believing it , even understanding it , wo n't make the goodness and the greatness rub off on the believers .
In December of 2006 , Mexico 's new President Felipe CalderÃ³n declared war on the drug cartels , reversing earlier government passiveness .
Since then , the government has made some gains , but at a heavy price - gun battles , assasinations , kidnappings , fights between rival cartels , and reprisals have resulted in over 9,500 deaths since December 2006 - over 5,300 killed last year alone .
President Barack Obama recently announced extra agents were being deployed to the border and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton heads to Mexico today to pursue a broad diplomatic agenda - overshadowed now by spiraling drug violence and fears of greater cross - border spillover .
Officials on both sides of the border are committed to stopping the violence , and stemming the flow of drugs heading north and guns and cash heading south .

Two orb - weaving spiders sit in the middle of their respective , symmetrical webs aboard the International Space Station on Nov. 20 , 2008 .
An intrepidspider may have survived the long months at the International Space Station , with scientists eager to know for sure once it returns to Earth aboard thespace shuttle Discovery .
Thearachnid , one of twoorb weaving spiders sent to the station last November , is due to land withDiscovery ?s astronaut crew in Florida on Saturday afternoon .
The spiders , and somebutterfly larvae , are part of an educational experiment with students on Earthto compare their developmentin zero gravity with their counterparts on Earth .
? Everybodyis rooting for the spider , ?
NASA ?s station program scientist Julie Robinsontold SPACE.com Thursday .
Spacestation astronauts named the spiders Elmo and Spiderman and checked in on themfrom time to time during their months in orbit .
The arachnids are the same asthe spider " Charlotte " in the children 's book " Charlotte ' sWeb " by E.B.
White .
? The spiderhabitat was very hard to see inside because there were quite a bit of fruit flycarcasses , as you might expect from a hungry spider , ?
station commander MichaelFincke radioed Mission Control this week as he packed the spider and butterflylarvae habitats for Discovery ?
sWednesday departure .
? Spiderman and Elmo are on their way home .?
As of February , scientists knew that at least one of the spiders was still alivebecause they saw it in a camera that was watchingthe two arachnids , Robinson said .
But it was hard to see through the websinside the enclosure to learn the second spider ?s fate , she added .
The PaintedLady butterfly larvae did not fare as well .
Of the manylarvae sent to the station - in a different enclosure than the spiders - onlytwo managed to form a chrysalis but neither emerged as a butterfly , Robinsonsaid .
In the months since they launched , the nectar provided as their food hadturned moldy , Fincke said .
? That ?s notnecessarily surprising because developmental biology is affected by microgravity , ?Robinson said .
But even on Earth , trying to cultivate butterflies is tricky , soit is difficult to know for sure , she added .
BioServeSpace Technologies of the University of Colorado in Boulder is overseeing thespider and butterfly experiment , with scientists planning to open the twohabitats for the first time on Sunday .
It is one of several efforts to encourage studentinterest in science , technology and math by through space station science , Robinson said .
There isalso an added bonus , she added .
Anothergroup of scientists is interested in the dead fruit flies used to feed Elmo and Spiderman .
Initially launched as spider chow , the flies appeared to havemultiplied over time to give the spiders a steady food supply .
Robinsonsaid it turned into an accidental experiment in long - duration , multi- generational fruit fly spaceflight .
? Theremight be a possibility that there may be a live fruit fly alive in there and they ?ll be looking for that , ? she said .
Discovery undockedfrom the space station on Wednesday and is poised to land Saturday at NASA ?
sKennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral , Fla. , to end a 13 - day mission .
Whilethe spiders spun their webs inside the station , the astronauts performed threespacewalks to add thelast pair of U.S. solar arrays to the station , boosting it to full power .
They alsoswapped out one crewmember , NASA astronaut Sandra Magnus , who arrived at thestation last November with the spiders .
It was students from Magnus ?s hometownof Belleville , Ill. , who suggested the names Elmo and Spiderman .
As for thespiders themselves , scientists are hopeful but only time will tell .
? A spidercan live a long time , ?
Robinson said , adding that arachnids can also slow theirmetabolism to survive .
?
They can hang in there .?

Amazon and the " Author 's Guild " Reach a Cute Little Agreement About the Kindle 's Text - To - Speech
In an effort to retain good relations with the mysterious " Author 's Guild " that supposedly represents the world 's fiction writers , Amazon has decided to go ahead and let the rightsholders of Kindle books decide whether or not to allow the Kindle to read books aloud in an uninflected , demonic robot voice .
If rightsholders do n't want the Kindle to do this , they can turn the feature off for their specific title .
While I hate both the Kindle and Amazon , I disagree with the " Author 's Guild " about this issue in a big way , and , with this decision , the " Author 's Guild " only succeeds in making writers look selfish and cruel .
The only GOOD thing about the new Kindle is its easy - to - use text - to - speech feature , which potentially allows blind people to consume first - run editions of books for the same price that other people get them without having to wait for the Braille edition .
Only big bestsellers ever make it to the audio book market .
A dead robot reading fiction does not constitute a professional performance .
There are a million shitty text - to - speech programs out there that have been around for decades .
My favorite was the " Talking Moose " for the Apple Macintosh , a program we used to fuck around with in elementary school to our endless delight .
The only reason Amazon has done this deal is to nod to the " Author 's Guild " as a sovereign body that represents writers , because the " Author 's Guild " has already proven that they can be bought and have neither spine nor sense Crowning the " Author 's Guild " as the designated spokesperson for writers everywhere is like the U.N. asking Taiwan what China thinks .
They are only going to say something crazy and then ask for money and tanks .
Who is the " Author 's Guild ? "
Do they have a Guildhall ?
How do you frag the leader ?
Where will he respawn ?
Will he respawn next to the rocket launcher ?
If so , we should snipe him there before he can rocketjump to safety and then get armor .
I do n't trust that " Author 's Guild . "
Imagine an inoculation that a soldier could take within an hour or two of witnessing a particularly traumatic wartime event .
If there was a drug to prevent flashbacks from occurring later on , most soldiers would probably take it .
Call it an Anti-PTSD drug .
But what if that drug was n’t a drug at all , but a simple computer game you could equip every military unit with on the front lines ?
Yes , researchers who did an analogue study on 40 undergraduates suggest that the old computer game Tetris can actually help prevent future post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) flashbacks .
Here ’s their theory :
Our theory is based on two key findings : 1 ) Cognitive science suggests that the brain has selective resources with limited capacity ;
2 ) The neurobiology of memory suggests a 6 - hr window to disrupt memory consolidation .
The rationale for a ‘ cognitive vaccine ’ approach is as follows : Trauma flashbacks are sensory - perceptual , visuo - spatial mental images .
Visuo - spatial cognitive tasks selectively compete for resources required to generate mental images .
Thus , a visuo - spatial computer game ( e.g. “ Tetris ” ) will interfere with flashbacks .
Their findings ?
After leaving the laboratory , participants then kept a daily diary in which they recorded their flashbacks to the trauma film over a period of 1 - week .
Crucially , we found that participants [ who played 10 minutes of Tetris ] experienced significantly fewer flashbacks over the week than those [ who did n’t ] .
Furthermore , at 1 - week , participants returned to the laboratory and participants in the game condition had significantly lower scores on the measure of clinical symptomatology of trauma .
Playing Tetris appeared to interfere with the brain ’s ability to form a significant visuo - spatial memory of the traumatic event .
Such memories are an important component to flashbacks .
No such memories means a reduced likelihood of future flashbacks .
The limitations of the study are many — undergrads , not real trauma ( the students watched a 12 minute film ) , and only a 1 week followup .
So it ’s hard to say whether these findings would be robust enough to actually work on real trauma experienced firsthand by an individual , versus a movie watching in a college laboratory .
But if confirmed , the findings would suggest that we could help prevent ( or perhaps at the very least , reduce ) the likelihood of future flashbacks ( and perhaps full - blown PTSD ) by simply having soldiers play specific video games like Tetris as soon as they return to the safety of their camp .
This may possibly be a great prevention method for anyone exposed to a traumatic event if the findings hold up .
A hospital ER could be equipped with computer terminals ( or Nintendo DSs ) with Tetris on them , with one possible treatment for psychological trauma victims being an emergency “ course ” of Tetris .
It ’ll be interesting to see if this research holds up under further study , as it would be a ground - breaking intervention for a preventative treatment for PTSD .

IT IS 150 years since the publication of Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution , which suggested that all living things are related and that everything is ultimately descended from a single common ancestor .
This has troubled many , including Darwin himself , as it subverted ideas of divine intervention .
It is not surprising that the countries least accepting of evolution today tend to be the most devout .
In the most recent international survey available , only Turkey is less accepting of the theory than America .
Iceland and Denmark are Darwin 's most ardent adherents .
Indeed America has become only slightly more accepting of Darwin 's theory in recent years .
In 2008 14 % of people polled by Gallup agreed that “ man evolved over millions of years ” , up from 9 % in 1982 .

Take Action : DIRECTV Censors Our Gaza Strip TV Ad !
February 3rd , 2009
Thanks to a generous emergency grant from Cultures of Resistance , we produced a 30 - second commercial about the U.S. role in Israel s war on and siege of the Gaza Strip .
We thought ,  What better way to bring this important information to the attention of people in the United States than to advertise nationally on DIRECTV ? the largest satellite television subscription service in the country .
After detailed discussions with DIRECTV , including agreement on rates , times , and network placements of the ad , when we gave them the final product , they abruptly decided not to do business with us .
This blatant act of censorship is preventing millions of U.S. households from learning the truth about our governments crucial role in enabling Israel s war on and siege of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip .
IN THE NEWS DIRECTV 's censorship of our ad on Gaza has become a news story .
Check out the following stories :

The Agence France - Presse is reporting that Serge Foucher , president of Sony France , is being held “ hostage ” by angry workers whose plant is about to close .
“ He wo n’t listen to us , we did n’t find any other solution , ” said the union spokesman .
Foucher had come to the video tape manufacturing plant at Pontonx - sur - l ' Adour in southwest France to meet with the 311 workers one more time before the plant ’s closure .
Unhappy with the the compensation offered , the workers barricaded the entry with tree trunks late Thursday night .
Look , times are tough , but let ’s be civil , ok ?
Besides , demand for video tapes is certainly not at risk .

Nagatani-en ( 永谷園 ) have released their first range of “ function orientated ” miso soups .
A number of makers have been selling miso soup products with vitamins included , but Nagatani - en claim they are the first to successfully mix the amino acid ornithine ( オルニチン ) .
In food groups , ornithine is most commonly found in Shijimi ( シジミ ) and so not surprisingly the miso soup made by Nagatani- en has plenty of Shijimi , as well as a dash of negi ( ネギ ) .
The packaging states that each cup contains 70 times the power of shijimi , in the form of ornithine .
The miso soup is said to be good for hangovers and the packaging specifically shows a beer glass with the words “ For people who like their drink ” .
Shijimi has long been known by Japanese to assist the bodies natural recovery process and to aid with hangovers .
The website WhatJapanThinks covered this in a survey some time ago :
http://whatjapanthinks.com/2006/04/14/hangover-cures-in-japan/
Whilst not a lot of information is available on Ornithine , Nagatani - en on their own website state the following :
＜ 「 オルニチン」とは＞
アミノ酸の一種で、身体のあらゆるところで私たちの健康維持に重要な働きをします。一般の食材にはあまり含まれていませんが、比較的しじみに多く含まれることが知られています。
Roughly translated , Ornithine is a type of amino acid , that performs an important function to help maintain the health of our bodies in a number of ways .
It is not found in many common foods , but comparitivley has large quantities in shijimi .
Nagatani-en and other makers are expected to release more soup , ramen and other instant food products containing vitamin supplements and other health promoting nutrient supplements .
The current product is on sale only at convenience stores .
When convenience stores first started popping up in central Tokyo , there was a lot of research being conducted by companies on how to keep food fresh for longer periods of time .
Now some of that research seems to be moving towards how to provide healthier food through supplements and additives .
Tokyo Beer & Bloggers Event
Tomorrow evening at 7 pm there is a meeting for all Bloggers in Japan who want to attend the first Beer & Blog in Tokyo .
It will be held in Shibuya .
Details can be found by clicking here .
Recommend everyone buy their Shijimi Miso soup first before going to the event .

Do you have a yen to see the world , but want to have an authentic experience while doing some good ?
Then volunteering abroad may be just what you 've been looking for .
With travel and volunteerism going hand in hand in recent years , it is understandable if there is confusion among terms .
There is , in fact , more than one way to combine traveling and doing good .
Here are the main categories you should be thinking about .
Voluntourism Growing Rapidly
Voluntourism encompasses vacation travel that has some component of volunteer work .
An example is the service learning programs by Road Scholar .
One program sends participants to teach children in India .
The travelers receive education about the area , its history , and its people .
In off hours , they might go on field trips , visit a museum , and hear lectures .
Usually , travelers in such programs can deduct some of the expenses of the journey as a charitable deduction on their tax returns .
Voluntourism opportunities may be as short as a week or take place over several months .
The best voluntourism opportunities involve participants in the volunteer work for the majority of the time , are prearranged with the community being helped and make sure that help is being rendered in a culturally sensitive way .
Think service first , vacation second when picking an opportunity .
I think the safest voluntourism opportunities are provided by long - established nonprofits .
Think about your particular passion , such as the environment , poverty , education , or health .
Then check out domestic and international charities that work in those areas .
See if they have volunteer opportunities available .
Do n't neglect voluntourism programs right in the U.S. too .
Habitat for Humanity , for instance , welcomes volunteers throughout the U.S. as well as overseas .
The United Nations has volunteer opportunities of all kinds , including local and abroad .
To whittle down your web search , check into services that track volunteer opportunities , such as VolunteerForever or Go Eco .
There are many program reviews and opportunities right on their sites .
Why You Should Be Happy to Help Pay for Arranged Volunteering
Many of us , when we first think about volunteering , believe that it should be enough that we give our time .
Why should we pay for the privilege of volunteering ?
The truth is that it is commonplace to pay your expenses when you volunteer abroad .
Those costs include airfare , meals , and lodging .
In the world of crowdfunding , it is even possible to convince friends and family or even strangers to fund your volunteer travel .
At Volunteer World , for instance , you can both find a volunteer opportunity and raise funds for your trip with its fundmytravel community marketplace .
This type of volunteering is called " arranged volunteering . "
It is usually done through an organized program that makes arrangements with nonprofits ( commonly known as NGOs or Non-Governmental Organizations ) in the country where you volunteer .
What 's the advantage of this arranged volunteering ?
It is more volunteer focused .
If you want to drop the tourism from your volunteering , arranged volunteering is the way to go .
You 'll get a more immersive experience in the culture , hone your skills , and come away with an in - depth knowledge of people , cultures , and social problems .
Even though you do pay for your travel , accommodations , and meals , there are a lot of benefits that you receive from the organization you work with .
These include orientation , language , and technical training , a safe and supportive place to live , a safety net through staff that provides logistical support and even counseling , clear expectations for the work you will do , and affordability .
It will be cheaper to travel to a foreign country with an organization that handles most of the details than it would be if you tried to do it on your own .
There are many organizations that arrange these volunteer opportunities .
They have developed a network of NGOs to work with and have put support structures into place so that volunteers can do their best work with a minimum of confusion as soon as they arrive at their destination .
Often , the costs you pay are packaged into one fee to make it even easier to participate .
Arranged volunteering usually means that you will live under conditions that are common to the people in that country .
You may stay with a local family for instance .
You are likely to work in some human service capacity or with a humanitarian aid project .
You may be required to have some language skills or have expertise such as economic development or teaching .
It is not always easy to separate " arranged volunteering " from " voluntourism . "
Many opportunities fall somewhere in between these two types of volunteering .
One advantage of these volunteer placements is that you may be able to take a tax deduction for most of the expenses you incur .
Young people flock to these types of opportunities but arranged volunteering has also become very popular among retirees , baby boomers , and mature travelers of all kinds .
It is easy to see why .
Mature adults may have disposable income , they often have a wish to contribute in some way , and they certainly have a travel bug .
Many organizations that set up international volunteer opportunities actively recruit older people .
Here is a list of organizations that provide arranged volunteer opportunities or that will lead you to additional resources .
Philanthropic Travel for Donors Who Want Hands - On Knowledge
Philanthropic travel , on the other hand , usually means that a philanthropist , considering a substantial charitable gift , visits the possible recipient .
The purpose of the trip can be research , to get to know the recipient better , to establish an ongoing relationship , or to reassure oneself that the gift is worthwhile .
Often philanthropic advisory organizations facilitate charitable travel .
They might send a donor or a group of donors to an international project that is a good candidate for significant support .
The philanthropist is not volunteering his / her service but establishing a trust for himself and the recipient organization so that a donation can be made .
Some nonprofits that work internationally provide opportunities for potential donors to visit their projects .
For instance , Room to Read arranges " site visits " for interested donors while Soles4Souls arranges group shoe distribution trips for donors and volunteers .
Potential Downsides to Combining Travel and Volunteering
While we usually approach travel with the idea of having fun , learning , or exploring , volunteering may require a different mindset .
For one , there likely wo n't be much time for relaxing .
It 's more like a job than a vacation .
Count on working most of every weekday and confining your sightseeing to weekends .
Volunteering takes commitment , which can be hard to come by since you 're not getting paid .
But , treating your volunteer job like a paid job pays off in the end because you 'll know you gave it your best , physically and emotionally .
Volunteering abroad will be challenging , more than you probably think .
You 'll be in new surroundings , perhaps without the modern conveniences of home .
even a different language .
You 'll have to be patient , resourceful , and committed to making a difference .
Whatever we call travel for good , it is a growing trend and is especially appealing to those who enjoy combining helping , learning and somewhat exotic traveling .
The rewards , as anyone who has volunteered abroad will tell you , are immeasurable and result in memories for a lifetime .
A CHRISTIAN school in Werribee has been forced to defend its refusal to offer a training placement to a Muslim teaching student on the grounds of her religion .
Victoria University student Rachida Dahlal has reportedly lodged a complaint with the Equal Opportunity Commission against Heathdale Christian College , accusing it of discrimination and prejudice .
But the faith - based private school stood by its decision last night .
It said it would have been " inappropriate " to offer the student a placement because of the school 's Christian ethos .
Principal Reynald Tibben said Mrs Dahlal - who wears a head scarf and is a devout Muslim - may have found it difficult to work at a school where the teachers ' morning staff briefing includes prayer devotion and Bible reading .
" The way we practise our education is not just nominal , it 's actually what parents want for their kids , and it would have been confusing for the kids .
It 's not that we have anything against her or her beliefs , we just felt it was an inappropriate placement , " Mr Tibben said .
History has told us all but frequently we forget about the hardship experienced by generations past , especially during certain wars .
However , some people have a very creative and profound way of reflecting on times gone by , presenting their take on the world in a new light .
Hopefully our children and future generation will still remember that comfortable life they get is coming from bloodshed of people in the past .
These haunting , hybrid images of past and present St Petersburg – formerly known as Leningrad – are the works of Sergei Larenkov .
After studying old images of the city , Larenkov visited the same spots , capturing them on film .
He then digitally superimposed the old image over new , producing these eerie and thought - provoking shots using remakable photoshop technique .
Like ghosts captured forever on film the scenes depict all too clearly a harshness that can result only from times of war .
The 900 - day Siege of Leningrad , also known as The Leningrad Blockade , lasted from September 9 , 1941 , to January 27 , 1944 – just over 65 years ago – and was “ one of the longest and most destructive sieges of major cities in modern history , and second most costly , ” according to Wikipedia sources .
<
Although the blend of the two images seems natural , it ’s hard not to ignore the colorful boundary of the present and focus totally on the black and white scene of the past .
Each image demands the viewer to stop and contemplate what life must have been like in Leningrad during World War II .
The difference between life now and then in these moving images is distinct , and deserves the attention of an undoubtedly more privileged audience .

For any other compound form for which the operator is a symbol f , the setf form expands into a call to the function named ( setf f ) .
The first argument in the newly constructed function form is newvalue and the remaining arguments are the remaining elements of place .
This expansion occurs regardless of whether f or ( setf f ) is defined as a function locally , globally , or not at all .
For example ,
( setf ( f arg1 ar g2 ... ) new - value )
expands into a form with the same effect and value as
( let ( ( # : temp - 1 arg1 ) ; force correct order of evaluation

( funcall ( function ( setf f ) ) #:temp - 0 #:temp - 1 #:temp - 2... ) )
A function named ( setf f ) must return its first argument as its only value in order to preserve the semantics of setf .

Yesterday I wanted to wrap a library ' smethod in anothermethod that I was writing , but I was n't sure how to directly call the other library ' smethod .
Say I have the following : Then if I macroexpand the call to ( using SBCL ) : I get the following ( with some cleaning up of the gensyms ) : That function argumentlooks pretty strange , so I tried finding out what is going on here .
After a lot of research , here 's what I found .
From the HyperSpec , has the following syntax :
The glossary entry for ' function designator ' is n't too helpfulSinceis clearly not a symbol , it must be a function , but that 's certainly a weird way to designate a function .
The entry for " extended function designator " is n't by itself any more useful , but provides a small clue :
The key here is " function name " : Additionally , there 's also these entries : Aha !
So the only two ways to specify a function name is with a symbol ( the case we 're all familiar with ) or the listSo , we 're pretty close .
The list ( is afunction name .
You 'll note thattakes a function designator and not an extended function designator , that is , it takes functions , not function names .
Of course , the way to get from function names to functions is to use the function " function " or the better know reader macro .
Thus , we finally have , which is equivilent to ( no quote needed forbecauseis a special operator .
So , if you type , you 'll get back something like
The final oddity is the ordering of the arguments , it appears to beThis is explained in the sections explaining how setf expansion works :
Putting the new value first allows everything following to look just like the call to the accessing function , even if it has lots of additional lambda keyword arguments , for examplebeing transformed into something likeAnyway , I was able to successfully call the other library ' smethod by following the above example .
My final thoughts , I have aamount of respect for the people able to read between the lines of the spec and be able to correctly implement all of the nooks and crannies of Common Lisp .
