Instead of working together to reach the promised land of online brand advertising , Facebook and Google are racing to see who can get there first . *

Page should have been in a good mood .
It was the fall of 2007 , and Google 's cofounder was in the middle of a five - day tour of his company 's European operations in Zurich , London , Oxford , and Dublin .
The trip had been fun , a chance to get a ground - floor look at Google 's ever - expanding empire .
But this week had been particularly exciting , for reasons that had nothing to do with Europe ; Google was planning a major investment in Facebook , the hottest new company in Silicon Valley .
Originally Google had considered acquiring Facebook — a prospect that held no interest for Facebook 's executives — but an investment was another enticing option , aligning the Internet 's two most important companies .
Facebook was more than a fast - growing social network .
It was , potentially , an enormous source of personal data .
Internet users behaved differently on Facebook than anywhere else online :
They used their real names , connected with their real friends , linked to their real email addresses , and shared their real thoughts , tastes , and news .
Google , on the other hand , knew relatively little about most of its users other than their search histories and some browsing activity .
But now , as Page took his seat on the Google jet for the two - hour flight from Zurich to London , something appeared to be wrong .
He looked annoyed , one of his fellow passengers recalls .
It turned out that he had just received word that the deal was off .
Microsoft , Google 's sworn enemy , would be making the investment instead — $ 240 million for a 1.6 percent stake in the company , meaning that Redmond valued Facebook at an astonishing $ 15 billion .
As the 767 took off , Page tersely but calmly shared the news with the others on the plane and answered their questions for about 15 minutes .
" Larry was clearly , clearly unhappy about it , " the passenger says .
Page soon got over it , but Facebook 's rejection was still a blow to Google ; it had never lost a deal this big and this publicly .
But according to Facebookers involved in the transaction , Mountain View never had much of a chance — all things being equal , Microsoft was always the favored partner .
Google 's bid was used primarily as a stalking horse , a tool to amp up the bidding .
Facebook executives were n't leaping at the chance to join with Google ; they preferred to conquer it .
" We never liked those guys , " says one former Facebook engineer .
" We all had that audacity , ' Anything Google does , we can do better . '
No one talked about MySpace or the other social networks .
We just talked about Google . "
Today , the Google - Facebook rivalry is n't just going strong , it has evolved into a full - blown battle over the future of the Internet — its structure , design , and utility .
For the last decade or so , the Web has been defined by Google 's algorithms — rigorous and efficient equations that parse practically every byte of online activity to build a dispassionate atlas of the online world .
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg envisions a more personalized , humanized Web , where our network of friends , colleagues , peers , and family is our primary source of information , just as it is offline .
In Zuckerberg 's vision , users will query this " social graph " to find a doctor , the best camera , or someone to hire — rather than tapping the cold mathematics of a Google search .
It is a complete rethinking of how we navigate the online world , one that places Facebook right at the center .
In other words , right where Google is now .
All this brave talk might seem easy to dismiss as the swagger of an arrogant upstart .
After all , being Google is a little like being heavyweight champion of the world — everyone wants a shot at your title .
But over the past year , Facebook has gone from glass - jawed flyweight to legitimate contender .
It has become one of the most popular online destinations .
More than 200 million people — about one - fifth of all Internet users — have Facebook accounts .
They spend an average of 20 minutes on the site every day .
Facebook has stolen several well - known Google employees , from COO Sheryl Sandburg to chef Josef Desimone ; at least 9 percent of its staff used to work for the search giant .
And since last December , Facebook has launched a series of ambitious initiatives , designed to make the social graph an even more integral part of a user 's online experience .
Even some Googlers concede that Facebook represents a growing threat .
" Eventually , we are going to collide , " one executive says .
It is remarkable that the most powerful company on the Web would feel threatened by one that has yet to turn a profit .
( Last year , one insider estimates , Facebook burned through $ 75 million plus the $ 275 million in revenue it brought in ; Google made $ 4.2 billion on an astounding $ 15.8 billion in net revenue . )
And even Facebook executives concede that Google has secured an insurmountable lead in search advertising — those little text ads that pop up next to search results — which accounts for about 90 percent of Google 's net revenue .
But they say they are going after an even bigger market : the expensive branding campaigns that so far have barely ventured online .
Once , Google hoped an alliance with Facebook would help attract those huge ad budgets .
Now , instead of working together to reach the promised land of online brand advertising , Facebook and Google are racing to see who can get there first .
Like typical trash - talking youngsters , Facebook sources argue that their competition is old and out of touch .
" Google is not representative of the future of technology in any way , " one Facebook veteran says .
" Facebook is an advanced communications network enabling myriad communication forms .
It almost does n't make sense to compare them . "
FACEBOOK'S
4 - Step Plan
for Online Domination
Mark Zuckerberg has never thought of his company as a mere social network .
He and his team are in the middle of a multiyear campaign to change how the Web is organized — with Facebook at the center .
Here 's how they hope to pull it off .
1. Build critical mass .
In the eight months ending in April , Facebook has doubled in size to 200 million members , who contribute 4 billion pieces of info , 850 million photos , and 8 million videos every month .
The result : a second Internet , one that includes users ' most personal data and resides entirely on Facebook 's servers .
2. Redefine search .
Facebook thinks its members will turn to their friends — rather than Google 's algorithms — to navigate the Web .
It already drives an eyebrow - raising amount of traffic to outside sites , and that will only increase once Facebook Search allows users to easily explore one another 's feeds .
3. Colonize the Web .
Thanks to a pair of new initiatives — dubbed Facebook Connect and Open Stream — users do n't have to log in to Facebook to communicate with their friends .
Now they can access their network from any of 10,000 partner sites or apps , contributing even more valuable data to Facebook 's servers every time they do it .
_ _4 . Sell targeted ads , everywhere .
__
Facebook hopes to one day sell advertising across all of its partner sites and apps , not just on its own site .
The company will be able to draw on the immense volume of personal data it owns to create extremely targeted messages .
The challenge : not freaking out its users in the process .
To understand Facebook 's challenge to Google , consider my friend and neighbor Wayne , a PhD in computer science from UC Berkeley and a veteran of many big - time programming jobs .
I know a lot about him because we are friends .
I know even more because we are Facebook friends .
On his online profile , I not only find the standard personal - blog - type information — his birthday , address , résumé , and pictures of his wife , son , and step - kids .
I also discover that he likes to make beer , that he had dinner at one of my favorite restaurants last week , and that he likes to watch cartoons .
Indeed , he has posted something about his life almost every day for the past two months — wondering whether his son's Little League game will get rained out , asking his friends what the impeller in his central heating unit does .
But if I type Wayne 's name into Google , I learn very little .
I am directed to an old personal Web site , with links that have almost all expired , and a collection of computer - science papers he has written over the years .
That 's about it .
Hardly any of Wayne 's Facebook information turns up on a Google search , because all of it , along with similar details about the other 200 million Facebook users , exists on the social network 's roughly 40,000 servers .
Together , this data comprises a mammoth amount of activity , almost a second Internet .
By Facebook 's estimates , every month users share 4 billion pieces of information — news stories , status updates , birthday wishes , and so on .
They also upload 850 million photos and 8 million videos .
But anyone wanting to access that stuff must go through Facebook ; the social network treats it all as proprietary data , largely shielding it from Google 's crawlers .
Except for the mostly cursory information that users choose to make public , what happens on Facebook 's servers stays on Facebook 's servers .
That represents a massive and fast - growing blind spot for Google , whose long - stated goal is to " organize the world 's information . "
Facebook is n't just kneecapping Google 's search engine ; it is also competing with it .
Facebook encourages its 200 million members to use Microsoft 's search engine , which it installed on its homepage late last year as part of the deal struck between the two companies .
At press time , it was also planning to launch Facebook Search , allowing users to scour one another 's feeds .
Want to see what some anonymous schmuck thought about the Battlestar Galactica finale ?
Check out Google .
Want to see what your friends had to say ?
Try Facebook Search .
And it will not only be for searching within Facebook .
Because Facebook friends post links to outside sites , you will be able to use it as a gateway to the Web — making it a direct threat to Google .
Why settle for articles about the Chrysler bankruptcy that the Google News algorithm recommends when you can read what your friends suggest ?
Already , Facebook is starting to horn in on Google 's role as the predominant driver of Web traffic .
According to Hitwise , Facebook in recent months has sent more traffic than Google to Evite , video site Tagged.com , and gossip mills Perez Hilton.com and Dlisted .
That trend should only grow with the advent of Facebook Search .
These are just the latest moves in an ambitious campaign to make the social graph an integral , ubiquitous element of life online .
In December , Facebook launched Connect , a network of more than 10,000 independent sites that lets users access their Facebook relationships without logging in to Facebook .com .
Go to Digg , for instance , and see which stories friends recommended .
Head to Citysearch and see which restaurants they have reviewed .
Visit TechCrunch , Gawker , or the Huffington Post and read comments they have left .
On Inauguration Day , millions of users logged in to CNN.com with their Facebook ID and discussed the proceedings with their friends in real time .
In April , Facebook announced its Open Stream API , allowing developers to create mashups using Facebook 's constantly updated stream of user activity .
Previously , users who wanted to read their friends '
News Feeds had to go to the Facebook site .
Now developers can export that information to any site — or to freestanding applications , much as Twitter desktop clients do for Tweets .
Connect and Open Stream do n't just allow users to access their Facebook networks from anywhere online .
They also help realize Facebook 's longtime vision of giving users a unique , Web - wide online profile .
By linking Web activity to Facebook accounts , they begin to replace the largely anonymous " no one knows you 're a dog " version of online identity with one in which every action is tied to who users really are .
To hear Facebook executives tell it , this will make online interactions more meaningful and more personal .
Imagine , for example , if online comments were written by people using their real names rather than by anonymous trolls .
" Up until now all the advancements in technology have said information and data are the most important thing , " says Dave Morin , Facebook 's senior platform manager .
" The most important thing to us is that there is a person sitting behind that keyboard .
We think the Internet is about people . "
But you do n't build a competitor to Google with people alone .
You need data .
And Connect and Open Stream are intended to make Facebook a much more powerful force for collecting user information .
Any time someone logs in to a site that uses Connect or Open Stream , they give Facebook the right to keep track of any activity that happens there — potentially contributing tons more personal data to Facebook 's servers .
Facebook Connect and Open Stream are also designed to make each user 's friend network , which belongs to Facebook , even more valuable and crucial to the Web experience .
Together , they aim to put Facebook users ' social networks at the center of all they do online .
Mark Zuckerberg is notoriously cocky , even by the standards of Silicon Valley .
Two years ago , he walked away from a reported nearly $ 1 billion offer from Yahoo for his company .
He could have sold to Google or Microsoft for a lot more .
His business cards once famously read : i'm ceo ... bitch .
And he has described Facebook as a once - in - a - century communications revolution , implying that he is right up there with Gutenberg and Marconi .
Still , you 'd think he might play it a little cool when discussing Google , not wanting to antagonize the most powerful company on the Internet .
But Zuckerberg does n't pull any punches , describing Google as " a top - down way " of organizing the Web that results in an impersonal experience that stifles online activity .
" You have a bunch of machines and algorithms going out and crawling the Web and bringing information back , " he says .
" That only gets stuff that is publicly available to everyone .
And it does n't give people the control that they need to be really comfortable . "
Instead , he says , Internet users will share more data when they are allowed to decide which information they make public and which they keep private .
" No one wants to live in a surveillance society , " Zuckerberg adds , " which , if you take that to its extreme , could be where Google is going . "
It 's ironic to hear Zuckerberg paint Google as Big Brother .
After all , many observers worry that Facebook itself has grown too controlling .
Unlike Google , Facebook makes it difficult for users to export their contacts , mail , photos , and videos — a practice Web 2.0 evangelists say is a sign that the company values its proprietary data more than its users ' experience .
In November 2007 , Facebook launched Beacon , a ham - fisted attempt to inject advertising into News Feeds .
Users felt violated ; after a month of protest , Zuckerberg publicly apologized and effectively shut Beacon down .
Then , in February 2009 , Facebook quietly changed its terms of service , appearing to give itself perpetual ownership of anything posted on the site , even after members closed their accounts .
Users complained so vociferously — millions joined Facebook groups and signed online petitions protesting the change — that the company was forced to backtrack .
The event left many people fearful of the amount of personal information they were ceding to a private , profit - hungry enterprise .
" Do You Own Facebook ? " a New York magazine cover story asked warily in April .
" Or Does Facebook Own You ? "
( Facebook executives say that the company was merely updating the terms of service to match those of other sites and that there was no nefarious intent .
They reinstated a version of the amendment after subjecting it to a vote of Facebook members . )

The drumbeat of controversy surrounding Facebook illustrates the catch - 22 the social network faces :
It has a massive storehouse of user data , but every time it tries to capitalize on that information , its members freak out .
This is n't an academic problem ; the company 's future depends on its ability to master the art of behavioral targeting — selling customized advertising based on user profiles .
In theory , this should be an irresistible opportunity for marketers ; Facebook 's performance advertising program allows them to design and distribute an ad to as narrow an audience as they would like .
( It has also developed a program to create ads that are designed to be spread virally . )
But as the Beacon debacle showed , there is a fine line between " targeted and useful " and " creepy and stalkerish " — and so far , not enough advertisers have been willing to walk that line .
In a way , Facebook 's dilemma extends from its success .
Users see the site as sanctified space , a place to engage in intimate conversations with friends — not to be laser - beamed by weirdly personal advertising .
But with initiatives like Connect and Open Stream , Facebook can sell ads beyond its own site .
Just as Google 's AdSense program sells ads on any participating Web site , Connect and Open Stream will eventually push Facebook - brokered advertising to any member site or app .
But unlike with AdSense , Facebook 's ads could be exquisitely tailored to their targets .
" No one out there has the data that we have , " says COO Sandberg .
That 's where the big - budget brand advertisers come in .
Google has courted them for four years , to no avail .
That 's because , while search ads are great at delivering advertising to users who are seeking specific products , they are less effective at creating demand for stuff users do n't yet know they want .
Google has tried everything to lure brand advertisers — from buying and selling radio ads to purchasing YouTube .
And it is easy to see why it keeps trying .
Today , global online brand advertising accounts for just $ 50 billion a year .
Offline brand advertising , meanwhile , accounts for an estimated $ 500 billion .
Google 's desire to crack the brand - advertising conundrum is so intense , some company executives have even considered swallowing their pride and pursuing another deal with Facebook .
But whether or not it ultimately friends the social network , Google has clearly been influenced by it .
On December 4 , the same day that Facebook Connect launched , Google unveiled its own version , Friend Connect , which allows Web sites to link to accounts on any of the major social networks — including MySpace , LinkedIn , Ning , Hi5 , and Bebo .
In March , four months after Facebook reportedly offered $ 500 million in a failed bid for Twitter , reports surfaced that Google was holding similar talks .
( A Google insider confirms the discussions . )
It is easy to see the appeal : Twitter is growing even faster than Facebook — doubling its membership in March — and would give Google access to the kind of personal information that fills Facebook News Feeds .
And Google recently announced Wave , a Web communications platform that encourages Facebook - like sharing and conversations .
The company even seems to have conceded Zuckerberg 's point about its impersonal search results .
In April , Google announced a plan to allow individuals to create detailed profiles that would show up whenever anyone searches for their name .
If they opt for this service — a big if —users gain greater control over how they are portrayed online , which will give them the incentive to share with Google the kind of personal information they had previously shared only with Facebook .
Google has even shown a willingness to join Facebook in gingerly tapping the third rail of Internet marketing — behavioral targeting .
The search giant has long assured its users that it would never use their personal information to deliver targeted advertising , relying instead on aggregate data or search activity that preserves anonymity .
( " There is a line with users that you do n't want to cross , " Google CEO Eric Schmidt said in the wake of the Beacon controversy . )
But in March , Google started its own behavioral targeting campaign — tracking users ' browsing to deliver more - customized ads .
Users have the option to either edit their profiles or opt out entirely .
In September 2007 , Gideon Yu was hired as Facebook 's CFO .
Before that , the 38 - year - old had been CFO at YouTube , where he negotiated its acquisition by Google .
He 'd also put in four years as Yahoo 's treasurer and was one of its top dealmakers .
Facebook announced the hire with much fanfare .
" I consider it kind of a coup that we were able to recruit him here , " Zuckerberg told the Wall Street Journal .
" He 's just excellent . "
Nineteen months later , Yu was gone .
It was a short tenure — not unprecedented for a private - company CFO .
But Zuckerberg turned
Yu's departure into a kerfuffle by publicly trashing him , saying that the job had simply outgrown him and that Facebook now needed a CFO with " substantial public company experience . "
To many , the performance was a stark reminder that the Facebook CEO , while undeniably ambitious and brilliant , was still just 24 years old .
( He 's 25 now . )
Zuckerberg 's youth has given Googlers some confidence .
After all , even under the most sage and steady leadership , Facebook would be confronted with a difficult challenge : turning a massive user base into a sustainable business .
( Just ask Friendster , MySpace , YouTube , and Twitter . )
Through Google 's own experience with YouTube , they have seen how expensive it can be to keep up with exploding user growth .
They inked a disastrous $ 900 million partnership with MySpace in 2006 , a failure that taught them how hard it is to make money from social networking .
And privately , they do n't think Facebook 's staff has the brainpower to succeed where they have failed .
" If they found a way to monetize all of a sudden , sure , that would be a problem , " says one highly placed Google executive .
" But they 're not going to . "
Facebook 's naysayers have a point .
But before they get too complacent , they might remember another upstart that figured out a new way to organize the Internet .
For five years , it worked on building its user base and perfecting its product , resisting pleas from venture capitalists to figure out how to make money .
It was only after it had made itself an essential part of everyone 's online life that its business path became clear — and it quickly grew to become one of the world 's most powerful and wealthy companies .
The name of that company , of course , was Google .

Future of Social Media : The Walls Come Crumbling Down
A former Chandler police officer who exchanged more than 13,000 texts and calls with his alter ego surrendered his officer certification last week , almost a year after a criminal investigation uncovered bizarre story and led him to resign .
The Arizona Peace Officer Standards and Training Board voted to accept an agreement Bradley Allen signed in late April that relinquished his certification as a police officer and barred him from ever working as a cop in the state again .
He served in the Chandler department for about 4� years .
Chandler police followed a series of tall tales last summer that began with Allen reporting his car stolen and a man named David Fowler sending his girlfriend , Nicole Latone , a text suggesting that something might happen to his 1992 black Honda Accord .
The man , he told Nicole , was his ex-girlfriend 's new beau and a man she cheated on him with leading to their split .
Latone told police Fowler had been harassing her and Allen and sending her crude text messages suggesting that he was following her .
When detectives searched Fowler 's phone records , they discovered he was using a prepaid phone that did not require a verification of the owner 's identity because it was not a subscription .
They could n't come up with any other form of biographical information on Fowler , including a state license .
Allen told his fellow Chandler cops that he had never met Fowler , 38 - year - old man with no middle name .
When officers interviewed the ex-girlfriend , Marcella Johnson , she said Allen ended their six - year relationship claiming she was cheating on him with Fowler , who was sending her and Allen text messages .
But when she hired two separate private investigators , both concluded Fowler did n't exist and was likely Allen acting out as the other man .
Police subpoenaed GPS coordinates for Fowler 's phone and found that most of the texts were sent through cell towers closest to Allen 's Chandler apartment , except for a series of calls in mid-July that came from California .
When police asked Latone , who was also starting to unravel the truth along with police , if Allen had been to California recently , she said no , but that she had and Allen gave her a cell phone to use when she got there .
She was given Fowler 's phone , investigators told her .
She said whenever Allen received a text or call from Fowler it would be while he was out of the room and not in her presence .
Police confronted Allen , first at Dillard 's where he was working extra duty as security , and later in an interview at the police station where they told him that they had GPS locations on the phone and asked him to call Fowler .
He did in the interview but it rang and went to voicemail .
The detectives then told Allen they had no choice but to charge him with false reporting .
He resigned from his post the next day , August 1 , before an internal affairs investigation could be completed .

For a while now , Bicycle Colorado has been distributing bumper stickers urging motorists to maintain a 3 - foot distance when passing cyclists .
Pretty soon , it could become state law .
Here ’s hoping it does .
Three feet is n’t too much to ask , is it ?
A new bicycle safety bill passed the Colorado House on Monday and went to the Senate , where it originated under the sponsorship of Sen.
Greg Brophy and passed in its original form , 27 - 6 .
If the Senate passes the version approved by the House , it goes to Gov. Bill Ritter .
Being 36 inches from a growling diesel driven by a guy who believes bicyclists do n’t belong on the road would still be an unnerving experience for cyclists , but making that buffer the law would make us feel a little safer , at least .
“ The current law is , basically , as long as you do n’t hit the bicyclist , it was considered a safe pass under the law , ” said Dan Grunig , executive director of Bicycle Colorado .
“ That ’s just not good enough .
That does n’t provide very clear instruction , very clear guidance for motorists . ”
The bill also would :
• Clarify language regarding lane positioning for bicyclists , requiring them to be as far right as is safe but giving them the right to move left as needed to avoid hazards such as potholes and broken glass .
It also would allow cyclists to ride in the left lane on one - way roads with more than one lane .
• Stipulate that bicyclists may ride two abreast if they are not “ impeding the normal and reasonable movement of traffic . ”
• Criminalize harassment by making it a misdemeanor to throw an object at a cyclist .
Driving in a threatening manner — swerving at cyclists or slamming on brakes in front of them — would be construed as a careless driving offense .
“ With changes to any traffic law , the big goal is to make the road safer , ” Grunig said .
“ We believe this bill really does that . ”
The 3 - foot restriction would allow motorists to cross the center line to maintain the lawful distance between them and a cyclist , as long as it is safe to do so .
The language in the bill regarding side - by - side cycling is a minor change from the current law , which says riders shall ride single file except when riding two abreast does not impede traffic .
I ’m not a big fan of side - by - side riding , whether I ’m on my bike or driving a car , but Grunig points out safety advantages .
“ One of the reasons most often cited by a motorist involved in a car - bike crash is that they never saw the cyclists , ” Grunig said .
“ When cyclists are two abreast , they ’re more visible . ”
I ’ve learned from experience that writing in defense of bicyclists and their safety is sure to generate all sorts of angry e-mails and phone calls excoriating bicyclists .
But most bicyclists I know are extremely careful and vigilant , in part because so many of us know bicyclists who were killed , paralyzed or otherwise seriously injured in accidents involving motor vehicles .
“ Bicyclists , because they ’re more vulnerable on the roads , are doing what they believe will make them as safe as possible , ” Grunig said .
“ They will not purposefully put themselves in harm ’s way . ”
And all those irate motorists so quick to criticize cyclists forget that bicyclists are usually motorists too .
The motorist who does n’t ride does n’t know how scary it can be to ride a bike in traffic , but bicyclists know what it ’s like to be behind the wheel of a car when cyclists are present .
“ It gets down to , are bikes equal vehicles ? ” Grunig said .
“ Do they have a right to be there ?
These are publicly owned right of ways .
Bicycles are defined as vehicles in Colorado statute , and have equal rights and responsibilities on the road .
“ Yeah , when you have different - speed vehicles on the road , it slows people down , and we ’re not hiding from that .
There ’s nothing wrong with taking your foot off the gas pedal , even if it ’s just for a couple of seconds . ”
Bicycle safety bill
To read the proposed new bicycle safety bill before the legislature ( Senate Bill 148 ) or the existing Colorado statute regarding bicycles ( 42-4-1412 ) , go to bicyclecolo.org .
Practical and sustainable , it 's an ideal material for frames , but bamboo may take a while to become the next big thing
The panda jokes are now a long way from my mind .
I 'm standing astride a bike crafted from an armful of bamboo cane , about to push out into rush - hour traffic .
As a material for a bicycle frame , it makes more sense than it sounds .
In Asian countries it 's often used as scaffolding , and even to reinforce concrete , so it 's certainly strong .
But the important part is that it's also incredibly springy .
Next time you 're on your bike , find somewhere away from traffic and look down at your frame when you set off .
Most people do n't realise that bikes are not rigid , they warp and bend slightly when you ride them .
The largest of my bikes flexes so much when I corner hard that I can actually feel it distort underneath me .
As well as such practicality , bamboo offers sustainability – so long as it's done right .
Some bamboo production is far from green , causing biodiversity problems and creating toxic dioxins from treatment with chlorine .
The cane used here , though , is reportedly grown responsibly in Taiwan 's Yushan national park , and hand - picked before being shipped to bike manufacturer Calfee 's California headquarters .
It 's also smoked and heat treated , rather than chemically hardened .
There are definite environmental benefits to using bamboo as a raw material : it grows extremely quickly , requires minimal pesticides and water and is a prolific producer of oxygen .
So , why not build bikes from it , rather than more energy - intensive steel or carbon ?
Well , people have .
In fact , look up English patent number 8274 , filed in 1894 , and you 'll see that it 's far from a new idea .
It 's just never taken off .
Craig Calfee intends to change all that .
He was one of the early pioneers of carbon fibre bikes , and he 's been experimenting with bamboo since 2005 .
He now builds high - end bamboo racing , mountain and cargo bikes , and is working on bringing cheap and simple utility bikes to Africa .
Because of the climate there , the raw material grows well , and local people could be trained to produce the frames themselves .
It 's one of Calfee 's racing bikes I 'm riding today , all £ 3,000 of it ( available in the UK via Eco Age ) .
Worryingly , it 's incredibly light and looks fragile , but it does come with a 10 - year guarantee .
So , what does it feel like to ride ?
When you played with a bamboo cane as a child , and swished it through the air , it felt like energy incarnate .
That 's a little how this bike feels to ride .
When I first sprint off , nothing happens for a split second , just like when you swish that bamboo cane .
Then , almost before you 've noticed , it springs ahead as though it has more energy than you 've put in .
It rivals carbon , steel , anything I 've ridden .
It 's also comfortable .
But not like a big , heavy commuter bike with large , bouncy tires .
It just soaks up the bumps , with no lolling around .
The incredible part of this bike is that this feel comes from something that grows naturally – technically , it 's a grass .
It 's simply harvested and crafted in a workshop .
It 's not a hi-tech carbon fibre bike which has been moulded , layered , glued , baked and finished .
Even the joints are made of natural hemp .
But will it become the next big material for bike builders ?
In the developing world it makes perfect sense , but it will be a big task to oust carbon fibre in the west .
It took almost a decade for riders to trust that material , and bamboo somehow feels even more alien than that did .
Maybe everyone should have a test - ride on Calfee 's bike .
An Ofcom - commissioned report into Wi-Fi performance concludes that it 's baby - listeners and TV - senders that are mucking with the signal , not to mention the " Free Public Wi - Fi " virus , without which we 'd all be connecting faster .
Ofcom 's remit is to ensure efficient use of radio spectrum , including the unlicensed 2.4GHz band used by Wi-Fi .
To that end , it commissioned specialist consultancy Mass to examine how effectively the band is being exploited .
What Mass discovered ( pdf ) is that while Wi-Fi users blame nearby networks for slowing down their connectivity , in reality the problem is people watching retransmitted TV in the bedroom while listening to their offspring sleeping , and there 's not a lot the regulator can do about it .
Outside central London that is : in the middle of The Smoke there really are too many networks , with resends , beacons and housekeeping filling 90 per cent of the data frames sent over Wi-Fi .
This leaves only 10 per cent for users ' data .
In fact , the study found that operating overheads for wireless Ethernet were much higher than anticipated , except in Bournemouth for some reason : down on the south coast 44 per cent of frames contain user data .
The following table shows the proportion of frame types around the UK , listed by population and demonstrating that it's not the number of locals that defines the speed of your wireless connection .
The bigger version is more legible
Beacon frames are those sent out by access points , advertising their presence , or by computers that have picked up the " Free Public Wi- Fi " infection - originally considered to be a Windows thing but observed on Meamo too .
Users see an access point of that name , and attempt to connect , only to find themselves advertising such a point to everyone else .
What 's worse is that it seems " Free Public Wi - Fi " points are sending out beacon frames ten times more frequently than they should ( every 0.01204 seconds ) , leading to a significant amount of traffic :
" Walking around central London one can expect to encounter , on average , 26 of these devices per hour .
On average they constitute about 7 % of the total frame density , but this is very much an average and this peaks at about 28 % in some cases "
But even that 's nothing compared to the interference generated by analogue baby listeners and other deregulated kit , and the report notes that much of the overhead traffic shown is generated by devices reconnecting when they 've lost a connection .
Mass also demonstrated , in laboratory conditions , how a baby - listener can generate a swath of interference in such a way that devices could see a nearby access point , and report a strong signal , but could n't connect because the interference was so great - a situation that could equally result in an slow or unreliable connection that the user would struggle to solve .
Not that bad Wi -Fi is always to blame - Mass found that users are quick to blame the wireless part of their connectivity when the fault actually lies in ADSL , routing or even the servers at the other end of the connection .
Mass also found that , contrary to expectation , residential users were good at changing the Wi-Fi channel , though pointed out that once 802.11n devices start to use bonded channels the chances of interference will increase .
Dealing with the interference from perfectly - legal AV transmitters and baby listeners would seem to yield the greatest increase in capacity , not to mention reducing the headache of managing residential wireless , but it 's a hard thing to do in unregulated spectrum .
Baby listeners are already moving towards digital transmissions , and some even come labelled " Wi - Fi friendly " to indicate they 'll slot into a single 802.11 channel ( 5MHz wide , rather than the 8MHz channel used by analogue listeners which ensures any interference spans two channels ) .
But while ever - cautious parents will pay a premium for the digitally - rendered sniffles of their beloved , not to mention additional features such as a back channel , thermometers and the like , cheap AV senders have no compelling reason to go digital and show no signs of doing so .
Enforcing Wi-Fi friendliness would be unpopular , and difficult , within an unregulated channel , but the alternative is to continue suffering intermittent connections so that Sky customers can watch TV in the bedroom . ®

AMERICA has been dithering about how to sort out its banking crisis .
The market has forced its hand .
On the morning of Monday February 23rd a joint statement by banking regulators said that they stood “ firmly behind ” the banking system and would initiate promised stress tests of banks ' capital positions on Wednesday .
The fine print remains critical and , so far , unclear , but the statement should at least halt the scary market moves that took place last week .
In a five - day period last week shares of two of the biggest and most vulnerable banks , Citigroup and Bank of America ( BoA ) , fell by 44 % and 32 % respectively .
Those of better capitalised institutions , such as JPMorgan Chase , fell by less .
Far more worryingly , this sorting of the wheat from the chaff occurred in the credit defaults swap market , which showed the perceived risk of bankruptcy ballooning for Citi and rising sharply for BoA , while JPMorgan remained more secure .
Investors seemed to be betting that new injections of straight equity from the state ( rather than more dollops of preferred shares ) would dilute existing shareholders , but also that the state might insist that a “ haircut ” be imposed on those further up the capital structure .
However emotionally satisfying , forcing banks to default on debt would cause the type of liquidity runs and market dislocation that brought chaos after the collapse of Lehman Brothers last year .
The regulators ' statement seems designed to reassure on this front .
What it still sidesteps is the basis on which new equity will be injected into tottering banks .
Clearly the government could take all sorts of forensic decisions about the carrying values of assets that banks have on their balance sheets .
But the market is mainly betting that the government will bow to common sense .
Headline tier - one capital ratios show all three banks at 11 - 12 % ( with BoA including Merrill Lynch ) .
But Citi and BoA have flattered these ratios with huge amounts of preference stock , much of it issued by the state .
This capital is not genuinely loss bearing : for example Citi can defer dividends on its latest government preference stock but not cancel them entirely in the same way as common shares .
Strip out the hybrid capital and JPMorgan is at 6.4 % .
This is in line with the best capitalised European banks — for example Britain 's state - controlled RBS , even after it latest round of big losses , stands at about 7 % .
However Citi and BoA look much weaker , with ratios at about 3 - 4 % as well as carrying higher investment banking exposure .
Investors appear only to trust banks with high levels of pure equity capital .
That suggests it would be a good idea to convert existing government preference stock into pure equity .
If this occurred at current market prices , the state would own about two thirds of BoA and about 80 % of Citi .
But instead the regulators ' announcement on Monday appears to support the idea of more “ temporary ” preferred shares that would convert into common stock “ over time ” as and when losses materialise .
This further fiddlyness seems designed to avoid the appearance of nationalisation , but it could well create even more confusion about the true loss bearing capacity of these two firms , and of other banks that are likely to fail the test .
It is hard to believe the solution to banks ' problems is to make their capital structures more , not less , complicated .
Oh boy , simple ideas can drive outstanding results .
A Japanese amateur photographer named Spyuge combined an Epson flatbed scanner with a Canon manual - focus lens .
Voila , result is an extremely high resolution scanner - camera thingy .
The resolution of each picture is about 13,068 x 10,173 pixels !
Good , taking a picture with that device would take some time , but for a special - armed robot agent maybe a good idea .
Uhm , I think more of making scientific scans from the surface of foreign planets than exploring the private life of your neighbours . ;)

Via Shannyn Moore , who reveals who these " not so Jesus Christians " are :
Gay rights ordinance is bad
Here are just some of the reasons I am against the homosexual ordinance .
It would allow any man to dress like a woman and use any public women ’s restroom .
Ladies , do you want that to happen ?
If not then you should contact the Anchorage Assembly and show up at the June 9 public hearing .
A man in a highly visible sales job could come to work dressed like a woman .
A person of either sex who indulges a taste for extreme sexual promiscuity and pornography during working hours could not be stopped or fired even though it damages the company ’s image .
Maybe , worst of all , this ordinance would allow a man who teaches a second grade class or any grade to show up as a woman in the classroom and the School District could do nothing because of this ordinance .
This is a poorly written ordinance .

On Monday , the U.S. Supreme Court rejected appeals from two California counties that object to that state 's medical marijuana law .
In a shift from previous top prosecutors , Attorney General Eric H. Holder recently said the federal government will not be devoting a lot of effort prosecuting low - level marijuana cases .
And now , the Supreme Court 's rejection bolsters the state laws -- although it should be noted that officially , the sale or use of marijuana is still considered illegal by the U.S. government .
The attorney general 's statement and the Supreme Court 's action are good news for patients who live in states with compassionate marijuana laws .
Like California , Colorado recognizes the relief that marijuana can bring to some patients with HIV / AIDS , cancer , glaucoma and the severe pain and nausea that comes from those and other ailments .
Colorado 's medical marijuana law was passed by the voters in 2000 .
Almost 7,400 people have applied to be registered as medical marijuana patients .
Some registrations have expired , some patients have died , 35 applications were rejected and 18 cards have been revoked .
Today , there are about 5,920 medical marijuana users here , including 560 in Boulder , 48 in Broomfield and 255 in nearby Weld .
Severe pain accounts for about 88 percent of the users -- though some patients register for multiple ailments , such as severe pain and cancer .
Whether or not pot should be legalized and regulated full - stop is a question for another time :
The high court 's rejection of the California case allows states like our own to continue compassionate care .
Elsewhere in the war :
Gil Kerlikowske , the newly named head of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy , said that the country will shift toward an emphasis on treatment over incarceration to try and reduce drug use .
" Regardless of how you try to explain to people it's a ' war on drugs ' or a ' war on a product , ' people see a war as a war on them .
We 're not at war with people in this country , " Kerlikowske said in his first interview last week .
This is a most welcome shift :
We need to start being honest about the costs of this war .
Our prisons are filled with people busted for even low - level drug use .
" Zero tolerance " policies filter down to even the smallest of municipalities :

Now here ’s an interesting rumour circulating around the Russian language blogs – 26 year old Russian Olympic gymnast turned Duma Deputy Alina Kabaeva has just given birth to Vladimir Putin ’s son .
Kabaeva , if you recall , was the Russian beauty who alleged to have secretly married Putin last year .
The story captured headlines all over the world , and – unsurprisingly – made Putin very very cross .
Aleksandr Lebedev , the billionaire owner of Moskovsky Korrespondent , the newspaper that broke the story , was hauled over the coals by Putin , forced to retract the story , and closed the newspaper down within months .
( Naturally , we all know that President Putin , a balding man in his 50s , was secretly delighted to be linked romantically with a flexible young Russian gymnast , regardless of whether the story was true or not . )
Adding fuel to the rumour fire is that not a single one of the major Russian news agencies have mentioned the birth .
I suppose that it is possible that nobody in Russia thinks this is newsworthy , but more likely , they saw what happened to the last newspaper to break a story about Putin ’s love life and decided that they ’d quite like to stay in business .
But , whatever the reason , it ’s raised eyebrows .
As Russia !
Magazine ’s Blah Blah blog notes / pleads :
“ The most puzzling part of this story is that at press time not a single major Russian media has reported that Kabaeva had a son .
Come on , Channel One Russia and The Moscow Times , say something !
Or else the bloggers are starting to look very convincing . ”
A few ( a very few ! ) internet only publications are covering the story .
But even they are nervous .
Take this story from Rupor. info , for example .
They ’ve noticed that Express Gazeta posted a small story about the birth , then quickly withdrew it .
Want more fuel to add to the fire ?
How about this ?
Putin and his ( official ) wife Ludmilla have n’t been seen out together in public for more than a year .
Most strikingly at this Easter ’s publicly televised TV service , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev stood with his wife Svetlana , but Putin stood alone .
Until last week , that is – the two ventured out for a very public meeting with the newly appointed Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church , Metropolitan Kiril .
The question on Russian bloggers minds is , why would one bring one ’s ( official ) aged wife out of semi-retirement at exactly the same time as one ’s ( alleged ! ) wife has just given birth to a bouncing baby boy ?
Is it because Putin wants deflect rumours about his alleged illegitimate son and represent himself as a stable , long - married family man , respectable enough to be elected again as Russia ’s President in a few years time ?
Update 27 May 2009 : Kabaeva has posted an update on her blog categorically denying that she has given birth .
Which kind of rules out the prospect of Putin bouncing a bonny baby boy on his knee any time soon …
“ About rumors Dear friends !
I do n’t normally comment rumors , but this time I ’ve decided to make an exception .
The reason being I cannot leave unanswered many warm words and wishes …
On my site in the section “ My life ” I promised to tell about most important events in my life , about my family .
Hence , when I become a mother ( which has n’t happen yet ) , I will certainly write about it .
At any rate – I thank all those who congratulated me and showed their concern .
Just for you I have compromised my principle : never to pay any attention to rumors . ”

Giovanni Lovatelli and his family lucked into a long - term loan of a 1948 baby grand piano when a friend moved to New York years ago .
Five - year - old Giacomo began taking lessons , practicing diligently for a year or so .
“ We had to keep pushing a little bit , ” Lovatelli said , adding that he promised a basketball hoop if his son persevered through his teacher ’s recital .
Giacomo got the hoop but soon stopped playing piano , and now , at 11 , he plays acoustic and electric guitar .
The piano stayed .
Friends play , and children pound on it from time to time , but its long - term place in the family is uncertain -- as is the piano ’s future in American culture .
The piano has been the center of many American homes for generations , not only a proclamation of a love of music but also often a statement about striving for success .
“ In a very traditional sense , the piano did stand for something .
It was a symbol of mobility , moving up , ” especially among immigrant families , said Joe Lamond , president of the International Music Products Assn. , based in Carlsbad and known as NAMM .
Some real estate agents still will move a piano into a house that ’s for sale to class it up , he said .
In many homes these days , a piano is n’t so much a musical instrument as it is just another piece of furniture .
Christiane Cuse did n’t want that to happen in her Sherman Oaks house .
During some renovations , a decorator suggested moving her family ’s grand piano to a nook off the living room .
She objected .
“ I always put the piano in a place people would walk by a lot , ” she said .
“ If it ’s off the beaten path , it ’s not used . ”
And so , a dining table sits in the nook , and the piano remains in front of a big window with a view of the pool .
Cuse said she often sees pianos topped with framed family photographs , and that ’s a tipoff .
“ Obviously , no one is playing that , ” she said .
“ So we ’ve never had anything on the piano . ”
But the Cuses may be going against the tide .
In the 21st century , the acoustic piano seems to be a relic of another era .
Jeffrey Lavner , a piano teacher at the Colburn School in downtown L.A. , puts it this way : “ I think piano playing is a little like black - and - white movies . ”
It is n’t that our need for music has diminished , said James Parakilas , music department chairman at Bates College in Maine and author of “ Piano Roles : 300 Years of Life With the Piano . ”
In fact , our opportunities to hear music seem to be increasing : at home , in cars , even as we walk or jog , buds nestled in our ears .
It ’s that there are so many ways to make and listen to music , and most of them are less demanding and expensive than actually playing the piano .
Many forces have contributed to the acoustic piano ’s troubles .
Start with electronic keyboards and digital instruments , with their improving quality and alluring gadgets such as metronomes , USB ports , headphones and recording devices .
Not to mention their generally lower price .
“ We live in a digital age , ” said Brian Majeski , editor of Music Trades magazine .
“ You have to redefine the instrument . ”
And in a time of foreclosures and downsizing , the expense of a traditional piano -- which can run from a few thousand dollars to $ 100,000 or more -- may seem untenable , especially for a child who may be eager to play but has no track record in the rigors of daily practice .
What ’s more , for students , there is ferocious competition for the hours between school and sleep : Homework or video games ?
Soccer or ballet ?
Facebook or TV ?
In a survey of piano teachers conducted in 2005 for the Piano Manufacturers Assn .
International , 89 % said that the primary reason a child drops lessons is “ too many other activities . ”
That worries Ellen Collins , a piano teacher in Hancock Park , who said the piano has been replaced by a television as the center of the living room or den .
“ It saddens me , ” she said .
“ How many grown - ups are out there on the soccer field ?
But music ?
That ’s a whole lifetime . ”
Other reasons : Piano lessons were harder or less fun than children expected , or they were too inconvenient or too expensive for parents .
A branch of society still believes that the ability to play piano has great value , said Adam Chester , who has been playing for most of his 45 years .
Not only is he the manager of a Keyboard Concepts store on Beverly Boulevard , but he ’s also the rehearsal pianist for Elton John .
“ I will admit there are a lot of other distractions in today ’s time - crunching community , ” he said .
“ This is the way life is now . ”
In the world of competitive child - rearing , many parents have a reputation both for spoiling their little darlings and for scheduling them out of all reckoning .
“ Kids have résumés when they ’re 12 , ” Bates College ’s Parakilas said .
“ Parents do n’t ask their children to choose , they ask them to do everything . ”
That does n’t always mean those parents -- perhaps recalling their own childhood practicing -- insist that their children play scales every day .
And again .
One more time .
Until it ’s perfect .
“ People think it ’s important , but they do n’t make it a priority , ” said Elizabeth Yaron , a piano teacher .
“ No one will miss a baseball or a basketball game for a piano lesson .
. . .
It does n’t go the other way . ”
Sales of new acoustic pianos , which peaked three decades ago , have been harmed by the crash of the stock and housing markets , Lamond said .
Figures from NAMM and Music Trades reveal that in 2000 , 105,000 acoustic upright and grand pianos were sold in the United States .
In 2007 , the total was just 54,000 .
( Electronic piano sales rose from 82,000 to 121,000 over the same period , and Americans bought 1.2 million portable keyboards in 2007 . )
By contrast , sales for a generally cheaper instrument -- the guitar -- have risen : From 1998 to 2007 , acoustic guitar sales grew to 1,348,000 from 611,000 ; for electric guitars , the numbers grew to 1,520,000 from 543,000 .
“ The guitar has displaced the piano in a lot of the music people listen to -- and not just kids , ” Parakilas said .
People see the guitar -- mistakenly -- as easy to master , and “ kids want to see themselves as guitar players , ” he said .
Garrett Sullivan , the manager of Adams Music , a popular spot on the Westside for lessons , said that electric guitar lessons have been gaining ground for years .
It ’s by far the most popular in the Pico Boulevard studio , with band and orchestra instruments and piano competing for second place .
Not surprisingly , Lamond believes the piano has some staying power .
“ I think it might be a tad early to call for the demise of the acoustic piano , ” he said .
Colburn teacher Lavner , in turn , hopes to boost piano culture .
“ I think it ’s our job to figure out how to keep it alive , ” he said .
One of Lavner ’s students , 15 - year - old Isaac Wilson , plans to do his part .
An upright Yamaha piano sits in his small bedroom , and he puts in three to four hours each day toward his goal of becoming a professional jazz musician .
He can play just before he sleeps and as soon as he wakes , he said .
Christiane Cuse ’s daughter Caroline , a senior at Harvard - Westlake School , began playing at age 8 on an orange , hand - me - down upright piano .
Now , she plays the grand piano that sits in a window of her family ’s Sherman Oaks home .
“ I ’m really , really happy that I ’ve taken piano for so long .
I think it ’s a really good form of self - expression , ” she said one afternoon before sitting down , feet bare , nails painted silver and red , to play Chopin from memory .
The goal of most parents is to make music a permanent part of the child ’s life , said Kathleen Summerland , Caroline ’s teacher .
“ Occasionally I have the honor of working with someone who will make music a career , ” Summerland said .
But she considers herself to be teaching the audiences of the future .
Those who remain in the business of selling pianos emphasize the mental agility that supposedly comes with practice and the nostalgia value .
“ Will the Wii provide those long - term skills that will carry you through ? ” asked Brian Chung , senior vice president at the piano manufacturer Kawai America Corp. in Rancho Dominguez .
“ I think pianos are very dear to people .
They represent generations of family life .
They imprint the memories of a person upon them . ”
Pro pianist Chester said his older child , who is 5 , and will start lessons this year .
If the going gets rough , “ I ’d whip out a couple of old tapes with me at the piano and lots of people around having a great time . ”
Or he can bring on the secret weapon : tapes of Chester with Elton John .

Technology.am ( may 11 , 2009 ) —
The EU researchers have successfully tested technology to verify ¬identities for security checks , so distinctive brain patterns could become the latest subject of biometric scanning .
The US government ’s secretive Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity is seeking development proposals to enhance such technologies .
Researchers are eager to produce ‘ non - contact ’ biometric systems that can check any individual ’s identity at a distance .
Among security experts there is a preference for developing biometric security devices that do not rely on measuring solely one physiological trait : offering choice makes scanning appear less intrusive and allows for double - checking .
The Foreign Office plans to spend up to £ 15 m on fixed and mobile security devices that use methods including “ Facial recognition , fingerprint recognition , iris recognition and vein imaging palm recognition ” .
The Home Office has also confirmed rapid expansion plans of automated facial recognition gates , and 10 will be operating at major UK airports by August .
Passengers holding the latest generation of passports traveling through Manchester and Stansted are already being checked by facial - recognition cameras .
Another series of tests fitted a “ sensing seat ” to a truck to record each driver ’s characteristic seated posture in an attempt to spot whether commercial vehicles had been hijacked .
Biometric identity checks are also becoming more common in the world of commercial gadgets .
New versions of computer laptops and mobile phones are entering the market with built - in fingerprint scanners to prevent other people running up large bills and misusing pilfered hi-tech equipment .
How to Write an Equality Method in Java
by Martin Odersky , Lex Spoon , and Bill Venners
June 1 , 2009

Summary
This article describes a technique for overriding the equals method that preserves the contract of equals even when subclassses of concrete classes add new fields .
In Item 8 of Effective Java1 , Josh Bloch describes the difficulty of preserving the equals contract when subclassing as a “ fundamental problem of equivalence relations in object - oriented languages . ”
Bloch writes :
There is no way to extend an instantiable class and add a value component while preserving the equals contract , unless you are willing to forgo the benefits of object - oriented abstraction .
Chapter 28 of Programming in Scala shows an approach that allows subclasses to extend an instantiable class , add a value component , and nevertheless preserve the equals contract .
Although in the technique is described in the book in the context of defining Scala classes , it is also applicable to classes defined in Java .
In this article , we present the technique using text adapted from the relevant section of Programming in Scala , but with the code examples translated from Scala into Java .
Commmon equality pitfalls
Class java.lang .
Object defines an equals method , which subclasses may override .
Unfortunately , it turns out that writing a correct equality method is surprisingly difficult in object - oriented languages .
In fact , after studying a large body of Java code , the authors of a 2007 paper concluded that almost all implementations of equals methods are faulty .
2
C
C
elem1
elem2
C
elem1.equals(elem2 )
true
equals
Set <C> hashSet = new java.util.HashSet<C >( ) ; hashSet.add(elem1 ) ; hashSet.contains(elem2 ) ; // returns false !
This is problematic , because equality is at the basis of many other things .
For one , a faulty equality method for a typemight mean that you cannot reliably put an object of typein a collection .
You might have two elementsof typethat are equal , i.e. , “ ” yields .
Nevertheless , with commonly occurring faulty implementations of themethod , you could still see behavior like the following :
Here are four common pitfalls3 that can cause inconsistent behavior when overriding equals :
Defining equals with the wrong signature .
Changing equals without also changing hashCode .
Defining equals in terms of mutable fields .
Failing to define equals as an equivalence relation .
These four pitfalls are discussed in the remainder of this section .
Pitfall # 1 : Defining equals with the wrong signature .
Consider adding an equality method to the following class of simple points :
public class Point { private final int x ; private final int y ; public Point ( int x , int y ) { this .x = x ; this .y = y ; } public int getX ( ) { return x ; } public int getY ( ) { return y ; } // ... }
A seemingly obvious , but wrong way would be to define it like this :
//
An utterly wrong definition of equals public boolean equals ( Point other ) { return ( this.getX ( ) == other.getX( ) && this.getY ( ) == other.getY ( ) ) ; }
What 's wrong with this method ?
At first glance , it seems to work OK :
Point p1 = new Point ( 1 , 2 ) ; Point p2 = new Point ( 1 , 2 ) ; Point q = new Point ( 2 , 3 ) ; System.out.println(p1.equals ( p2 ) ) ; // prints true System.out.println(p1.equals( q ) ) ; // prints false
However , trouble starts once you start putting points into a collection :
import java.util.HashSet ; HashSet < Point > coll = new HashSet < Point >( ) ; coll.add( p1 ) ; System.out.println(coll.contains ( p2 ) ) ; // prints false
How can it be that coll does not contain p2 , even though p1 was added to it , and p1 and p2 are equal objects ?
The reason becomes clear in the following interaction , where the precise type of one of the compared points is masked .
Define p2a as an alias of p2 , but with type Object instead of Point :
Object p2a = p2 ;
Now , were you to repeat the first comparison , but with the alias p2a instead of p2 , you would get :
System.out.println(p1.equals ( p2a ) ) ; // prints false
What went wrong ?
In fact , the version of equals given previously does not override the standard method equals , because its type is different .
Here is the type of the equals method as it is defined in the root class Object :
public boolean equals ( Object other )
Because the equals method in Point takes a Point instead of an Object as an argument , it does not override equals in Object .
Instead , it is just an overloaded alternative .
Overloading in Java is resolved by the static type of the argument , not the run -time type .
So as long as the static type of the argument is Point , the equals method in Point is called .
However , once the static argument is of type Object , the equals method in Object is called instead .
This method has not been overridden , so it is still implemented by comparing object identity .
That 's why the comparison “ p1.equals ( p2a ) ” yields false even though points p1 and p2a have the same x and y values .
That 's also why the contains method in HashSet returned false .
Since that method operates on generic sets , it calls the generic equals method in Object instead of the overloaded variant in Point .
A better equals method is the following :
// A better definition , but still not perfect @ Override public boolean equals ( Object other ) { boolean result = false ; if ( other instanceof Point ) {
Point that = ( Point ) other ; result = ( this.getX ( ) == that .getX ( ) && this .getY ( ) == that .getY ( ) ) ; } return result ; }
Now equals has the correct type .
It takes a value of type Object as parameter and it yields a boolean result .
The implementation of this method uses instanceof and a cast .
It first tests whether the other object is also of type Point .
If it is , it compares the coordinates of the two points and returns the result .
Otherwise the result is false .
Pitfall # 2 : Changing equals without also changing hashCode
If you repeat the comparison of p1 and p2a with the latest definition of Point defined previously , you will get true , as expected .
However , if you repeat the HashSet.contains test , you will probably still get false :
Point p1 = new Point ( 1 , 2 ) ; Point p2 = new Point ( 1 , 2 ) ; HashSet < Point > coll = new HashSet < Point >( ) ; coll.add( p1 ) ; System.out.println(coll.contains ( p2 ) ) ; // prints false ( probably )
In fact , this outcome is not 100 % certain .
You might also get true from the experiment .
If you do , you can try with some other points with coordinates 1 and 2 .
Eventually , you 'll get one which is not contained in the set .
What goes wrong here is that Point redefined equals without also redefining hashCode .
Note that the collection in the example above is a HashSet .
This means elements of the collection are put in “ hash buckets ” determined by their hash code .
The contains test first determines a hash bucket to look in and then compares the given elements with all elements in that bucket .
Now , the last version of class Point did redefine equals , but it did not at the same time redefine hashCode .
So hashCode is still what it was in its version in class Object : some transformation of the address of the allocated object .
The hash codes of p1 and p2 are almost certainly different , even though the fields of both points are the same .
Different hash codes mean with high probability different hash buckets in the set .
The contains test will look for a matching element in the bucket which corresponds to p2 's hash code .
In most cases , point p1 will be in another bucket , so it will never be found .
p1 and p2 might also end up by chance in the same hash bucket .
In that case the test would return true .
The problem was that the last implementation of Point violated the contract on hashCode as defined for class Object :
If two objects are equal according to the equals ( Object ) method , then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result .
In fact , it 's well known in Java that hashCode and equals should always be redefined together .
Furthermore , hashCode may only depend on fields that equals depends on .
For the Point class , the following would be a suitable definition of hashCode :
public class Point { private final int x ; private final int y ; public Point ( int x , int y ) { this .x = x ; this .y = y ; } public int getX ( ) { return x ; } public int getY ( ) { return y ; } @ Override public boolean equals ( Object other ) { boolean result = false ; if ( other instanceof Point ) {
Point that = ( Point ) other ; result = ( this.getX ( ) == that .getX ( ) && this .getY ( ) == that .getY ( ) ) ; } return result ; } @ Override public int hashCode ( ) { return ( 41 * ( 41 + getX ( ) ) + getY ( ) ) ; } }
This is just one of many possible implementations of hashCode .
Adding the constant 41 to one integer field x , multiplying the result with the prime number 41 , and adding to that result the other integer field y gives a reasonable distribution of hash codes at a low cost in running time and code size .
Adding hashCode fixes the problems of equality when defining classes like Point .
However , there are still other trouble spots to watch out for .
Pitfall # 3 : Defining equals in terms of mutable fields
Consider the following slight variation of class Point :
public class Point { private int x ; private int y ; public Point ( int x , int y ) { this .x = x ; this .y = y ; } public int getX ( ) { return x ; } public int getY ( ) { return y ; } public void setX ( int x ) { //
Problematic this .x = x ; } public void set Y ( int y ) { this .y = y ; } @ Override public boolean equals ( Object other ) { boolean result = false ; if ( other instanceof Point ) {
Point that = ( Point ) other ; result = ( this.getX ( ) == that .getX ( ) && this .getY ( ) == that .getY ( ) ) ; } return result ; } @ Override public int hashCode ( ) { return ( 41 * ( 41 + getX ( ) ) + getY ( ) ) ; } }
The only difference is that the fields x and y are no longer final , and two set methods have been added that allow clients to change the x and y values .
The equals and hashCode methods are now defined in terms of these mutable fields , so their results change when the fields change .
This can have strange effects once you put points in collections :
Point p = new Point ( 1 , 2 ) ; HashSet < Point > coll = new HashSet < Point >( ) ; coll.add(p ) ; System.out.println(coll.contains ( p ) ) ; // prints true
Now , if you change a field in point p , does the collection still contain the point ?
We 'll try it :
p.setX(p.getX( ) + 1 ) ; System.out.println(coll.contains ( p ) ) ; // prints false ( probably )
This looks strange .
Where did p go ?
More strangeness results if you check whether the iterator of the set contains p :
Iterator < Point > it = coll.iterator ( ) ; boolean containedP = false ; while ( it.hasNext ( ) ) { Point nextP = it.next ( ) ; if ( nextP.equals ( p ) ) { containedP = true ; break ; } } System.out.println(containedP ) ; // prints true
So here 's a set that does not contain p , yet p is among the elements of the set !
What happened , of course , is that after the change to the x field , the point p ended up in the wrong hash bucket of the set coll .
That is , its original hash bucket no longer corresponded to the new value of its hash code .
In a manner of speaking , the point p “ dropped out of sight ” in the set coll even though it still belonged to its elements .
The lesson to be drawn from this example is that when equals and hashCode depend on mutable state , it may cause problems for users .
If they put such objects into collections , they have to be careful never to modify the depended - on state , and this is tricky .
If you need a comparison that takes the current state of an object into account , you should usually name it something else , not equals .
Considering the last definition of Point , it would have been preferable to omit a redefinition of hashCode and to name the comparison method equalContents , or some other name different from equals .
Point would then have inherited the default implementation of equals and hashCode .
So p would have stayed locatable in coll even after the modification to its x field .
Pitfall # 4 : Failing to define equals as an equivalence relation
The contract of the equals method in Object specifies that equals must implement an equivalence relation on non- null objects :
It is reflexive : for any non-null value x , the expression x.equals ( x ) should return true .
, the expression should return .
It is symmetric : for any non-null values x and y , x.equals (y ) should return true if and only if y.equals ( x ) returns true .
and , should return if and only if returns .
It is transitive : for any non-null values x , y , and z , if x.equals (y ) returns true and y.equals ( z ) returns true , then x.equals ( z ) should return true .
, , and , if returns and returns , then should return .
It is consistent : for any non-null values x and y , multiple invocations of x.equals (y ) should consistently return true or consistently return false , provided no information used in equals comparisons on the objects is modified .
and , multiple invocations of should consistently return or consistently return , provided no information used in equals comparisons on the objects is modified .
For any non-null value x , x.equals ( null ) should return false .
The definition of equals developed so far for class Point satisfies the contract for equals .
However , things become more complicated once subclasses are considered .
Say there is a subclass ColoredPoint of Point that adds a field color of type Color .
Assume Color is defined as an enum :
public enum Color { RED , ORANGE , YELLOW , GREEN , BLUE , INDIGO , VIOLET ; }
ColoredPoint overrides equals to take the new color field into account :
public class ColoredPoint extends Point { //
Problem : equals not symmetric private final Color color ; public ColoredPoint ( int x , int y , Color color ) { super( x , y ) ; this .
color = color ; } @ Override public boolean equals ( Object other ) { boolean result = false ; if ( other instanceof ColoredPoint ) { ColoredPoint that = ( ColoredPoint ) other ; result = ( this.color.equals ( that.color ) && super.equals ( that ) ) ; } return result ; } }
This is what many programmers would likely write .
Note that in this case , class ColoredPoint need not override hashCode .
Because the new definition of equals on ColoredPoint is stricter than the overridden definition in Point ( meaning it equates fewer pairs of objects ) , the contract for hashCode stays valid .
If two colored points are equal , they must have the same coordinates , so their hash codes are guaranteed to be equal as well .
Taking the class ColoredPoint by itself , its definition of equals looks OK .
However , the contract for equals is broken once points and colored points are mixed .
Consider :
Point p = new Point ( 1 , 2 ) ; ColoredPoint cp = new ColoredPoint ( 1 , 2 , Color.RED ) ; System.out.println(p.equals ( cp ) ) ; // prints true System.out.println(cp.equals ( p ) ) ; // prints false
The comparison “ p equals cp ” invokes p 's equals method , which is defined in class Point .
This method only takes into account the coordinates of the two points .
Consequently , the comparison yields true .
On the other hand , the comparison “ cp equals p ” invokes cp 's equals method , which is defined in class ColoredPoint .
This method returns false , because p is not a ColoredPoint .
So the relation defined by equals is not symmetric .
The loss in symmetry can have unexpected consequences for collections .
Here 's an example :
Set < Point > hashSet1 = new java.util.HashSet< Point >( ) ; hashSet1.add(p ) ; System.out.println(hashSet1.contains ( cp ) ) ; // prints false Set< Point > hashSet2 = new java.util.HashSet< Point >( ) ; hashSet2.add( cp ) ; System.out.println(hashSet2.contains ( p ) ) ; // prints true
So even though p and cp are equal , one contains test succeeds whereas the other one fails .
How can you change the definition of equals so that it becomes symmetric ?
Essentially there are two ways .
You can either make the relation more general or more strict .
Making it more general means that a pair of two objects , a and b , is taken to be equal if either comparing a with b or comparing b with a yields true .
Here 's code that does this :
public class ColoredPoint extends Point { //
Problem : equals not transitive private final Color color ; public ColoredPoint ( int x , int y , Color color ) { super( x , y ) ; this .
color = color ; } @ Override public boolean equals ( Object other ) { boolean result = false ; if ( other instanceof ColoredPoint ) { ColoredPoint that = ( ColoredPoint ) other ; result = ( this.color.equals ( that.color ) && super.equals ( that ) ) ; } else if ( other instanceof Point ) {
Point that = ( Point ) other ; result = that .equals ( this ) ; } return result ; } }
The new definition of equals in ColoredPoint checks one more case than the old one :
If the other object is a Point but not a ColoredPoint , the method forwards to the equals method of Point .
This has the desired effect of making equals symmetric .
Now , both “ cp.equals ( p ) ” and “ p.equals ( cp ) ” result in true .
However , the contract for equals is still broken .
Now the problem is that the new relation is no longer transitive !
Here 's a sequence of statements that demonstrates this .
Define a point and two colored points of different colors , all at the same position :
ColoredPoint redP = new ColoredPoint ( 1 , 2 , Color.RED ) ; ColoredPoint blueP = new ColoredPoint ( 1 , 2 , Color . BLUE ) ;
Taken individually , redp is equal to p and p is equal to bluep :
System.out.println(redP.equals( p ) ) ; // prints true System.out.println(p.equals ( blueP ) ) ; // prints true
However , comparing redP and blueP yields false :
System.out.println(redP.equals( blueP ) ) ; // prints false
Hence , the transitivity clause of equals 's contract is violated .
Making the equals relation more general seems to lead to a dead end .
We 'll try to make it stricter instead .
One way to make equals stricter is to always treat objects of different classes as different .
That could be achieved by modifying the equals methods in classes Point and ColoredPoint .
In class Point , you could add an extra comparison that checks whether the run-time class of the other Point is exactly the same as this Point 's class , as follows :
// A technically valid , but unsatisfying , equals method public class Point { private final int x ; private final int y ; public Point ( int x , int y ) { this .x = x ; this .y = y ; } public int getX ( ) { return x ; } public int getY ( ) { return y ; } @ Override public boolean equals ( Object other ) { boolean result = false ; if ( other instanceof Point ) {
Point that = ( Point ) other ; result = ( this.getX ( ) == that .getX ( ) && this .getY ( ) == that .getY ( ) && this.getClass().equals ( that.getClass ( ) ) ) ; } return result ; } @ Override public int hashCode ( ) { return ( 41 * ( 41 + getX ( ) ) + getY ( ) ) ; } }
You can then revert class ColoredPoint 's implementation back to the version that previously had violated the symmetry requirement :
4
public class ColoredPoint extends Point { //
No longer violates symmetry requirement private final Color color ; public ColoredPoint ( int x , int y , Color color ) { super( x , y ) ; this .
color = color ; } @ Override public boolean equals ( Object other ) { boolean result = false ; if ( other instanceof ColoredPoint ) { ColoredPoint that = ( ColoredPoint ) other ; result = ( this.color.equals ( that.color ) && super.equals ( that ) ) ; } return result ; } }
Here , an instance of class Point is considered to be equal to some other instance of the same class only if the objects have the same coordinates and they have the same run-time class , meaning .getClass ( ) on either object returns the same value .
The new definitions satisfy symmetry and transitivity because now every comparison between objects of different classes yields false .
So a colored point can never be equal to a point .
This convention looks reasonable , but one could argue that the new definition is too strict .
Consider the following slightly roundabout way to define a point at coordinates ( 1 , 2 ) :
Point pAnon = new Point ( 1 , 1 ) { @ Override public int getY ( ) { return 2 ; } } ;
Is pAnon equal to p ?
The answer is no because the java.lang .
Class objects associated with p and pAnon are different .
For p it is Point , whereas for pAnon it is an anonymous subclass of Point .
But clearly , pAnon is just another point at coordinates ( 1 , 2 ) .
It does not seem reasonable to treat it as being different from p .
The canEqual method
So it seems we are stuck .
Is there a sane way to redefine equality on several levels of the class hierarchy while keeping its contract ?
In fact , there is such a way , but it requires one more method to redefine together with equals and hashCode .
The idea is that as soon as a class redefines equals ( and hashCode ) , it should also explicitly state that objects of this class are never equal to objects of some superclass that implement a different equality method .
This is achieved by adding a method canEqual to every class that redefines equals .
Here 's the method 's signature :
public boolean canEqual( Object other )
The method should return true if the other object is an instance of the class in which canEqual is ( re ) defined , false otherwise .
It is called from equals to make sure that the objects are comparable both ways .
Here is a new ( and final ) implementation of class Point along these lines :
public class Point { private final int x ; private final int y ; public Point ( int x , int y ) { this .x = x ; this .y = y ; } public int getX ( ) { return x ; } public int getY ( ) { return y ; } @ Override public boolean equals ( Object other ) { boolean result = false ; if ( other instanceof Point ) {
Point that = ( Point ) other ; result = ( that.canEqual ( this ) && this .getX ( ) == that .getX ( ) && this .getY ( ) == that .getY ( ) ) ; } return result ; } @ Override public int hashCode ( ) { return ( 41 * ( 41 + getX ( ) ) + getY ( ) ) ; } public boolean canEqual ( Object other ) { return ( other instanceof Point ) ; } }
The equals method in this version of class Point contains the additional requirement that the other object can equal this one , as determined by the canEqual method .
The implementation of canEqual in Point states that all instances of Point can be equal .
Here 's the corresponding implementation of ColoredPoint :
public class ColoredPoint extends Point { //
No longer violates symmetry requirement private final Color color ; public ColoredPoint ( int x , int y , Color color ) { super( x , y ) ; this .
color = color ; } @ Override public boolean equals ( Object other ) { boolean result = false ; if ( other instanceof ColoredPoint ) { ColoredPoint that = ( ColoredPoint ) other ; result = ( that.canEqual ( this ) && this.color.equals ( that.color ) && super.equals ( that ) ) ; } return result ; } @ Override public int hashCode ( ) { return ( 41 * super.hashCode ( ) + color.hashCode ( ) ) ; } @ Override public boolean canEqual ( Object other ) { return ( other instanceof ColoredPoint ) ; } }
It can be shown that the new definition of Point and ColoredPoint keeps the contract of equals .
Equality is symmetric and transitive .
Comparing a Point to a ColoredPoint always yields false .
Indeed , for any point p and colored point cp , “ p.equals ( cp ) ” will return false because “ cp.canEqual ( p ) ” will return false .
The reverse comparison , “ cp.equals ( p ) ” , will also return false , because p is not a ColoredPoint , so the first instanceof check in the body of equals in Colored Point will fail .
On the other hand , instances of different subclasses of Point can be equal , as long as none of the classes redefines the equality method .
For instance , with the new class definitions , the comparison of p and pAnon would yield true .
Here are some examples :
Point p = new Point ( 1 , 2 ) ; ColoredPoint cp = new ColoredPoint ( 1 , 2 , Color .
INDIGO ) ; Point pAnon = new Point ( 1 , 1 ) { @ Override public int getY ( ) { return 2 ; } } ; Set < Point > coll = new java.util.HashSet < Point >( ) ; coll.add(p ) ; System.out.println(coll.contains ( p ) ) ; // prints true System.out.println(coll.contains ( cp ) ) ; // prints false System.out.println(coll.contains ( pAnon ) ) ; // prints true
These examples demonstrate that if a superclass equals implementation defines and calls canEqual , then programmers who implement subclasses can decide whether or not their subclasses may be equal to instances of the superclass .
Because ColoredPoint overrides canEqual , for example , a colored point may never be equal to a plain - old point .
But because the anonymous subclass referenced from pAnon does not override canEqual , its instance can be equal to a Point instance .
One potential criticism of the canEqual approach is that it violates the Liskov Substitution Principle ( LSP ) .
For example , the technique of implementing equals by comparing run-time classes , which led to the inability to define a subclass whose instances can equal instances of the superclass , has been described as a violation of the LSP .5
The reasoning is that the LSP states you should be able to use ( substitute ) a subclass instance where a superclass instance is required .
In the previous example , however , “ coll.contains ( cp ) ” returned false even though cp 's x and y values matched those of the point in the collection .
Thus it may seem like a violation of the LSP , because you can't use a ColoredPoint here where a Point is expected .
We believe this is the wrong interpretation , though , because the LSP does n't require that a subclass behaves identically to its superclass , just that it behaves in a way that fulfills the contract of its superclass .
The problem with writing an equals method that compares run-time classes is not that it violates the LSP , but that it does n't give you a way to create a subclass whose instances can equal superclass instances .
For example , had we used the run-time class technique in the previous example , “ coll.contains ( pAnon ) ” would have returned false , and that 's not what we wanted .
By contrast , we really did want “ coll.contains ( cp ) ” to return false , because by overriding equals in ColoredPoint , we were basically saying that an indigo - colored point at coordinates ( 1 , 2 ) is not the same thing as an uncolored point at ( 1 , 2 ) .
Thus , in the previous example we were able to pass two different Point subclass instances to the collection 's contains method , and we got back two different answers , both correct .

Human Rights Watch on Monday in a letter to Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski said that a law proposed in the country that would ban discussions on homosexuality in schools violates freedom of speech and could deny children access to HIV / AIDS information , London 's Guardian reports ( Connolly , Guardian , 3/20 ) .
The legislation , proposed last week by Deputy Education Minister Miroslaw Orzechowski , would allow teachers to be fired for promoting what it called " homosexual culture . "
According to the AP / International Herald Tribune , the bill does not define clearly what is meant by homosexual culture but seems to include basic information about HIV / AIDS and lessons promoting tolerance toward men who have sex with men ( AP / International Herald Tribune , 3/19 ) .
Education Minister Roman Giertych said the aim of the proposed law is to " prohibit the promotion of homosexuality and other deviance . "
He added , " One must limit homosexual propaganda so that children wo n't have an improper view of family . "
President Lech Kaczynski has given his support to the law ( Guardian , 3/20 ) .
HRW in the letter called on Jaroslaw Kaczynski to stop the legislation , protect the rights of MSM and women who have sex with women in schools , and " disassociate his administration from rhetoric that promotes discrimination and spreads hatred . "
Scott Long , director of HRW 's gay rights program , said , " Polish authorities claim to be protecting families , but in fact they are trying to deny children free speech and lifesaving information on HIV / AIDS . "
He added , " Schools should be training grounds for tolerance , not bastions of repression and discrimination . "
The proposed law faces a vote in Parliament , the AP / Herald Tribune reports ( AP / International Herald Tribune , 3/19 ) .
The legislation has been fast - tracked and a vote is expected by the end of the month .
Giertych has said he hopes a similar ban will be adopted across the European Union ( Guardian , 3/20 ) .

AP chair takes on new media
Associated Press chairman Dean Singleton kicked off the week by telling newspaper executives that the AP is “ mad as hell ” — but at whom , exactly , still remains unclear .
“ It came off pretty combative , ” the AP ’s Jane Seagrave told POLITICO Friday , “ but that really was n’t our intent . ”
Advertisement
Regardless of the AP ’s intent , Singleton 's tough talk about those who " walk off with our work " fueled speculation that search engines ( Google ) or news aggregators ( The Huffington Post ) are now in the AP ’s crosshairs .
Singleton , talking of “ misguided , unfounded legal theories , ” even raised the possibility of litigation for those not following the rules .
Seagrave , a senior vice president for global product development , stressed that “ what we ’re really trying to do is work on ways to affirm the value of original reporting . ”
Already , the AP has challenged bloggers and remains embroiled in a lawsuit against artist Shepard Fairey for allegedly basing his iconic " Hope " image of Barack Obama on an AP photograph .
Singleton signaled that the AP is ready to go further to prove that the world 's oldest news organization wo n't be put out to pasture by the new media .
But Seagrave stressed that while there is an enforcement aspect to the AP ’s new initiative , it ’s really “ more affirmative than punitive . ”
The AP is working on methods to attach rights information to content as well as create new models for distribution and revenue , she said .
While newspaper executives applaud , new media gurus scoff .
And given the complex legalities what constitutes " fair use " of AP 's content online , some media lawyers say that protecting AP 's content is easier threatened than done .
Attorney Andrew P. Bridges said that “ fair use is a lighting rod right now , ” and acknowledged that “ the notion that someone has to pay somebody else for a symbiotic relationship is in the air . ”
Bridges , who works in the San Francisco - based firm Winston & Strawn , previously defended Google in a suit alleging that its search engine was illegal ; his firm has represented the AP .
While newspaper veterans complain that aggregators make money off their content — paid for with costly newsgathering — it ’s not the first time such cross-industry relationships have led to litigation .
A few decades back , Bridges said , copyright disputes normally took place within the same industry , whether publishing , music , or movies .
But when the motion picture industry sued Sony — a non-competitor — over the video tape , Bridges contends that a new era began that continues today : Hollywood vs. Silicon Valley .
Of course , the courts decided that consumers could tape movies off television , and eventually , Hollywood benefited from the new service by selling its films to consumers on video cassettes .
Now , Bridges sees a parallel between the Betamax tape - recording case and the fight of newspaper companies against search engines and aggregators .
Effectively , Bridges noted , they ’re saying : “ You are building a business that profits from our existence , and so you ought to pay us for it . ”
“ In copyright law , ” said another attorney who ’s represented top media companies , “ fair use is one of the major fuzzy lines . ”
“ It ’s sometimes hard to make a judgment in a clear way , ” the attorney said , noting there are factors to weigh -- such as how much material is used or whether the defendant has “ supplanted the value of the copyright owner 's work . ”
Besides the murky legal issues , the attorney questioned whether the fact that news organizations have been reaping the benefits of links and traffic for years could weaken their chances of winning in court .
After addressing the Newspaper Association of America this week , Google chief executive Eric Schmidt was asked about the AP ’s aggressive posture and possible legal threats .
Schmidt , noting that Google already has a multi-million licensing deal with the AP , said he “ was a little confused ” by all the attention drawn to a potential AP vs.
Google face - off .
“ The ultimate resolution of all these will be determined by how you interpret fair use , ” Schmidt said .
“ And in my position I 've come to learn that lawyers go to different schools .
And if you went to school A you learned it one way , and if you went to school B you learned it another way , ” Schmidt continued .
“ And if you 're Google , all your lawyers went to school B , and if you 're the other side , all your lawyers went to school A . ”
While Schmidt said he was confused by Singleton ’s speech , AP critics were incensed by what sounded like a lot of foot - stomping on the part of old media without accepting that the world ’s changed .
NYU professor Adam Penenberg wrote on MarketWatch that Singleton ’s “ righteous indignation is misplaced , ” noting that aggregators and search engines push traffic to its Web sites .
“ What 's the solution ? ” Penenberg asked .
“ There is n't one .
We are in the midst of a paradigm shift .
The big media companies with huge legacy costs pertaining to gathering , printing and distributing information either will adapt or die . ”
Other critics have pointed out that the newspaper industry has had 15 years or so to incorporate the Internet into its business model .
Also , given that the AP brings in more $ 125 million annually from license agreements with online customers like Google — according to this month ’s American Journalism Review — and builds traffic through links , critics contend that search engines and aggregators are n’t the problem .
But the AP and its supporters argue that it cannot pay for costly newsgathering without being properly compensated by those making profits off their content .
That ’s the argument newspaper executives are quick to make these days :
The current setup simply is n’t fair .
“ We need to get control of our content , ” AP chief executive Tom Curley told Charlie Rose on Wednesday .
“ So what you want to do in your own judgment is restore the balance of power between the publishers of content and search engines ? ”
Rose asked .
“ That ’s right , ” Curley responded .
“ We want a fair deal . ”
But in talking about a fair deal , Curley downplayed media reports of future conflict between two media juggernauts , telling Rose that “ everybody is trying to make it into an AP - Google [ fight ] , and AP trying to out - Google Google . ”
Also noting that Google has a license agreement , Curley said that “ it ’s what happens to it in the web that goes beyond that license that we need to pull back , and that ’s what we ’re working on . ”
While Curley praised The Huffington Post , another licensee , there are clearly some fundamental differences at play .
“ You hear Arianna Huffington say we do n’t understand the link economy , ” Seagrave said .
“ There really is n’t an economy around links .
It ’s a flawed statement . ”
Huffington , while chatting with Curley and Rose , talked up the value of links and the disadvantage of media companies putting content inside a “ walled garden . ”
“ At The Huffington Post , you know , half our traffic comes from links and search , ” she told Rose .
“ So either we ’re going to really acknowledge the brave new world we ’re living in , as opposed to trying to pretend that we ’re still living in the old world , where simply content reigned supreme , then we need to see how do we monetize links .
And many are doing just that . ”
Let ’s suspend disbelief for a few minutes while we traverse together down this vast and ever - widening road , and assume for now that I am a little cartoon orphan in search of the perfect dad .
Now I am out there feverishly looking for some big fella to take me in , to nurture me in the ways of cartoon manhood , and to raise me as his very own … which does n’t , necessarily , mean that this particular animated father need a wife to , in turn , become my mother .
Oh sure , that is always a plus , but let ’s face it : more often than not , drawn moms seem to be either fiercely overbearing , closet psychopaths , or whores .
No , none of those ‘ perks ’ for this poor , haggard youth .
I need a male influence who can , when I ’m sleeping , toss a few Benjamins to Betty Boop is he so desires .
But beyond that , it ’s a boy and his pop all day long .
And what about the prospect of the guy already having a brood of his own ?
Well , of course I ’d love the perks of becoming an only child and the Richie Rich - like monetary spoiling I so obviously deserve , but , I suppose having a playmate already familiar with the old man and the ins and outs of the house for later use as potential hiding spots would come in handy .
So , as I arrive in the painted - cell world that is Cartoon Town , I really begin my hunt for the one great father - figure in this wacky insane world .
Now as I search , I would like to steer clear of the most obvious choices of folks who not only are already fathers , but are also too busy to take on another kid .
Such as : Peter Griffin , Fred Flintstone , George Jetson , or Stan Smith .
No , I think I ’d like to find a father a little less traditional .
Here ’s how it would all go down :
Huckleberry Hound
Well , he certainly seems gentle enough .
He ’s often portrayed as a member of Law Enforcement , which , in and of itself is a cool idea , but ultimately only serves as a giant thumb pushing down on the one person who might just want a little freedom as he gets old enough to go out drinking with his cartoon buds : Me .
He can certainly find interesting ways to eventually thwart the bad guys always stirring up a ruckus in his town , but he also spends much of the allotted thirty minutes of catch - and - arrest time on the receiving end of a beat - down .
No , I think this Hound Dog is just a little to passive for me .
Fred Jones
Fred solves problems .
Fred is a big hit with the ladies .
Especially the two main types in his world : swooning and air - headed fire - crotches , and painfully brainy know - it - all closet porn stars .
Now this is great , since he ’s married to neither and typically only hangs out with them when a mystery needs solving .
On top of that , he partners with a kick - ass dog who is so smart he might as well be human ( and a father , for that matter – though his rearing of the bastard Scrappy leaves a lot to be desired ) , as well as a pot smokin’ mess who could easily score me a dime now and again .
Ya know , on second thought , I would likely end up right back where I am now with the good - intentioned Fred as my dad .
Yeah , I do n’t see that ending particularly well .
For me .
Bugs Bunny
Yes , it ’s true that I am human and my dad of choice in this description is an anthropomorphic rabbit , I do n’t really see that as a problem .
Bugs is a weasel at heart and could very easily , with a modicum of effort , spring us from any lame trap we find ourselves in whether deftly set by that Jack of all things ridiculous , Pete Puma , or the ever conniving and far - too - smart - for - his - own - good , Wile E. Coyote .
Even during the times when Bugs is actually in a situation where the outcome looks bleak , a quick turn around of the would - be - killer ’s words , and BAM , he ’s out with nary a scratch .
But that , unfortunately , is the whole problem .
Even when Bugs had the opportunity to handle a baby - be them bunny or boy - he managed to get them in some really unsafe spots .
No , as much fun as Bugs would be for a father , I ’d feel far too vulnerable .
Donald Duck
Donald has quite the familial lineage that actually begins and ends with his Uncle Scrooge , perhaps one of the richest cartoon characters of all time .
This bides well for me , as befriending Donald almost to a fault would certainly get me into one of those Duck Tales adventures featuring Scrooge and Donald ’s own nephews , Huey , Dewey , and Louie .
Now that would be fun !
But you know what , the one duck I ’d choose as my father would n’t even be around to share it .
And then there ’s the little problem of Big D.’s anger management issues .
From his early days blowing up over Chip and Dale messing around in his trees , to his current job in the Mickey Mouse Club House , Donald will throw down at the drop of a hat .
Most often , his own .
No , I really do n’t need a psychopathic , ultra- aggressive , quickly frazzled water fowl teaching me right from wrong .
I will really miss those money bins , though .
Barney Rubble
First of all , this marks the first father I ’ve chosen who does have a child and is actively married to , quite possibly , the hottest female cartoon character ( with a mind of her own ) of all time – despite what some folks might lead you to believe .
To have Betty as my mom , to showcase off to my school chums and to accidentally catch coming out of the elephant shower would more than make up for Barney ’s inherent ineptitude as a man , let alone a dad .
Betty , sidling in from the hot , steamy neanderthal afternoon with that mammoth fur just sticking to her every curve … no , no I am not in this for MILFs .
Barney , however fun loving and sickeningly jovial , would really make a poor choice for a father .
He ’s rarely home , he lets Fred push him around and likely takes it out on poor , sweet , hot little Betty , and their damn kid is a brute with a massive club .
Moving on .
Homer Simpson
Boy , having been a father to three ageless children for twenty years is some feat .
Yes , though Homer is a generally lazy , beer - swilling , foul - mouthed funny fat guy , he truly does love his kids and , when he forgets just how much , Marge is right there to edge him in the right direction .
Marge herself , a Super - Mom almost to a fault , has apparently lost the ability to visually discern Homer for what he really is and chooses instead to see the forest for the trees .
For the most part Lisa and Maggie have turned out okay , and that ’s largely due to Marge ’s influence .
Bart , well , he ’d make for the best playmate of all time !
But alas , Homer is already so busy juggling the job he occasionally attends , the children he sometimes raises , and the wife he frequently forgets , that another child would be utterly impossible and likely his ultimate demise .
Bad idea .
Fat Albert
Being a rather large fellow like I am ( even as a kid ) , what could be more perfect that a big , round , jovial dude who is just about the most all “ round ” nicest guy in town .
I ’d be willing to wager that he ’d have no problem whipping some fine , down - home tasty Southern grub … goodness knows he was raised on it .
I guess I could see him not exactly excelling at sports , what with his sheer immensity , and slow , methodical run that most likely renders him out of breath for the better part of the day .
Yeah , and I suppose the whole , ‘ hanging out in a junk yard ’ thing , though really cool , would more than likely lead to some kind of Tetanus - related injury or death by hiding in refrigerator .
So , despite his happy - go - lucky appearance , Albert is not the best father figure around .
John Arbuckle
Certainly unmarried , a loner by accident more than by choice , and strangely verbal with a cat he could n’t possibly understand , John is desperate , clingy , and as needy as you please .
Obviously the most perfect choice for a future father .
On the flip - side , those very traits that make him innocent almost to the point of being juvenile are ultimately his downfall .
Being raised by John Arbuckle would be much akin to being raised by a smothering little girl to her dolls : he ’d kill you with kindness , dress you like Little Lord Fauntleroy , and basically treat you in the exact way his cat , Garfield , would never knowingly allow .
No , for a guy who can barely handle a cat and a moronic dog , John would make for a pretty creepy dad .
Papa Smurf
I guess the sign of a good father is having a slew of children who not only respect and adore you ( even though you are a communist ) , but also pretty much do whatever you tell them up to and including risking their own lives .
Oh , and did I mention he has over a hundred kids ?
Yep , and each and every one is named , every so conveniently , after what he just happens to be good at : Jokey , Vanity , Brainy … and the rest .
I suppose the only real issue would be the soul matriarchal figure in the village would more than likely snatch you up as her very own and raise you much in the same way she brought up Baby Smurf .
So named because he was , for a good long time , a baby .
Also there ’s the quite apparent situation of living in a tiny mushroom town .
So , yeah …
Papa Smurf , he ’s busy enough .
Brian Griffin
Brian is only a dog in physicality .
In spirit and in intelligence , he is all human .
Yes , Brian is an alcoholic , but he is n’t at all violent , so that can be ignored .
He is fiercely loyal to his best friend , Peter , even at the expense of his hidden love for his wife , Lois .
He is a good friend to Peter ’s older kids , Chris and Meg , and has often helped them out of uncomfortable ( for him ) situations .
And finally , Stewie , the Griffin ’s youngest and most definitely Brian ’s biggest nemesis , yet most trusted confidant .
They ’re either at each other to the point of blows , or else singing their way out of another country .
But as a father , Brian not only seems the most well suited to teach me in the ways of the world , but also the best choice for his innate ability to really love and care .
Also he can mix a mean Martini .
Yep , Brian can be my dad .
Snoop
Dogg says he was happy to rap with astronaut Buzz Aldrin , who " pushes kids to achieve their dreams " with his ShareSpace Foundation .
Their rap video , and an autobiography of Aldrin , arrives today .
Enlarge NASA via AFP Picture it , July 20 , 1969 : A photo of Buzz Aldrin on the surface of the Moon as taken by fellow astronaut and the first man on the noon , Neil Armstrong .
Apologies to American Idol 's Randy Jackson , but yo , dawg , check it !
MC
Buzz is out of this world and in the house .
And , admittedly , just a little bit pitchy .
Astronaut Buzz Aldrin , 79 , who has had his share of rendezvous with pop culture , launches three projects today , including a rap video that features Snoop Dogg , Soulja Boy and Quincy Jones .
What can the real Buzz Lightyear be thinking ?
THE FIRST MOONWALK : Share your memories FUNNY OR DIE : See the ' Rocket Experience ' spoof " I 'm not too good at carrying a tune , but I do have rhythm , " says Aldrin , who got the idea from a family member who felt the genre would have a broad reach .
Aldrin's ShareSpace Foundation , which promotes science and exploration , is one of three beneficiaries of the song 's iTunes sales .
" I want kids interested in space .
It 's their future . "
Aldrin 's triple threat , which lands today , includes the single Rocket Experience and an autobiography ( with Ken Abraham ) , Magnificent Desolation : The Long Journey Home From the Moon ( Harmony , $ 27 ) .
The track takes listeners back to the first lunar landing 40 years ago in July .
The book plumbs Aldrin 's alcoholism battles after following in Neil Armstrong 's big bootsteps .
But the biggest splash may come from a video now playing on FunnyOrDie .com , Will Ferrell 's comedy website .
With a nod to Spinal Tap , this " making of Rocket Experience " spoof features Jones , a longtime friend , riffing about Aldrin 's " great groove . "
" Buzz has got the biggest buzz on the streets right now , " Snoop Dogg says .
" He 's got Talib Kweli and ( me ) in the studio with him , and I only work with the best . "
On a more serious note , the rapper says he signed on " because ( Aldrin ) pushes kids to achieve their dreams . "
Kweli says he and Snoop " both have kids , and to tell them we hung with Buzz gets your inner geek fired up . "
Rounding up talent to make the video was easy given Aldrin 's fame , says FunnyOrDie producer Mike Farah .
But persuading the astronaut — whose flag - in - hand image inspired MTV 's " moon man " video music award — to play it funny was another matter .
" He was n't into doing a comedy video at first , " Farah says .
" But when we heard he was rapping , that was it . "
As for Aldrin , he says rapping with Snoop Dogg proved almost as daunting as space .
" Snoop had this great hand language going as he sang , which was hard for me , " Aldrin says .
" But when it comes to getting people 's attention , comedy goes a long way . "

SEOUL , South Korea  Former President Roh Moo-hyun of South Korea , whose reputation as an upstanding political leader had been tarnished recently by a corruption scandal , committed suicide on Saturday by jumping off a cliff near his retirement home , according to his aides and the police .
Mr. Roh , 62 , died while he was hiking on a hill in Bongha , a village near the southeast corner of South Korea , Moon Jae-in , Mr. Roh ’s former presidential chief of staff , said during a news conference .
He left a brief will for his family , Mr. Moon said .
Mr. Roh suffered fatal head injuries and was declared dead in a hospital in Pusan , the largest regional city , said Park Chan - jo , a police officer .
Mr. Roh was accompanied by a bodyguard during his morning hike .
President Lee Myung - bak , Mr. Roh ’s successor , found the news “ difficult to believe , ” his office said .
A quick guide to Montana ’s most notable local food , whether restaurants , farmer ’s markets , or even wild edibles you can stop and pick along the way .
This article has been created in partnership between Matador and our friends at the State of Montana .
Montanans are resourceful .
Whether they ’re hunting , gathering , or growing , folks in the Big Sky know how to squeeze the most succulent and sometimes strange sustenance from the short and vibrant summers , quick falls and springs , and extended winters .
And yet Montana is so big ( 147,138 square miles of land , with over 60 million acres in agricultural production ) you can live there for a decade and not know what lies over the next range .
Here is a glimpse of choice and local morsels that can be discovered between Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks .
Whether you want old - school Montana eats or contemporary cuisine , our guide includes a healthy mix of decadence and the just plain weird .
A Few Tips :
There are ample farm stands and markets selling wild and farmed foods , including salad greens , Dixon melons , sun-gold tomatoes , huckleberries , peach pie , and fresh lavender .
Some of them are listed here .
Montana is rich with wild food : morel mushrooms , huckleberries , fish , and game .
These foods have a cultish appeal .
If you are intrigued enough to pursue them yourself , it ’s important to know the rules of the game and do n’t hesitate to ask how they are harvested when you purchase them at market .
You may see trout , elk , and bison on restaurant menus .
While these could be local , they are n’t wild — these meats are regulated by law and are therefore farmed , which plays into their sustainability factor .
It is n’t feasible for most venues to offer everything local , so expect seasonal selections .
Ask what ’s local and how it made it to your plate or shopping bag .

Python micro frameworks are all the rage these days
update : I ’ve added bottle and werkzeug based on feedback from comments .
Thanks !
It ’s never been easier to setup a web app :
web.py , werkzeug and webapp have some additional features , and are considered as lightweight frameworks instead .
I prefer the url dictionnary approach ( mnml , newf , webpy ) to the decorator approach ( juno ) .
djng is bit different , routing is based on the django module ( from django.conf.urls .defaults import url ) .
micro frameworks + key - value stores are a match made in heaven for webservices development .
NEW HAVEN  Frank Ricci has been a firefighter here for 11 years , and he would do just about anything to advance to lieutenant .
The last time the city offered a promotional exam , he said in a sworn statement , he gave up a second job and studied up to 13 hours a day .
Mr. Ricci , who is dyslexic , paid an acquaintance more than $ 1,000 to read textbooks onto audiotapes .
He made flashcards , took practice tests , worked with a study group and participated in mock interviews .
Mr. Ricci did well , he said , coming in sixth among the 77 candidates who took the exam .
But the city threw out the test , because none of the 19 African - American firefighters who took it qualified for promotion .
That decision prompted Mr. Ricci and 17 other white firefighters , including one Hispanic , to sue the city , alleging racial discrimination .
Their case , which will be argued before the Supreme Court on April 22 , is the Roberts court ’s first major confrontation with claims of racial discrimination in employment and will require the justices to choose between conflicting conceptions of the government ’s role in ensuring fair treatment regardless of race .
Welfare rolls , which were slow to rise and actually fell in many states early in the recession , now are climbing across the country for the first time since President Bill Clinton signed legislation pledging " to end welfare as we know it " more than a decade ago .
Twenty - three of the 30 largest states , which account for more than 88 % of the nation 's total population , see welfare caseloads above year - ago levels , according to a survey conducted by The Wall Street Journal and the National Conference of State Legislatures .

Jewish Israelis are very diverse .
In a nation whose immigrants come from countries and cultures far and wide , pluralism often refers to tolerance among different cultural groups of Jews .
But diversity discourse in Israel differs considerably when it comes to interaction with non-Jewish groups .
Rival historic , religious and national narratives make real diversity a tough principle to practice .
Most Christians in Israel are Arabs , a minority within a minority squeezed between different layers of conflict .
Christians account for 2.1 % of the population .
Israel 's non-Arab Christians are mainly immigrants from the former Soviet Union , foreign workers , resident clergy and even Catholic Jews .
And Jewish Israelis do n't quite know how to perceive any of them -- for cultural , national and religious reasons .
Fifty - two percent of Jewish Israelis have no Christian friends or acquaintances , but almost 100 % of them have opinions about them .
A recent poll surveyed attitudes among the adult Jewish population toward Christians , Christianity and the Christian presence in Israel .
The results of the survey , carried out by the Jerusalem Center for Jewish - Christian Relations ( JCJCR ) and the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies ( JIIS ) , shed light on how Jewish Israelis perceive Christians and what they know about them , or think they do know .
Generally , most answers showed that the higher the level of religious observance , the more negative the attitude toward Christians .
Such attitudes also were seen the lower the level of age , income and education .
The following numbers mostly refer to the overall sample , but keep in mind the observance breakdown of the respondents : 23 % Orthodox , 24 % traditional and 53 % secular .
Late Friday night , New York Times reporter David Rohde and his assistant Tahir Ludin slipped over the wall of the Taliban compound where they were being held in Pakistan ’s North Waziristan and made their way to safety at America ’s Bagram Airbase in Afghanistan after seven months in captivity .
Mr. Rohde , who won a Pulitzer prize in 1996 for uncovering the massacre of Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica while working for The Christian Science Monitor , and this year for his role in the New York Times ’s coverage of Afghanistan and Pakistan , had been held since Nov. 10 , 2008 .
He , Mr. Ludin , and their driver , Asadullah Mangal , were kidnapped outside Kabul .
Mr. Mangal did not escape with his colleagues .
Rohde ’s kidnapping had been kept largely quiet by the world ’s media , following the lead of the Times and the urging of the family , both of which were concerned that coverage of the kidnapping would put the three men ’s lives at greater risk .
“ From the early days of this ordeal , the prevailing view among David ’s family , experts in kidnapping cases , officials of several government and others we consulted was that going public could increase the danger , ” the Times quoted Bill Keller , its executive editor , as saying .
“ We decided to respect that advice … and a number of other news organizations that learned of David ’s plight have done the same .
We are enormously grateful for their support . ”
The extended media blackout , its effectiveness , and whether the press is guilty of a double standard – protecting its own while reporting on other kidnapping cases – is likely to be the subject of extended debate in the days ahead .
He was already in captivity when it was announced that he was among a team of reporters at The New York Times who had won a Pulitzer this spring .
When Monitor reporter Jill Carroll was kidnapped in Iraq in 2006 , the paper was criticized in some quarters for seeking a brief news blackout .
That effort ended after about two days , with major news outlets saying they could not continue to sit on a significant story .
Given that Ms. Carroll ’s captors were eager for publicity – issuing a number of videos to Arab TV stations – keeping the story quiet for a long time would have proved impossible .
Keller said that Rohde ’s captors had initially asked for no publicity , and so complied with that demand .
The captors ’ views apparently changed as time went on , with the release of at least two videos that were produced and sent to Arab TV networks , though they were not given extended air play at the urging of the Times .
The way the Times handled Rohde 's case reflects the set of informal rules the press is developing to deal with new kinds of conflict , and the new kinds of reporting that they require .
Since the Iraq war began , 57 journalists have been kidnapped and 87 killed there .
Last November , Melissa Fung , a reporter for the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. , was released in Afghanistan after enduring a month of captivity , much of it bound in a small hole .
The media also observed a news blackout in that case .
“ We have competing interests in these cases – we have the primary obligation of journalists to report in a timely , comprehensive manner on significant events , ’’ says Bob Steele , an expert on ethics and journalism at the Poynter Institute .
“ But I also believe that we also have an obligation to minimize harm . ”
He says there are no hard and fast rules for such situations – “ I think that rules imply rigidity , and rigidity greatly diminishes good ethical decisionmaking . ”
Mr. Steele notes that it ’s important to consider the specific case : who the kidnappers might be , what the special vulnerabilities of the captors might be – and to listen to the opinions of governments , businesses , and others who have a stake in the outcome .
“ The trick is to make journalistic and ethical decisions in a fashion that is not unduly influenced by , say , pressure from terrorists , the self - interest we have in protecting one of our own , or the potential connections we have with government agencies , ” he says .
As to a possible double standard , “ I think that is a weak spot in the underbelly of the decision making in these cases .
We show a preference for one of our own in journalism generally by holding back a story or elements of a story compared to how we might cover the kidnapped oil field worker or diplomat or tourist .
In those cases , we might not bring as serious a deliberative process to how we ’re going to cover it . ”
This is the second time Rohde has been kidnapped in a war zone .
While reporting in 1995 on the massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and children at Srebrenica , during the Bosnian War , he was arrested and held by Bosnian Serbs for 10 days .
Clay Jones , the Monitor ’s chief editorial writer and its foreign editor in 1995 , says The New York Times had “ consulted us , given our experience rescuing David after his 10 - day capture in Bosnia – and we had extensive experience in dealing with the US government and his family . ”
Mr. Jones described Rohde as “ a classic foxhole reporter – you want him on your side .
He obviously takes a lot of risks but he gets good stories … he ’s a reporter ’s reporter . ”
The US government was involved in working to win the men ’s release in this case , with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton meeting with members of the family , as well as Richard Holbrooke , the US special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan , who knew Rohde in Bosnia and helped secure his release when he was captured there .
At the time of the three men ’s kidnapping , Rohde was finishing up reporting on a book project and was not on assignment for the Times .
He married Kristen Mulvihill just two months before his capture .
Ms. Mulvihill told the Times after she spoke with her husband that he and Ludin “ just walked over the wall of the compound , ” from where they made their way to a nearby Pakistani Frontier Corps base .
On Saturday morning , they were flown to Bagram .
The Times said that no ransom was paid for the men ’s release .
“ The family is so grateful to everyone who has helped — The New York Times , the US government , all the others , ” Ms. Mulvihill was quoted as saying by the Times .
“ Now we just hope to have a chance to reunite with him in peace . ”
Rohde was to head to Dubai to meet his wife and family .
Mr. Mangal , the driver who is still being held , has two children , and Mr. Ludin is the sole provider for his large family of two wives , seven children , a sister , and his elderly parents .
He was an English teacher before he moved to Kabul to start working with Western journalists , arranging numerous face - to - face meetings between journalists and the Taliban .
The New York Times paid a monthly salary to both men ’s families during the captivity , according to Farouq Samim , an Afghan reporting assistant or “ fixer ” who was hired for a month - and - a - half by the New York Times to help Afghanistan Bureau Chief Carlotta Gall work for Rohde ’s release .
“ A journalist is someone who is on no side and a friend of everybody … and David and Taher were those kinds of journalists , ” said Mr. Samim .
Ben Arnoldy contributed reporting from Kabul , Afghanistan .
Raph Koster makes a pretty good case for 1971 being the perfect year to be born geek .
I 'm biased ( born : July 17 , 1971 ) , of course :
* It meant I got to see Star Wars in the theater , 13 times , at age 8 and 9 , exactly when it would overwhelm my sense of wonder .
* I got an 8 - bit computer at exactly the age when boys get obsessive about details , and I spent days PEEKing and POKEing and typing in listings from magazines and learning how computers actually worked .
* It meant at least half the new games I played were actually new ideas .
* And yet I got to play real pinball machines .
* In real arcades .
* New Wave science fiction was the used paperbacks laying around , and I got to read cyberpunk and steampunk as they were invented , and see SF when fandom was not yet a media circus .
* I got to play D&D from as close to the beginning as most anyone .
Julie and I recently finished watching season four of “ How I Met Your Mother ” .
It ’s obviously just “ Friends ” 2.0 , but I ’ve grown to enjoy it .
I like how the show gets very post - modern with plots and time lines .
Plus , of course , Neil Patrick Harris is kind of a revelation .
This season both of the female leads , Alyson Hannigan and Cobie Smulders , were pregnant .
In the second half of the season , I enjoyed watching the meta - show of “ Conceal the Pregnancies ” .
The show ’s producers devised all sorts of creative strategies to hide the actresses ’ growing bumps .
You ’ve got the clothing options , which the show deployed early on .
There ’s the big flowy scarf , the loose - fitting shirt and the big dressing gown :
Several variations of the big bag :
The rather unconvincing newspaper :
The cereal box :
Finally , if you ’re looking for something really formidable , just have the actor stand behind something solid , like a cooler :
Or , she can carry something and stand behind something :
I posted a photo set of 18 bump - hiding tactics on Flickr .
In what I ’d imagine to be a nod to this issue , both actress ’s characters make a joke about being pregnant in the final episodes of this season .
I ’m not sure what the thesis would be , but there ’s surely a Women ’s Studies essay in the metaphor of hiding these women ’s pregnancies .
What ’s the opposite of ’ emasculated ’ ?
0:36 Intro . [ Recording date : May 7 , 2009 ]
Standard argument : Invention , ideas need to be protected by copyright and patent to give people incentives to produce them .
Existence of intellectual property : property rights should be clearly defined and protected , but this particular one is inefficient .
Neither theoretical nor practical reason .
Standard argument : come up with new idea , work hard , invest ; if no exclusive rights to concept , new competitors can quickly come in and use that hard work , so no incentive .
Seems logical .
Two different points of view .
First , practical : new idea -- open pizza parlor , sell jeans in a particular street , making this gadget rather than that gadget , cell phone that is a little computer .
We would not like the idea that the first person to open a jeans shop in that area to have exclusive rights .
We want competition , lower cost , better quality .
Sounds like it works -- we want to have imitation .
Imitation is price - taking in mathematical model ; in reality , we look at what others do and see if it is good and try to do the good things and not the bad things ; price equalization to extent things are similar .
Do again : Very high fixed costs , so if you do n't allow person to have some rents over and above the opportunity costs , people would not be willing to afford the initial fixed costs .
Idea is not new - - dates to Alfred Marshall , late 1800s .
Market for shoes with laces : sets up factory , implies fixed cost , with constant returns to scale up to that capacity , certain marginal cost .
Below that capacity , he is earning a rent , because this initially has low capacity and high demand as a new product .
The rent will cover the fixed cost and more , per Marshall .
Somebody looks and imitates , sets up another factory for shoes with laces ; capacity goes up , quantity sold goes up , price goes down along demand curve , till eventually the price goes the point where the extra rents over the marginal cost covers just right the fixed cost of the last plant built .
Long run competitive equilibrium , no further entry .
Why does n't this work for most innovation ?
Patents are subset .
So maybe patents are n't really needed .
9:02 Many innovations take place without patents .
Innovator has a choice .
Patent has cost : out of pocket cost and risk that by patenting the idea that you open the opportunity for competitors to work around it .
In back of our minds , patents are the seed that lead to the potential and then the fruit ; but historically , patents come in after the fact to keep out competitors after the innovation has taken place .
Look at all of the innovation of the 20th century .
Origin of the industry , flurry of small innovators competing , with very little patenting .
Bill Gates , PC and the internet ; his words : if we had had patents and copyright in the 1970s there would be no software industry .
When a new industry comes around , like cellphones , all copy each other like crazy .
Exactly what Marshall was describing .
Possibilities to improve is large .
Opportunity cost of wasting time fighting legally is great when instead can be improving the new product .
Sufficient profits in the early days .
Technical work that led to the conclusions of the book is that it does allow for patents to be useful in special circumstances .
If cost of innovating is gigantic and it is really easy to imitate , really easy to expand capacity very easily , then argument fails .
Empirical argument .
Book available online free or at Amazon .
Historical case studies .
15:01 Two things come to mind about it being an empirical question .
Economists look for proofs : high fixed costs justify patents .
But lots of cases where fixed costs are not particularly large or where so much opportunity for innovation and profits that the fixed - cost issue is n't important ; and then you have to look at the incentives .
Turn to the government to keep out competitors even if there is no good economic case .
But economists have given people the cover .
Socially productive : while it may be true that imitation can quickly lower the returns to all the effort and hurt profits and reduce incentives , what that does it is encourages inventors to compete on things other than just price .
So , find firms looking for ways to make their products more useful , more customized .
Should I turn efforts to rent - seeking and the government or to the consumer to make product more valuable ?
Only when the industry matures that innovating becomes harder , rate of return has gone down , that having patents available becomes a way of making money .
Presence of patents is huge incentive to put efforts into rent seeking .
Empirical part : externality new discovery of last 25 years in economics .
One way of justifying patents is through externalities -- big externality of imitation .
I 'm copying you and you know that so you under - invest .
Good argument ; how relevant in practice .
Singapore colleague .
Travel Pro example : first company to come up with the rolling suitcase .
Quickly imitated , anyone can see carry - ons .
Took a while to see that even four wheels could be better .
Did n't patent the idea , but still in business , making profits .
Had some lead time .
Copyright : completely confused .
argument is that if the musician does n't make tens of millions of dollars , he wo n't sing any more .
Become a ditch - digger ; we 'll lose Beethoven , Paul Simon , etc .
Do we encourage it too much ?
Could be too little .
Copyright in music is late , second half of 19th century ; son of Bach complains to Parliament .
In that short period , extended .
Market size multiplied greatly .
Now , superstar musicians make so much compared to Frank Sinatra that there is no comparison .
Should lead us to pause .
Is opportunity cost to Britney Spears so large that she has to make ten times as much as Frank Sinatra ?
Beatles had low opportunity costs , good at nothing ; but some stars today would be doing derivatives , quantitative finance .
Compensate them to keep them in the music world .
Obviously the profits will go down if you cut copyright to ten years .
But would open doors to many more musicians .
24:17 Friends who are intellectual property lawyers ; like the artists , self - interested .
Have to concede that profits will go down .
Worry is that they 'll go to zero .
Napster came along , was thriving .
Listeners wanted Napster to thrive ; artists not so happy ; what should economists on the outside argue ?
Napster certainly dented CD sales .
If it was legal , would the profits be sufficient , or is that an empirical question we do n't have the answer to ?
We did at the time .

Napster was legal given the laws at the time .
Showed what current technology allowed .
Useful provocation .
But in 1999 - 2000 could n't tell what final outcome would have been ; but now we can tell .
Check what 's online .
Pirate for scientific permission ; university was blocking it .
Time - consuming to use it .
Everything available , but not a big dent in CD market .
Time - consuming to find things , sometimes do n't find it or it is incomplete , quality not good .
Invention of digital distribution of music has not been exploited by the industry because there are no incentives because of the copyright .
Fat and happy .
In the ten years , music industry has made only small steps toward doing what Napster was doing .
Proof that badly allocated intellectual property creates bad incentives for innovation .
Two arguments about that kind of example .
Quality not as high , but quality is really quite good , good enough for a lot of people ; save the $ 10 from iTunes to get free copy from elsewhere .
Russ 's article on Napster .
It ignored the potential for private solutions to emerge to make those distribution methods useful to consumers .
Minimum example : maybe you wo n't make money on recorded music , but on concerts .
Maybe find ways to make your music more usable -- come with the lyric sheet , video , who knows what people would come up with .
Video tape -- Larry Lessig story -- movie industry initially afraid that it would destroy their industry .
Worried people would crowd into the room , private neighborhood theaters .
But movie theaters have gotten better .
Round - table discussion : in music industry , technological progress .
Nothing to do with the pirates .
Those hurt will try to fight it .
Same in other industries : GM , Chrysler ; steel .
Some losers , want to spread around the extra butter , but legal defense of the monopoly position wo n't hold water .
Can still have to pay $ 20 for a CD for music that you could pay on the internet only a couple of bucks .
Surprised iTunes is still $ 9.99 for a CD .
Policy statement .
Pay for one tune and share with 9 buddies .
Buy about 10 - 15 % of what is on an iPod .
Close to the marginal cost .
If you could download it for $ 5 , lots of people would refrain from doing the free downloading .
Ethical things : it costs so little so why risk it .
Distribution system is providing something of value .
35:34 Going to get to pharmaceuticals , but first : Who disagrees ?
Some would be lawyers ; some people who currently have monopoly power ; any in economics profession ?
What is counter - argument ?
One area from the start for warm reception was actually the academic legal side .
Legal scholars who work on intellectual are painfully aware that it is problematic .
Mark Lemly , copyright so out of control that it has to be scaled back , pure rent seeking .
Practicing lawyers do n't react very well .
In economic profession , most negative reaction from new growth , endogenous growth literature , Paul Romer : argument was that fixed costs play a role in spurring growth .
Paul 's argument ( Boldrin was a student of Romer and Roberts while at Rochester ) : innovation technology , " blueprints " in a production function , are public goods and as such they are non-rivalrous and without legal protection non-excludable .
Hence there is increasing return .
Increasing return comes from the externality and the externality from the blueprint .
Productive ideas , once discovered , can be used by everybody at essentially zero cost .
We want a lot of those because they are productive ; since profitability is tough to sell , we want to protect them temporarily with monopoly .
That is wrong at the start : confuses abstract ideas with actual productive ideas .
Productive ideas , that have social value , are completely rivalrous and excludable .
How do Russ and Michele earn a living ?
Complete mystery .
Give away tons of stuff -- podcast , blog , express themselves , teaching strange activity , why do people pay as much as they do for it ?
Undergrads are paying for Russ and other economists to explain demand curves , which have been around for a century and can be read about for free .
Students irrational ?
Because it 's not true that the idea once discovered can be used by everyone .
There are a lot of potential ideas .
2 + 2 = 4 is nonrivalrous .
Copy in my brain and your brain , but it 's the copy in my brain that is useful and that is totally rivalrous .
Non-rivalrous means that more people can enjoy it at the same time than just the owner .
43:43 History of economic thought ; told Ken Arrow ten years ago .
Paper , 1962 , Nelson , Arrow , on information .
Talks briefly about innovation : ideas of innovation are public goods and as such should be financed by the public purse .
Ken is making a mistake : confusing abstract ideas with actual ideas that are the opposite .
New growth theory in the 1980s .
Ken Arrow was pushing the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) .
Government support of research argued to be crucial because of externalities ; but in fact it 's been very useful for the economists who got the checks but benefits that spilled over to others are limited , some maybe negative .
Have cake and eat it .
Case of medicine , pharmaceuticals : publicly funded research , patentable ideas turned into private monopoly .
Most of the benefits captured by the monopoly .
Bhide podcast : distinction between most public ideas and how they are implemented .
Camera in a phone .
In 1970 , would have been laughable .
Someone has that idea ; once produced , can't be hidden .
But the whole value of that is the implementation -- how it 's put into the phone , what you do with the phone , can you email it , put it on a website , what 's the quality ?
Much less public than the idea itself .
One - click button .
Patenting of everything no matter how small can block thousands of other products .
Political process favors existing competitor at expense of would - be competitor .
Would n't abolish patents and copyright overnight .
Shortening , not lengthening , the term would be a good experiment .
50:49 Pharmaceuticals .
Standard argument is that the fixed costs are extremely high ; research is very uncertain ; so return is very uncertain ; so without patent protection people would not seek out new products .
True answer is that we do n't know enough about it .
Companies are very secretive about it .
Both true and false .
Most of the cost has nothing to do with the process of invention , but with clinical trials .
About 80 % is clinical trials , necessary to get FDA approval .
Second point : look at where in recent two decades at where the effective active components come from , they come from small labs .
University labs mostly financed by public money and licensed to large company , NIH , NSF .
Create a small company , one - product company , patent it , develop it , then call big pharmaceutical to sell it to do the legal work and marketing .
Brilliant researcher in small lab -- what would he be doing in absence of this patent process ?
Do n't have an answer , not enough data .
Bayh - Dole Act. Pharmaceutical profits have gone up .
Others look at that and " blame " pharmaceutical companies .
Legal side .
Swiss chemical pharmaceutical industry most amazing -- thrived without patents until 1978 .
No patents because of the constitution , French - speaking part of Switzerland .
Huge lobbying pressure mostly from Anglo - Saxons all over Europe .
Italy .
Germany -- big chemical industry origin , we took technology after WWII .
Natural product can't be patented , but processes can be .
Led to German industry becoming the dominant one at end of the 19th century .
59:47 Pharmaceuticals : clinical trials .
Public money if anything should be there .
We want the tests as a public concern , afraid of principal / agent problem : they have an interest in saying it 's safe .
Also could argue that private testing agencies with reputations would emerge .
Two approaches : let 's redesign old mechanism , or do n't trust market , political reality , public monitoring .
NIH money produces private goods ; should go to clinical tests on competitive basis instead .
Licensing model , mandatory license , price is the cost .
Indian case : Ron Jones .
Jury is out .
India had thriving pharmaceutical industry .
Experiment is being carried out .

At least 20 people were killed and nearly 300 injured yesterday when a hospital in the last area of Sri Lanka held by the Tamil Tigers was shelled in what one doctor described as the worst day of bloodshed since the start of the military campaign .
The doctor , Thangamutha Sathiyamorthy , blamed the Sri Lankan army for firing shells that landed next to two health facilities in Putumattalan , on the northern end of the tiny strip of the Sri Lankan coastline where tens of thousands of civilians are trapped by the fighting .
The military strenuously denied the allegation .
Sathiyamorthy said 22 people , including an 18 - month - old child and a medical worker , were killed and 283 injured in the attack , which started soon after dawn yesterday .
He described how he found dead and wounded civilians on the site of the first blasts , which occurred as about 500 people queued beside a mother and baby clinic to receive milk powder and food rations .
" We were ready to distribute at 7.30 , there were 500 people waiting , then suddenly shells fell , " he said .
Half an hour later he went back to assess the damage .
" I saw there were bloodstains on the road , I saw there were slippers and sandals . "
He said he saw five bodies still lying on the ground .
" One was about a one - and - a - half - year - old child , another was a 30 - year - old lady - she had four children - another one a 60 - year - old man , he died while he was sleeping , and another lady died at home ...
These were the bodies I found . "
The 39 - year - old doctor , the regional director of Kilinochchi health service , said more people were killed and injured in two subsequent attacks .
In the final attack , at about 11 am , one member of the hospital staff was killed and another seriously injured .
" Everyone clearly knows it has come from the Sri Lankan army side ... all shells come from their direction , " he said .
The International Committee of the Red Cross said one of its aid workers was killed in shelling in the region yesterday , but it was not immediately clear if it was the same incident .
International media are not permitted to enter the no-fire zone to verify claims .
The Sri Lankan military said it was aware that there had been a number of explosions yesterday morning , shortly after it broadcast a final offer for the rebels to surrender .
But military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara categorically denied that Sri Lankan forces were responsible for the shelling .
He said troops had reported hearing explosions from within the zone but suggested they may have been Tamil Tiger mortar fire .
He said no artillery had been used by government forces for weeks .
Since stepping up the military campaign since the start of the year the Sri Lankan armed forces have driven the last remnants of the once - powerful Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) into a narrow strip of land estimated to be no larger than 20 sq km .
Estimates of the number of civilians trapped alongside them vary , with the UN putting the figure at about 100,000 and Sri Lankan authorities claiming it is no more than 40,000 .
Yesterday Sathiyamorthy said conditions inside the no-fire zone were now desperate , with 13 people dead from starvation and 69 % of children below the age of five showing signs of malnutrition .
" Of course the food supply is inadequate .
Many children are at risk .
Yesterday we distributed milk powder and I saw very thin children coming to the clinic , " he said .
He estimated that more than 5,000 people had died since the start of the latest offensive .
" Every day they expect some solution because everybody was asked to go to the no-fire zone , but actually the people reached this area and unfortunately the government is shelling this area , " he said .
" It is a real disaster .
We did n't expect this amount of disaster . "
Medical staff have set up a temporary hospital in a former school to try to cope with the casualties .
Sathiyamorthy said 75 % of the civilians trapped in the zone were living in closely packed tarpaulin shelters and were extremely vulnerable to shelling .
He estimated that about 100 people a day were being injured and that , of those , about 20 died every day in the hospital .
Another 30 or 40 a day were dying outside the hospital , he said , but no accurate figure was available .
" The civilians do n't have the facility to take them to hospitals so whenever that happens they are burying them by the site or near places , " he said .
The Sri Lankan army believes it is close to a total victory , but faces a dilemma over how to extract the remaining LTTE fighters from among the civilians .

Klaus Bade erklärt das Dilemma gerne an dem Beispiel eines befreundeten Diplom - Ingenieurs .
Als dieser Anfang der 90er - Jahre die Ukraine verließ und nach Deutschland kam , war er etwa um die 40 Jahre alt , im besten Erwerbsalter also und hatte gerade ein hochkarätig besetztes Projekt zum Thema Kältetechnik geleitet .
Sein Examen wurde in Deutschland nicht anerkannt .
" Der Mann arbeitet heute als Taxifahrer “ , sagt Bade , Migrationsforscher und Vorsitzender des Sachverständigenrats deutscher Stiftungen für Integration und Migration ( SVR ) .
Als der Ingenieur neulich in einer Fernsehsendung porträtiert wurde , rief der Leiter der deutschen Filiale eines internationalen Kältetechnikkonzerns an und bat mit den Worten „ Den Mann brauchen wir , und zwar dringend ! “ um seine Telefonnummer .
Der so plötzlich Umworbene jedoch lehnte das Stellenangebot ab .
Nachdem sein Mühen um eine seiner Qualifikation entsprechenden Arbeit in Deutschland jahrelang vergeblich war , hat er sich das aufgebaut , was Bade eine „ Ersatzkarriere “ nennt :
In seinem kleinen Taxiunternehmen beschäftigt er nun zwei Fahrer .
Die will er nicht entlassen für eine Stelle , für die er sich mit Ende 50 erst noch ein , zwei Jahre qualifizieren muss , damit Deutschland seine Abschlüsse anerkennt , die er für diese Arbeit benötigt .
Anzeige
„ So etwas nennt man Verschleuderung von Humankapital “ , sagt Prof. Bade .
„ Wir sind dumm genug , hervorragend qualifizierte deutsche Abwanderer ziehen zu lassen und gleichzeitig qualifizierte Zuwanderer zu verprellen . “
Und weil sich herumgesprochen hat , wie viele Hürden Ärzte , Ingenieure , Lehrer oder Mathematiker überwinden müssen , machen hoch qualifizierte Fachkräfte oft einen Bogen um Deutschland – und gehen lieber nach Australien oder in die Schweiz , in die USA oder in jüngster Zeit auch nach Großbritannien .
Neun Wissenschaftler des SVR haben in den vergangenen Monaten unter Bades Leitung untersucht , wie Abwanderung , Zuwanderung und Integration das Qualifikationsniveau der Erwerbsbevölkerung in Deutschland verändert .
Das Fazit des Informationspapiers „ personalpolitische Potenziale der Firma Deutschland “ ist alarmierend .
Jährlich wandern zehntausende von oft gut qualifizierten Deutschen im besten Erwerbsalter ab , nur ein Teil von ihnen kehrt zurück .
Seit 2003 hat Deutschland fast 180.000 Staatsangehörige an andere OECD - Staaten abgegeben .
Die Fortzüge Deutscher sind in den vergangenen Jahren rasant gestiegen .
Seit mehr als 15 Jahren übersteigt die Zahl der Abwanderer die der Rückkehrer .
Und die Zahl der Zuwanderer sinkt .
Anzeige
Besonders auffällig ist die Entwicklung bei den Medizinern : allein 2008 sind über 3000 vorwiegend in Deutschland ausgebildete Ärzte ins Ausland abgewandert .
Unter vorsichtigen der Annahme , dass ein Drittel von ihnen dauerhaft im Ausland bleibt , entgehen dem deutschen Staat etwa knapp 1,1 Milliarden Euro .
Er finanziert die Ausbildung , doch seine Steuern zahlt der Akademiker in einem anderen Land .
70 Prozent von 4000 befragten Medizinstudenten können sich gut vorstellen nach dem Examen im Ausland zu arbeiten .
Das Grundproblem : Während diejenigen , die Deutschland verlassen , wesentlich besser qualifiziert sind als die durchschnittliche Erwerbsbevölkerung , liegt die Qualifikation der ausländischen Zuwanderer deutlich unter diesem Niveau .
Deutschland gehört zu dem Land mit den am niedrigsten qualifizierten Zuwanderern von allen OECD - Ländern .
Selbst bei der heranwachsenden neuen Elite der Einwanderungsbevölkerung in Deutschland zeichnet sich ein Trend zur Abwanderung ab .
Nach einer jüngst veröffentlichten Studie des Instituts futureorg erwägen 38 Prozent der Studierenden türkischer Herkunft nach Abschluss ihres Studiums in die Türkei abzuwandern .
Gut Ausgebildete gehen , schlecht – oder gar nicht – Ausgebildete kommen .
„ So trägt Migration in Deutschland letztendlich zur Dequalifizierung der Erwerbsbevölkerung bei “ , sagt Bade .
Alarmierend für ein Land , das kaum über Bodenschätze verfügt , sondern nur „ über Produktion und Export wissensintensiver Produkte und Dienstleistungen “ , wie es in der SVR - Studie heißt , also letztlich nur mit exzellenter Bildung international wettbewerbsfähig bleiben kann .
Anzeige
Die alternde Bevölkerung und die geringe Geburtenrate in bildungsnahen Familien sollte durch qualifizierte Zuwanderer abgefedert werden , so lautete die romantische Hoffnung .
Doch diese Feder scheint zu brechen ; denn es sind zu wenige und überdies oft die falschen , die kommen .
„ Dass die Politik hier nicht den Mut zu Veränderungen hat , liegt daran , dass wir Zuwanderung in der Vergangenheit immer nur als humanitäre Frage angesehen haben “ , sagt Hilmar Schneider vom Bonner Institut zur Zukunft der Arbeit ( IZA ) .
Die Folge sei , dass Ausländer als arme Schlucker wahrgenommen würden , die die Sozialkassen belasteten .
Oft mache sich niemand ernsthaft die Mühe , ihre Qualifikation zu prüfen : „ Da bleiben die auf der Strecke , die wir gut gebrauchen könnten . “
Dabei wurde in den vergangenen fünf Jahren soviel getan wie in den letzten 50 Jahren nicht .
Die Politik scheint nach einer ausgiebigen Schlafphase endlich erwacht .
Angela Merkel spricht nun davon , dass Zuwanderung „ immer auch eine Bereicherung “ sei und auch Maria Böhmer ( CDU ) , Integrations - Beauftragte der Bundesregierung , propagiert jetzt die gezielte Förderung von Migranten .
Durch das 2005 in Kraft getretene Zuwanderungsgesetz wurden die nahezu unüberwindbaren Hürden für hoch qualifizierte Zuwanderer zögerlich herab gesetzt .
Das vom Arbeitgeber nachzuweisende Mindestgehalt in Höhe von 84.600 Euro wurde auf 64.800 Euro abgesenkt .
Ausländische Unternehmer erhielten ursprünglich nur dann eine Niederlassungserlaubnis , wenn sie mindestens 500.000 Euro investieren und zehn Arbeitsplätze schaffen .
Jetzt sind es noch 250.000 Euro und fünf Arbeitsplätze .
„ Es wurde unlängst viel investiert in Richtung Integrationsförderung “ , sagt Bade , „ das ist ganz hervorragend .
Aber die Zugangssperren sind noch immer eindeutig zu hoch , die Tür wurde nur halb geöffnet .
Es herrscht immer noch viel zu große Scheu , ein flexibles Punktesystem zu etablieren , sich die Einwanderer damit möglichst genau auszusuchen und Zuwanderung so bewusst zu steuern . “
Das führe doch zu Zuständen wie an der KZ - Rampe , habe ein Politiker Bades Vorschläge vor Jahren einmal kommentiert .
Heute ist die Einstellung der Politiker pragmatischer geworden .
In den klassischen Einwanderungsländern wie Australien , Neuseeland , Kanada und neuerdings auch in Großbritannien herrscht längst ein hartes Punktesystem .
Doch in Deutschland herrsche die Angst vor einer Invasion – dabei ist Bade überzeugt mit einem transparenten System , einem klaren Forderungsprofil aus Sprache , Ausbildung , Alter angeglichen an die Engpassdiagnose auf dem Arbeitsmarkt würde die Zuwanderung nicht steigen , sondern lediglich ein erwünschteres Profil bekommen .
So bleibt nur der Versuch , die Kinder und Enkel der Pionierzuwanderer besser zu qualifizieren und das Potenzial zu wecken , das in ihnen schlummert .
Keine leichte Aufgabe in dem überregulierten deutschen System .
Die Hertie - Stiftung etwa unterhält ein erfolgreiches Programm zur Förderung von begabten Kindern aus sozial schwachen Zuwanderer - Familien .
Unter anderem bekommen sie 100 Euro Bildungsgeld pro Monat , damit sie Bücher anschaffen , Sprachförderungsprogramme belegen können .
Anzeige
Das System bewährte sich gut .
Doch jetzt haben die Sozialämter mitbekommen , dass die Mehrzahl der geförderten Kinder aus Hartz - IV - Familien stammt – und fordern , das Geld solle auf das Arbeitslosengeld angerechnet werden .
„ Es ist zum Haare raufen “ , sagt Kuratoriumsmitglied Bade .
„ Wir müssen endlich begreifen , dass wir beides brauchen .
Qualifikation im Innern und Zuwanderung von außen . “
Der Migrationsforscher spricht sich für einen Umbau des Bildungssystems aus , um die Vererbung sozialer Startnachteile zu beenden und dafür endlich einen Willkommengruß nach außen zu senden , anstatt nur griesgrämig und zögerlich den lange Zeit errichteten Stacheldrahtverhau um das Land abzubauen .
Werbung im Ausland für Deutschland zu machen , wie es die Amerikaner tun , die an elitären deutschen Ausbildungsinstituten mit Green Cards winken und wie Angler die „ Big fishes “ herausziehen .
Schließlich habe Deutschland seinen miserablen Ruf unter qualifizierten Ausländern nicht verdient .
„ Wir stellen uns zu schlecht dar “ , sagt Bade .
„ Wie ein schmuckes Auto , das ständig mit einer verdreckten Karosserie herumfährt .
Das muss doch nicht sein . “
B ell and Rogers are waging a war for your business – and you can gain by playing off one telecom giant against the other .
It 's Red ( Rogers ) vs. Blue ( Bell ) , cutting prices for couch potatoes .
And both combatants are using couches in their ads .
Rogers kicked off the fight by showing how its home phone service – which includes calling features ( such as voice mail and call display ) and long distance minutes – undercuts
Bell 's prices by up to $ 25 a month .
Bell attacked on another front , boasting that its satellite TV service was cheaper than Rogers cable and included more channels .
Plus , its wireless smartphones were faster and cheaper , too .
Behind the skirmishes could be the arrival of new wireless phone players to Canada 's market later this year .
Bell and Rogers want to shore up their positions before the new companies put out innovative price plans .
They also want to sign up customers for at least one service to get a foot in the door .
Later , they will offer bigger discounts for ordering more services from the same supplier .
This strategy , known as bundling , is the weapon of choice for companies that want to increase customer loyalty .
You can use bundling to your advantage – and capitalize on the rivalry to negotiate better deals .
Marc Charbonneau has three Rogers services ( cable TV , Internet and home phone ) .
He was getting a bundle discount of 15 per cent a month on each one .
He was dismayed to learn his saving would drop to 10 per cent , since Rogers now requires having four services to get a 15 per cent bundle discount .
" I was prepared to cancel all of my Rogers services as the prices just seem to rise and rise and I could not afford it , " he said .
But when he called to cancel , Rogers came back with several attractive offers .
" The end result is that I now have phone service with two options instead of one and 500 minutes of Canadian long distance .
" I have reduced my Internet charges and Rogers has increased its speed .
" In the end , I am saving $ 25 a month .
I am quite impressed that customer service was able to adjust my billing with one call and hear my concerns . "
I , too , have three Rogers services .
And I , too , got a recent letter saying my 15 per cent bundle discount would go down to 10 per cent .
My home phone service is with Bell .
And I 'm not ready to switch sides yet .
So , I called Rogers and Bell and asked them both a few questions .
How much did our household pay and what were we getting ?
What rate plans had come out since we signed on ?
If we adopted a different rate plan , how much could we save ?
What other savings could be had by cutting features we did n't use ?
As a result , I got offers of better deals from both Rogers and Bell .
I 'm paying less than I was before – and I did n't have to move anywhere .
Rogers agreed to raise our discount on cable TV and Internet to 20 per cent for the next 12 months .
Though our wireless discount would drop to 10 per cent , Rogers added customer loyalty discounts that cut $ 25 a month from our wireless bill .
Bell also found savings once I spoke to the " loyalty department . "
Our old plan was replaced by a new one that cost $ 10 to $ 15 a month less .
My advice :
In a price war between two big players , ask for concessions .
Play one side against the other .
Do n't switch sides without a fight .
You can win great deals for yourself – at least until next year , when you may have to fight all over again .

We 're back like a dead Vulcan for yet another installment in our ongoing Star Trek celebration leading up to the release of the new film Friday .
IGN Movies smells a hit for this reboot -- we 're talking mainstream success on a level that the Trek feature films have rarely known .
But lest we forget , there have been plenty of occasions when the needs of the many were outweighed by the needs of the bad .
And that 's what we 're here to talk about today .
Star Trek has given us some truly great cinematic memories , but it 's a lso in the course of its 10 - plus movies created some horrific filmic nightmares .
From weddings taken straight out of fan fiction to dances in the moonlight by geriatric former hotties , from ignoble deaths of legendary starship captains to renditions of the H.M.S. Pinafore during shuttlecraft chase scenes , we 've seen -- and suffered through -- some bad times .
So read on for our list of the 10 Worst Star Trek Movie Moments in the history of the franchise .
And then be sure to click the link below to check out our Top 10 Star Trek Movie Moments , just to prove that we 're not a bunch of Cardassian scrooges :
10 . H.M.S. LameInsurrectionPicard , Worf Data , Gilbert , SullivanWe start this list with a scene from 1998 's Star Trek : Insurrection , a film which will certainly make an appearance here again .
When Data is sent to an area of space called the Briar Patch where the homeworld of the alien race the Ba'ku is located , the filmmakers take the opportunity to indulge in their -- and not 99 % of their audience 's -- love for Gilbert and Sullivan .
We 'd seen this trend towards musical fancy before on the Next Generation TV series , where it was usually acceptable because the show had the time to present the characters singing and dancing in a more believable context -- Data rehearsing for Chief O'Brien 's wedding and so on .
But here , Picard , Worf , and Data 's singing of " A British Tar " from the comedic opera H.M.S. Pinafore is inserted into a shuttlecraft chase scene that can result in only one outcome : inclusion on any list of worst Trek moments .
Picard and Worf are pursuing a malfunctioning Data above the planet 's surface , so they figure they 'll do some singing and pipe it over the communicator in order to rattle the android .
He starts singing too , the shuttlecraft 's computer displays the lyrics to the music complete with sing - along graphics , the Klingon Worf is humiliated yet again … and the audience feels like they just swallowed a dozen Ceti eels .
J.J. Abrams envisioned a sleek , updated version of the Enterprise for his upcoming Star Trek movie , but the director can't claim a monopoly on pimping out Captain Kirk 's interstellar ride .
Street artists , filmmakers and designers from around the world have been beaming down their own versions of the Enterprise for an exhibition of arty starships , shown earlier this month at the ShoWest movie convention in Las Vegas and now popping up in Los Angeles theater lobbies .
Bizarre paint jobs and weird materials turn the Enterprise models into unique works of art .
Project organizers from Paramount Pictures invited creative types from Poland , Nicaragua , Korea , Thailand and the United States to put their stamp on undecorated Enterprise models produced by effects shop FX Company and modelers Quantum Mechanix .

なんか最近 id : nishiohirokazu さんや akrさん が色々ビジュアライズとかされてて面白いです。感化されてちょっとなんか絵をかいてみました。
上の絵は3目並べを引き分けになるように探索していった時の絵です。わかりにくいですが、一番下の板が一手目なので9個点があって、その9個の点からはそれぞれ垂直にのびる以外の8本の線がそれぞれのびてるはずです。今までの軌跡に応じて点がずれるようになってるので何か組み合わせが増えてるなーという雰囲気がわかります。
ありえる点を全部調べると一番上の板がもっと光ってあまり綺麗じゃなかったです。後は敗着になる手は避けるような探索をすると上の方が光らなかったのでこれもいいかと思いました。

Officials approved a service , coded No 24/i , to take foreigners to an immigrant hostel and by - pass a working - class neighbourhood served by the existing 24 bus after disturbances between the two groups of passengers .
" At the heart of the decision are the clashes between immigrants and residents , " said Orazio Ciliberti , the centre - Left mayor of the agricultural town in Puglia province .
He added , however , that immigrants would be free to travel on any bus they choose .
Though the Internet may seem like a relatively new concept , the idea of a computer network that would allow communication between a wide scope of users from various computers was formulated in 1962 in a series of memos by J.C.R.
Licklider discussing ‘ Intergalactic Computer Network ’ .
These ideas contained almost everything that the Internet is today .
Early P2P networking
In the late 1960 ’s , the peer - to - peer networking system was developed .
The ARPANET ( Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ) was created by the United States Department of Defense during the Cold War and was the world ’s first operational packet switching network - now the basis for data communication .
The original ARPANET connected UCLA , Stanford Research Institute , UC Santa Barbra and the University of Utah as equal computing peers source .
Bulletin Board Systems ( BBS ) and Usenet
In 1979 , Usenet was developed by two graduate students from Duke University and one from the University of North Carolina , which allowed you to exchange information in the UNIX community .
UNIX was the first widely - used operating system that could switch from and outlive its original hardware .
Similar to Bulletin Board Systems , which could perform functions such as downloading or uploading software and data , reading news and exchanging messages with other users , students from both universities were able to exchange messages , post news , and read public messages with Usenet .
The articles users would post were then organized into topical categories called newsgroups .
Newsgroups were added to the main topic hierarchy .
If a newsgroup vote passed , a new group message would be sent and propagated through the Usenet network .
Usenet grew from those original two sites to hundred of thousands of sites , while still retaining the P2P model of networking .
Usenet was essentially the precursor to various web forums used today - a hybrid between email and web forums , minus the advanced security features of a hosted exchange server .
The 90’s : When http and ftp Reigned
P2P networks developed throughout the 90’s but were mostly used for in - house purposes .
When the Internet became really popular in the mid 90’s , most developers and web architects were creating systems that did involve P2P exchange .
The Internet made its way into the mainstream and primarily became a way for people to exchange email , access web pages , and buy stuff .
Between 1995 - 1997 , FTP ( file transfer protocol ) file sharing and free homepage file sharing became the major way to share files .
The most popular file sharing was the ( anonymous ) file transfer protocol .
An anonymous FTP server allows a user to login using an anonymous name to send or receive a file over the Internet .
HTTP was also widely used , beginning as a simple protocol used to request pages from a server .
The browser would connect to the server and send a command like :
GET / welcome.html
The server would then respond with the contents of the requested file .
In 1997 , ICQ messenger became the new major way to share files and enabled you to send instant messages .
It was developed by an Israeli company called Mirabilis and was the first of its kind as at that point , no software existed to enable an immediate connection between users , and most people were accessing the Internet through a non-UNIX operating system .
Napster 1999
The P2P system began to gain popularity again when Northeastern University student Shawn Fanning developed Napster , along with two friends he had met online , Jordan Ritter and Sean Parker .
Its technology allowed people to copy and distribute mp3 files amongst each other which ended up paving the way for decentralized peer - to - peer file distribution programs .
60 million people worldwide were using this application , which generated an immense selection of music to download .
But with Napster ’s popularity also came a unanimous anger by recording artists and studios who felt that this so - called music sharing application was violating copyright laws .
The Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) sued Napster in December of 1999 , and in April of 2000 Metallica filed a lawsuit as well .
After long legal battles Napster stopped operation in July 2001 .
Kazaa , Morpheus , Gnutella , Audiogalaxy , Limewire …
Even though Napster disappeared it opened the door to new file - swapping programs such as Kazaa , Gnutella , Audiogalaxy and these continue to be used to share music files .
These programs operate without any involvement from central computers so even if these companies were sued the file - swapping networks would still exist .
Bram Cohen ’s BitTorrent
American computer programmer Bram Cohen designed BitTorrent to be able to download files from many different sources , in order to speed up download time especially for users with faster download than upload speeds .
BitTorrent became very popular for its ability to share large music and movie files online at fast speeds - the more popular the file the faster the download .
uTorrent , azure ( and other torrent software )
uTorrent is a freeware closed source BitTorrent client by BitTorrent Inc and is the second most popular P2P application .

At the moment , torrent downloads account for a majority of all peer - to - peer exchanges over the internet .
Its prevailing use has lead to many innovations and avenues for smaller and larger companies alike to share and distribute digital content in all forms .
While the original intent behind torrents was noble , most torrents available online are of copyrighted materal .
It goes without saying that downloading copyrighted materials on the internet is inherantly risky as most countries currently have laws protecting artists .
Ausiello keeps track of the bubble shows
EW.com ’s Michael Ausiello is tuned into the world of television , and his information can usually be trusted .
He has an article devoted to the current status of all the shows ( renewed , cancelled , on the bubble , etc. ) and suggests that readers bookmark it .
Here are his thoughts on a few of the shows currently on the bubble .
Scrubs : Prospects brightening .
The Unusuals : A long shot .
Eleventh Hour : Could go either way .
Now a long shot .
Hearing the crew is looking for other work .
The Unit : A long shot .
Now hearing it ’s a goner .
Dollhouse : Could go either way .
Now hearing it ’s a long shot .
Fringe : Sure thing .
Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles : A long shot .
Chuck : Could go either way .
Life : A long shot .
Now hearing it ’s a goner .
Medium : Safe bet .
My Name is Earl : Could go either way .
Fox may rescue it if NBC passes .
Southland : Sure thing .
Privileged : Prospects brightening .
Reaper :
It ’s a goner .
I ’m bummed to hear that the news on “ The Unit ” is n’t getting better .
CBS invited Shawn Ryan to pitch story ideas for another season , and the show has been pretty great the last two years .
It ’s good to see that “ Fringe ” is considered a sure thing — I had n’t heard much about how well it was doing ratings - wise this season .
“ Southland ” continues to get good reviews .
I do n’t know that the world needs another cop show .
My tastes are pretty particular after watching great shows like “ NYPD Blue , ” “ The Shield ” and “ The Wire , ” so I have n’t watched it , but if I keep hearing good things , I may dive in this summer when there is n’t much else on .
If you do n’t see your favorite show on this list , be sure to check this link for the latest info .
I ’d like to see Ausiello tackle some of the basic and pay cable shows on FX , TNT , TBS , USA , HBO and Showtime , but this page only covers the major networks .
Samsung Jet Gets 2M Preorders
Just a week ago we were lauding the success of the Palm Pre with its 50,000 unit opening weekend .
Earlier today we got news that the iPhone 3GS has sold 1 M units at launch , despite having the “ smallest ” launch for the device to date .
Samsung enters the fray walking tall and carrying forty pound sledge : the Samsung Jet. According to Samsung , they ’ve received 2 M preorders for their WinMo smartphone .
The Jet runs on the same 800MHz processor as the 3GS , though the iPhones is underclocked .
The Jet also has an AMOLED screen and a 5 MP camera , two improvements over the iPhone .
It comes with Windows Mobile 6.1 installed , which is n’t everyone ’s favorite touch platform .
An update to 6.5 could be a serious improvement for WinMo users .
The Jet preorder sales make it the largest handset order Samsung has ever seen .
The phone will be available at the end of the month .
Days before the planned launch of the Wolfram Alpha search engine , Google on Tuesday announced a series of new search products intended to provide more relevant results .
Days before the planned launch of the Wolfram Alpha search engine , Google on Tuesday announced a series of new search products intended to provide more relevant results .
The new offerings include Google Search Options , Google Squared , Rich Snippets , and an astrology - related Android app .
Google Search Options is a " rich set of tools that let you slice and dice your results , " Marissa Mayer , vice president of search products and user experience , said during a presentation at Google 's Mountain View headquarters .
Specifically , once you conduct a normal Web search , you can drill down with different genres , including elements of time , visualization tools , recently added , blogs , or images , combining a variety of Google search products into one .
The idea is to combine relevancy and " recentcy " , she said .
Doing a normal search for " shuttle launch " could turn up results from any number of shuttle launches in countries around the world .
Using Search Options , you can choose to search
Web sites or blogs that were updated in the past 24 hours or week , increasing the chance that it will include results pertinent to this week 's launch .
Choosing " images from the page " , meanwhile , will display pictures pulled from the site alongside search results .
During the demo , Mayer and her team also searched for " solar oven " to demonstrate another feature of Search Options , dubbed sentiment analysis .
If you are searching for reviews of solar ovens , for example , the program will try to determine if a particular review is positive , negative , or neutral and display that in the search results .
Search Options also includes a timeline that displays the popularity of the topic searched over time .
Search Options also includes a feature known as the Wonder Wheel .
The term " solar oven " would be displayed in the middle of this wheel , with related searches branching out from it in a circle .
In the same way that you might weave your way from a Wikipedia page on Google to a page about tropical fish thanks to the hundreds of links within Wikipedia posts , you can click on the various Wonder Wheel " arms " and crawl into a nice little search wormhole .
Next up was Google Squared , a Labs project set to debut later this month .
It is similar to Search Options in that you can drill down your search results , but Squared lets you add or delete results to produce the most useful " square " of information that you can save to your Google account and refer back to later .
Rich Snippets , meanwhile , is intended to provide you with more useful information in the blurbs that sit below the URL on the search results page .
Searching for a restaurant , for example , could produce a Yelp review with a snippet that shows its average rating is 4 stars based on 17 reviews  a more useful return than a line with its name and address .
Google updated snippets in March to increase the number of lines in the snippet for longer searches , but Tuesday 's announcement was geared more toward webmasters .
Starting today , Google will be supporting open HTML standards not just for formatting , but for the meaning as well .
Those who want to participate in Rich Snippets can add quick tags to give Google a better understanding of what on their pages , Mayer said .
Google also announced an update to the Sky Map Android app , which uses GPS and the compass sensors in G1 phones to produce constellation maps .
" Not only does it know where on the planet [ your phone ] is , it also knows which direction you 're holding the phone , " said creator John Taylor .
Google made improvements in performance , redesigned the user - interface , and made it an official Google app .
Users can now search for specific stars or constellations .
Hold the phone in the air and a circular arrow will direct the user to the spot in the sky where that constellation is  changing from blue to red as you get closer .
It is available in the Android Market starting today .
Mathematica founder Stephen Wolfram next week is expected to launch Wolfram Alpha , an upcoming search engine that aims to more thoroughly answer Web users ' questions rather than just serve up existing data .
Udi Manber , vice president of engineering at Google , said that he and Google co-founder Sergey Brin were given a demo of Wolfram Alpha " early on , but we were asked to be confidential about it and we respect that . "
Turns out birds are n’t the only ones with a reason to steer clear of wind farms .
This past weekend , a wind turbine spinning out of control forced California police to shut down a stretch of highway because of concerns that it could break into large , heavy , and very fast - moving pieces .
California Highway Patrol officers late on Sunday morning noticed that a roughly 125 - foot tall turbine on a ridge near the desert town of Tehachapi was spinning much faster than any of the others at the Tehachapi farm .
“ It looked like a propellor on an aircraft … and it was giving off a loud racket as it failed , ” Officer Ed Smith said .
Officials contacted AES , the power company that owns the wind farm , and Smith said “ it was determined that if it failed it could cast large pieces of steel and debris up to a mile from where the turbine was . ”
Given that the state ’s Highway 58 is less than half a mile from the location of the crazy turbine , which could not be stopped , officials resolved to shut down the road .
It was closed for about 10 hours , Smith said , at which point the winds had died down enough to reopen it .
AES spokeswoman Meghan Dotter said the turbine was made in the mid-1980s by Denmark ’s Vestas and was smaller than more modern models .
The turbine ’s brake failed , Dotter added , causing it to spin out of control in high winds of more 50 mph .
The site is being monitored now , she said .
Turns out this sort of thing has happened before .
In upstate New York , a General Electric - made turbine caught fire and collapsed in March after a wiring malfunction at Noble Environmental Power ’s Altona Wind Park .
No one was hurt , but debris from the turbine was flung a quarter of a mile away .
To see just how dramatic a wind turbine failure can be , check out the video of a separate incident below :

A new rumor , complete with supposed screenshots , maintains that Apple is on the verge of allowing movie and TV show downloads directly from an iPhone or iPod touch .
According to the blogger reporting the purported find , a friend who downloaded the latest version of the iPhone app TwitterFon claims to have discovered three mobile ads from Apple that pointed to " iTunes Movies , " " iTunes Movie Rentals " and " iTunes TV . "
Rather than take the visitor to a website , however , tapping one of the ads is said to switch to the mobile iTunes client and shows what appears to be a work - in - progress video section of Apple 's mobile store .
Viewers can browse genres and see featured items , but tapping the actual videos themselves produces a notice that the content is " not available . "
Promos for episodes and movies are missing .
The section was reportedly in a rough enough state when viewed that a navigation bar used to filter by music videos , movies and TV shows was n't there at one point in the day and appeared the next .
It 's possible that Apple was building the portal in a live environment , the report suggests .
A video store would signal a loosening of the restrictions surrounding video downloads on the iPhone .
Since adding the podcast section to the iTunes Store , Apple has allowed downloading video podcasts whenever one of its handheld devices is connected through Wi-Fi but has never permitted paid video downloads , in part because of the lengthy wait to download hundreds of megabytes of content .
While the authenticity of the rumor has n't been corroborated outside of the seemingly real screenshots taken to show the new store portal 's existence , its appearance comes just as Apple is poised to introduce 802.11n
WiFi to its handhelds .
The wireless standard is about four times faster than the 802.11g the iPhone and iPod touch use today and would significantly shorten the time spent waiting for downloads that would otherwise be interminable with fast - enough Internet connections or less - than - ideal WiFi reception .
The blogger 's friend did n't make any assertions as to whether or not videos would work over 3G , though carrier concerns about overloading the network would most likely keep paid content restricted to WiFi in the same way that video podcasts are restricted today .
I 'm looking at these images from a Hong Kong blog , and they totally look like The Real Thing™ to me .
Sure they are blurry , but those applications ' user interface definitely screams Apple design .
The gallery shows the compass and autofocus in action — which can't work in current hardware .

These could very well be the first shots of the new iPhone , featuring the new compass in action — which the current iPhone lacks — and video functions , as well as the autofocus in the camera .
They look like polished new Apple applications .
You can also see how the camera app can change between video and still modes , as well as the autofocus overlay — I wonder if you could change focus with your finger — and MMS screens .
The more I look at these images , the more I 'm convinced they are the real deal .
The compass and the autofocus are hardware functions which are not supported by the current phone , which explains why these apps are not part of any of the iPhone OS 3.0 betas .
As we get closer to WWDC , it seems that some stuff may be starting to leak .
We saw potential parts from the next - generation iPhone 3G and what may be a new finish .

Researchers in the US have shown that a recently discovered class of compound based on light elements can store gas at least as efficiently as the most promising metal organic framework ( MOF ) candidates .
The compounds , known as covalent organic frameworks ( COFs ) , bring the prospect fuel tanks of the future consisting of a lightweight crystalline sponge that can hold large volumes of hydrogen or methane a step closer .
Gas storage is fast becoming a key issue in energy policy , both for cleaner fuels , such as hydrogen and methane , and for locking away carbon dioxide .
In 2005 , Omar Yaghi ’s team at the University of California , Los Angeles described a new type of porous crystal made solely from light elements - hydrogen , boron , carbon , nitrogen and oxygen .
These materials are similar to previously described MOFs , which have been shown to have exceptional gas adsorption properties , but because COFs do not contain metal atoms they are less dense .
’ While this is one advantage , what we are really doing is extending the range of possible materials for these kinds of applications so that there are a number of alternatives that could be used in different situations , ’ says Yaghi .
COFs consist of building blocks of five - or six - membered rings arranged into sub-units , which are then bolted together with strong covalent bonds to create large crystalline frameworks with pores ranging in size from 9 to 32
. Now , Yaghi and colleague Hiroyasu Furukawa have reported how much hydrogen , methane or carbon dioxide a series of different COFs are capable of soaking up .
Some of the COFs tested have adsorption capacities that surpassed those of MOFs .
’ Our findings place COFs among the most porous and best adsorbents for these gases , ’ Yaghi says .
It should be relatively straightforward to scale up production of the materials , according to Yaghi .
’ There are no exotic molecules involved so cost should not be prohibitive , and we have made multi-gram quantities in the lab , so industry should be able to scale up far more . ’
Andy Cooper , director of the Centre for Materials Discovery in Liverpool in the UK , says that the team ’s results are ’ significant ’ .
’ These materials have spectacularly high surface areas and show amongst the highest uptakes for hydrogen , methane and carbon dioxide , ’ he says .
However two big issues remain to be tackled , Cooper points out .
The first is to make any new material so much more efficient than carbon that the extra cost can be justified , and the second is to overcome the problem of hydrogen ’s low heat of sorption - the fact that for it to ’ stick ’ within framework materials it needs to be cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures .

Ramsay has found himself in hot water in Australia before
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has criticised TV star Gordon Ramsay after the chef made insulting remarks about TV host Tracy Grimshaw .
Ramsay , who appeared on Grimshaw 's TV show on Friday , made the comments at a Melbourne food fair the following day .
He showed an image of a nude woman on all fours with a pig's face and likened the image to Grimshaw .
Mr Rudd said Ramsay 's remarks reflected " a new form of low life " .
The chef has played down the incident .
' Offensive '
He told Australian programme Nine News his comments had been " blown out of context " .
Ms Grimshaw hit back at Ramsay , describing him as an " arrogant narcissist " and " a bully " on her Monday night programme .
Grimshaw is a well - known TV personality in Australia
Ramsay allegedly also made several sexist remarks .
Melinda Tankard Reist , of Women 's Forum Australia , told Australian newspaper the Herald Sun that Ramsay was " no longer welcome here " .
" Ramsay 's sexist and demeaning actions are offensive to every Australian woman , " she said .
" Why should he get paid for depicting a woman as an animal and publicly deriding her looks ?
He should n't make money through the verbal abuse of women . "
A spokeswoman for Ramsay told the newspaper on Sunday it was " just a joke " .
Ramsay caused controversy in Australia last year when an inquiry was initiated by Liberal senator Cory Bernardi after he watched the chef 's Kitchen Nightmares .
The probe was prompted by one episode aired in a pre-watershed slot early last year , in which Ramsay used a four - letter expletive more than 80 times in 40 minutes .
But senators stopped short of imposing an outright ban on swear words , citing a lack of an " overwhelming community consensus " in favour of the move .
The other day I was told “ No , you ’ll do it this way . ”
In my professional life .
And , Ganesha help me , I loved it .
Sure , at first , not so much .
But within a few minutes I was strangely pleased .
Smoothed out .
Dare I say , perky , even .
I had a customer issue I needed to address , and it had been shuttled around for a bit .
A number of people had their fingerprints on the e-trail for this problem , but I had to actually respond to the customer .
This is something I do well , and I have in fact been given recognition , prizes , plaques and awards for this shit .
I fucking RULE at customer service .
Yeah , shocking , I know .
So this fairly standard issue , addressing a customer complaint , was a piece of cake .
I dusted off my high - falutin’ CorporateFuckYouHaveALovelyDay approach , dashed out an e-mail , and forwarded to one of the Powers That Be for approval .
And they said “ No , I do n’t want it this way . ”
I sat , a bit frustrated because I am rather proud of my writing ability and my 20 + years working in Customer Service of one kind or another .
Then I realized that I was n’t angry or even really that frustrated .
That what I wanted was to receive the back - patting I felt I deserved for my not - inconsiderable skills .
After some lighthearted banter , I ( only partially joking ) pulled the “ Well if you can do better , bring it !
Let ’s see whatcha got ! ” gambit .
And then I waited for the re-write .
The new draft of the response to the customer had little to do with my initial response , which was not designed to leave much room for the complainant to continue their diatribe .
It was far more personable , friendly , all that shit .
I made one or two tiny adjustments to make it sound at least a BIT like something I MIGHT say , and sent it off .
What the hell does this have to do with kink ?
OK , I ’m getting to that .
STFU .
Furthermore , as I work on kink - oriented websites ( to get meta on that ass ) anything work related IS , technically , kink related .
But that ’s not my point .
My point is this : I have shifted my perspective a whole lot in the past 2 + years of sobriety .
Things I never noticed before are thrown into sharp razor - slicing relief , and loom large as blue whales .
And things that used to be crushing blows to my ego roll off of my back like so much dew on the head of a cygnet .
But I only take criticism with calm , unruffled grace in a HANDFUL of situations .
From a director I respect , while working in theater .
From a dominant I respect while working in submission
From a friend I respect when I KNOW they know me well and intimately .
In most other situations , criticism usually had to filter though defensive mechanisms more Byzantine than I am even capable of describing to you now .
So when I realized I ’d accepted a criticism in a NEW way , and not had the hackles raised , and in fact feel calmed and pleased that I was able to see the value in the criticism without it having to diminish my self - worth , that is kind of amazing .
To further wonkify it , it felt … submissive .
Yah OK so , what ’s new ?
Work IS submission , right ?
Submission to the clock , to the almighty dolla bill , y’all , dolla bill y’all .
But I had an additional little extra frisson in that I actually kind of enjoyed it .
It felt good , to me , to be able to take that adjustment in stride , to remain on task .
It mirrored other branches of submission .
I let go and managed , somehow in the relinquishing of my ego , just for a little bit there , to see that what I wanted , and my own pride in purpose , was perforce secondary to the larger vision , which was n’t necessarily mine at the time .
That type of release is something I am not often aware that I do when in a submissive mindset , because that IS one of the pillars of my submission .
But for me , submitting is dissolving into a larger spiritual lattice .
I am losing my focus on submitting to a person , in total and finding that I submit to my life itself .
To what I do , and to what I do not do .
To people who are in and around and throughout my life .
But not in a way that permits them to abuse me , not by a longshot .
In fact , when I take stock , I feel more honored and loved and respected than I have in a long time .
But there is something to submitting to one ’s own life .
I hear so many people talking , myself included , about “ managing their lives . ”
Increasingly this sounds like so much bullshit .
You ca n’t manage it .
You can only ride it .
Submit to it .
And in doing so , with the fight between me and destiny and pain slowly grinding to a standstill , the quiet is filled with some really strange and beautiful music .
I ’m sure I wo n’t hit mental subspace each and every time I am smacked down for a decision that is at odds with the position of someone in authority over me , and that is OK .
Because even the occasional emotional smackdown is sufficient to help me to “ get it . ”
… and frankly , it does n’t hurt to get the “ correction ” from someone wearing Engineer style motorcycle boots .

They have not allowed her to visit or discuss my case unless its being recorded on the phone where they can hear everything .
Arm Your Mind for Liberty , a libertarian weblog , would like to bring attention to the Sam Dodson case .
According to George Donnelly , blogger , video journalists in Iran are n't the only ones at risk for due process violations .
That 's what journalist Sam Dodson learned when he was arrested April 13 at Keene District Court for allegedly refusing to turn off a video camera in the lobby according to an April 14 Keene Sentinel article .
Dodson is being held indefinitely on $ 10,000 cash bail at Cheshire County Correctional Facility because he refuses to disclose his legal name to authorities per orders issued by Cheshire County District Court Judge Edward Burke on April 14 and 29 under docket number 09 - CR - 01825-1828 .
" The first order states $ 10,000 cash bail and only when he reveals his name .
In the latest order they have discovered his legal name , but again they say until he tells it to them , and tells them his address , he 's staying in jail .
In both orders they refuse to schedule any more dates , including trial , in this matter .
They will not see him for arraignment , they will not see him for preliminary hearings , and they will not see him for trial until he gives them his name and address , " said Dodson 's attorney Sharon Walker .
" The state has not even told me what they are charging me with at this point for over two weeks which Article 15 of the New Hampshire Bill of Rights clearly says that they are not to hold anyone until the charges are substantially and formally given to them , " Dodson said from a jail pay phone May 1 when he called in to WKBK - AM's The Dan Mitchell Morning show .
Private discussions with his attorney have been denied said Dodson .
" They have not allowed her to visit or discuss my case unless its being recorded on the phone where they can hear everything . "
" They were giving me motions where I could n't respond to them because I did n't have pens or papers , " said Dodson during an April 29th interview on talk radio show Free Talk Live .
Conditions in the jail are unsanitary said Dodson .
" The toilet that has been stopped up for over 3 weeks now overflowed again and toilet paper , urine , feces starts flowing out onto the floor and it was also a hot day . "
Dodson is on a hunger strike and has lost 20 pounds .
" I 'm going to eat when I 'm free , " he said on WKBK - AM .
Cheshire County Superior Court rejected Walker 's writ of habeas corpus for Dodson but she refiled the writ with the New Hampshire Supreme Court on April 29 .
Grassroots support for Dodson made him the top choice of internet TV show " Freedom Watch on Fox " viewers in a recent poll , ahead of celebrities such as entertainer Penn Jillette and former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson .
More than 40 friends attended a candlelight vigil for Dodson in Keene April 19 .
Some have also demonstrated in front of the jail where he is being held .
Letters from Dodson while he is in jail are being published at freekeene.com .
Video of Judge Burke charging a man with contempt of court for taking 6 seconds to sit down in November 2008 was viewed more than 100,000 times on YouTube .
" It is not supposed to work to where somebody in America is thrown in a jail cell and left there to rot until they cooperate and give up their rights in order to get whatever rights the government wants to hand out , " Dodson said April 29 on Free Talk Live .

FRESNO , Calif . ( AP ) 
Food safety inspectors said Friday that the California plant at the center of a salmonella scare knew some of its pistachios were tainted but continued shipping nuts for another six months .
The Food and Drug Administration issued a sweeping national warning in March for consumers to avoid eating pistachios after concerns surfaced about nuts from Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella , .
In an inspection report released this week , FDA officials said Setton got results in October showing some of its roasted nuts tested positive for salmonella .
But , officials said , it did n't make proper adjustments to its processing procedures and kept shipping out nuts .
Officials have n't said whether Setton will face sanctions .
A Setton spokeswoman did n't immediately return calls seeking comment Friday .
No illnesses have been confirmed as a result of contaminated pistachios .

If the world goes crazy for a lovely fossil , that 's fine with me .
But if that fossil releases some kind of mysterious brain ray that makes people say crazy things and write lazy articles , a serious swarm of flies ends up in my ointment .
On Friday , a reporter at the Wall Street Journal got a scoop on a new paper on a 47 - million - year - old primate fossil that was published today in PLOS One .
The story mentioned that the discovery would be revealed at the American Museum of Natural History .
It did not mention that the fossil was also the ceneterpiece of a show on the History Channel , along with a big web site and a book -- all called " The Link .
Yesterday and today there have been a torrent of news articles on the new primate , dubbed Darwinius masillae .
Publications that normally would n't give two picas to paleontology , such as New York Magazine and Gawker jumped on the bandwagon .
So what made this primate worth all the attention ?
Well , reporters who attended a press conference this morning heard things like this ( courtesy of the Guardian )
Nancy Dubuc of the History Channel that will be showing the film said Ida " promised to change everything that we thought we understood about the origins of human life " ....
Dr Jorn Hurum , the scientist at the heart of the project , made the most exotic parallels .
He screened photographs of the Mona Lisa and the Rosetta Stone , without elucidation , though the implication was clear .
He variously described the fossil as the Holy Grail of paleontology and the lost ark of archeology .
I watched this media event balloon as I tried to do other work , but I kept getting distracted .
I kept waiting to see an article that sought out some opinions from experts who were not involved in the discovery and analysis of the fossil , which might corroborate that this was indeed the Holy Grail of paleontology , or perhaps something just a wee bit more Earthbound than that .
I never found one .
It finally got to the point where I found myself dispatching emails to two prominent primatologists -- John Fleagle of SUNY Stony Brook and Chris Beard of the Carnegie Museum -- to see what they thought .
Both researchers agreed that it was a lovely fossil , in terms of its exquisite preservation .
" It 's really wonderful , " Fleagle said .
It 's got bones , fur , and even its last meal in its stomach .
Fleagle observed that it will be possible to learn many details about the biology of early primates from Darwinius , down to the stages by which it teeth erupted .
But does this " change everything " ?
Is it , as the Sun claims , " the missing link in human evolution " ?
Actually , I did n't ask Beard or Fleagle those questions .
That would be a bit ridiculous .
No scientist , including the co-authors of the Darwinius paper , would ever pretend that they had found a single fossil that was " the " missing link .
For some reason reporters ( and apparently television producers ) are obsessed with the idea , as I wrote about long ago when another primate fossil was touted in a similar fashion .
Newly discovered fossils are important instead in helping to resolve the order in which traits evolved , and how groups of species are related to one another .
And the more fossils that are discovered , the clearer these pictures become .
Instead , I asked what Fleagle and Beard thought about the actual argument in the paper , which has to do with where humans , apes , and monkeys ( known as anthropoids ) fit in the primate family tree .
Some of the co-authors on the new paper have argued in the past that an extinct group of primates called adapiforms gave rise to anthropoids .
Others have favored a common ancestry with small primates known as tarsiers .
( Laelaps has a nice history of the debate . )
The authors of the new paper argue that Darwinius is an adapiform , but it also has traits that link it with anthropoids .
So , according to them , it 's an early relative of our own anthropoid lineage .
Both Fleagle and Beard were not impressed with this argument .
Fleagle observed that , ironically , most of the evidence presented in the paper is old news .
Except for the ankle and a few other traits , most of the traits offered to link adapiforms to anthropoids " have been known for decades , " said Fleagle .
It 's nice to have those traits all in one primate fossil , but they do n't advance the debate .
Fleagle is intrigued by the anthropoid - like ankle of the fossil , but he also notes that it's " roadkill , " flattened down to a 2 - millimeter pancake .
He wonders whether their interpretation of the ankle will hold up to scrutiny .
Beard has similar things to say via email .
I 've been deluged today by journalists regarding this .
It is a marketing campaign for the ages .
The fossil is nice because it is so complete , but it is a rather vanilla - flavored adapiform that does not differ appreciably from other members of that well - known group of Eocene primates ...
Beard was also puzzled that the authors did not compare Darwinius to an important early anthropoid fossil Beard found , known as Eosimias .
In fact , he was underwhelmed by the entire comparison of Darwinius to other primates ( a phylogenetic analysis ) :
The phylogenetic analysis is not very complete , and I would certainly interpret many of the characters they do cite very differently than they do .
But one of the most shocking things of all about the technical paper is that they found room to cite 89 references , but there is not one mention of Eosimias to be found there .
This is bizarre indeed .
In a paper that purports to tell us something about anthropoid origins , the authors have conveniently ignored the single most significant fossil that has been published to date .
Incomprehensible .
We certainly have n't heard the last of Darwinius -- on that , even the critics agree .
But let 's hope that we 've heard the last of the Holy Grail .

Update :
In response to comments from Kilian and Brett , I thought I 'd add a little more detail here on the evolutionary relationships the authors argue for in the paper .
Scientists have long split the primate order into two suborders : strepsirrhines and haplorhines .
Strepsirrhines included lemurs , galagos , and a few other species , which all share certain traits , such as a wet nose ( the root of the name strepsirrhine ) .
Monkeys , apes , and tarsiers are typically included in the Haplorhines .
The Darwinius team argues that their new fossil , Darwinius , is more closely related to haplorhines ( which includes monkeys and apes ) than it is to strepsirrhines .
Therefore , it ( and other adapiforms ) are ancient relatives of monkeys and apes .
Brett wondered whether there was a tree in the paper .
There is , and thanks to PLOS 's open access policy , I can post it right here :
A couple points here : 1 . They need to fix the typo in Strepsirrhini .
2 . This is what Beard would call " not very complete . "
Three branches makes for a pretty bare tree , especially when you consider that there are a fair number of early primate fossils known at this point .
Fleagle pointed out to me that there are some early anthropoid fossils that lack some of the traits that supposedly join Darwinius to anthropoids .
This could all be sorted out with a detailed phylogenetic analysis , which no doubt someone will carry out .
The authors of the study get kudos from Fleagle for providing so much anatomical detail and high - resolution images of the primate , because that will enable lots of scientists to take their own stab at placing Darwinius in the primate tree .
Using Web Workers
Monday , June 22 , 2009
The Web Workers draft , originally part of HTML5 and now split out into its own document , specifies an elegant solution to a common need in Web applications .
Workers allow Web pages to perform long - running computations in the background while remaining responsive to user input .
This post demonstrates the dedicated worker API , using the 3box project as an example , with links to further reading in the Web Workers and HTML5 drafts .
Motivation
In many Web applications , long - running operations may be triggered frequently , e.g. in 3box , running an arbitrary JavaScript function and displaying the output every time the text in a textarea is changed .
In the JavaScript execution model of modern browsers , this leads to a delay during which the UI is unresponsive .
The browser is effectively frozen or hung until the JavaScript event handler returns control .
This can be partially worked around by minimizing the frequency of expensive calculations , trying to start them at " convenient " times , and yielding control explicitly during long - running operations , e.g. with setTimeout ( ) .
All these workarounds are awkward and have certain fundamental limitations .
Web Workers are the ideal solution to this class of problems .
A Worker can be opened by the page , do work in the background without tying up the UI , and notify the page when the work is done .
During this time , the page can respond to other events normally .
The page can cancel the worker or start new workers at any time , and the worker and the page can communicate by passing any number of messages back and forth .
Subject to Change
The Web Workers draft is not yet final and is likely to continue to change .
Please note the date of this post and be sure to consult the final specification or most recent draft for the current API details .
Note that at the time of this writing , the Firefox and Safari implementations both differ from the draft in several respects , and both the draft and early implementations may change .
In the example code below I have written to the API given by the draft , but see the Firefox and Safari compatibility sections below for notes on those implementations and the actual code currently used by 3box for compatibility .
Creating a Worker
A worker is created by calling the Worker constructor , which takes the URL of a JavaScript program as its only argument .
Before trying to create a worker , we must write the file that will be loaded .
Workers can be dedicated or shared .
Since this will be working for a single Web page in a single window , 3box uses the dedicated worker API .
A worker can send and receive messages until closed , whether by itself , by the page that created it , or by the user closing or navigating away from that page .
Inside a dedicated worker , the work to be done will be received as messages from the page that created the worker ( or in the case of a shared worker , from the pages connected to it ) .
The page will use postMessage ( ) to send these messages .
In the worker script we write an event handler to catch the message events , do the work , and post messages back with results .
The event handler , like any DOM event handler , will be called with one argument , which will be the event object .
This object implements the MessageEvent interface .
Messages can be values of any primitive ECMAScript data type : number , boolean , string , undefined , or null .
A few specific Object types are supported , including Date , RegExp , and ImageData .
Some values cannot be passed as messages , including host objects ( such as DOM Nodes ) , functions , objects containing cyclical references , and some others .
HTML5 's structured cloning algorithm explains the details .
When a message is sent , the message value is cloned ; the value received by the worker will not share any references to variables that exist in in the caller 's context .
For example , passing an object to a worker which then mutates the object it receives would not mutate the original object , since the worker is mutating the clone and not the original .
This is a significant difference from ECMAScript function calls , which can mutate objects passed to them with observable results .
This cloning of message values ensures that the only communication with the worker is through the message channel , which avoids introducing intractable concurrency issues into the existing single - threaded , event - based computational model of JavaScript in the browser .
The simple practical advice would be to send over message channels only " simple " data types , and objects or arrays which are built up out of these types ( but see the compatibility notes below ) .
In our case , we wish to pass an arbitrary JavaScript program and an expression from the page to the worker , let the worker evaluate that expression in the context of that program , and then return the result to the main page for display .
Later we would like to extend the interface between the page and the worker to support more fine - grained control , so we will choose a very simple message structure that still allows some extensibility .
The page will send a message consisting of an Array value in which the first member is a string naming a particular operation and the remaining members are arguments .
We will use two operations here , and call them " environment " and " eval " .
The " environment " operation expects a JavaScript program and evaluates it in the context of the worker .
The " eval " operation takes an expression , evaluates it in the environment that has been set up , and then posts a message back to the page containing the result of evaluating the expression .
If either " environment " or " eval " throws an exception , the worker will catch the exception and post a message to the main page .
In the worker script :
/* Note that since a worker does not share the main page 's scope we can dispense with some of our usual caution in regard to the global namespace .
*/ environment=null /* onmessage is the event handler for messages sent from the page . */ onmessage=function(e ) {var op , args , data /* the clone of the value from the page 's call to postMessage ( ) is provided as e.data */ data=e.data op=data.shift ( ) args=data switch ( op ) { case " environment " : environment=setupEnvironment( args [0 ] ) break case " eval " : if(!environment)environment=setupEnvironment ('' ) handleResult( environment.envEval ( args [ 0 ] ) ) break}}
The setupEnvironment returns an object which has an envEval property which may be used to evaluate an expression in that environment .
The details of this function are not relevant to the use of Web Workers , and the version shown here is simplified .
function setupEnvironment ( program ) {var js js= " ;( function ( ) { " + program +" return {envEval : " + " function envEval ( expr ) { " + " return eval ( expr ) }}} ) ( ) " try{ return eval ( js ) } catch(e ) { handleException(
e)}}
For our purposes the important thing here is that when an " eval " message is received by the worker either handleException ( ) or handleResult ( ) will be called .
These functions then are responsible for posting messages back to the page .
The messages posted from the worker take the same form as those received : an array containing a string as the first member , which will be either " result " or " exception " .
If the string is " result " , the second member of the array will the result of evaluating the expression .
If the string is " exception " , the second member will be an object containing some details regarding the error .
In a dedicated worker , the postMessage ( ) function is available as part of the DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope interface implemented by the worker 's global object , which means we can simply call postMessage directly to pass messages back over the channel to the main page .
function handleResult ( res ) { postMessage ( [ " result " , res ] ) } function handleException(e ) { postMessage ( [ " exception " , {name:e.name , message:e.message} ] ) }
Note that we rely on postMessage 's structured cloning to pass these values back to the main page .
How well this works will depend on the value we are passing to the page .
Passing arbitrary values through postMessage is not transparent , as described above , so we may eventually change the interface to deal with this in a more robust manner , e.g. by doing output formatting in the worker , and passing back a string rather than an arbitrary JavaScript object .
Now all that remains is to update 3box to create the worker and communicate with it .
Briefly , we provide a function which takes two values : a JavaScript environment and an expression .
A simplified version of that function is presented below .
3box will take care of calling that function as appropriate , the details of registering the function with 3box are not relevant here and are not shown in the code below .
To create the worker , as previously mentioned , we call the Worker constructor , providing the relative URL reference of the worker script we just wrote as the argument .
We then set a message event handler on the worker to handle the incoming " result " or " exception " messages we expect to get back from the worker .
If the desired JavaScript environment should change , then we know that any result generated by a currently running worker will not be useful to us , so when we detect changes of this nature we will terminate the running worker and create a new one .
function registerPureFeedbackWorker ( ) { var wkr , state /* ... */ /*
The function that manages the worker .
3box takes care of calling this function for us whenever the JavaScript environment or expression changes as a result of user input .
It provides the old environment , the new environment , and the expression to evaluate .
*/ function ( old_js_env,new_js_env, expr ) { /* if the environment has changed , create a new worker .
*/ if ( old_js_env != new_js_env ) { if ( wkr)wkr.terminate ( ) wkr=new Worker (' pureWorker.js ' ) wkr.onmessage=onmsg wkr.postMessage([" environment " , new_js_env ] ) } /* now the worker has the new environment loaded so we post a message to it to request evaluation of the expression .
*/ wkr.postMessage([" eval " , expr ] ) } function onmsg(e ) {var op , args , data data=e.data op=data.shift ( ) ; args=data switch ( op ) { case ' result ' : /* ... display the result ... */ break case ' exception ' : /* ... display the exception ... */ break}} /* ... */ }
Detecting Worker Support
In 3box , we have existing code which does not use workers , so we want to continue to use that code in existing browsers , but use workers in browsers that support them .
To do this we use the standard technique called feature detection or object detection , i.e. checking whether the Worker constructor exists as a property of the window :
/* ... in an initialization function ... */ if (' Worker ' in this ) registerPureFeedbackWorker ( ) else registerPureFeedback ( )
Firefox Compatibility
The code presented above uses the Workers API as currently specified by the most recent draft .
The current implementation in recent Firefox builds has some differences , the primary one being that the structured cloning algorithm is not implemented .
Instead , Firefox appears to call toString ( ) on the message argument to postMessage ( ) if it is not already a string .
This can be worked around , but the solution depends to some extent on the data being passed .
In the code above , we are passing Arrays , so we would never expect to see e.data of type ' string ' in a message event handler .
Hence we can use this in the event handler to detect when the message channel implementation is not using the cloning algorithm , and deserialize the string message ourselves .
All that remains is to ensure that the string value sent when the cloning algorithm is not in use contains the information required .
Since Firefox uses . toString ( ) , if we do not intervene a string will be sent over the channel and information will be lost , but the intervention required is fairly trivial : we simply wrap the message argument to postMessage ( ) in a utility function Fx ( ) which adds an appropriate toString method .
This has one side effect under the cloning algorithm , which is that the object passed will have a toString property set to null , but this is tolerable for our purposes .
Here is a snippet of the current workaround :
/* the message event handler : */ function onmsg(e ) {var op , args , x x=e.data if ( typeof x=='string ' ) x=JSON.parse(x ) op=x.shift ( ) /* ... */} /* the postMessage calls are actually written as , e.g : */ wkr.postMessage( Fx ([ " eval " , expr ] ) ) } /* the Fx workaround : */ function Fx ( x ) { if ( typeof x==' string ') return x x.toString=function ( ) { delete this .
toString return JSON.stringify ( this ) } return x}}
Values representable as JSON are a subset of those handled transparently by the structured cloning algorithm , so this is not an ideal workaround .
Using .toSource ( ) and eval ( ) in place of JSON.stringify and . parse ( ) is another possibility .
Of course , we could also write custom functions to serialize and deserialize the data we send .
None of these approaches is fully satisfactory , and hopefully this Firefox limitation will soon be lifted .
Safari Compatibility
Safari 4 has Worker support , but , like Firefox , does not support the structured cloning algorithm .
It also does not have native JSON support , as used in the Firefox workaround .
It seems to use the same toString ( ) approach , so the same code path is followed , but the JSON reference throws an exception .
To work around this we include the json2.js library if necessary .
In the main page , we can simply include this as we would any other script ,
< script src=/compat/json2.js></script>
but in the Worker itself , we do not have access to global objects defined by the scripts on the main page .
To meet this requirement , the Workers draft includes a utilities API which can be used to load required script dependencies , among other things .
In the worker , we first detect whether the JSON object is present ( as it is in recent Firefox builds ) , and if not , we use the importScripts ( ) function to load json2.js .
if ( !( ' JSON ' in this ) ) importScripts ('/3box/compat/json2.js ')
With this change , the JSON code path works in Safari 4 just as it does in Firefox , only using the slower non-native implementation of JSON .
Demo
The code presented above is simplified , but the full working example can be seen in the 3box demo .
You will need a recent Firefox 3.5 preview or nightly build for the Workers support .
In Firefox 3 , the earlier code will be used which does not rely on Workers .
Currently , the Worker - enabled 3box has the same features , only without hanging the UI .
This is already a significant improvement , but there are more new features in the works that would simply be impractical without Web Workers .
I hope to write more about Web Workers as these features are developed .

It ’s summertime and the Terminator is back .
A sci-fi movie thrill ride , “ Terminator Salvation ” comes complete with a malevolent artificial intelligence dubbed Skynet , a military R.&D. project that gained self - awareness and concluded that humans were an irritant  perhaps a bit like athlete ’s foot  to be dispatched forthwith .
The notion that a self - aware computing system would emerge spontaneously from the interconnections of billions of computers and computer networks goes back in science fiction at least as far as Arthur C. Clarke ’s “ Dial F for Frankenstein . ”
A prescient short story that appeared in 1961 , it foretold an ever - more - interconnected telephone network that spontaneously acts like a newborn baby and leads to global chaos as it takes over financial , transportation and military systems .
Today , artificial intelligence , once the preserve of science fiction writers and eccentric computer prodigies , is back in fashion and getting serious attention from NASA and from Silicon Valley companies like Google as well as a new round of start - ups that are designing everything from next - generation search engines to machines that listen or that are capable of walking around in the world .
A.I. ’s new respectability is turning the spotlight back on the question of where the technology might be heading and , more ominously , perhaps , whether computer intelligence will surpass our own , and how quickly .
The concept of ultrasmart computers  machines with “ greater than human intelligence ”  was dubbed “ The Singularity ” in a 1993 paper by the computer scientist and science fiction writer Vernor Vinge .
He argued that the acceleration of technological progress had led to “ the edge of change comparable to the rise of human life on Earth . ”
This thesis has long struck a chord here in Silicon Valley .

Earlier today Calculated Risk posted a video and links to Krugman 's Talk In Spain on March 17 .
Here is the video .
A partial transcript by me follows .
Krugman : " I am rather a supporter of Mr. Bernanke at the Federal Reserve which is partly because I think he is the right man for the job , partly because before he was demoted to his current position he was a professor at Princeton University which is where I also teach .
How does this end ?
What can make this better ?
One answer is a stronger European economy .
This problem would be much easier if Europe was a vigorously growing economy with a positive rate of inflation .
Around the world people want to save more than business is willing to invest .
We have a global paradox of excessive savings .
The best thing that could happen to the economy would be to find a lot more investment opportunities , anything that provides quantum leaps into what we can do that would be worth doing even in a depressed economy . "
Note that Krugman is repeating the mindless chatter of Bernanke about excessive savings .
The " Savings Glut " theory is easily refuted .
Problems With Academic Wonderland
What Portion of Government Spending Is Productive ?
In the case of dropping bombs in Iraq , government spending was and remains negative .
In the case of pork barrel projects in Congressional slush funds , the answer is very little .
In the case of pothole filling and bridge repair , the answer might be a great deal .
However , excessive wages paid vs. what would be paid in a true competitive bidding process will need to be factored in .
In the case of government sponsorship and takeover of Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and AIG , the answer is close to zero .
There is no such concept as an ideal growth rate in GDP other than the growth that would be achieved if government simply got out of the way and stopped wasting taxpayer money .
Printing vs. Savings
Both Bernanke and Krugman mistake printed dollars accumulating in China and Japan as excessive savings .
The reality is that spending without prior saving ( i.e. printing money ) results in bubbles that eventually pop .
First Global Output Decline Since 1930's
Industrial Production Annualized Three Month % Changes
The charts above show what happens when consumers are tapped out , wages are low , jobs are very difficult to find , and in short what happens when credit bubbles pop .
Unfortunately , neither Krugman nor Bernanke can distinguish cause from effect , or excessive printing from excessive savings .
Any 8th grader would quickly come to the conclusion that it would be impossible to have too much savings .
However , Krugman is trapped in academic wonderland and puts his faith on equations such as the following one from Competition , Coordination , and the Crisis The problems with such equations are many .
For starters it assumes that one can correctly determine the ideal GDP when GDP figures themselves are ridiculously distorted .
For example consider the following two cases .
1 . The Government sends everyone in the country between 18 and 62 a check for $ 40,000 .
This does not add to GDP.2 .
The Government hires everyone in the country to sponsor a road and collect trash .
The salary is $ 40,000 a year .
The results of the above would be a nearly identical waste of money , yet in case number two , every dime spent would add to GDP .
Clearly this is nonsense and one can see that by this formulation potential GDP is limited only by the capacity to print which is in theory infinite .
Inquiring minds are asking " What portion of government spending is productive ?
" Government spending simply cannot be as productive as private sector spending .
Yet Krugman thinks government spending can lead us out of this mess .
It cannot .
The global credit bubble has now popped and Bernanke and Krugman both want banks to lend when there is every reason for banks to not lend .
The reason banks are reluctant to lend is prior excessive spending led to malinvestments and overcapacity in autos , homes , durable goods , strip malls , and damn near everything else .
There is simply no reason for banks to lend or for credit worthy borrowers to borrow .
Thus the charts are not a result of excessive savings , but rather of prior excessive spending on a Ponzi pace that could not be maintained .

Internet Medieval Sourcebook
Editor : Paul Halsall
The Internet Medieval Sourcebook is located at the
Fordham University Center for Medieval Studies .
1 . This project is both very large and fairly old in Internet terms .
At the time it was begun ( 1996 ) , it was not clear that web sites [ and the documents made available there ] would often turn out to be transient .
As a result there is a process called " link rot " - which means that a " broken link " is a result of someone having taken down a web page .
In some cases some websites have simply reorganized sub - directories without creating forwarding links .
Since 2000 , very few links to external sites have been made .
An effort is under way to remove bad links .
2 . All links to documents at Fordham should be working .
3 . Users may attempt to locate texts not currently available , or where the links have changed via The Internet Archive / Way Back Machine .
Alternately , a search via Google may locate another site where the document is available .
INTRODUCTION : MEDIEVAL SOURCES ON THE INTERNET
Historians teaching medieval history surveys almost always want to combine a textbook , a sourcebook , and additional readings .
Textbooks , as an ever - evolving form , are probably worth the cost , but sourcebooks are often unnecessarily expensive .
Unlike some modern history texts , the sources used for medieval history have been around a long time .
Very many were translated in the 19th century , and , as a rapid review of any commercial source book will show , it is these 19th century translations which make up the bulk of the texts .
Indeed the genealogy of such texts is a minor area of possible historiographical research .
Although publishers need make no copyright payments to use these texts , there is no real cost reduction , compared with sourcebooks for modern history surveys .
Many of these nineteenth - century texts are now available on the Internet , or are easily typed in to e-text form .
GOAL : The goal here then has been to construct an Internet Medieval Sourcebook from available public domain and copy - permitted texts .
[ A few short extracts - abiding by the standard 300 word " fair use " rule may be posted . ]
The problem with many of the Internet available texts is that they are too bulky for classroom assignment .
For instance , all of Pope Gregory I 's letters are available , but in one 500 page document .
The Internet Medieval Sourcebook then is in two major parts .
The first is made up of fairly short classroom sized extracts , derived from public domain sources or copy - permitted translations , the second is composed of the full documents , or WWW links to the full documents .
DOCUMENT SIZE :
The size of documents for teaching purposes is an issue .
Some commercial selections are composed of very small - paragraph long - snippets from many sources [ see for example Deno John Geanakoplos , Byzantium ] .
Sometimes the documents themselves are short , but for the most part the choice here has been for texts which would be three or more printed pages in length .
Such documents allow students to see a larger context , and to escape from being spoon fed .
COVERAGE and SELECTION :
After ten years of steady development , the Sourcebook , while continuing to make available a wide range of texts which address elite governmental , legal , religious and economic concerns , now also includes a large selection of texts on women's and gender history , Islamic and Byzantine history , Jewish history , and social history .
Although initially the similarity of the contents of a book like Tierney 's The Middle Ages and the collections of ninety years ago was striking , this is no longer the case .
In its early stages the the main principle of selection here was been availability of texts .
This long ago ceased to be the case as editorial desiderata deliberately focused on expanding the number of texts addressing non-elites .
Since it is foreseen that there will be a variety of uses for this Sourcebook , the principle of exclusion - necessary for printed material - does not operate .
Although many survey classes do not include much discussion of Byzantium and Islam , I have been eager to include material which would be useful for classes which gave these two other successor civilizations of Antiquity equal billing .
This is especially the case for Byzantium , which , apart from its own intrinsic interest , provides a parallel case for many western developments .
TEXTS
Since these texts come from a variety of printed materials , translators , and sources , they will vary in quality .
In particular there may be better modern translations available [ for instance for the works of Bede , Froissart , or Joinville . ]
More modern translations offered with copy permission by modern translators have not been checked , and in some cases could not be , by the compiler of these pages .
All the texts are , it seems , suitable for class purposes , but check printed material for any intended publication usage .
Caveat emptor !
USAGE : This Sourcebook is specifically designed for teachers to use in teaching .
There are several ways that this might be done :-
By pointing students to this web site .
By downloading the documents , and printing / Xeroxing them for distribution in course packets or as class handouts .
By creating syllabi and course outlines at local websites with links to the documents here .
[ Please DO NOT download and incorporate the texts permanently into your local network websites .
The files are updated and corrected : multiple versions on the web makes this difficult to do . ]
All such projects are specifically allowed , permitted , and encouraged .
Not all the documents here are out of copyright , and I claim copyright on the the specific electronic form , modernized versions of texts and any notes ( this is not to prevent you using the material freely , merely to prevent others using it commercially ) .
What is asked is that reference to the source of the material is included , and that no commercial use be made of the material .
If you feel a need to pay up , do so by contributing texts you have made available in e-text form .

The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) is investigating a pair of Google board members who fulfill similar roles with tech giant Apple .
Such a set - up would be illegal if it in any way affects competition between the two companies .
The investigation involves Google chief Eric Schmidt and fellow board member Arthur Levinson .
Neither company , nor the FTC , have commented on the story , which recently broke through the New York Times .
( Source : nytimes.com )
The FTC is reportedly looking into potential breaches of the 1914 Clayton Antitrust Act which bans people from sitting on the board of two competing firms if their position reduces competition between the companies .
Competition Breach Unclear
On the face of it , Google and Apple compete with one another in several areas .
The most notable is Google 's Android phone operating system as a rival to the iPhone , but there are also battles between the Chrome and Safari browsers .
Even the forthcoming launch of Android on netbooks could be viewed as competition for MacBooks and their Leopard OS .
There 's no official word yet on what areas of business the FTC is looking at , though it 's possible it involves the way Google worked with Apple to make iPhone - friendly versions of services such as Gmail and Google Maps .
However , it 's known that Schmidt leaves the room during Apple board meetings when the iPhone is discussed , as he recognizes the potential conflict of interests .

Persuasion More Likely Than Force
In theory , the law does allow the government to force changes .
However , this is rare , primarily because it is difficult to conclusively prove that a director 's twin posts are specifically responsible for limiting competition .
It 's more common that an investigation would put enough pressure on a director that they resign from one of their posts .
While there is no evidence yet that the Google - Apple set - up stretches or breaches the law , if that was to be the case it seems most likely it would be settled by Schmidt leaving Apple and Levinsen leaving Google .
The New York Times notes that the investigation comes despite concerns that Google was too close to Barack Obama 's administration .
Schmidt was part of Obama 's official transition team and was recently appointed to his advisory council on science and technology .

The FDA currently has a policy that states “ Men who have had sex with other men , at any time since 1977 are currently deferred as blood donors . ”
This means that a male who has had sex with another male even one time since 1977 is banned for life from donating blood .
This policy was written in 1983 , Twenty - five years later this policy is not only medically and scientifically unwarranted , it is also discriminatory .

Legal Drinking Alcohol Age World Map
Legal drinking age map
It seems that everyone in the U.S. complains about the legal drinking age being set at 21 , using the argument that if you are old enough to fight in a war for your country , you should be able to legally enjoy a beer .
Not a bad contention , but it could be worse .
Military service could be mandatory , and drinking could be illegal .
Go count your blessings .
The following map displays the legal drinking age in each country around the world .
A few disclaimers :
- In some countries , the age you can legally drink is different than the age you can legally purchase alcohol .
Some also distinuish between types of alcohol , the difference typically being around 22 % ABV .
- Not all drinking laws are enforced , many countries follow general custom instead .
- Many Middle Eastern countries have a ban on alcohol under Muslim law , though the country permits certain establishments to sell to tourists upon obtaining a proper license .
- Canada ’s legal drinking age varies by providence , Alberta , Manitoba and Quebec all set the age at 18 , the restare 19 .
- The legal drinking age in Nepal is 24 .
- The legal drinking age in India varies between 18 and 25 from state to state .

The Pyramid Method : A Simple Strategy For Becoming Exceptionally Good
June 3rd , 2009 · 58 comments
The Power of Good
In early May , I received an interesting e-mail from a reader .
After the standard introductions , he said :
Though I ’m progressing towards my goal to become a physicist , I ’m also very interested in writing a novel .
He noted that before diving into a novel he would probably have to first “ write a short story or two . ”
He wanted my advice for how to kick off this project in time for summer .
“ This sounds like a great idea for a Grand Project , ” I replied .
“ But I would first be definite that this is an important goal in your life , because I predict you ’d need at least five years of focused work before landing a book deal becomes a possibility . ”
My answer reflects an observation that plays an increasingly important role in my understanding of the world : if you want to do something interesting and rewarding — be it writing a novel , becoming a professor , or growing a successful business — you have to first become exceptional .
As Study Hacks readers know , I think Steve Martin put it best when he noted that the key to breaking into a competitive and desirable field is to “ become so good , they ca n’t ignore you . ”
In other words , there ’s no shortcut .
If you want the world to pay attention to you , you have to provide a compelling reason .
It does n’t care about your life goals .
In this post , I want to discuss a simple method with a complicated back - story .
It ’s a technique that can help you move efficiently down the road toward becoming exceptionally good .
The story behind this advice starts with an old friend who possessed an unlikely talent .
The Saga of Sickabod Sane
Around high school , my longtime friend , Chris , began to show a natural ability for rap music .
This was somewhat unexpected considering that we lived in a sleepy , 2000 person town , not far outside Princeton , New Jersey .
But this did n’t seem to deter Chris .
By the time he arrived at NYU , the novelty - song ethos that drove his high school creations began to wear away .
He developed , in its place , a mature ear for crafting brain - burrowing hooks and complex beats .
By the time he graduated , in 2004 , his friends agreed : a professional music career lay in Chris ’s future .
Let ’s jump ahead to the fall of 2006 .
At this point , Chris ’s catalog had grown , as had the quality and inventiveness of his music .
A steady stream of small - time players had emerged with promises to help Chris achieve his destined break , and the best of his songs had earned cult followings .
But he had n’t yet received any attention from the industry heavyweights .
Around this time , Chris and I had a phone conversation that would change the way we both thought about the art of becoming good .
In the month or so leading up to the call , Chris had made his first tentative stage appearances at a series of open mike nights .
The last of these performances had been at the infamous Tuesday night bootcamp , held at the Pyramid Club , a popular underground rap venue in midtown Manhattan ( see the picture to the right ) .
Anyone could sign up to perform during the bootcamp open mike .
But it was a decision few made lightly .
Pyramid attracted aspiring rap talent from all five of New York ’s boroughs — birthplace to some of the industry ’s most talented ( and hardest ) performers .
Not an easy audience .
In addition the open mike , the club ’s emcee , an industry veteran with the stage name Mental Supreme , also hosted a semi- regular rap showcase .
It cost $ 100 to enter , and the winner went home with $ 1000 .
It was judged by industry insiders , and was considered to be a place to spot upcoming East Coast talent .
Anyone brave enough to face the demanding crowd could sign - up for the open mike .
But only the best of these performers were invited to grace the showcase stage .
As I learned during our phone call , Chris ’s first performance at Pyramid had been shaky .
But something about the club seemed right .
“ This feels like the place to be , ” he said .
We soon hatched a plan .
He would forget the random advice he ’d been receiving from various friends and hangers - on — the suggestions to hand out demo CDs in front of radio stations or network to meet the right executives .
Instead , he would turn his focus solely onto the Pyramid Club .
He would return to the open mike again and again until he was able to win over that crowd .
After that , he would progress to the showcase and play to win .
Our logic was simple : if he could n’t become good enough to win over the Pyramid Club crowd , he could n’t become good enough to attract industry attention .
So why waste energy doing anything else ?
I ’m going Pyramid it up , ” he said at the end of the call .
“ Yep , ” I replied .
“ Time to Pyramid it up . ”
As the months passed , Chris got better .
His early halting performances gave way to the occasional not bad performance .
He worked harder on his songs , trying , week after week , to craft that one beat or lyrical turn that could impress his skeptical crowd .
Eventually , he scored his first Pyramid hit ; an avalanche of improbably complex flows that he dubbed Mixtape .
During his first performance of the song he received one of the highest honors you can achieve in New York ’s underground rap scene : audience members touched his sneakers after a few of the more particularly tight lines .
Chris was invited to perform Mixtape at the next $ 1000 showcase .
He earned third place .
Afterwards , talking to the judges , he learned that he lost on his stage presence scores .
He returned to the studio , working late into the night , as was his habit , to craft ever - catchier hooks .
Before his open mike performances , he now also took to incessant practice — going over every beat of his on - stage movements .
The rate of Pyramid hits began to increase .
Soon the audience was singing along to their favorite songs .
He entered the $ 1000 showcase again , this time wielding an unapologetically original track called Top 8 — an homage to MySpace that somehow integrates three different rhythm changes with a Broadway - style musical chorus .
This time , he won first place .
He entered the contest three more times , winning twice more and tieing for first place on the other occasion .
The club retired him from competition — no one else had a chance when he performed .
He was only the second rapper to ever achieve this distinction .
More recently , he heard about another club that hosted a $ 1000 rap showcase .
On a whim , he entered it .
He won that contest , too .
At this point , Chris had finally become so good that the industry could n’t ignore him .
Natural talent had n’t been enough .
He needed the focus of the Pyramid challenge to drive him to develop his skills as far as they could possibly go .
After his string of showcase victories , he signed with a serious manager .
Since then , his life has changed .
He ’s been flown to L.A. and Miami to record with well - known producers .
He has meetings with high - level record company executives .
It ’s clear that the pieces of a professional career are careening into place .
The Pyramid Method
The difference between the first two years after Chris ’s graduation , and the two years that followed our fateful phone call , could n’t be starker .
The key to his transformation was two - fold : ( 1 ) Chris focused his attention on improving his standing at a single venue ; and ( 2 ) this venue provided clear metrics , so he could track his progress and use this to tweak his practice to be as effective as possible .
I call this general technique the Pyramid Method .
I claim that it ’s a powerful approach for anyone looking to transform an interest or natural talent into an expertise that cannot be ignored .
Regardless of the pursuit in question , if you want to take it someplace serious , follow Chris ’s example .
This means :
Pick a single relevant venue to join at the entry level and work to increase your standing .
Make sure the venue offers clear metrics on your progress ; use these metrics to guide your efforts to get better .
Forget all the other bullshit advice and mini-strategies people offer for getting ahead in your pursuit .
If you ca n’t master this one venue , then you do n’t yet deserve the world ’s respect .
Put your head down , and get it done .
The Novelist
Let ’s return to our aspiring novelist from above .
What venue could he choose to apply the Pyramid Method ?
I suggest his college ’s literary journal .
The entry level for this venue is getting a piece published .
The higher levels include getting a story featured on the cover and being invited to join the editorial board .
If he ca n’t conquer this venue then he certainly can’t expect a book deal .
So instead of wasting time reading about tricks for getting an agent , or diving straight into a novel manuscript , he should consider pouring all of his writerly focus into this Pyramid .
My Pyramid
To give another example , when I wanted to improve my non-fiction chops before pitching my third book , I picked a respected online magazine as my own personal Pyramid .
This publication had an approachable entry - level because it encouraged submissions .
Its best staff writers , however , were professionals with good reputations .
I set my goal to become a staff writer with recognized talent .
I began by trying to get any piece accepted .
Two years later , I was a staff writer , and I had one of my feature articles chosen to be included in a book of the magazine ’s best writing of the past decade .
( Ironically , it was a piece about Chris . )
This required a huge amount of work .
But my effort was focused like a laser beam .
As a result , the quality of my writing made huge leaps during this time .
Conclusion
This method does n’t provide shortcuts .
Becoming exceptional requires an exceptional amount of work .
Trust me , you ca n’t avoid this .
But not all work is made equal .
And the Pyramid Method focuses your attention exactly where it needs to be .
Today , I read a news article from the Physorg.com about the new pattern found in the Prime Numbers , the article talks about the new discovery by Bartolo Luque and Lucas Lacasa :
In a recent study , Bartolo Luque and Lucas Lacasa of the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid in Spain have discovered a new pattern in primes that has surprisingly gone unnoticed until now .
They found that the distribution of the leading digit in the prime number sequence can be described by a generalization of Benford ’s law .
I was very surprised by the fact that nobody have noticed that before and after read the original paper ( if you are interested , read it ) describing the new patterns discovered , I was very impressed and impatient to see it in pratice !
The new pattern discovered is based on the so - called GBL ( Generalized Benford ’s Law ) , which you can see in the paper at the Eq 3.1 :
Where the P(d ) means the probability of appearance of the leading digit d .
The alpha is the exponent of the original power law distribution ( for alpha = 1 , the GBL reduces to the Benford ’s law ) .
The authors says that for a given integer interval of [ 1 ,N ] , there exists a particular value alpha( N ) for which the GBL fits with extremely good accuracy the first digit distribution of the primes appearing in that interval and showing the functional relation between alpha and N in the Eq 3.2 :
Where a = 1.10 +- 0.05 for large values of N .
They also cite a GBL extension , but I ’ll use just these formulae to plot our distributions .
So I have implemented these formulae into the simple pybenford module as follows :
def gbl ( alpha , digit ) : return 1/( 10 **( 1 - alpha ) - 1 ) *( ( digit + 1 ) **( 1 - al pha ) - digit * *( 1 - alpha ) ) def calc_alpha(n , a =1.10 ) : return 1/( math.log ( n ) - a ) def gbenford_law ( alpha ) : return [ gbl ( alpha , digit ) * 100.0 for digit in xrange ( 1,10 ) ]
For the reason that we are using an infinite integer sequence , we must always pick the sequence interval [ 1 , N ] where N = 10 ^D ( see the Natural Density section of the paper for more information ) .
The next step is to create a list of prime numbers between an arbitrary interval of D=8 , or [ 1,10 ^8 ] .
In this step I used the Sieve ( see more information ) utility to create a file with the generated prime numbers in the cited interval , I used the follow command to get this file output :
sieve2310.exe -s 1 -e 100000000 >>sieve_n8.txt
The sieve is very fast , this will create the file “ sieve_n8.txt ” with nearly 66MB ( do n’t worry , it ’s a very fast generation , it took 8 seconds for me using a Intel Core 2 Duo 2GHz ) .
And we are ready to use Python and pybenford to read the prime numbers , calculate the leading digits frequency and plot our result !
Here is the code I created :
import pybenford sieve_file = open ( " sieve_n8.txt " , " r " ) prime_list = [ int ( prime ) for prime in sieve_file ] sieve_file.close ( ) alpha = pybenford.calc_alpha( 10**8 ) benford_law = pybenford.gbenford_law(alpha ) prime_distribution = pybenford.calc_firstdigit( prime_list ) pybenford.plot_comparative(prime_distribution , benford_law , " Prime Numbers " )
And voilà , here is the output plot showing an extremely good accuracy claimed by paper authors ( click on the image to enlarge ) :

If you are interested on Benford ’s law , there are some posts about it here and here .
I hope you liked this =)

Well , I 'm no longer picking up patches .
When the 0.9.24 release came out , I pretty much lost interest in my fork .
My objection all along has been that CVS is not a real source control system , and no modern project should be burdened with it .
CVS does n't even understand changesets .
You were kind enough to post your patches to the list : if they went directly into CVS ( as Grischka does , although he only really seems to care about the windows target ) , I could n't see what files got touched in what groups , because CVS simply was n't designed to track that information .
I can't even go " how many changes were checked into the project in the month of August " , because cvs thinks about individual files , and does n't understand that a project is made up of ore than one , or that the same change can touch more than one file .
( According to http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/tinycc/?root=tinycc
the project has n't had a checkin in four months , although that 's just a guess from looking down the list at the age field of EVERY DARN FILE ) , including the windows subdirectory .
I have an enormous todo list for tinycc .
No modern compiler can be relevant without generating x86 - 64 code , but there are simpler and more fundamental things it needs just as badly .
For example , I wanted to redo the command line parsing logic to work like busybox : call it like ld and it understands linker arguments , call it like as and it jumps straight to the inline assembler .
It can easily work as " strip " , and it would be easy enough to grab the uClibc code for readelf and ldd and whip up an nm and objdump and ar ...
( And if you do all that , adding support for " - Wl , - - dynamic - linker , / blah " becomes trivial .
And without doing that , adding support for that is an amazingly ugly hack . )
All that 's not actually very hard , I 've done it before and most of the code is already there .
But before I touch tinycc again , I need to deal with the fact that my fork is n't based on 0.9.24 .
There are changes in CVS that I need to look at to make what I 'm working on relevant again , but that involves dealing with CVS .
And it would n't be the last time .
And I just have n't been able to bring myself to care .
If this project decides to move off of CVS , let me know .
But it 's 2008 , CVS is dead , and I 've run out of the patience necromancy requires .

Falling into the category of “ I guess it ’s better than nothing , ” the state of Georgia has passed a bill that will use economic stimulus funds to provide retroactive grants to organizations that have already installed clean energy projects .
Why is this so lame ?
Thanks to the Georgia State Government , it ’s just more of the same Republican policies that do n’t work and are n’t an appropriate use of stimulative funds .
[ social_buttons ]
So say you live in Athens , Georgia and want to put some solar panels on your house .
Can you apply for a grant to buy the panels and get professional help installing them ?
“ Hell no !
Put up those damn solar panels yourself , buddy , and then we ’ll talk about reimbursing you .
Oh yeah , and you need to own a business by the way .
Once you start a company and install some solar panels– get back to us . ”
>> Read the latest about discounts on solar power in Phoenix at 1bog.org
How is such a grant stimulative ?
It only puts money back into the pockets of companies who could afford it earlier or made the effort to install clean energy systems in the first place .
Who ’s to say they would use the money to develop more clean energy capacity ?
Maybe I ’m wrong , but I think this is one of the lamest renewable energy grants ever .
It rewards those companies that did n’t need a helping hand in the first place .
If anything , why could n’t the grants both reward retroactive and future projects ?
And why ca n’t they also be distributed to actual citizens rather than just companies ?
Way to go Georgia !
Economy stimulated !

LEEDS , England , June 12 ( UPI ) -- A 7 - foot - 4 - inch young Englishman , recognized by witnesses outside a burgled house , was sentenced to 11 months in prison this week .
Christopher Lister , 21 , of Armley pleaded guilty , admitting he stole a van used in the burglary in November , Armley Today reported .
He waited outside the house while his friends stole a plasma television .
Advertisement
The group abandoned both van and television after the van got stuck .
At the time , Lister was on probation after receiving a suspended sentence for dangerous driving .
He admitted breaking into two cars while he was out on bail after the burglary .
" This ridiculous obsession with cars has got to stop , " Recorder Paul Miller said as he imposed sentence in Leeds Crown Court .
Lister 's lawyer , Richard Wright , asked for a non-custodial sentence , saying Lister 's outsize body will make his life behind bars unusually difficult .
Lister , nicknamed Stretch , is one of the tallest men in England and only 2 inches shorter than the current record - holder .
Mother Nature is not usually kind .
There are creatures , usually tiny creatures , that will take over a member of another species .
They will invade their host 's bodies , their brains , and even their will .
They turn their much - larger victims into zombies !
1. Zombie Snails - Induced Vulnerability
The flatworm Leucochloridium paradoxum infects two different animals in its lifetime , but only controls one of them .
It lives its adult life inside birds and its eggs are spread by bird excretion .
How does it get inside the birds ?
That 's the horror story .
Amber snails eat the eggs , which hatch in the snail 's digestive tract .
The larva changes into sporocysts ( or broodsacs ) , which elongate and invade the snail 's tentacles atop its head .
The broodsacs , filled with hundred of Leucochloridium paradoxum , pulsate and seek light .
The snail is helpless to retract its tentacles , and has lost its ability to perceive light and therefore does not hide .
The inflated tentacles move like worms , attracting birds that bite off the tentacles .
The flatworms then develop into the adult stage inside the bird .
The snail , however , is left to die - or to undergo the process again .
2. Zombie Crabs - Slave Governess
A barnacle named Sacculina wants to nest inside a crab .
A female Sacculina will look for a place to enter the crab 's body .
When it does , it will leave its shell behind , not needing it anymore as it has the crab !
Inside , Sacculina sets up shop , growing tendrils through the crab 's body and slowly feeding on it .
It castrates the crab ( if male ) and effectively turns the crab into a female nanny for its young .
This makes the crab not only infertile but also uninterested in mating .
The barnacle , on the other hand , bores a hole open in the crab 's shell big enough to let male Sacculina in to mate .
The zombie crab treats the Sacculina eggs and larvae as its own , having lost the will to do anything but serve its parasite master .

3. Zombie Caterpillars - Slave Bodyguard
Glyptapanteles is a wasp that lays its eggs in the body of a caterpillar .
This is a three layered parasitic infection .
The wasps engage the help of a virus , or more accurately a polydnavirus that has been genetically modified by the wasps , to disable the caterpillar 's immune system , allowing the wasp eggs to survive .
The relationship between the wasps and the virus is mutually beneficial ; only the caterpillars get the short end of the stick .
The eggs hatch and feed on the caterpillar , but do not kill it .
Instead , the caterpillar stops developing and spends the rest of its life protecting the wasp larva , even going as far as spinning its own cocoon around the wasp pupae .
Watch a video of the entire process .
When the adult wasp emerges from its cocoon , the zombie caterpillar finally tastes the sweet release of death .
4. Zombie Grasshoppers - Induced Suicide
The parasitic hairworm Spinochordodes tellinii is deadly to grasshoppers .
Once eaten by a grasshopper or cricket , the larval worm produces proteins that affect the insect 's brain and nervous system .
By the time the worm reaches adulthood , the insect is completely under its power .
The zombie grasshopper commits suicide by jumping into water , where the worm will emerge and look for a mate .
5. Zombie Fish - Luring Its Killer
The parasitic worm Euhaplorchis californiensis infects three other species in a cycle , and alters the behavior of two of them .
First , the eggs are consumed by horn snails .
While living inside a snail , sometimes for several generations , Euhaplorchis inhibits the snail 's fertility .
The parasite will eventually leave the snail and infect the gills of a killifish .
The worms will surround the fish 's brain and cause it to swim near the surface and wiggle around .
This makes the fish more likely to be eaten by a bird , which is what Euhaplorchis wanted in the first place .
The digestive system of a bird is where the worm lays its eggs , which are excreted onto the beach where snails can reach them .
6. Zombie Ants - Serving the Impostors
Even butterflies can make other species into zombies !
Maculina rebeli , a European butterfly , lay eggs that exude the scent of ant queens .
Worker ants welcome them into their colony .
The butterflies emerge as caterpillars which are fed by the ants .
The ants treat them as their own young , or even better than ordinary ant larvae since they perceive the caterpillars to be queen ant larvae .
Worker ants will even defend the caterpillars against their own queen !
You may think of ants as zombies already , but they normally only serve their own species .
7. Zombie Fish Tongue - Artificial Organ
Cymothoa exigua is a small crustacean found off the coast of California .
You do n't have to worry about it unless you are a spotted rose snapper .
C. exigua invades the mouth of these fish and grabs onto the base of the tongue , pinching off the blood supply and drinking it .
As the tongue atrophies , the fish begins to use the little isopod as a replacement tongue .
Meanwhile , C. exigua lives its life inside the fish 's mouth , drinking blood and fish slime from the tongue 's stump .
Other than the loss of its tongue , the fish suffers little from the experience , so the two can share a normal , if creepy , lifespan .
8. Zombie Cockroach - Commandeered Nursery
The Emerald Cockroach Wasp ( Ampulex compressa ) makes a slave out a much larger cockroach .
The wasp will sting the roach twice , paralyzing its front legs and taking the escape reflex away from its brain .
Then the wasp will chew off half of the roach 's antennae and uses what 's left to steer the roach to a prepared nest .
The wasp lays an egg on the roach 's abdomen and leaves .
The egg will hatch and feed off the roach , which still wo n't try to escape .
The wasp larvae keeps the docile roach alive long enough to build a cocoon inside the roach 's body and transform into an adult wasp .
An adult female wasp can enslave and lays eggs on several dozen zombie roaches .
Are there organisms that will have effects like this on human behavior ?
I believe there may be , but the voices in my head tell me they are a secret .

If you ever argued with your mother when she told you to get some sleep after studying for an exam instead of pulling an all - nighter , you owe her an apology , because it turns out she 's right .
And now , scientists are beginning to understand why .
In research published recently in Neuron , Marcos Frank , PhD , Assistant Professor of Neuroscience , at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , postdoctoral researcher Sara Aton , PhD , and colleagues describe for the first time how cellular changes in the sleeping brain promote the formation of memories .
" This is the first real direct insight into how the brain , on a cellular level , changes the strength of its connections during sleep , " Frank says .
The findings , says Frank , reveal that the brain during sleep is fundamentally different from the brain during wakefulness .
" We find that the biochemical changes are simply not happening in the neurons of animals that are awake , " Frank says .
" And when the animal goes to sleep it 's like you ’ve thrown a switch , and all of a sudden , everything is turned on that 's necessary for making synaptic changes that form the basis of memory formation .
It 's very striking . "
The team used an experimental model of cortical plasticity – the rearrangement of neural connections in response to life experiences .
" That 's fundamentally what we think the machinery of memory is , the actual making and breaking of connections between neurons , ” Frank explains
In this case , the experience Frank and his team used was visual stimulation .
Animals that were young enough to still be establishing neural networks in response to visual cues were deprived of stimulation through one eye by covering that eye with a patch .
The team then compared the electrophysiological and molecular changes that resulted with control animals whose eyes were not covered .
Some animals were studied immediately following the visual block , while others were allowed to sleep first .

From earlier work , Frank 's team already knew that sleep induced a stronger reorganization of the visual cortex in animals that had an eye patch versus those that were not allowed to sleep .
Now they know why .
A molecular explanation is emerging .
The key cellular player in this process is a molecule called N - methyl D- aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) , which acts like a combination listening post and gate - keeper .
It both receives extracellular signals in the form of glutamate and regulates the flow of calcium ions into cells .
Essentially , once the brain is triggered to reorganize its neural networks in wakefulness ( by visual deprivation , for instance ) , intra- and intercellular communication pathways engage , setting a series of enzymes into action within the reorganizing neurons during sleep .
To start the process , NMDAR is primed to open its ion channel after the neuron has been excited .
The ion channel then opens when glutamate binds to the receptor , allowing calcium into the cell .
In turn , calcium , an intracellular signaling molecule , turns other downstream enzymes on and off .
Some neural connections are strengthened as a result of this process , and the result is a reorganized visual cortex .
And , this only happens during sleep .

“ To our amazement , we found that these enzymes never really turned on until the animal had a chance to sleep , " Frank explains , " As soon as the animal had a chance to sleep , we saw all the machinery of memory start to engage . "
Equally important was the demonstration that inhibition of these enzymes in the sleeping brain completely prevented the normal reorganization of the cortex .
Frank stresses that this study did not examine recalling memories .
For example , these animals were not being asked to remember the location of their food bowl .
" It 's a mechanism that we think underlies the formation of memory . ”
And not only memory ; the same mechanism could play a role in all neurological plasticity processes .
As a result , this study could pave the way to understanding , on a molecular level , why humans need sleep , and why they are so affected by the lack of it .
It could also conceivably lead to novel therapeutics that could compensate for the lack of sleep , by mimicking the molecular events that occur during sleep .
Finally , the study could lead to a deeper understanding of human memory .
Though how and even where humans store long - lasting memories remains a mystery , Frank says , " we do know that changes in cortical connections is at the heart of the mystery .
By understanding that in animal models , it will bring us close to understanding how it works in humans . "
The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health , the National Sleep Foundation , and L'Oreal USA , and also involved researchers at the Penn ’s Center for Sleep and Respiratory Neurobiology , and the School of Life Sciences , Jawaharlal Nehru University , New Delhi , India .
Lego made amazing buildings
These little things can turn into impressive looking things .
Many might think that Lego bricks are only toys , but photos like these prove that in the hands of a talented person they can turn into true artwork .
Three days after Iran ’s disputed presidential election , as protesters took to the streets , President Obama offered a reserved statement :
He was “ troubled ” by the violence but pledged noninterference .
On Tuesday , he changed his tone only slightly , condemning the crackdown but neither denouncing the fraudulent election nor openly hoping for regime change .
The administration ’s muted response has increasingly come under attack .
How , critics ask , can the U.S. stand idly by while Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s vote - rigging regime attacks protesters ?
How could Obama remain lamely on the wrong side of history ?
In fact , the critics are wrong and the administration is right .
As Obama has argued , tarring the opposition with U.S. support would only strengthen the regime without helping the protesters .
Already , Iran ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has blamed the U.S. for backing the dissidents .
Why give his false accusations real ammunition ?
Especially when backing the protesters would neither deter the crackdown nor embolden the opposition .

As Duke University political scientist Timur Kuran has argued , the success of revolutions is a function of the relationship between individuals ’ private opinions of the government and the level of public support for the opposition .
Most people will take to the streets only when they judge public sentiment to be sufficiently aligned against the government .
Only then is it safe to act on once - private anti-government preferences .
Once enough people collectively make the decision to come out of the closet , a revolution can commence .
In Iran , public sentiment has already revealed itself , and Iranians ’ private sentiments exist independent of the U.S. government ’s position on their election .
Say Obama did what his critics want .
What would happen ?
Imagine you are a progressive , twentysomething Mir-Hossein Mousavi supporter who hates the regime but has decided -- out of laziness or self - interest -- not to join the protests .
You flip on Al Jazeera and see Obama expressing support for the opposition .
You may feel grateful .
But your decision whether to join your compatriots outside has already been made , and the calculus is unlikely to change .
Knowing the U.S. is behind you will not thicken your skull against a Basiji baton .
Furthermore , Obama ’s words will only inspire those who are pro-American to begin with .
But a February 2008 survey by the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland found that only 15 % of respondents thought “ very favorably ” of the American people .
Even when asked to distinguish between the U.S. government and the U.S. as a country , only 43 % of self - described “ reformers ” held favorable views .
Mousavi ’s ranks are more pro-American than the regime , but they no doubt include many who are not fans of the U.S .
There are critics of Obama ’s silence who realize all this , who understand that Washington can do little to affect what is essentially a domestic Iranian affair .
Still , they want Washington to say something -- anything -- in support of democracy in Iran .
Regardless of the outcome in Iran , they argue , the United States simply must stay faithful to its own values .
Anything else would be un-American .

There may be a time for harmless and empty pro-democracy rhetoric , a time when it is worth promoting American values and shameful to conceal them .
Speaking up for democracy makes sense when there are no costs to doing so : when a country ’s revolutionary tide has already turned , or when an incumbent regime is strategically irrelevant .
But when it comes to supporting the demonstrators in Iran , words would be , at best , meaningless and , at worst , counterproductive .
Smartly , Obama is forsaking concerns about standing on the right side of history in favor of pragmatism .
Let ’s hope he keeps his mouth shut .
“ Historical Amnesia ” : Reporting
The Conflict In Somalia
By Stephen Roblin
30 May , 2009
Countercurrents.org
Somalia ’s capital , Mogadishu , and the surrounding area is the site of an intense , violent conflict between the country ’s two Islamic sects : the moderate Sufi and the radical Shabab .
According to a recent New York Times article , “ a new axis of conflict has opened up in Somalia , an essentially governmentless nation ripped apart by rival clans since 1991 . ”
The article goes on say ,
If Mogadishu falls , Somalia will be dragged deeper into the violent morass that the United Nations , the United States [ my emphasis ] and other Western countries have tried hard to stanch , and the country will fragment even further into warring factions , with radical Islamists [ the Shabab ] probably on top .
Present in these comments are two common assumptions about the conflict : ( 1 ) that there has been virtually no break in the conflict in Somalia since 1991 ; and ( 2 ) that the U.S. has made efforts to end conflict in the country .
These assumptions are widely taken for granted in the reporting on Somalia by the U.S. mainstream media .
The historical record , however , does not support these assumptions .
The first assumption , that there has been no break in the conflict since 1991 , ignores a critical period in Somalia ’s recent history where Somalis enjoyed six months of peace and security .
This critical moment in Somalia ’s recent history began in June 2006 when a broad - based coalition of Islamist courts and militias , commonly referred to as the Islamic Courts Union ( ICU ) , took control of Mogadishu after defeating a coalition of warlords .
The warlords ’ defeat marked “ he first time Mogadishu had fallen under a unified administration in 16 years . ”
According to the International Crisis Group , during its six month tenure , the ICU brought “ a degree of peace and security unknown to the south for more than fifteen years . ”
By reuniting Mogadishu and removing weapons from the streets , the ICU ’s “ success at restoring peace , security and administration won admiration … from a broad cross section of Somalis . ”
The report adds that “ Communities seemed prepared to tolerate a strict interpretation of Sharia law in return for peace and security . ”
ICU - rule , however , only lasted from June to December 2006 .
Examining what led to the collapse of the ICU raises serious doubts about the second assumption present in the New York Times article , that the US has made efforts to end conflict in the country .
ICU - rule came to an end with a U.S. - backed Ethiopian invasion of Somalia .
The aim of the invasion was to bolster the Transitional Federal Government ( TFG ) — the intended “ government of national unity ” put in place in October 2004 by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development ( IGAD , a regional body of seven East African countries .
Addis Abba made the decision to overthrow the ICU ( with full blessing from Washington ) in spite of the views of Somali citizens , who saw the TFG as illegitimate – due to its corruption and inability to provide basic services to the public – and irrelevant – due to its territorial control of only the south - west city of Baidoa and one other town in southern Somalia .
Immediately after the ICU took over Mogadishu , Ethiopian troops moved across the Somali border .
For its part , the U.S. helped lay the foundation for the invasion by by sponsoring the December .
6 U.N. Security Council resolution , which allowed Ethiopia to maintain its increasing military presence ( an estimated 8,000 troops ) on Somali soil .
The U.S. also took an active role in the Ethiopian invasion through training Ethiopian troops and providing the Ethiopian military with U.S. military advisors and intelligence on the military positions of ICU fighters .
Not surprisingly , when the invasion was initiated in late December 2006 the ICU proved ill - equipped to defend itself against the regional power backed by the world ’s sole superpower .
Washington justified U.S. support and participation for the invasion on the grounds that the ICU was “ controlled by al Qaeda cell individuals , ” as put by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs , Jendayi Frazer .
Experts of Somalia , however , revealed that such claims were absolutely false .
In fact , studies have found that “ post - 9/11 fears of al - Qaeda bases in Somalia were unfounded . ”
According to one expert , Kenneth Menkhaus , the only “ legitimate ” debate concerning ICU ’s connection to Al - Qaeda was “ whether a small number of leaders in the Islamic Courts … [ had ] linkages with a small number of leaders from Al - Qaeda . ”
The invasion and subsequent occupation devastated Somalia .
Since January 2007 , “ Thousands of civilians have died in the violence that has engulfed the country , ” and “ over one million have been displaced and up to 3.2 million need humanitarian assistance . ”
These outcomes are logical consequences of the criminal nature of the Ethiopian occupation , made possible by its status as the largest recipient of U.S. financial and military assistance in Africa .
According to Human Rights
Watch , the crimes committed by Ethiopian forces included firing “ rockets , mortars , and artillery in a manner that did not discriminate between civilian and military objectives ….[ and ] deliberate attacks on civilians , particularly attacks on hospitals . ”
The U.S. response has been to refuse to “ confront or even publicly acknowledge the extent of Ethiopian military and TFG abuses in the country . ”
Any claim that the U.S. has tried to “ stanch ” the “ violent morass ” is difficult to make considering the U.S. role in driving Somalia back into a familiar state of violence , terror , and humanitarian crisis .
As for the assumptions present in the New York Times article , which in my view is representative of the general coverage in the mainstream media , one can not even begin to discus , much less report , the conflict in Somalia without mentioning the period of peace and security ushered in by the ICU and the U.S. - backed Ethiopian invasion which caused its collapse .
That is , if we are interested in understanding the causes of the “ violent morass ” and arriving at its solutions .
As put recently by Noam Chomsky , “ Historical amnesia is a dangerous phenomenon , not only because it undermines moral and intellectual integrity , but also because it lays the groundwork for crimes that lie ahead . ”

Coal must either modernise or become obsolete , the research implies About three - quarters of the world 's fossil fuel reserves must be left unused if society is to avoid dangerous climate change , scientists warn .
More than 100 nations support the goal of keeping temperature rise below 2C .
But the scientists say that without major curbs on fossil fuel use , 2C will probably be reached by 2050 .
Writing in Nature , they say politicians should focus on limiting humanity 's total output of CO2 rather than setting a " safe " level for annual emissions .
The UN climate process focuses on stabilising annual emissions at a level that would avoid major climate impacts .
It took us 250 years to burn the first half trillion , and on current projections we 'll burn the next half trillion in less than 40 years
Myles Allen
But this group of scientists says that the cumulative total provides a better measure of the likely temperature rise , and may present an easier target for policymakers .
" To avoid dangerous climate change , we will have to limit the total amount of carbon we inject into the atmosphere , not just the emission rate in any given year , " said Myles Allen from the physics department at Oxford University .
" Climate policy needs an exit strategy ; as well as reducing carbon emissions now , we need a plan for phasing out net emissions entirely . "
Forty years
The UN climate convention , agreed at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit , commits countries to avoiding " dangerous " climate change , without defining what that is .
The EU proposed some years ago that restricting the rise to 2C from pre-industrial times was a reasonable threshold , and it has since been adopted by many other countries , although some - particularly small islands - argue that even 2C would result in dangerous impacts .
Temperatures have already risen by about 0.7C during the industrial age .
Dr Allen 's analysis suggests that if humanity 's CO2 emissions total more than about one trillion tonnes of carbon , the 2C threshold is likely to be breached ; and that could come within a lifetime .
" It took us 250 years to burn the first half trillion , " he said , " and on current projections we 'll burn the next half trillion in less than 40 years . "
Inherent uncertainties in the modelling mean the temperature rise from the trillion tonnes could be between 1.3C and 3.9C , Dr Allen 's team calculates , although the most likely value would be 2C .
Oil change
The " trillion tonnes " analysis is one of two studies published in Nature by a pool of researchers that includes the Oxford group and scientists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Change Impact Research in Germany .
Impacts such as droughts would increase above 2C , the IPCC believes
The second study , led by Potsdam 's Malte Mainshausen , attempted to work backwards from the 2C goal , to find out what achieving it might mean in practice .
It suggests that the G8 target of halving global emissions by 2050 ( from 1990 levels ) would leave a significant risk of breaching the 2C figure .
" Only a fast switch away from fossil fuels will give us a reasonable chance to avoid considerable warming , " said Dr Mainshausen .
" If we continue burning fossil fuels as we do , we will have exhausted the carbon budget in merely 20 years , and global warming will go well beyond 2C . "
If policymakers decided they were happy to accept a 25 % chance of exceeding 2C by 2050 , he said , they must also accept that this meant cutting emissions by more than 50 % .
That would mean only burning about a quarter of the carbon in the world 's known , economically - recoverable fossil fuel reserves .
This is likely to consist mainly of oil and natural gas , leaving coal as a redundant fuel unless its emissions could be captured and stored .
Both analyses support the view of the Stern Review and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) in suggesting that making reductions earlier would be easier and cheaper than delaying .
But according to Potsdam 's Bill Hare , a co-author on the second paper , some key governments appear to favour pledging milder cuts in the near term in return for more drastic ones in decades to come .
" We have a number of countries - the US , Japan , Brazil - saying ' we will emit higher through to 2020 and then go down faster ' , " he said .
" That might be true geophysically , but we cannot find any economic model where emissions can fall in the range that this work shows would be necessary - around 6 % per year . "
Major intervention Myles Allen 's group has made the argument before that focussing on humanity 's entire carbon dioxide output makes more scientific and political sense than aiming to define a particular " safe " level of emissions , or to plot a pathway assigning various ceilings to various years .
Some greenhouse gases , such as methane , have a definable lifetime in the atmosphere , meaning that stabilising emissions makes sense ; but , said Dr Allen , CO2 " does n't behave like that " .
" There are multiple levers acting on its concentration and it does tend to accumulate ; also models have to represent the possibility of some feedback between rising temperatures and emissions , such as parts of the land turning from carbon sinks into sources , for example . "
The Nature papers emerge in a week that has seen the inaugural meeting of President Obama 's Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate , a new version of a body created under President Bush that brings together 17 of the world 's highest - emitting countries for discussion and dialogue .
During the opening segment , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton re-affirmed the administration 's aim of cutting US emissions by 80 % from 1990 levels by 2050 - a target espoused by some other developed countries .
But according to Malte Meinshausen 's analysis , even this reduction may not be enough to keep the average global temperature rise within 2C , assuming less developed nations made less stringent cuts in order to aid their development .
" If the US does 80 % , that equates to about 60 % globally , and that offers only a modest chance of meeting the 2C target , " he said .
Last week saw the publication of data showing that industrialised countries ' collective emissions rose by about 1 % during 2007 .

by Brett Stevens on May 31 , 2009
One interesting fellow who commented on early articles on this blog is Pete Murphy , who worked for thirty years in manufacturing and engineering for a major chemical company and now writes in his spare time .
What ’s interesting is that his book , Five Short Blasts , take an economic approach to analyzing the population problem in the United States — and economics , like mathematics , relies heavily on real - world modeling of granular , bottom - up systems , unlike the “ personality - based ” viewpoints of most political thinking .
It ’s an interesting book by an interesting author , and we ’re fortunate to have him for a round of questions .
How would you describe yourself politically — you seem fiscally conservative or libertarian , but other aspects of your philosophy seem to be more futurist .
The problem that I have with both the political left and right is that neither is addressing what I believe to lie at the root of our problems .
For the past few decades , in spite of oscillating back and forth between the left and right approaches of the Democratic and Republican parties , our economy seems to get worse .
This is because even the political center is completely off target .
While macroeconomic indicators like Gross Domestic Product seem to show an economy that , while having its ups and downs , is steadily growing , anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that something is wrong .
It ’s becoming more of a dog - eat - dog world everyday .
Well - paying jobs with good benefits are becoming ever more scarce .
Real wages are declining along with our net worth .
People are literally working themselves to death out of fear of losing their jobs .
I think that most of your readers can relate to what I ’m saying , especially older people who can remember when times were different .
I believe that these are consequences of what I call “ economical overpopulation , ” both the home - grown consequences and those imported by attempting to trade freely with nations that are even more economically overpopulated than we are .
Neither party addresses this issue because both are guided by the belief of economists that population growth is an essential element of a healthy economy .
And both parties support unfettered free trade .
Do you believe that any systems can be purely regulated by an “ invisible hand ” ?
In other words , leave guidance of our nation to the free markets , or the popular vote , or other forms of counting granular approval .
I ’ll answer with a qualified “ no . ” I generally believe in free markets but , because there are parameters at work that are unaffected by market forces while simultaneously having an effect on markets themselves , boundaries must be established within which free markets may operate .
In the first half of the 20th century , we found it necessary to establish boundaries regarding the just treatment of workers , banning abusive practices like child labor .
In the second half of the 20th century , we found it necessary to establish boundaries to protect the environment .
I believe that two additional boundaries are required .
First , population growth cannot be relied upon as a mechanism for driving economic growth .
Secondly , we must have a balance of trade .
No nation can run a large trade deficit indefinitely .
Since the U.S. trade deficit is financed by a sell - off of American assets , an obvious limit is reached when the supply of assets is depleted .
With a $ 9.2 trillion cumulative trade deficit of thirty - three consecutive years , that point has been reached and the ongoing global economic collapse is the consequence .
When you understand the role of disparities in population density between nations in driving that imbalance , you come to understand that market forces are powerless to correct it .
You point out that as population density increases , consumption decreases , which makes that for us to trade with more densely - population nations leaves us at a disadvantage .
As world population grows , however , most places are going to become more densely - populated .
Do we have a strategy for countering that , or would we be better off trading less outside our borders ?
First , a little background is necessary in order for folks to understand my answer to this question .
There is what I call an “ optimum population density , ” the point at which we have a sufficiently large population to provide the labor force necessary to produce the products required for a high standard of living , but not so large that we begin crowding together more than we ’d like , a point at which overcrowding begins to erode per capita consumption .
This “ optimum population density ” is difficult to define and we may not know that it ’s been exceeded until anecdotal evidence suggests that the line has been crossed .
But once that line is crossed , over - crowding begins to erode per capita consumption , due simply to a lack of space for using and storing products .
Perhaps an example will help .
I like to use Japan because they are a modern , prosperous country like the U.S. , but ten times as densely populated .
As a result , the per capita consumption of dwelling space – the size of their homes – is less than a third of the average American ’s , not because they like living in tiny homes but because there is n’t room for anything larger .
This means that their consumption of all products used in the construction , furnishing and maintenance of their homes is dramatically reduced .
And their per capita consumption of virtually everything ( with the exception of things like food and clothing ) is similarly affected to a greater or lesser extent .
As a result , their per capita employment in producing goods and services for domestic consumption is quite low , making them utterly dependent on manufacturing products for export to employ their excess labor capacity .
So you can see that , by engaging in free trade with such a nation , our economies combine and the work of manufacturing is spread evenly across the combined labor force .
But , while they gain access to a healthy , vibrant market , all we get in return is access to a market emaciated by over - crowding and low per capita consumption .
The result is an automatic trade deficit and loss of jobs for the U.S .
Finally , to answer your question , this means that , while free trade in natural resources with all nations and free trade in manufactured goods between nations with similar population densities is indeed beneficial , free trade in manufactured goods with badly overpopulated nations is a sure - fire loser , tantamount to economic suicide .
What I have proposed for such situations is a tariff structure for manufactured goods that is indexed to population density .
It seems to me that your idea of “ smart tariffs ” calibrated by the difference in population densities fits between the libertarian view of
unfettered free markets , and the moderate view that government regulation is good .
It ’s regulation by principle .
How does this escape the problems of regulation by bureaucracy ?
It probably does n’t .
Unfortunately , administering tariffs , “ smart ” or otherwise , is going to require a certain amount of bureaucracy .
Perhaps the most famous example of attempting to reduce the bureaucracy involved in administering tariffs was the Smoot - Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 .
Free trade advocates like to point to this act as a turn toward protectionism by the U.S. that caused the Great Depression .
That ’s simply not true .
Smoot - Hawley was only the most recent in a long history of tariff acts and barely raised tariffs at all above the previous Fordney - McCumber Tariff Act of 1922 .
It ’s real purpose was to reduce the bureaucracy involved in setting the tariff rates .
All tariffs had been previously set in “ ad valorem ” terms , which means that they were set as a percentage of the products ’ values .
It was then up to bureaucrats to determine the values , and the figures had to be reviewed and revised over time .
So Smoot - Hawley set the tariffs in firm dollar terms , eliminating the value - determining bureaucracy .
If anything , it was expected that the tariff rates would actually decline with time as inflation eroded the effective rates .
But exactly the opposite happened .
With the Great Depression came a new phenomenon – deflation – which actually sent the effective rates of the Smoot - Hawley tariffs soaring .
The lesson of Smoot - Hawley was that tariffs should always be “ ad valorem ” tariffs .
I think a better question is how “ principled ” tariffs , designed to counteract the tendency of high population densities to drive trade imbalances , would be received by the rest of the world as compared to tariffs that seem arbitrary and born out of selfishness and a fear of competition .
We tend to speak of unfettered free trade and blanket applications of protectionism as the only two choices for trade policy when , in fact , these are nothing more than the two extremes of a trade policy spectrum .
Smart trade policy employs both , preferring free trade but using tariffs in those cases where it is the only mechanism to assure a balance of trade .
Such a policy would make a trade war unlikely , since most nations would enjoy the benefits of free trade with the U.S. while only the manufactured goods of overpopulated nations would be subjected to duties .
For example , why would we want to jeopardize the extremely beneficial free trade relationship we enjoy with Canada ?
At the same time , the imposition of tariffs on nations like Japan , Germany , Korea and China is the only hope we will ever have of restoring a balance of trade with them .
Would Canada react with tariffs on U.S. goods to protest U.S. tariffs on Japan ?
Not likely .
Instead , they ’d probably be keen to adopt a trade policy similar to that of the U.S .
You show how immigration is a cause of poverty and unemployment , but is favored by corporations because it creates new consumers .
However , it seems to me that ideal consumers are those who are by ability placed into the upper half of the middle class , because these consumers buy what they perceive to be superior products , allowing competition on the basis of quality .
How does immigration affect this ?
I ’d like to begin my answer by distinguishing my case for reducing immigration from the more classic claims that immigration drives down wages .
There is some truth to that argument , but my primary concern with immigration is that it contributes dramatically to population growth , driving our population density further beyond the economically “ optimum ” level .
I want to be clear that my concern with immigration is not rooted in racism or xenophobia .
I really would n’t care if the entire population of the U.S. emigrated to foreign countries , to be replaced by immigrants from those lands .
It ’s the imbalance that ’s the problem .
Each year approximately 1.5 million immigrants ( both legal and illegal ) arrive in the U.S. while only about 50,000 people emigrate from the U.S.
Whether these immigrants are upper class , middle class or poor makes little difference .
It is true that each immigrant adds to total consumption .
Each must purchase or rent dwelling space , transportation , food , clothing , staples , etc .
So each new immigrant is another customer , making corporations happy , and each adds to our gross domestic product , making economists happy .
But each also contributes to over - crowding which very slowly and almost imperceptibly erodes per capita consumption .
This can best be illustrated by returning to the example of the per capita consumption of dwelling space in Japan .
Even though it is less than a third of the average American ’s , because they are ten times as densely populated as the U.S. , the total consumption of dwelling space is more than three times what it would be if their population density was the same as the U.S.
This is great for corporations involved in building , furnishing and maintaining Japanese homes but it ’s not good at all for the Japanese people who have to live in such crowded conditions .
Again , what ’s worse is what it does to per capita employment in these industries .
The low demand for labor drives up unemployment and puts downward pressure on wages .
This is my concern with immigration – it ’s contributing to overpopulation , driving down per capita consumption and wages while driving up unemployment and poverty .
In order to keep value , do we want to achieve constant growth , or could we achieve superior social stability and superior products and as a result , live better as merchants to the world not consumers of the world ’s products ?
It ’s the quest for constant growth that ’s actually ruining our economy .
Once the economically optimum population density has been breached , further growth becomes cancerous , fueling unemployment and driving down the purchasing power of our citizens at the same time that it ’s boosting GDP .
But economists have yet to recognize this , and ca n’t envision a healthy economy without growth , including growth in the population .
You either grow or die , they say .
Of course , this is nonsense .
We can have a stable economy that is , at the same time , healthy and robust .
Regarding the second half of your question – whether we would be better off as the world ’s consumers or as its merchants – the answer is neither .
Both imply an imbalance in trade that is ultimately unsustainable .
After more than three decades of consecutive annual trade deficits , we ’ve been bankrupted .
For us to become merchants to the world , other nations would eventually be bankrupted , just as we have been .
Ultimately , for a nation as large as the U.S. , the only way to have a sustainable , viable economy is to provide for ourselves the full range of products and services we consume , while trading what we have in excess for things that we lack .
Does immigration lead to more jobs and more overall income , or does it lead to a “ thinning ” of jobs with more jobs in low - paid labor , with a consequent proliferation of bureaucratic jobs to manage these workers ?
Immigration does lead to an increase in the total number of jobs , just as population growth does in general .
But we have to begin thinking in per capita terms .
Although the total number of jobs rises with population growth along with a total rise in demand for products , it does n’t keep pace with growth in the labor force and per capita employment begins to decline as over - crowding begins to erode our per capita consumption .
Again , consider the example of housing in Japan .
Even though the total consumption of housing is three times higher than it would be if their population growth had stopped at the current density of the U.S. , their per capita employment in that industry ( and other industries that make products for domestic consumption in Japan ) , is much lower .
Whether the population growth is due to immigration or growth in the native population is irrelevant .
What matters is the growth and , here in the U.S. , immigration accounts for well over half of our population growth .
If America were to stop being a debtor nation , stop growth and stop immigration , would her power and prestige diminish or rise ?
That ’s really two separate questions : what happens if we stop being a debtor nation and what happens if we stop growth ?
If we stop being a debtor nation by eliminating our trade deficit , we would soon realize huge benefits .
Six million manufacturing jobs would come home .
Federal spending required to offset the negative consequences of those lost jobs – unemployment benefits and so on – could be eliminated , helping to reduce the federal budget deficit and , ultimately , taxes .
And foreign policy would no longer be influenced by our dependence on foreign sources of oil and other products .
These are just a few benefits .
Regarding the question of whether our standing and prestige would be diminished if we stopped growing relative to the rest of the world , I think that on the surface it may appear that way at first .
Ultimately , however , overpopulation will prove to be source of weakness , not strength , as rising unemployment leads to civil unrest and strife and becomes a drain on nations ’ resources .
In the end , it will be nations who have dealt with the problem of overpopulation and have evolved into sustainable , healthy economies that will be the most powerful and they will be the nations the rest of the world looks to for leadership .
Many of your economic ideals seem to me similar to those of the upper half of the American middle class : quiet , small cities with low crime and an emphasis on an economy primarily driven by knowledge workers , instead of a relatively flat economic hierarchy with a predominance of unskilled manual laborers .
Economically , do you think this will be a better long - term model ?
If that ’s the impression I ’ve given regarding manual labor , then I ’m afraid I ’ve been misunderstood .
You cannot have a viable economy without manual labor .
Farming , construction , manufacturing ?
all of these activities involve some manual labor .
During the summers when I was in college , I worked as a manual laborer myself , building fence along highways .
All honest work is noble , including manual labor , and the people who do these jobs should be able to earn enough to make a living .
Some say that Americans wo n’t do this kind of work any more , and that ’s why we need immigrants .
Since I ’m an advocate of dramatically reducing our rate of immigration , both legal and illegal , I obviously believe otherwise .
Americans will do any work for decent pay .
Here in Michigan , I see Americans every day collecting the trash and pumping septic tanks .
Corporate farm operators complain that they can’t find people to pick their crops , yet the parking lot of every ?
U- Pick ?
farm that I pass is full of cars bringing people eager to spend a couple of hours picking crops to save five bucks over what they ’d pay at the grocery store .
Those who say they can’t find Americans willing to do the work are either being disingenuous or have n’t tried very hard .
The notion of a ?
knowledge - based ?
economy became popular with economists as they attempted to tamp down concerns about manufacturing job losses with a vision of a new economy that relied less upon manufacturing .
But now we can see that , if anything , at least some ?
knowledge - based ?
work may be even more easily out - sourced than manufacturing work .
Information technology jobs and some jobs in the medical field , like reading X - rays and analyzing test results , are just a couple of examples .
Nearly every person who walks the earth has a brain capable of doing ?
knowledge - based work ?
given the proper training and , unless there is something that makes the ?
knowledge - based work ?
impossible to do from a remote location , it ’s just as susceptible to being out - sourced as any other job .
In the final analysis , every sector makes a necessary and valuable contribution to our overall economy and we can’t afford to write off any jobs , regardless of how skilled or unskilled they may be .
One factor I did not see mentioned was political instability .
From my readings of history , when societies grow too fast they produce large numbers of disenfranchised and irresponsible laborers , who then join in revolt against their elites , usually killing them .
Does this future ever threaten America ?
Europe ?
That ’s a real concern .
Overpopulation produces rising unemployment which , beyond some point , can result in social unrest .
In addition , badly overpopulated regions are breeding grounds for hatred and intolerance .
It was high unemployment that fostered Hitler ’s rise to power .
And it ’s no mere coincidence that the other main antagonist of World War II , Japan , was ( and is ) badly overpopulated and was looking to expand .
Virtually everywhere you look across the globe , wherever you find the worst civil strife is where you ’ll find overpopulation , whether it ’s the Israel / Lebanon / Palestine region of the Middle East , Rwanda in Africa or , going back a few years , El Salvador in North America .
Although I would like to see the U.S. restore a balance of trade , this would certainly raise unemployment in those nations where gross overpopulation makes them utterly dependent on exports to sustain themselves .
These are the places I worry about most as having the potential for civil unrest and political instability .
“ Five Short Blasts ” seems to point to a difficulty in the paradigm of growth itself — that is , what goes up must go down .
Is there a way we can balance ourselves so we can stay at the middle of the growth curve , without experiencing the decline ?
This may be one of the more difficult concepts to understand — that for a society that has grown beyond the economically optimum population density — a falling population would actually yield an improvement in the economy as measured at the “ micro ” level .
There would be no decline !
It may be easiest to understand if you imagine a graph depicting standard of living or quality of life vs. population density .
You ’d see a parabolic curve , slowly rising as the population density increased from zero ?
the situation economists have witnessed for most of human history .
But then , at some point , the curve levels off and begins to decline as overpopulation begins to drive unemployment up .
Wages and benefits begin to decline .
Savings are eroded .
And the quality of life in general begins to decline as overcrowding precludes opportunities for recreation and , in general , makes life more of a dog - eat - dog world .
Reversing that process by reducing population would send us back - tracking up that same curve , increasing our standard of living and quality of life until we had returned to the optimum population density .
Those who measure the economy in macroeconomic terms like GDP would be dumbfounded by what they witnessed .
GDP would certainly decline and , as the process unfolded , it would look like a recession with falling home sales and vacant stores , but unemployment would actually decline and median wages would begin rising again as the decline in total consumption was outpaced by a decline in the labor force .
The demand for labor , relative to the size of the labor force , would actually increase .
There would be some problems along the way .
Eliminating blight as the ?un- development ?
process progressed would be an issue .
But the big issue that economists wring their hands over is the problem of an aging population with a shrinking percentage of workers to support them .
Taxes may have to rise as that population bubble works its way through the age spectrum and slowly vanishes .
But consider this : since it ’s impossible for population growth to continue indefinitely , it ’s a problem that has to be faced sooner or later .
It will be much easier to deal with it now instead of waiting until our population has perhaps doubled , making the size of the aging population twice as large .
It ’s time to deal with reality instead of dumping it onto future generations .
If growth is not the path to prosperity , how will society have to adjust its values systems to adapt to a better path ?
What is that path ?
I suspect that path is something that would evolve over time , and it ’s difficult to predict what form it might take .
But I think a couple of elements are fairly predictable .
First of all , it ’s easy to see that the construction sector of the economy would decline significantly , as new construction to accommodate an expanding population would vanish , leaving an industry with only a replacement market ?
replacing old homes , buildings and infrastructure as they wear out .
This also means that it wold be that much more important to restore the manufacturing sector of our economy to employ displaced construction workers .
Secondly , people will not be able to rely upon investment returns that out - pace inflation to fund their retirements , which means they ’ll have to save more .
That may seem like a daunting task in today ’s environment , but the environment will be quite different .
Thanks to a high demand for labor relative to the smaller size of the work force , well - paying jobs with benefits ( perhaps even pensions ! ) will be plentiful .
A reduced demand for resources will yield low inflation .
All of the stresses associated with constant growth will be gone .
This may be an appropriate time to point out that economists often warn of dire consequences of a declining population , pointing to examples where population decline has accompanied a declining economy .
But , in every one of these cases , they ’ve reversed the cause and effect .
The population decline has been caused by economic problems , and not vice versa .
It ’s only natural that people will move away from a bad economy to look for work elsewhere .
This is exactly the situation we see in my home state of Michigan today .
But blaming the economic decline on the falling population is putting the cart before the horse .
I ca n’t think of a single instance in which the population was reduced in a healthy economy .
Yes , some European nations have below - replacement birth rates but the population is propped up with immigration in each case .
So we have no model to predict what will happen .
But for a nation in a state of overpopulation , my theory predicts that the decline in GDP will be slower than the population decline , resulting in a boost in the standard of living of the people who remain .
As population density increases , consumption increases — but this consumption proportionately favors entertainment - based goods and services .
This seems to be a result of the expansion of a demographic of urban people who fit a new profile : middle - level , educated , middle - class but not prosperous , single and entertainment - oriented employees .
Is this difference in types of consumption important ?
You ’re speaking of what people do with their disposable income once their more basic needs of food , clothing , housing and transportation have been met .
These basic needs consume the vast majority of the income of most urban dwellers , just as it does for the suburban and rural populations .
The problem is that even the per capita consumption of products that meet some of these basic needs ?
like housing and transportation ?
is dramatically affected by population density .
City dwellers , on average , live in much smaller quarters like condos and apartments and are more likely to eschew the luxury of owning a car in favor of public transit , due the high cost of parking ( if it ’s available at all ) .
In addition , since these urban dwellers in condos and apartments have no lawns or gardens to maintain , their per capita consumption of lawnmowers , rakes , shovels and so on falls to basically zero .
So , in a country with very high population density , the per capita employment in all of the industries involved in producing and maintaining all of these products is dramatically reduced .
Yet , the city - dwellers generally have no more disposable income to spend on entertainment and travel than their suburban or rural counterparts because the relatively higher cost of housing and transportation has consumed a bigger proportion of their income .
So , does it matter if that disposable income is then spent on movies , theater and electronic gadgets as opposed to such things as golf and boating equipment ?
It ’s difficult to say , but the point is that before the first dollar of their disposable income has been spent , the bulk of their per capita consumption of other products has already been seriously eroded .
One of the things that attracted me to your ideas was your proposed balancing of population and resources , and an emphasis on quiet living
instead of radical consumption of transient products fueled by entertainment marketing .
This reminds me of what parts of the
conservation and environmental movements have been saying for years .
Do you think there ’s compatibility ?
My theory is absolutely compatible with and complementary to the environmental movement .
You ’ve probably noticed that , even though I am concerned about overpopulation , I ’ve said very little about its role in environmental degradation and resource depletion .
That ’s not because I ’m not concerned about these issues .
Rather , it ’s because I was able to arrive at this theory only by setting aside such concerns .
When I first became aware of the seriousness of the overpopulation problem , I was already aware that economists claim that there ’s really no cause for concern because man has demonstrated over and over again that he is ingenious enough to deal effectively with any obstacles to further growth .
Even though I had my doubts , I decided to assume that they were right , but still could n’t shake the feeling that there was something that economists were missing — some barrier that would prove to be our undoing .
Only then was I able to see the consequences for per capita consumption , unemployment and poverty .
And it is poverty that has been the greatest killer throughout human history .
If ecological disaster does n’t befall us first , poverty will be our downfall .
Environmentalists have done a wonderful job of raising awareness of the issue .
I do wish they would be more courageous in tackling the subject of overpopulation .
But every time they do , they run into the same wall — economists who at once raise alarm about the problems associated with an aging population and also assure us that there are technological solutions to every problem .
So my mission is to bring something new to the debate ?
a parameter of population growth that is only exacerbated by attempts to mitigate it ?
one for which there is no solution except returning to a stable , sustainable population .
I see this theory as a sort of ? ultimate weapon ?
for environmentalists , an economic argument against population growth .
Would the ?economically optimum ?
population I speak of also turn out to be an environmentally sustainable population ?
Honestly , I ca n’t really say .
I think it would be a fascinating challenge for mathematicians , probably requiring the largest super - computers available , to attempt to calculate what that optimum population would be .
The inputs for such a calculation would include the definition of a desired standard of living , the level of consumption of every product required for that standard of living , the resources and labor required to make every product , the manpower required to man factories to produce all of these products , and so on .
I ’m kind of surprised that no one has ever attempted it , as far as I know .
Ultimately , however , it may come down to anecdotal evidence .
My gut feel is that sometime in the latter half of the 20th century is when we ( the U.S. ) breached our economically optimum population density , perhaps when we had half as many people as today , just based on my lifetime of experience in the labor force .
There was a clear transition from emphasis on manufacturing volume and efficiency to cost - cutting and down - sizing .
From a micro-perspective , the economy clearly took a turn for the worse .
So , if the U.S. is overpopulated by a factor of two , then China is overpopulated by a factor of eight .
Japan is overpopulated by a factor of twenty .
Korea is overpopulated by a factor of thirty , and so on .
Reducing populations around the world accordingly would be quite a dramatic reduction .
But only environmentalists could determine whether it would still be enough .
But , if not , we ’d have taken an enormous step in the right direction .
On the other hand , I ’ll concede that environmental parameters may prove to be the upper limits for population growth before the poverty that my theory predicts really takes hold in a big way .
Either way , the dawning of a new age will have begun and I ’ll be just as happy .
Your ideas could be a line into what one might see as the beginning of meta- politics , or a political system that avoids polarity to an ideology and instead focuses on the pragmatic needs of our situation .
This gets outside political language , which while self - consistent may not be consistent with reality outside the political sphere , and forces a change in focus from the marketing of ideas to practical adaptation .
Do you think such a meta- politics is possible in our lifetimes ?
Had you asked me this question ten years ago , I would have replied “ no , ” it ’s not possible that my ideas could be incorporated into mainstream thinking and into politics in my lifetime , or in the lifetime of anyone alive today .
But one of the things that continues to amaze me is how rapidly change is unfolding , including the economic collision I warned of with Five Short Blasts .
Although I expected it may take decades for the real consequences of our trade deficit to be felt , it ’s already upon us , collapsing the global economy .
And thanks to the rapidly evolving acceptance of the dangers of global warming , although economists and world leaders still cling desperately to the notion that technological fixes alone will be sufficient , widespread recognition of the role of overpopulation ca n’t be far behind .
But real progress may not come until these ideas begin to take root in the field of economics .
I targeted Five Short Blasts at average Americans , hoping to start a grass roots understanding of the role of overpopulation in our economic demise , believing that I could never be taken seriously by economists for two reasons : because anyone raising the issue of overpopulation is immediately dismissed by economists as a ?
Malthusian ?
and because my background is not in the field of economics .
But that has n’t stopped me from pushing these ideas with economists , and I ’ve found a few who would listen .
Helping matters is the fact that the field of economics is in some disarray now , following the economic meltdown .
Many are questioning whether economists are missing something , and the field seems more open to new ideas .
It ’s interesting that you ’ve ended this interview with this question because it ’s similar to the question I posed in the final two paragraphs of the epilogue of my book :
“ Have I struck a spark large enough to start a fire , or will it flicker and die ?
Will others more eloquent and influential than I take up the cause ?
Will opportunistic young activists recognize the potential of these fresh ideas for launching political careers among the irrelevant and dying philosophies that surround them ? ”
I ’ve been asked by others how I will know if I ’ve been successful .
I probably will never know .
To be successful , I do n’t need to sell a million copies of this book .
I only need to get one copy into the right hands .
Thanks Pete for a great interview .

UPDATE : See the post “ Delicious.com , checking user numbers against Benford ’s Law ” if you want to see an one more example .
UPDATE 2 : Brandon Gray has done a nice related work in Clojure , here is the link to the blog .
As Wikipedia says :
Benford ’s law , also called the first - digit law , states that in lists of numbers from many real - life sources of data , the leading digit is distributed in a specific , non-uniform way .
According to this law , the first digit is 1 almost one third of the time , and larger digits occur as the leading digit with lower and lower frequency , to the point where 9 as a first digit occurs less than one time in twenty .
The basis for this “ law ” is that the values of real - world measurements are often distributed logarithmically , thus the logarithm of this set of measurements is generally distributed uniformly .
Which means that in a dataset ( not all , of course ) from a real - life source of data , like for example , the Death Rates , the first digit of every number in this dataset have “ 1 ” almost one third of time , “ 2 ” in 17.6 % of times , and so on in a logarithmic scale .
The Benford ’s law distribution formulae is :
Where the “ n ” is the leading digit .
This formulae makes the follow distribution plot ( from Wikipedia image ) :
So I ’ve made a Python module , called “ pybenford ” , which helps me in the creation and analysis of datasets , like the Stock Historical Prices for Apple Inc .
I think that the code is simple enough to understand and reuse :
import pybenford import csv def convert_value ( value ) : return float ( value.replace ( " , " , " . " ) ) stock_file = open ( " apple_stock.csv " , " r " ) csv_apple_stock = csv.reader ( stock_file , delimiter= " ; " ) yahoo_format = csv_apple_stock.next ( ) stock_prices = [ convert_value ( row[ yahoo_format.index ( " Volume " ) ] ) for row in csv_apple_stock ] benford_law = pybenford.benford_law( ) benford_apple = pybenford.calc_firstdigit(stock_prices ) pybenford.plot_comparative( benford_apple , benford_law , " Apple Stock Volume " )
This code will iterate over the Apple Inc. historical data downloaded from Yahoo !
Finance and will verify the leading digit for the field “ Volume ” of the dataset , the dataset is from between 1984 and today ( 200 ) .
Then the pybenford will plot ( using Matplotlib ) a comparative graph of the dataset with the Benford ’s Law distribution .
In the graph , there is a Pearson ’s Correlation value on the title ; the Pearson ’s Correlation ranges from +1 to - 1 .
A correlation of +1 means that there is a perfect positive linear relationship between variables .
Follow the plot of comparative ( click on the image to enlarge ) :
As you can surprisely see , we have a strong correlation between the Volume data and the Benford ’s Law , the Pearson ’s Correlation was 0.98 , a higher coefficient , this is like black magic for me =)
Follow another graph of the opening stock prices :
The correlation this time was low , but it continues with a significant Pearson ’s coefficient of 0.80 .
I hope you enjoyed =)
The source - code for the “ pybenford ” can be downloaded here .
This module is a simple collection of some very very simple functions .
First Image Of Mickey Rourke As Whiplash in Iron Man 2 !
Heeeeeere 's Mickey !
And he 's suited up to take on Iron Man , or maybe a monster truck ...
CBM Comment : Looks like Whippy has got his hands on one of Stark 's power cells !
Here 's a bit of the USA Today Article ...
In Iron Man 2 , the scarlet and golden - metaled hero must face an adversary with some amazing gadgets of his own .
Whiplash ( Mickey Rourke ) sports a power pack on his chest that looks similar to the one that Iron Man ( Robert Downey Jr. ) uses .
" The technologies are definitely related , " says director Jon Favreau .
" That 's part of the core theme of the film . "
The villain 's alter ego , Ivan Vanko , is a Russian who " has constructed his own version of a suit , " Favreau says .
Among the creative innovations : a pair of whips , powered by the suit 's glowing chest piece , that are expected to keep Iron Man cracking .
I would have thought it would be another couple of months , at least , until we saw this .
But here it is !
Looks pretty sweet to me .
Can't wait till May 2010 .

Bank Bailout Documents

Washington , DC -- May 13 , 2009
Documents Detail Historic Treasury / Bankers Meeting – but Geithner Input on Key Document Withheld from the Public
Judicial Watch , the public interest group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption , announced today that it forced the Obama administration to release documents about the October 13 , 2008 , Treasury Department meeting that coerced major banks to allow the government to take $ 250 billion equity stakes .
Among the other news , the documents confirm former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson told the CEOs of nine major banks that they had no choice but to allow the government to take equity stakes in their institutions .
The documents show Obama Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , FDIC Chairman Shelia Blair , and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke co-hosted the meeting with Paulson .
Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request about the bankers meeting on October 16 , 2008 .
After months of stonewalling , a FOIA lawsuit was filed against the Obama Treasury Department on January 27 , 2009 .
Incredibly , on February 4 , Treasury responded it had no documents about the historic meeting .
Pressure from Judicial Watch forced Treasury to reevaluate its response , which resulted in this document release last month .
Included in the new documents are :

Dan Wiebe had grown all too familiar with the routine of the 2:00 AM phone call .
Bbbbrrrrrdddddiiiing .
What the – huh ?
Bbbbrrrrrdddddiiiing .
Oh , great .
What time is it ?
Bbbbrrrrrdddddiiiing .
Okay , okay , I ’m coming !
Bbbbrrrrrdddddiiiing .
Please be a wrong number , " Hello ? "
It was never a wrong number .
It was always someone from support , they were always calling about some system or another that had crashed , and by the time it got to him , the problem always required a solution a bit more in - depth than " just reboot the server . "
This time proved to be no different : the data link server flat - out refused to communicate with the daily extracts loader .
I swear , Dan grumbled as he pored over log file after log file , I am going to cut someone .
I will .
I 'm not kidding .
This is complete bullsh — aha !
This has to be it !
After blearily working on the problem for an hour and a half or so , Dan discovered that the problem was caused by a misplaced 0x0A , a single byte representing a line feed that had somehow found its way into a text field .
The next hour or so of digging led to the source of the problem .
Although the daily extracts loader was constructing data packets properly , it was outputting a few more bytes than it should .
Tamme Burns , the developer responsible for the loader , decided to add a last - minute " feature " that would output a carriage return byte ( 0x0D ) before the first 0x0A .
It looked something like this :
char outp = data [ i++ ] ; if ( outp == '
' && first ) { writeByte( ' \r ' ) ; first=0 ; } writeByte( outp ) ;
Because the packet was already framed , the additional byte pushed all of the remaining fields down a byte , which caused all sorts of numeric and text framing errors on parsing .
Fortunately , Dan was able to hack together a horrifyingly ugly fix and get the data link and extracts loader talking again .
With the clock approaching 5:00 AM , Dan wrote up a quick email explaining what happened and sent it too all those affected , including Tammie Burns .
All ,
The problem is a framing error caused when the JKU348 field contains a newline character .
The packet assembly code is working fine , and our packet parsing code is working fine , but the code between us and Tammie Burns needs to be beaten into submission .
I have implemented an ugly hack that will work temporarily , but it will cause performance problems until the real issue is addressed .
Thank you , Dan PS - I 'll be in a little late tomorrow .
Figuring he deserved to go in a couple hours late , he set his alarm for 9:00 AM and went back to bed .
But when he got to work the next morning , there was no fanfare , no " attaboy ! " , not even a single " good morning , Dan " .
Instead , most everyone averted their eyes and stared at the floor .
Some watched him with wide eyes , as if he had committed some grave offense .
A few people even whispered and pointed as he walked towards his cube .
Before he even had a chance to sit at his desk , Dan 's boss , Greg , rushed over .
" Look man , " he said nervously , " you 've gotta help me out with this .
I 've gone to the mat for you , but if you can't explain yourself , then both of us will probably be fired by the end of the day ! "
Dan looked puzzled , to say the least .
Greg continued , " I mean , I get that it was late and all , but seriously ?
What the hell were you thinking , man ? "
" Err , " Dan scratched his head , " huh ?
I do n't know ? "
" We gotta do some serious damage control here , " Greg was frantic , " I mean , I do n't even know .
This hit division , man !
Division !
Nothing ever goes to division , you know that !
This is some serious sh — "
Interrupting , Dan said " what are you talking about ?
Did I miss something ? "
Greg seemed just as surprised as he was .
" Uhhh , " he stammered , handing Dan a print out , " this ! "

The problem is a framing error caused when the JKU348 field contains a newline character .
The packet assembly code is working fine , and our packet parsing code is working fine , but the code between us and Tammie Burns needs to be beaten into submission .
I have implemented an ugly hack that will work temporarily , but it will cause performance problems until the real issue is addressed .

As Dan followed the long list of forwards , Greg continued , " they wanted to fire you immediately , man !
I really had to put my neck on the line for this .
I mean , how — "
" Not to cut you off , " Dan said , cutting Greg off , " but did anyone actually read my message ? "
Dan handed the paper back to Greg , who then took a second look at the email .
They both had a chuckle after realizing what happened .
When Tammie Burns glanced at Dan 's message , her email client just happened to wrap the incoming message so that her name appeared at the beginning of a line .
This naturally drew her attention , while the rest of the sentence terrified her : " Tammie Burns needs to be beaten into submission . "
After highlighting the offending phrase , she sent the email to her boss , who sent it to his boss , who sent it to his boss , who sent it to the CTO , who sent it all the way back down to Greg .
Everyone was equally horrified and , if it were n't for Greg 's passionate defense of his subordinate , Dan would have likely been met by the police at the edge of the company 's property that morning .
To their credit , everybody else felt pretty silly when Greg implored them to read the sentence again and try to identify the subject .
Even Tammie Burns , who no longer feared being beaten into submission because of some bad code
THE NICAP SITE PRESENTS
The RAND Corporation published a paper titled " UFOs : What to Do ? ,
Here is the actual RAND Document in pdf format
Fran Ridge :
Originally , the RAND Corporation , a high level research group that had nothing to do with the business - machine firms and one of the most unpublicized yet highly competent contractors to the Air Force , stated in a letter dated June 25 , 1969 that they were unable to identify any RAND publication on UFOs " available for external distribution . "
Then , in another letter dated August 8th , 1969 RAND stated , " RAND has done very little on the subject of UFOs : therefore , no publications have been written on the subject . "
I also have a copy of a letter dated October ?
1969 from the Department of the Air Force , to Mr. William Laub , of Northfield , Illinois .
The letter was written by Lt. Col. James H. Aikman , Chief , Civil Branch , Community Relations Division , Office of Information .
It states , " The Rand Corporation has never made any reports on unidentified flying objects ( UFOs ) for the United States Air Force .
If any reports were made by this corporation they were made on their own . "
RAND finally had to admit the existence of this paper and later stated that it was originally produced as an internal document and not prepared for or delivered to any of RAND 's clients .
RAND decided to make this paper available to the public if they asked for it .
This document , which crops up for discussion every once in a while , is placed here , with commentary at the end of this page , for the record .
In regard to the commentary I have made a request to CUFOS ( Nov. 2006 ) to locate a copy of a letter from George Kocher to Dr. J. Allen Hynek to document the contents mentioned by Jan Aldrich and confirm the date of same .

UFOs : What to Do? George Kocher 27 November 1968 For RAND Use Only DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE IN EXTERNAL RAND PUBLICATIONS OR CORRESPONDENCE
-1- INTRODUCTION
Common sense is the quintessence of the experiences and prejudices of its time .
It is a most unreliable advisor when one is confronted with a perfectly new situation .
Gustav Naan UFOs -- unidentified flying objects , or flying saucers as they are often called -- have been on the mind of the public for at least the last 22 years .
For a number of reasons , we know little more about them now than we did at the outset .
There exists a great amount of misinformation about the phenomenon not only in the minds of the public , but among educated groups such as scientists as well .
It is the purpose of this series of essays to describe various aspects of the phenomenon , make clear my prejudices and the reasons for them , and to suggest a means of proceeding on this interesting and potentially very significant problem .
But first , a few words about the term UFO .
J. A. Hynek , an astronomer having continuous involvement with UFO study for over 20 years , defines UFOs as " any reported aerial or surface visual sighting or radar return which remains unexplained by conventional means even after examination by competent persons .
This definition ... specifies neither flying nor objects . " ( 1 ) I would agree , but would prefer to replace " or radar return " with " or instrumental observation " and " even after examination by competent persons " to " even after competent examination by qualified persons . "
This , then , is the definition I have adopted in the five essays that follow .

40 -2 - PART 1 : UFOs -- HISTORICAL ASPECTS
Those familiar with the UFO literature are aware that reports of sightings did not begin with Arnold 's sighting in 1947 , but that phenomenology much the same as is reported today can be found in documents going back to the earliest times .
Vallee ( 2 ) gives a sampling of this ; B.L.P. Trench ( 3 ) has made a more thorough study and reports on the research of others able to study the original documents .
What was reported ?
Luminous discs , shields , globes and elongated objects in the sky , sometimes alone , sometimes in large numbers .
Occasional descriptions of interactions with the observers are also mentioned , including landings , and seeing and communicating with occupants .
The latter events especially were almost always interpreted in a religious context .
A recent example is the repeated appearance of a typical UFO phenomenology at Fatima , Portugal on six successive months in 1917 .
The October 13 phenomenon was the best reported and was witnessed by a crowd of about 70,000 persons , including a number of scientists , reporters , atheists , and agnostics , as wel as faithful Catholics .
One of the scientifically curious was Dr. A Garrett of the University of Coimbra .
Rain , which had been falling that day , ceased and the crowd looked up to see the " sun " now visible through the heavy clouds .
Professor Garrett wrote , " ... I turned toward this ( sun ) which was attracting all eyes and I could see it like a disk with a clear cut edge , with a vivid rim , luminous and shining , but without hurting one .
The comparison I have heard at Fatima with a disk of dull silver , does - 3 - not seem to me exact .
It was a clearer , more vivid , richer color and with shifting tints like the luster of a pearl .
It was not at all like the moon on a clear transparent night , for one saw and felt it like a living star .
Nor was it spherical like the moon , nor did it have the same quality of lighter and less light .
It looked like a burnished wheel cut out of mother - of - pearl .
Nor could it be confused with the sun seen through a fog -- there was no fog ...
This disc spun dizzily round .
It was not the twinkling of a star : it whirled round upon itself with mad rapidity ...
The sun , preserving the celerity of its rotation , detached itself from the firmament and advanced , blood - red , towards the earth , threatening to crush us with the weight of its vast and fiery mass .
These moments made a terrifying impression . "
( 4 ) The relationship of the old phenomenology to religion are discussed by Thomas .
( 5 ) An example of earlier celestial displays of interest is illustrated in Figs 1 and 2 .
These are broadsheets from Nuremberg ( 1561 ) and Basel ( 1566 ) , respectively .
The psychologist , C. G. Jung ; provides an analysis of the contents of the woodcuts in his interesting book .
( 6 ) Reference 7 has a very interesting reproduction of a fourteenth century fresco in a Yugoslavian church .
The modern period of the phenomenon began with a widely publicized sighting made by Kenneth Arnold in Washington state in 1947 .
A study by Bloecher of North American reports over the four week period bracketing the Arnold sighting lists 853 events , including 38 sightings made before Arnold 's heavily publicized Sighting .
( 8 ) Because the early reports seemed to suggest airborne craft of unusual appearance and kinematics , the problem came to rest with the newly organized U.S. Air Force .
Initial fears were that the country was being over flown by advanced foreign aircraft , possibly on intelligence missions .
The latter was suggested by the large number of sightings from the White Sands , New Mexico area and from the vicinity of the Hanford , Washington atomic plant .
Serious inquiry proceeded for a few years without any positive results .
A number of supposedly knowledgeable people spoke out pointing out the sporadic nature of the sightings , and that since the reported - 4 - Both Broadsheets from the Wickiana Collection , Zurich Central Library - 5 - kinematics were inconsistent with current physical theory , the UFOs were not likely to be from a foreign power .
Further , they argued , no other planets in our solar system were believed to support life -- certainly not intelligent life -- and since even the nearest star was over four light years away , the hypothesis of extraterrestrial origin was simply unacceptable from a scientific point of view .
( 9 ) The Air Force investigative effort worked as follows : ( 10 ) Whenever a sighting was made , a report was to be made out and turned in to the Air Force at base level .
The report was forwarded to Wright - Patterson AFB , Ohio for study .
If the report was interesting enough , follow up inquiry was made .
By 1952 the number of reports coming in was so large that the CIA was concerned that an actual attack on the country might not be immediately recognized .
A panel of scientists was then convened in January 1953 to study the available evidence and see what conclusion could be reached about UFOs .
After seven days of hearing evidence and discussing the matter it was concluded that there was only circumstantial evidence of the extraterrestrial hypothesis .
The panel recommended a broadened study effort with full disclosure of investigations .
In order to unplug the military intelligence channels , however , the CIA recommended that , since the UFOs apparently posed no threat , the Air Force should debunk UFO reports and try generally to discourage public interest in them , in the hope that they would go away .
( 11 )
It was the CIA 's recommendation , apparently , that was made policy , for the investigative procedures used since 1953 have been vestigial and the handling of the subject by the authorities tended to make witnesses look ridiculous .
In spite of the unfavorable publicity accorded witnesses , reports persisted , and no doubt in response to official behavior several civilian study groups were formed to receive reports and investigate sightings .
The most successful of these groups is the National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena ( NICAP ) .
NICAP 's membership is well dispersed geographically and acts to learn as much as possible from sightings .
The large number of scientific and technical personnel in the NICAP membership aids the quality of their evaluations .
A summary of characteristics of the UFO phenomenology published by NICAP - 6 - in 1964 ( 12 ) contains 575 reports that were extensively checked by NICAP for accuracy .
A series of sightings in 1965 and 1966 received considerable public attention arid after the poor public reception given the official explanations , the Air Force felt compelled to contract for a 15 month ( later stretched to l8 months ) scientific study to be performed at the University of Colorado under the leadership of E. U. Condon , a highly respected physicist .
The Condon Committee is due to complete investigations at the end of June 1968 ; its report will be reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences ( presumably to validate that the study was indeed the objective pearl of the scientific method that was desired ) , and is expected to be made public in October 1968 .
Unfortunately , the dismissal of two members of the Committee in February 1968 resulted in publicity suggesting that the study was not , in fact , objective .
It remains , therefore , to see the final report to determine the worth of the study .
In the meantime , the respectability accorded UFOs by the $ 500,000 study contract permitted a considerable amount of scientific interest to surface .
Astronomer Hynek has made a number of public statements on the basis of his long involvement as a consultant to the Air Force ; atmospheric physicist James F. McDonald has turned his attention full time to the subject , and a number of scientific and technical journals have printed some dialogue - notably Science , the AIAA Journal , Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and the Journal of the Astronautical Sciences .
It is also noteworthy that the University of Toronto has recently formed a UFO study group .
Even the Soviets , who previously refused even to discuss the subject now admit to having a study group with good qualifications .
The USSR Academy of Sciences still holds to the orthodox scientific view that UFOs are a nonproblem , however , using the same arguments we heard so long .
These arguments are just as invalid in the USSR as in the USA .
It therefore appears that the subject is slowly and finally being regarded as a fit subject of scientific inquiry .
It is hoped that enough scientists will acquaint themselves with the subject so that progress can finally be made .
-7 - ( Reference 13 is a good account of how the UFO phenomenon was treated in the U.S. and is recommended to those wondering how science came to consciously ignore the subject . )
-8 - PART 2 : UFOs -- ASTRONOMICAL ASPECTS
The astonishing thing would be if they did not exist .
Jean Cocteau
We saw in Part 1 that the historical aspects suggest an extraterrestrial explanation to UFOs .
While it has not been established that the contemporary phenomena are extensions of the historical , there does seem to be a continuity in the descriptions of the phenomena described .
We shall therefore look at contemporary astronomical knowledge and theories and ascertain the likelihood of the existence of other highly developed life forms .
To begin with , the observable universe -- that is , the distance to which we can observe luminous objects -- is several billion light years in radius ( a light year is the distance light travels in a year at a rate of 186,300 miles per second .
The sun is 8 light minutes from the earth .
The next - nearest star is 4.2 light years away ) .
Within this vast volume we find hundreds of millions of galaxies .
Our own ( Milky Way ) galaxy is similar to many of those we see at great distances .
It is a lens - shaped assemblage of some 100 billion stars having a diameter of about 100,000 light years .
The sun is but one of its component stars and lies about 30,000 light years from the center , close to the plane of symmetry .
Now let us just consider the stars in our own galaxy -- specifically excluding those in neighboring or distant galaxies .
We would like to estimate the number of stars having planets roughly similar to the Earth .
From the statistics of stars within 15 light years of the sun we find that only about one - third are single , the rest binary or multiple .
Since planetary orbits are often unstable in multiple systems ( depending on the details of the configuration ) we will say that only 30 billion stars in our galaxy now have a dynamical environment that permits planets to exist around them .
Will these stars have planets ?
We cannot state with assurance that they will ; however , current knowledge supports the theory that planetary formation is a natural adjunct to formation of the star itself from the interstellar gas cloud .
-9 -
We would therefore expect about 30 billion stars to have one or more planets .
Now , we can reject certain classes of stars as candidates or habitable planets , because their lifetimes are too short ( these are stars of high mass ) .
Others can be rejected because of variability in light output , a characteristic that would make evolutionary development of life much more difficult .
In fact if we select only those stars similar to the sun ( whose peak of radiation energy coincides with a region of terrestrial atmospheric transparency ) we have only a few percent of the total -- about one in 30 .
Therefore , we would expect about 1000 million suitable solar type stars exist .
Of these , it is estimated by various astronomers that 200-600 million have planets at about the right distance and have been around long enough that life forms as developed as our own could exist .
Implicit in further discussion are the assumptions that : 1 . Planets and / or life evolves to a mutual compatibility ;
2 . The life force , whether spontaneous or otherwise , is such that whenever the environment is favorable , life will exist ;
3 . Our own history of past evolution and development is neither slow nor fast , but average and typical for life forms .
( Ours is the only example available and no one has yet demonstrated that the " average " galactic life form should be any different . )
Now let us turn momentarily to time scales .
The sun and earth are on the order of 5 billion years old .
We might define modern man as being about 5000 years old ( Stonehenge is 4000 years old ) -- just one millionth of the earth 's age .
The age of science is certainly not more than 500 years , so our scientific and technical development has thus far occupied only one ten - millionth of the earth 's life span .
We expect the sun will burn another 5 billion years before significant changes in its brightness occur .
Now the age of the galaxy is between 5 and 10 billion years ; therefore among the 200-600 million stars we would expect to have acceptable planets , some would be older than the sun , some younger ( for star formation is still continuing , even though at a lesser rate than in the galaxy 's early history ) and some the same age .
It should be clear from assumption ( 3 ) and the example of our own - 10 - development , that among the populated planets those younger than the sun would be peopled by beings very much behind us technologically , while those on older planets would be extraordinarily advanced ( remember our progress of 500 years and note that some planets could be as much as a few billion years older ) .
Indeed , we would be surprised to find someone else at just our stage of technological development .
For the purposes of this paper , we can ignore both the multitude younger than ourselves and those at our point of development .
Even so , we are left with the possibility of 100,000,000 planets in the galaxy having life forms very much advanced from us .
( This number would be reduced significantly if life forms destroyed themselves soon after reaching our age of development .
This is a philosophical point on which I am optimistic -- I believe the majority of races will learn to survive . )
If these stars are uniformly distributed in the galactic disk , the average separation will be about 10 light years .
The usual scientist 's reaction at this point is , well , even if the assumptions are correct and this number of advanced civilizations does exist , contact is still impossible because of the speed of light limitation of the theory of relativity .
An excellent example of this kind of reasoning can be found in Ref. 14 .
My reply is that such a statement would appear to be shortsighted .
For the moment , let us ignore the possibilities of overcoming the long time of travel by suspended animation and the like .
Recall that our own physical theory has been developed in only 500 years .
What can we expect in the next 500 ?
Or 1000 or million or even billion years ?
I suggest that _if_ a way to circumvent the speed of light restriction is possible , it has already been found by someone in our galaxy .
( I have n't the faintest idea how this might be done and I fully agree that our own experimental data appear to accurately confirm the existence of this limitation . )
If it has been discovered by one , we certainly would expect it to be used ; if no other planet 's inhabitants independently discovered the means , it makes little difference for such a thing could be taught by the discoverer .
Thus we may conclude that it is very likely that at least one , and probably many of the 100 million advanced planetary populations is capable of interstellar travel .
- 11 - The next question is , of course , have any of them been here ?
That question cannot yet be answered definitively .
Without knowing what kind of phenomenology extraterrestrial visitors might exhibit , I will fall back on my scientific , mechanistic attitudes and say it makes sense to look for some kind of vehicle or spaceship .
It appears that the class of phenomenology called UFO reports may contain , as a subset , actual observations of such craft .
We shall now turn to the reports to see when and where things are seen and by whom and what phenomenology , if any ) is revealed by the reports .
( Further information about the astronomical and biological possibilities are in Ref. 15 , whose principal defects are ( 1 ) the authors uninformed rejection of UFO phenomenology as being relevant to the subject under discussion , and ( 2 ) their meek acceptance of the speed - of - light restriction as a universal truth .
References 16 and 17 provide more detailed and more technical discussions of some aspects of the problem . )
- 12 - PART 3 : UFOs -- THE CHARACTER OF REPORTS
Any collection of reports of unknown aerial sightings by the public will include a large percent of noise - sightings of something explainable .
The reports are made because the appearance falls outside the range of the observer 's experience , and the observer believes it is sufficiently anomalous to warrant the attention of authorities .
Thus , any large collection of reports will include descriptions of aircraft , balloons ) spacecraft , astronomical objects , atmospheric effects and the like .
Often the practiced and perceptive analyst can recognize the stimulus , particularly if he has access to records of aircraft , balloon , and satellite movements , meteorological data and astronomical phenomenology .
Recognition of stimulus is aided by a high quality report which is as quantitative as possible and which shows the observer to be able to differentiate between observation and interpretation .
Of course a number of reports will be so lacking in details that no conclusion can be reached about what was seen .
These are of little use ; they may , however , serve as corroborating evidence to another , higher quality , report and should not , therefore be rejected .
The really interesting class of reports is that reporting phenomenology which is clearly extraordinary .
The observer 's qualifications may be such that the report is not only highly credible but is articulate and quantitative as well .
It is this subclass of reports , variously estimated at 5 to 20 percent of the total , that offer hope of our learning what is going on .
Hynek considers two parameters of reports ) credibility and strangeness , and suggests that the investigator really needs only to be concerned with reports having high strangeness and high credibility .
The physical scientist is in a position to evaluate strangeness , the social scientist should be able to provide some measure of credibility .
Hynek also comments on a number of beliefs about UFOs and reports stating , ( 18 ) among other things , that most reports are made by people who previously never gave much thought to UFOs ; that reports are not always vague ; and that well educated , well trained , reliable , stable people also contribute reports .
These conclusions have been reached by most people who have taken the trouble to collect and investigate reports first hand .
- 13 - To illustrate the character of reports , I will quote several narratives from the literature .
( Narratives , of course , are just the beginning of any report .
Quantitative information , usually not given in the narrative must be obtained by careful interview of the witness . )
The first is taken from a collection of 160 reports by Olsen . ( 19 ) It was originally made to NICAP .
Date : 24 April 1962
Place : Springfield ( Delaware County ) , Pennsylvania First witness , J. A. Gasslein , Jr. ( Lt. Colonel , USAR Ret. ) reports : " Time : Approximately 1945 hours , weather : clear , cloudless , medium blue sky , visibility good .
" My wife was driving her mother home following the latter 's visit to our home .
They had driven around the block to higher ground when my wife 's mother looked out the car window and saw a large object .
It was moving slowly and silently in an east - to - west direction at not over 50 ft. above street level .
( Determined by the proximity to and relationship to the size of the Cape - Cod - type bungalows over which the object was passing . )
My wife then plainly saw the object herself .
" Anxious to have me see the object , my wife quickly drove the car back to our house and attracted my attention .
I had been working in the basement .
I ran out of the house and up the street for a view .
by the time I saw it , the object appeared to be about a quarter to a half - mile away , moving in a westerly direction .
I saw it as an object smaller at the top than at the base , seemingly suspended in the air at an angle of about 45 degrees from my position , and giving off colored lights .
I know that the object was not any kind of conventional aircraft of balloon .
" Having had the advantage of a closer viewing than I , my wife describes the object as follows .. " ' The UFO appeared to be about the size of one of the Cape Cod houses over which it passed , which would make it approximately 30 ft. in diameter and about the same dimension in height .
It was circular , surmounted by a dome giving off flashes of green light .
The center section rotated a series of square shaped " windows " , each giving off a brilliant white light .
The base section was somewhat saucer - shaped , - 14 - curved upward .
Shafts of white light were directed downward from the base . '
Unfortunately , my wife cannot recall if the exterior was metallic in appearance .
In any event , the object had a well - defined outline .
Again , it moved silently .
There was no evidence of occupants of the UFO .
" Approximately 20 to 25 minutes following the first sighting described above , the following sighting occurred : " Returning from taking her mother home , my wife drove the car into our driveway alongside the house , headed westward .
In the rear of our home was a wooded park area .
My wife walked down the driveway to enter the house .
Coming up the driveway was a neighbor friend , a young lady 20 years of age .
In a tone of astonishment , she called my wife 's attention to the park area , from which was emerging an object of the same description as outlined above moving easterly at low level -- not over 50 ft.
above ground level , as judged by the trees in the area -- the UFO proceeded relatively slowly and without sound .
It was approaching the rear of our home and adjacent properties .
" Again , my wife called me from the basement .
By the time I got outside , the object had made a 90 degree turn northward and was proceeding parallel to the backs of the houses in the same line as ours .
It was perhaps 150 - 200 yards distant .
My observation of the characteristics of the UFO tallied with my wife 's and the young lady's .
Each of them independently made a pencil sketch within a few minutes after the sighting , and the sketches were substantially alike .
" All told , there were at least 15 persons in the vicinity who acknowledged seeing the object at about the same time as the sightings made by my wife and myself . "
Another witness , P. T. Scattergood , reports : " Around 8 ( p.m. ) I stepped out the front door , facing south and saw a brilliantly lighted object low in the southern sky .
At first I took it to be a jet taking off from Philadelphia Airport , which is in that general direction .
But I could hear no engine noise and it was traveling too slowly to be a plane .
Also it did not have the usual blinking lights .
" It appeared to have a row of yellowish lights ( which I took for the windows of the " jet " ) with a clear green light at the top .
As I - 15 - watched , the row of lights appeared to be obscured as though a large paddle - wheel were revolving and blotting them out , beginning with the rear lights and proceeding forward .
Since the object was moving west , I saw the right hand side of it .
The periodic appearance and disappearance of the lights was perfectly regular .
The top green light was constantly visible .
I stood on the pavement and watched the object sail leisurely to the west until it disappeared behind some trees .
The observation probably lasted from 5 to 10 minutes . "
This report has the desirable features of the UFO being seen by a number of people ( about 15 ) of which two actually made reports .
( Hynek estimates the number of sightings to be about 10 times the number of reports turned in ) .
Other desirable aspects of this sighting are that it was made during daylight ; that it was near enough that some details of its configuration were observable ; and , it was visible long enough to allow the observers to consider " explanations " as they watched it .
The second example is reported by James F. McDonald in T. Bloecher 's book on an intense period of UFO activity in 1947 .
The report was made 20 years after the sighting to Prof.
McDonald for the reasons given at the end of the quotation .
" Mrs. Olavick was in her kitchen at 2101 East Hawthorne Street , Tucson , while Mrs. Down was out in the back - year patio .
Suddenly Mrs. Down called her out excitedly , and both proceeded to observe what had caught Mrs. Down 's eye .
The time was just after the noon hour ; Tucson 's skies were completely cloudless .
Somewhat north of their zenith lay an unusual , isolated , " steamy - fleecy " cloud at an altitude which Mrs.
Olavick found difficult to estimate , though she recalled that it seemed lower than average for that time of year ( thus , perhaps at or below 10,000 feet , say . ) .
No other cloud was to be seen in the sky .
In and out of the cloud moved a number of dull - white disc - like objects that rose and fell in an erratic manner , occasionally disappearing into or above the unnatural cloud .
She said that these objects were round in planform but were not spherical , for they frequently tipped a bit , exposing a flattened - sphere form .
She estimates that they watched these objects cavorting near the cloud for perhaps five or six minutes before the entire group suddenly disappeared within the cloud or perhaps above it .
- 16 - " After a minute or so , as she now recalls it , a new object , perhaps three of four times as large as the little objects , came out of the cloud on its east side .
After it emerged , the small objects began to emerge also , taking up a V - formation pattern behind it .
The V comprised a line of four - abreast just to the rear of the large object , then a line of three - abreast behind that , and finally two - abreast in the rear .
Thus the point of the V was to the rear ( in the sense of the emergent and subsequent motion ) .
This formation permitted the first accurate count of the small objects , nine in all .
No sooner had the last pair emerged than all ten objects shot off to the northeast , climbing out of sight in a time that she thought was probably two to three seconds .
She does not recall what happened to the cloud after the ten objects departed .
" I ( McDonald ) have spoken with Mrs. Olavick several additional times , following her first call .
Her account was presented in an unembellished manner , and her descriptions were carefully framed , specifying just which parts had become less distinct in her memory .
But the basic vividness of her memory of this observation she stressed repeatedly .
I had to explain that it was by no means clear that the objects she saw were identical with those reported by Kenneth Arnold two months later .
When I queried her as to why she had not reported them , she pointed out that she and Mrs .
Down were entirely convinced that they had been fortunate enough to witness some new American military vehicles about which the general public had not yet been informed .
Later she heard of the " flying saucers , " and she and Mrs. Down , when they rejoined their husbands in mid-summer in Iowa , told them about their own observation .
The husbands , she recalled , made such a joke of it that they ceased mentioning it .
Again we have a daytime sighting of several minutes duration , with two witnesses .
As is often the case when .
the phenomenon appears mechanical , it was interpreted as some secret government development .
Ridicule of the sighting by family members and friends ( if not by authorities ) is frequently mentioned as a reason for delayed reporting of sightings .
- 17 - A third report is taken from a paper Prof. McDonald presented at the 12 March 1968 Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute Astronautics Symposium , Montreal .
" At about 5:15 am. , PDT , on the morning of July 4 , 1967 , at least five witnesses ( and reportedly others not yet locatable ) saw an object of unconventional nature moving over Highway 5 on the edge of Corning , California .
Hearing of the event from NICAP , I began searching for the witnesses and eventually telephone - interviewed four .
Press accounts from the Corning Daily Observer and Oakland Tribune afforded further corroboration .
" Jay Munger , operator of an all - night bowling alley , was drinking coffee with two police officers , James Overton of the Corning force and Frank Rakes of the Orland force , when Munger suddenly spotted the object out the front windows of his bowling alley .
In a moment all three were outside observing what they each described as a dark gray oval or disc - shaped object with a bright light shining upwards on its top and a dimmer light shining downward from the underside .
A dark gray or black band encircled the mid-section of the object .
When first sighted , it lay almost due west , at a distance that they estimated at a quarter of a mile ( later substantiated by independent witnesses viewing it at right angles to the line of sight of the trio at the bowling alley ) .
It was barely moving , and seemed to be only a few hundred feet above terrain .
The dawn light illuminated the object , but not so brightly as to obscure the two lights on top and bottom , they stated .
" Munger , thinking to get an independent observation from a different part of Corning , returned almost immediately to telephone his wife ; but she never saw it for reasons of tree - obscuration .
At my request , Munger re-enacted the telephoning process to form a rough estimate of elapsed time .
He obtained a time of 1 - 1.5 minutes .
This time is of interest because , when he completed the call and rejoined Overton and Rakes , the object had still moved only a short distance south on Highway 5 ( about a quarter of a mile : perhaps ) , but then quickly accelerated and passed off to the south , going out of their sight in only about 10 seconds , far to their south .
- 18 - Paul Heideman , of Fremont , California , was driving south on Highway 5 at the time of the above sighting , along with a friend , Robert King .
I located Heideman and obtained from him an account of his observation made from a point on the highway north of Corning .
He saw the light from the object , and had veered east ( a turn not seen from the more restricted viewing point of the bowling - alley parking lot ) .
Heideman said that , when first seen , it lay almost straight down Highway 5 , serving to check the estimate of the other observers that the object lay only a few city blocks to their west .
The weather was clear , no haze , no wind , according to the witnesses .
Munger 's concise comment was " I 've never seen anything like it before . "
He estimated its " diameter " at perhaps 50 - 100 ft , and its vertical thickness as perhaps 15 - 20 ft , with some kind of edge ( band ) perhaps 5 - 10 ft thick .
No sound was ever heard .
Overton stated to me that he had no idea what it was , but that " there was no doubt it was a craft of some sort . "
The next example is from a report I personally investigated .
It occurred in the area where I was reared ; the observers are known to my family ; I am familiar with the natural phenomenology of the area .
Date : 10 October 1966
Place : Near Newton , Illinois First witnesses : Mrs. A ( she prefers not to be publicly identified because of the reaction of friends and neighbors ) .
Time : 5:20 p.m. " Mrs. A was in her kitchen preparing supper ; five of her children were playing outdoors .
The children shouted to her to " come out and see the silent plane " .
She writes " I glanced out the south window and there it was coming into sight just south of our 72 foot silo moving very slowly from east to west .
It was about 35 feet high .
My first thought was that it was a plane making an emergency landing , but when I saw it in full view , I knew it was no plane , not like anything I have ever seen .
I hurried outside to join the children in the yard .
It - 19 - continued to move in a straight line to the west .
We could see it clearly as it drifted over a 50 by 100 foot machine shed being built at the time [ the workers were , however , in the fields this day ] .
It appeared to be larger than our car , and was more oval .
There was a bluish glow around the ends , top , and bottom of it .
It ( the glow ) was n't bright , since it was daylight yet , but more like a low cloud , haze , or fog ; or a mixture of bluish - grey tiny bubbles floating along around it .
The object was seen clearly .
It was blue in color and appeared to be made of metal .
You could see [ longitudinal ] seam lines .
There was one black window .
I thought they ( assuming someone was in it ) could see out but we could not see them .
I kept looking for someone to peep out and wave , but do n't recall seeing or feeling anything at the time .
There was a brownish - gold design on the lower back half .
A raised part was on the top near the back which was noticed by all the children .
It moved very quietly , making no sound at all except for a whirling or vibrating sound for 1 or 2 seconds as it drifted on toward the west ...
We followed it down the yard and lane , continuing to watch it as it was 300 feet , then 200 feet from the north and south gravel road and the REA electric line which is on the west side of the road .
We were talking together , all very excited about what it was , where it came from , if there were people in it , and if it would rise to clear the electric line .
It did ; it rose so quickly and was out of sight in just a few seconds .
Our eyes could not follow it fast enough .
This was certainly a fantastic thing . "
The questionnaire , a lengthy correspondence , an interview in June 1967 and other checking produced the following details : Meteorology : Clear , warm , dry weather , cloudless .
Astronomical : Moonset 3:51 p.m. EST
UFO : Prolate spheroidial shape .
- 20 -
The surface appeared to be non-spectacular , like dull aluminum or metal , and blue , the color probably deriving from the self - luminous halo .
Longitudinal seams were apparent , but no rivets or such were seen .
The black rectangle was assumed to be a window and appeared to be recessed .
It was not shiny , but " like the dark of night . "
The surrounding glow was partly opaque , yet self luminous .
It was darker than the sky and extended about 1 / 4 the object 's length in all directions .
The halo was particularly opaque at the ends : of the object , obscuring the underlying parts .
The design at the lower rear looked like a pattern of crosses and dots .
Mrs. A says the glow obscured the design and in any case her attention was fixed on the " window " .
The only sound heard occurred when the UFO was nearest the unfinished shed , being constructed of a wooden framework covered with ferrous sheets .
It is possible that some sheets were caused to vibrate .
No electromagnetic effects were noted ( TV was off ) and no electrostatic or other effects were noted by Mrs.
A or her children .
As the UFO disappeared , Mrs. A was just looking along the road for a car ; two of the children said the UFO pitched nose - up and as it went up a light or flame of orange color was seen at the rear .
Enough angular data was provided from building and landmark placement and sizes that it is possible to estimate the size of the metallic portion of the UFO at 16 to 20 feet in length , seen at a distance of 150 to 300 feet .
Its linear speed was about 4 to 8 miles per hour , based on the above distances and timings obtained by re-enactment .
It was visible for 4 minutes .
Angular size was 2 3/4 " at arms length .
In an effort to quantify the colors somewhat , a Nickerson color fan was used by the witnesses to select the colors most nearly like those on the UFO .
The color selections were made independently in direct sunlight with the color fan held in front of a white field .
The colors given were - 21 - Metallic surface
Mrs. A. 7.5 PB - 7
Child 1 2.5 PB - 8/5
Child 2 7.5 B - 3/5
Glow ( The color of " grayness " was not uniform )
Mrs. A. 5 PB - 8/5
2.5 PB - 8/5
Child 1 5 PB - 7/7
Child 2 2.5 PB - 6/8
Orange flare on ascent
Child 1 5 YR - 7/11
Child 2 5 YR - 7/11 Second event : Same day , 6:30 p.m. , sky is now dark .
Location is in town of Newton , Illinois , about seven miles north west of first event .
Mrs. B was walking down the steps of a friend 's house toward her car .
" As I started down the steps my eyes were drawn by something in the south eastern sky .
I stopped a moment and saw very clearly a luminous bluish object moving quite rapidly from east to west .
It seemed to be rather low in the sky , but at night it is difficult to judge distance either as to how high it was or how far away it was .
It did appear larger than a full moon , but instead of being round it had a definite oval shape .
I would say an elongated oval .
There was no sound that I could detect , and while it appeared to be blue and purple , there was also a whitish glow in it .
The outline of the object was very distinct .
I watched it until it disappeared behind some trees and a house a little less than a block from me .
Further correspondence and discussion brought forth the following information :
The major axis of the oval was horizontal ; its path was not perfectly horizontal ) but somewhat undulatory .
Its color was brightest and whitest at the center , becoming more blue and darker toward the edges .
Mrs. B. estimated the colors as shown below ( Since the interview was conducted in the evening ) the color fan was illuminated by an incandescent lamp ) .
- 22 - In itself , this last report , which describes a sighting of 15 to 20 seconds duration , contains insufficient information to come to any conclusion .
However , when put alongside the earlier report there is the possibility of a relationship -- could these be reports of the same thing seen under differing conditions of illumination ?
We 'll never know positively but the suggestion is quite strong .
As far as Mrs .
A's sighting is concerned , we have obtained enough data from follow - up inquiry and on - site investigation to rule out known airborne craft , meteorological , and astronomical phenomenon .
Yet the observations are sufficiently detailed to give us adequate confidence that some sort of machine was present , behaving in a very extraordinary way .
Some parts of the object are similar to other reports ( the effervescent glow , the orange color on acceleration , the very black " window " ( which sounds like a block - body absorber ) ) .
Other parts are unusual -- the UFO 's prolate spheroidal shape and the pattern ( although seeing the pattern would require the observer to be quite close ) .
The original correspondence and data sheets on Mrs. A 's sighting run to over 40 pages .
In correspondence and interviews over a period of 8 months no substantial inconsistencies could be found .
The geometric data , particularly , are so intricately related that it is most unlikely that the witness could have fabricated a story so well .
In addition , acquaintances made it clear that Mrs. A. is not prone to story telling and that " she is too busy to dream up such a tale " .
Mr. A , who returned from the fields that evening found the household still considerably agitated four hours after the event .
He said he had no idea what it was his wife and children saw , but he obviously treated the sighting seriously for he went to considerable trouble to comply with a request to measure the sizes and locations of each building and tree on the farm .
It is this kind of sighting - the kind which is clearly inexplicable in contemporary terms , which causes me ( and other interested persons ) to take the whole subject so seriously .
Hynek suggests that it is just this kind of sighting that often goes unreported , because the witness -- especially if his education or training are appropriate -- knows that what he saw was unambiguously extraordinary .
And machine - like .
A number of such reports were belatedly made after the University of - 23 - Colorado study effort got underway .
Apparently the witnesses waited for the respectability the UOC study brought to the subject .
It is hoped that the scientific and intellectual climate will change to the point where witnesses , particularly those having the best qualifications , can feel free to report sightings and know that they are being taken seriously .
Not all reports are visual reports only .
An example of a photographic observation studied in detail is given in reference 20 .
Here , a 16mn movie of two objects sighted in the daytime provided the analyst enough information to conclude that no known phenomena could have caused the images .
This report is , hopefully , the first in a series of instrumented sightings carefully and adequately studied .
- 24 - PART 4 : UFO'S - PHENOMENONOLOGICAL
ASPECTS
Since
I have made a first hand study of only a dozen sightings , the phenomenology described in this section will necessarily be based on descriptions of reports collected by others , particularly NICAP , APRO , UFOIRC , and Vallee .
There is , unfortunately , no central file of reports accessible to the interested scientist , although large numbers of reports are in the hands of the organizations mentioned above .
( The extensive Air Force files are of very limited use , from what I can tell , because of the extremely inconsistent quality of investigation . )
In an unfortunate number of cases the report consists of little more than a narrative .
My experience with the Newton sightings suggests that quantitative information is available if the investigator takes the trouble to personally make an on - site study .
True , it may not be the quality of an instrumented sighting , but enough quantitative data are available to permit meaningful study of sighting reports .
NICAP 's document " The UFO Evidence " contains a summary of patterns in appearance and behavior as determined from cases they had studied through 1963 .
Regarding appearance , the most common type is a disc shape , followed by spherical , oval / elliptical , cylindrical , and triangular .
The breakdown of NICAP 's 575 cases goes as follows Disc 26 % 149 cases
Round 17 % 96 cases
Oval / elliptical 13 % 77 cases
Cylindrical 8.3 % 48 cases
Triangular 2 % 11 cases
Other ( Radar , light source , 33.7 % 194 cases
not stated )
Obviously , there may be some mis-classification within the first three groups because of projective effects .
Discs may be coin - shaped or lens shaped ( double convex ) .
The domed disk is plano - convex , ( sometimes double convex ) with a smaller radius bulge atop the convex side .
The saturn disk is a sphere or oblate spheroid with a thin ring projecting from the equator .
Similar objects are
- 25 - seen without the equatorial ring also .
Another subset are the hemispheric variety , sometimes with a small protrusion at the apex and usually seen with the flat side down .
All the above mentioned objects are generically oblate with the axis of symmetry usually seen oriented vertically .
Another group are prolate , having the major axis horizontal , usually .
This includes the elliptical ( football ) variety , the triangular or tear drop variety , and the cylindrical or cigar shaped species .
Reported colors depend strongly on the luminous environment .
NICAP finds that of the 253 cases of daytime observations where color is stated , the results are Silver or metallic 34.8 % 88 cases
White 32.0 % 81 cases
Specular 13.4 % 34 cases
Gray 7.5 % 19 cases
Black 12.3 % 31 cases
It should be noted that a few reports exist suggesting that the brightness of the object first thought by the observer to be reflected sunlight , was in fact self luminosity , as ascertained by the geometry , presence of clouds and the like .
In the dark - sky observations , the outline or shape of the UFO is often not seen .
What is seen is a light or series of lights , sometimes extremely bright .
Luminous rays are also reported , going up sometimes ( particularly from domed discs ) downward ( from hemispheric types principally , also from discs ) and from one UFO to another ( spherical types ) .
The luminous column is usually not divergent .
Excluding these interesting rays , the reported colors of UFOs seen at night are , for 162 cases Red 38.3 % 62 cases
Orange 15.4 % 25 cases
Yellow 17.3 % 28 cases
Green 13.0 % 21 cases
Blue 16.0 % 26 cases
Purple 0 0 - 26 - Brightness and color changes are also noted , and while the sample is small ( 82 cases ) NICAP found the following :
Of the 25 cases showing a change in brightness , 23 of the changes occurred at the moment of a velocity change ( a change of either magnitude or direction ) .
Concerning the change of color , 23 cases showed a color change related to acceleration .
While the supporting data are not conclusive , it appears that the spectral shift is to the red upon acceleration .
It should also be noted that UFOs reported at night have only a star - like appearance unless very close .
Distant UFO 's sometimes turn off and on .
When closer to the observer , reports often indicate a number of lights , located at the top and around the rim usually .
Sometimes the lights flash on and off or change color rhythmically .
Several cases have been reported of the UFO flashing its lights in response to the witness flashing hand or vehicular lights .
In other cases the lights winked off with the approach of another car or an aircraft , only to turn on again when the vehicle had passed .
While practically any luminous behavior could be produced by someone with sufficient time and money , kinematic behavior at odds with experience or , preferably , at odds with Newtonian behavior are suggestive of non-terrestrial origin .
A common kind of motion is called oscillation by NICAP and is subdivided into " wobble on axis " ( frequently described also as fluttering , flipping , and tipping ) ; pendulum motion on slow ascent , hovering and decent ( also called " falling leaf motion " ) ; and occasionally a side - to - side oscillation observed as the UFO proceeds horizontally .
These motions are most often performed by discs , although examples of similar behavior by other forms also exist .
The last class , that of violent and erratic maneuvers , most clearly lacks an explanation from current physical theory .
Using terms like bobbing , erratic , jerky , zigzag , dark , and shot away , witnesses describe motions involving high angular accelerations and velocities .
A number of radar observations appear to substantiate this anomalous behavior .
Among the 40 cases showing such characteristics , NICAP finds that 28 percent were reported by scientific or other appropriately experienced personnel .
- 27 - Variation of Sightings with Time
It appears that the UFO phenomenology has been with us from the earliest times .
In the last twenty - five years , however , there seems to be a drastic increase in the number of sightings .
It is practically impossible to estimate the number of world - wide sightings because of the lack of suitable data collection means .
In the U.S. , the principal depositories are currently the Air Force , NICAP and APRO .
It is estimated that currently these sources together receive about 2000 reports per year .
Since only about one sighting in 10 is reported , the number of sightings is about 20,000 .
But of these , 80 to 95 % are not interesting , leaving us with " only " 1000 to 4000 worthwhile sightings per year for North America .
In addition to the background of reports more or less constantly flowing in , occasional periods of intense activity are also noted .
One such period was October 1954 over most of France .
NICAP lists a number of these " flaps " .
Sometimes they are very localized , covering only a small portion of a state for a period of a few weeks .
APRO concludes , on the basis of the reports available to them , that the patterns of appearance follow phases - atomic test areas and installations in the late 1940s and early 50s , rivers , reservoirs and bodies of water in the late 50s and early 60s and now electrical distribution systems .
Convincing evidence to support this hypothesis has not been published ; however , if the hypothesis were true it would certainly raise a lot of question .
McDonald and others suggest that reports of the last few years show more sightings of objects at low altitude ( or landed ) and more sightings made from urban areas ( in the 40s and 50s sightings were generally inversely correlated with population densities ) .
Interactions with the Environment Interactions of UFOs with the environment produce a kind of believability that pure visual observations will never do .
Some examples of interaction are cases showing electromagnetic disturbances in practically every kind of device -- radio , TV , auto ignition , aircraft electronics , compass , magnetometer , magnetic automobile speedometer , etc. NICAP lists 106 examples .
NICAP also lists 81 cases of radar - 28 - tracking of UFOs , most of which were simultaneous with visual sightings , and a number of which involved use of interceptors .
Among the physiological effects noted are burns , temporary paralysis , prickling sensation , and eyes irritated as by ultraviolet light .
A number of witnesses claim to have observed landings ; depressions in the ground and damaged vegetation usually result .
At a landing site in France , only weeds grow in a nine foot circular area where a disc was seen to land two years ago , despite efforts to replant .
( 21 )
At another landing site , French railway officials calculated that a weight of 30 tons would be required to make the depressions found in some railroad ties where a UFO was reported to have landed .
While most UFO's are silent , some have made sounds described as hissing , rushing , swishing , humming , whirring , whining , droning , like thunder , like shotgun , and a series of staccato explosions .
In the past the absence of sonic booms from supersonic UFO 's bothered many scientists ; it appears now that that problem might be overcome by surrounding the craft by a corona discharge ( which incidentally would be a luminous blue glow around the object ) .
( 23 ) I will purposely not comment much on occupants , except to say that there are a few ( very few ) reasonably reliable and carefully investigated reports of UFO occupants .
For the time being , I would prefer to concentrate on reports of the objects , however , as the frequency of reliable occupant reports is so low .
I have no bias one way or the other along these lines .
If UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin , they may or may not be " manned " .
If manned , one should expect an occasional appearance .
Readers more interested in this aspect of UFOs are referred to reference 24 .
In summary , we see a wide , almost exasperating range of reported phenomenology .
By careful interviews with witnesses and analysis of a large number of reports the significant patterns in phenomenonology should appear .
If the UFOs are a new manifestation of nature , they should exhibit some patterns of appearance or behavior which would aid in identifying and predicting them .
If of extraterrestrial origin and intelligently guided it may be possible to anticipate appearances .
This will be discussed in the next and final essay .
- 29 - PART 5 : UFOs -- HOW TO PROCEED AND WHY
We are so far from knowing all the forces of Nature and the various modes of their action that it is not worthy of a philosopher to deny phenomena only because they are inexplicable in the present state of our knowledge .
The harder it is to acknowledge the existence of phenomena , the more we are bound to investigate them with increasing care .
Laplace Laplace 's remarks are certainly as true and significant for us today as for his contemporaries .
In the preceeding essays I have suggested that there exists a class of phenomena rather widely occuring today ( and perhaps since earliest times ) that is elusive , puzzling and often at variance with known scientific and technical experience .
What are we going to do about it ?
What should we , what can we do about it ?
J. E. MacDonald suggests that the UFO phenomena lie somewhere in the following categories of explanation : 1 . Hoaxes , fabrications , and frauds .
Report files contain examples of these ; investigators believe about 5 percent of all reports made are in this category .
Detailed study , however , usually uncovers such reports .
2. Hallucinations , mass hysteria , and rumor phenomena .
Present understanding of psychology does not admit many of the significant reports to be explained in this way .
3. Misinterpretations of well known physical phenomena ( meteorolo - gical , astronomical , optical , etc. ) .
By far the largest percentage of reports fall in this category .
Study by an experienced investigator can usually identify these .
4. Poorly understood physical phenomena ( rare electrical or moteorological effects , plasmas ) .
Certainly a distinct possibility in a number of cases , it is a category worthy of careful study .
Some of the most interesting cases , however have sufficient observational datail to eliminate this possibility ( I am referring to reports of unambiguously machine - like objects ) .
- 30 - 5 . Advanced technologies ( test vehicles , satellites , reentry effects ) .
Again , some reports can be attributed to this cause , but most cannot .
6. Poorly understood psychic phenomena ( psychic projections , archetypal images , parapsychological phenomena , etc ) .
It is difficult to comment on this possibility because the current lack of knowledge of parapsychology .
While a ( small ) number of UFO reports do exhibit aspects of parapsychological phenomenology ( 25 ) general relationships have yet to be convincingly demonstrated .
Reference 6 deals with this explanation .
7. Extraterrestrial probes .
A possibility commonly held by the public and commonly rejected by scientists .
Prof. McDonald believes a number of sightings are best explained by this hypothesis .
8. Messengers of salvation and occult truth .
This explanation is listed because of the nature of certain reports ( particularly " contact " reports -- reports involving communication of UFO occupants and the witnesses ) and because of the historical aspects of the phenomenology .
See reference 5 for elaboration .
Perhaps , to play it safe , an additional category should be listed :
9 . Other Clearly , the explanation of UFOs will interest someone .
Psychologists have an interest in 1 , 2 , 3 and 6 ; theologians in category 8 , scientists in 4 and 7 .
Therefore , whatever the explanation , it is a problem of at least average interest .
If , by chance , the explanation is 7 , or even 8 ( and possibly 6 ) the value to society would be profound and significant .
In this sense , an identification of the phenomenon would be a task of highest potential urgency .
How might it be done ?
Because of the transient nature of UFO's we cannot expect to have the interested scientist rush to the spot to make his own observations .
Reports so far accumulated , however , show that UFO 's sometimes appear frequently in certain areas for a short period of time ( a so - called " flap " ) .
One characteristic of the flap is a larger percentage of sightings of objects at low levels than one normally obtains .
If the reporting and analysis system were responsive enough , men and instruments - 31 - could be dispatched when a flap was recognized with a reasonable hope of making first hand observations .
I would therefore suggest the following : 1 . Organization of a central report receiving agency , staffed by a permanent group of experienced UFO investigators and having on call specialists in astronomy , physics , optics , atmospheric physics , psychology and the like for application when needed .
2 . This agency should be readily and instantly accessible to the public for the purpose of reporting .
( Witnesses should be able to turn to someone other than the press to make reports . )
Report forms could be made available in Post Offices , for example .
More urgent reports could be made by toll - free telephone lines .
( Radio amateurs have recently begun cooperating with NICAP to provide an alerting system . )
Because many sightings are made at night when most services are closed , the local police office should be prepared to receive reports of sightings .
Experience indicates that witnesses usually turn first to the police , particularly if the UFO was close or if the witness was frightened .
Such a local " data center " would be very useful for identifying flaps and could possibly serve to dispatch personnel to an area of interest .
Care must be taken to properly inform the officers involved about the aims of the project and requests for assistance should be made in such a way as to minimize additional police work .
An awareness of the problem by a dispatcher or desk sergeant might be sufficient to draw attention to a developing situation .
An interested local scientist could then be notified , perhaps in time to make an observation .
Hynek also suggests that the police carry cameras in their cars should they become involved as observers .
This advice obviously applies to all interested persons .
3 . A loose organization of interested scientists should be available to investigate reports in their local areas .
A good start toward this has been made by NICAP .
It is important that investigations be made rapidly and by properly qualified people .
4 . The press should be encouraged to report sightings accurately and in a non-sensational manner .
Suitable reporting would encourage other witnesses to come forth .
- 32 - 5 . Existing sensor records could be examined for anomalies , particularly if visual reports are made nearby .
Since we do n't know what to expect , it is difficult to say what is needed ; however records of electric , magnetic and gravitational fields , radioactivity , optical and radio frequency anomalies would be a logical place to start .
Radars could also contribute , if they are designed for general purpose use .
As it is , most current radar detection and tracking devices are designed to ignore anomalous objects .
After a few years ' operation in this mode , it should be possible to study the resulting report statistics to draw generalities about appearance and behavior ( such as was done in Part IV ) and most importantly to anticipate times and locations of appearances .
Only when this is done will it be possible to instrument sightings and therefore obtain the objective data so badly needed
If the explanation is # 4 , some environmental correlations are bound to occur .
For # 7 it is possible that appearances could be anticipated , if we are clever enough ; for # 6 and # 8 we will likely not be able to anticipate appearances .
Certainly the conclusions drawn by NICAP from reports in their file are startling and , if valid worthy of considerable scientific effort .
It would be much more convincing if data could be collected worldwide and if the most interesting reports could be intensively and completely investigated .
I believe current reports justify the expanded data collection and analysis effort .
Pages 33 to 40 consist of the basic report form used by the University of Colorado UFO project which have not been included here .
A copy of this reporting form is reproduced in " The Final Report of the Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects , " Bantam Books , 1968 , published in association with Colorado Associated University Press .

Short Commentaries
30 Dec 1966
Jan Aldrich :
George Kocher worked at RAND .
He was interested in the UFOs .
He wrote up a short paper for circulation within RAND .
It was personal .
It was not an official RAND document .
Kocher got little or no response to his privately circulated document .
One copy of it did make its way to Wright - Patterson .
LTC Quintanilla wrote RAND a blazing letter .
Once again , Quinanilla 's letter was not an official ATIC response , but from Quintanilla 's address and his personal opinion .
Kocher 's supervisor turned Quintanilla 's letter over to Kocher .
RAND never responded to Quintanilla .
Kocher did not follow up on his paper .
The matter went no further .
Kocher confirmed all this in a letter to Dr. Hynek which is now at CUFOS with a copy of Quintanilla 's letter .
CUFOS made copies of Kocher 's document available years ago .
You can , I believe , still purchase copies from them .
Ruppelt , I believe in his papers , mentioned that the chief of RAND in the early 1950s was hostile towards UFOs .
Prior to that RAND had done a " Spaceship " study that COL McCoy requested in 1948 .
Parts of the study were used in the Project Grudge report .
There were several RAND scientists who , like Kocher , had at one time or another a personal interest in UFOs .
NICAP was in contact with one or two .
However , over the years contact was lost with these people .
There was one request from a scientist at RAND in 1965 to the Air Force for UFO material .
The Air Force forwarded the request to Hynek .
Nothing seems to have come of it .
Again , it may have just been a personal interest item .
16 Nov 2006
Dick Hall :
It would be perfectly legitimate and accurate to list this document as an " internal RAND document . "
It is exactly the same sort of thing as the NSA think piece generated by an employee , which was not an " official " NSA document .
These documents are part of the history and are revealing and important in their own right .
What people in positions like theirs were thinking and trying to do is significant for historians ( of which I are one ) .
Brad Sparks :
The hostile RAND official mentioned by Ruppelt in his papers was NOT the President and founder of RAND , Franklin Collbohm , it was James Lipp , chief of the Missile Division of RAND .
Ruppelt also mentioned that RAND astronomer James Thompson was pro-UFO and used to visit him at BB .
The RAND " spaceship " UFO study was done by Lipp in Dec 1948 and included as an appendix to the Sign Report , not the Grudge Report . ,
What is Jan 's source for what Kocher said or did ?
Is it solely Kocher 's letter to Hynek ?
Why is there no date or copy of it ?
Kocher 's RAND report seems to have more status as a RAND document than the NSA paper , given that it has RAND letterhead and the NSA paper has no NSA letterhead or routing .
17 Nov 2006
Jan Aldrich :
There were some UFO fans at RAND .
Mary Rorig comes to mind .
However , this paper is about as significant as some NICAP member writing a paper supporting contactees .
It should be made clear that this was an individual effort within an organization which took no action , and had no discussion on the matter as the result of his effort other than to file it .
Dick Hall :
The agencies represented are not private , pro-UFO citizen groups .
They are major Government agencies .
So what they did and tried to do even on an in - house basis and the results ( or non-results ) is very significant for the purposes of historical analysis .
The people mentioned all were highly qualified , reasonably high - level or respected employees .
To simply label them as " fans " ( sounds like " UFO buffs " ) and compare what they did to an internal NICAP paper is not a reasonable comparison .
History has more to do with only what " officially " is said and done .
A more apt comparison would be what Ruppelt or Fournet did and tried to do on the subject , and what had success and what did n't .
As mentioned in climate science watch 's diary yesterday , Hansen had agreed to debate with judge - bribing , safety - rules - ignoring , recent - Supreme - Court case loser , and CEO of Massey Energy , Don Blankenship .
Last week the President and CEO of Massey Energy , Don Blankenship , when he learned Dr. James Hansen would be joining protesters tomorrow in a demonstration against mountaintop removal for coal mining , publicly challenged Hansen to a debate on coal burning and climate change .
Along with hundreds of others , Hansen is headed to West Virginia to participate in tomorrow ’s demonstration , and is expected to risk arrest by marching with protesters to the private property of Massey Energy to make a set of demands .
Hansen took Blankenship up on the offer .
So far , the debate has n't happened -- but the arrests sure have .
Why are we still in this position ?
Why are guys like Blankenship still blowing 800 ' off the top of a mountain ?
Why is the Appalachian Apocalypse unchecked ?
Because the Obama administration will not stop this horror .
This is part of a string of increasingly dramatic protests on mountaintop removal and comes after the Obama Administration ’s announcement that the EPA will reform , but not abolish , the aggressive strip mining practice .
Tuesday ’s protest is happening just days before a Congressional hearing titled , " The Impacts of Mountaintop Removal Mining on Water Quality in Appalachia . "
Update [ 2009-6-23 15:28:28 by Devilstower ] : Jeff Biggers has additional info and updates over at HP .
UPDATE : from Stephanie Pistello : 1:30 pm EST :
The state police allowed the coal supporters to line up along the road and then to proceed into playing field to intermingle with activists .
The coal supporters are generally being aggressive towards other rally participants and chanting slogans such as " this is our state " .
The state police have general allowed aggressively ( shouting , physical intimidation , standing very near / sitting on vehicles / equipment ) activity and only intervene when asked to ( including allowing power cords to be ripped out of the wall to silence the PA system ) .
Update [ 2009-6-23 16:44:41 by Devilstower ] :
Not surprisingly , Blankenship is unavailable for debate while Hansen is in town .
But he 'll be happy to return the day after Hansen leaves .
I 'm sure hoping they get this Poundin ' in the Mountains together .

In 1969 , the Neiman Marcus catalog offered the first home PC , a stylish stand - up model called the Honeywell Kitchen Computer , priced at $ 10,600 .
The picture shows an aproned housewife caressing the machine , with this tag line : " If she can only cook as well as Honeywell can compute . "
That image should be on every cubicle in Silicon Valley ; it 's a testament both to what technologists get right and what they get badly wrong .

To their credit , they understood that Moore 's law would bring computing within the reach of regular people .
But they had no idea why anyone would want it .
Despite countless brainstorming sessions and meetings on the subject , the only application the Honeywell team could think of for a home computer ( aside from the perennial checkbook balancing ) was recipe card management .
So the Kitchen Computer was aimed at housewives and featured integrated counter space .
Those housewives would , however , require a programming course ( included in the price ) , since the only way to enter data was with binary toggle switches , and the machine 's only display was binary lights .
Needless to say , not a single Kitchen Computer is recorded as having sold .
Today , of course , we have computers in every home — and in every pocket and car and practically everywhere else .
But one of the few things the average person does n't use them for is managing recipe cards .
Do n't blame Honeywell — blame the computing world of the 1960s .
In those days , computers were expensive mainframes .
Because processing power was so scarce and valuable , it was reserved for use by IT professionals , mostly working for big companies and the government .
Engineers both built the computers and decided how to use them — no wonder they could n't think of nonengineering applications .
But as the Kitchen Computer hinted , computers would soon get smaller and cheaper .
This would take them out of the glass boxes of the mainframe world — and away from the IT establishment — and put them in the hands of consumers .
And the real transformation would come when those regular folks found new ways to use computers , revealing their true potential .

All this was possible because Alan Kay , an engineer at Xerox 's Palo Alto Research Center in the 1970s , understood what Moore 's law was doing to the cost of computing .
He decided to do what writer George Gilder calls " wasting transistors .
"
Rather than reserve computing power for core information processing , Kay used outrageous amounts of it for frivolous stuff like drawing cartoons on the screen .
Those cartoons — icons , windows , pointers , and animations — became the graphical user interface and eventually the Mac .
By 1970s IT standards , Kay had " wasted " computing power .
But in doing so he made computers simple enough for all of us to use .
And then we changed the world by finding applications for them that the technologists had never dreamed of .
This is the power of waste .
When scarce resources become abundant , smart people treat them differently , exploiting them rather than conserving them .
It feels wrong , but done right it can change the world .
The problem is that abundant resources , like computing power , are too often treated as scarce .
Consider another example : Wired 's IT department used to send out occasional emails telling employees it was time to " delete unneeded files from the shared folders " — their way of saying they had run out of storage room on the servers .
Because we 're good corporate citizens , we all dutifully scanned through our files , deleting those we could live without .
Perhaps you 've done the same .
One day , after years of this ritual , I began to wonder just how much storage capacity we actually had .
Turns out , not so much : 500 gigabytes .
At the time , a terabyte of memory ( 1,000 gigabytes ) cost about $ 130 .
I had recently purchased a standard Dell desktop PC for my family , which the kids used for playing videogames ; it came with a terabyte internal hard drive .
My children had twice as much storage as my entire staff .
Scarcity vs. Abundance Management Scarcity Abundance Rules Everything is forbidden unless it is permitted .
Everything is permitted unless it is forbidden .
Social model Paternalism ( " We know what 's best " ) Egalitarianism
( " You know what 's best " ) Profit plan Business model
We 'll figure it out Decision process Top - down Bottom - up Organizational structure Command and control Out of control How did this happen ?
The answer is simple :
We had gotten stuck thinking that storage was expensive , when in fact it had become dirt cheap .
We treated the abundant thing — hard drive capacity — as if it were scarce , and the scarce thing — people 's time — as if it were abundant .
The corporate bureaucracy had gotten the equation backward .
( Let me hasten to add that my office quickly added a heap of storage , and those emails do n't go out anymore ! )
This happens all over the place .
When your phone company tells you that your voicemail inbox is full , that 's artificial scarcity — it costs less than a nickel to store 100 voice messages , and the average iPod could store more than 100,000 of them ( voice messages are recorded at lower quality than music , so they take up less space ) .
By forcing subscribers to spend time deleting voicemails , the phone companies were saving a little on storage costs by spending a lot of consumer time .
They managed the scarcity they could measure ( storage ) but neglected to manage a much more critical scarcity ( customer goodwill ) .
No wonder phone companies are second only to cable TV companies in " most hated " rankings .

But the funny thing about waste is that it 's all relative to your sense of scarcity .
Our grandparents grew up in an age when a long - distance telephone call was an expensive luxury , to be scheduled and kept short .
Even today , many find it hard to keep people of that generation on a long - distance call for very long — they still hear a meter ticking in their head and rush to finish .
But our kids are growing up in an age when long distance is free on their cell phones .
They 'll happily chat for hours .
From the perspective of 1950s telecom costs , that 's incredibly wasteful .
But today , when those costs have fallen to near zero , we do n't give it a second thought .
It does n't feel like waste at all .
Nature Wastes Life
Our brains seem wired to resist waste , but we are relatively unique in nature for this .
Mammals have the fewest offspring in the animal kingdom , and as a result we invest enormous time and care in protecting each one so that it can reach adulthood .
The death of a single human is a tragedy , one that survivors sometimes never recover from , and we prize the individual life above all .
Percentage of your CPU 's transistors used for …
Waiting for you to do something Genie effect and other UI frippery Running programs you forgot you opened Spyware keylogging your passwords Work
As a result , we have a very developed sense of the morality of waste .
We feel bad about the unloved toy or the uneaten food .
Sometimes this is for good reason , because we understand the greater social cost of profligacy , but often it 's just because our mammalian brains are programmed that way .
However , the rest of nature does n't work like that .
A bluefin tuna can release 10 million fertilized eggs in a spawning season .
Perhaps 10 of them will hatch and make it to adulthood .
A million die for every one that survives .
But there 's good reason for it .
Nature wastes life in search of better life .
It mutates DNA , creating failure after failure , in the hope that some new sequence will eventually outcompete those that came before and the species will evolve .
In other words , nature tests its creations by killing most of them quickly — the battle " red in tooth and claw " that determines reproductive advantage .
Nature is so wasteful because scattershot strategies are the best way to do what mathematicians refer to as fully exploring " the potential space . "
Imagine a desert with two pools of water separated by some distance .
If you 're a plant growing next to one of those pools , you can follow one of two different reproductive strategies .
You can drop seeds near your roots , where there 's a pretty good chance they 'll find water .
This is safe but soon leads to crowding .
Or you can toss the seeds to the wind and let them float far away .
This means that almost all will die , but it 's the only way to find that second pool of water , where life can expand into a new niche , perhaps a richer one .
The way to get from what the mathematicians call a local maximum to the global maximum is to explore a lot of fruitless minima along the way .
It 's wasteful , in a sense , but it can pay off in the end .
The science fiction writer Cory Doctorow calls this " thinking like a dandelion . "
He writes : " The disposition of each — or even most — of the seeds is n't the important thing , from a dandelion 's point of view .
The important thing is that every spring , every crack in every pavement is filled with dandelions .
The dandelion does n't want to nurse a single precious copy of itself in the hopes that it will leave the nest and carefully navigate its way to the optimum growing environment , there to perpetuate the line .
The dandelion just wants to be sure that every single opportunity for reproduction is exploited ! "
This is how to embrace waste .
Seeds are too cheap to meter .
It feels wrong , even alien , to throw so much away , but it 's the right way to take advantage of abundance .
Some days you have to ask yourself , my God , what if these people were Republicans ?
Democrats took back Congress in 2006 and the presidency in 2008 in no small part because of their ability to bang their spoons on their high chairs about what they called the Republican “ culture of corruption . ”
Their choreographed outrage was coordinated with the precision of a North Korean missile launch pageant .
And , to be fair , they had a point .
The GOP did have its legitimate embarrassments .
California Rep. Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham and lobbyist Jack Abramoff were fair game , and so was Rep. Mark Foley , the twisted Florida congressman who allegedly wanted male congressional pages cleaned and perfumed and brought to his tent , as it were .
Of course , it was n’t as if Democrats were without sin .
Louisiana Rep. William Jefferson was indicted on fraud , bribery and corruption charges in 2007 , after an investigation unearthed , among other things , $ 90,000 in his freezer .
Then - New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer was busted in a prostitution scandal .
But that ’s all yesterday ’s news .
Let ’s look at the here and now .
Barack Obama , who vowed he ’d provide a transparent administration staffed with disinterested public servants with the self - restraint of Roman castrati , appointed an admitted tax cheat to run the Treasury Department -- and he ’s hardly the only one in the administration .

New York Rep. Charles Rangel , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , is under investigation for , among other things , failing to report income from his Caribbean villa .
Meanwhile , Sen. Christopher Dodd , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , got sweetheart deals from subprime lender Countrywide and has yet to adequately explain his too - good - to - be - true deal on his million - dollar “ cottage ” in Ireland , which he may have gotten in exchange for finagling a pardon ( from President Clinton ) for a felon .
Oh , Dodd also secretly protected those AIG bonuses that raised such a ruckus last month .
Rep. Jack Murtha of Pennsylvania , Nancy Pelosi ’s moral authority on military matters during the Iraq war , has been revealed as a kleptomaniac of sorts , delivering as much of the federal budget as possible to various cronies and lobbyists .
John Edwards , who had an affair even as he was scoring Oprah - points as the supportive husband during his wife ’s battle with breast cancer , is being investigated by the feds for the improper use of campaign funds .
It looks like the silky haired champion of the little guys may have used their donations to bribe the alleged “ baby mama ” into silence .
And it would be a shame to let it pass that Obama ’s Senate seat was put up for sale by the then - Democratic governor of Illinois , Rod Blagojevich , and Illinois Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. is under investigation for trying to buy it .

But you know what ?
We ai n’t seen nothing yet .
For starters , the real corruption is n’t what the media are ignoring or downplaying as isolated incidents .
It ’s what the media are hailing as bold , inspirational leadership .
The White House , as a matter of policy , is rewriting legal contracts , picking winners ( mostly labor unions and mortgage defaulters ) and singling out losers ( evil “ speculators ” ) while much of the media continue to ponder whether Obama is better than FDR .
If a Republican administration , staffed with cronies from Goldman Sachs and Citibank , was cutting special deals for its political allies , I suspect we’d be hearing fewer FDR analogies and more nouns ending with the suffix “ gate . ”
Take Obama ’s “ car czar , ” Steven Rattner .
According to ABC ’s Jake Tapper , Rattner is accused of threatening to use the White House to smear a Chrysler creditor if it refused to back the administration ’s bankruptcy plan .
He ’s also connected to a massive pension fund scandal involving the investment firm he used to run .
One allegation is that conspirators used investments in the low - budget movie “ Chooch ” to expedite their alleged chicanery .
Chooch , by the way , is Italian slang for “ jackass , ” which just happens to be the Democrats ’ mascot .
More to the point , political corruption is inevitable whenever you give hacks -- of either party -- too much discretion over public funds .
Businesses look to Washington for profits instead of to the market .
The thing is , this has become the governing philosophy of the Democratic Party , from banking and cars to healthcare and now student loans .
The federal government is taking over , and the culture of corruption inevitably trickles down .
That in itself should be a scandal .
Call it “ Choochgate . ”
This visualization , based on new computer modeling , shows that sea level rise may be an additional 10 centimeters ( 4 inches ) higher by populated areas in northeastern North America than previously thought .
Extreme northeastern North America and Greenland may experience even higher sea level rise .
( Graphic courtesy Geophysical Research Letters , modified by UCAR . )
Melting of the Greenland ice sheet this century may drive more water than previously thought toward the already threatened coastlines of New York , Boston , Halifax , and other cities in the northeastern United States and in Canada , according to new research led by the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) .
The study , which will be published Friday in Geophysical Research Letters , finds that if Greenland 's ice melts at moderate to high rates , ocean circulation by 2100 may shift and cause sea levels off the northeast coast of North America to rise by about 12 to 20 inches ( about 30 to 50 centimeters ) more than in other coastal areas .
The research builds on recent reports that have found that sea level rise associated with global warming could adversely affect North America , and its findings suggest that the situation is more threatening than previously believed .
" If the Greenland melt continues to accelerate , we could see significant impacts this century on the northeast U.S. coast from the resulting sea level rise , " says NCAR scientist Aixue Hu , the lead author .
" Major northeastern cities are directly in the path of the greatest rise . "
A study in Nature Geoscience in March warned that warmer water temperatures could shift ocean currents in a way that would raise sea levels off the Northeast by about 8 inches ( 20 cm ) more than the average global sea level rise .
But it did not include the additional impact of Greenland 's ice , which at moderate to high melt rates would further accelerate changes in ocean circulation and drive an additional 4 to 12 inches ( about 10 to 30 cm ) of water toward heavily populated areas in northeastern North America on top of average global sea level rise .
More remote areas in extreme northeastern Canada and Greenland could see even higher sea level rise .
Scientists have been cautious about estimating average sea level rise this century in part because of complex processes within ice sheets .
The 2007 assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected that sea levels worldwide could rise by an average of 7 to 23 inches ( 18 to 59 cm ) this century , but many researchers believe the rise will be greater because of dynamic factors in ice sheets that appear to have accelerated the melting rate in recent years .
The new research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and by NCAR 's sponsor , the National Science Foundation .
It was conducted by scientists at NCAR , the University of Colorado at Boulder , and Florida State University .
How much meltwater ?
To assess the impact of Greenland ice melt on ocean circulation , Hu and his coauthors used the Community Climate System Model , an NCAR - based computer model that simulates global climate .
They considered three scenarios : the melt rate continuing to increase by 7 percent per year , as has been the case in recent years , or the melt rate slowing down to an increase of either 1 or 3 percent per year .
If Greenland 's melt rate slows down to a 3 percent annual increase , the study team 's computer simulations indicate that the runoff from its ice sheet could alter ocean circulation in a way that would direct about a foot of water toward the northeast coast of North America by 2100 .
This would be on top of the average global sea level rise expected as a result of global warming .
Although the study team did not try to estimate that mean global sea level rise , their simulations indicated that melt from Greenland alone under the 3 percent scenario could raise worldwide sea levels by an average of 21 inches ( 54 cm ) .
If the annual increase in the melt rate dropped to 1 percent , the runoff would not raise northeastern sea levels by more than the 8 inches ( 20 cm ) found in the earlier study in Nature Geoscience .
But if the melt rate continued at its present 7 percent increase per year through 2050 and then leveled off , the study suggests that the northeast coast could see as much as 20 inches ( 50 cm ) of sea level rise above a global average that could be several feet .
However ,
Hu cautioned that other modeling studies have indicated that the 7 percent scenario is unlikely .
In addition to sea level rise , Hu and his co-authors found that if the Greenland melt rate were to defy expectations and continue its 7 percent increase , this would drain enough fresh water into the North Atlantic to weaken the oceanic circulation that pumps warm water to the Arctic .
Ironically , this weakening of the meridional overturning circulation would help the Arctic avoid some of the impacts of global warming and lead to at least the temporary recovery of Arctic sea ice by the end of the century .
Why the Northeast ?
The northeast coast of North America is especially vulnerable to the effects of Greenland ice melt because of the way the meridional overturning circulation acts like a conveyer belt transporting water through the Atlantic Ocean .
The circulation carries warm Atlantic water from the tropics to the north , where it cools and descends to create a dense layer of cold water .
As a result , sea level is currently about 28 inches ( 71 cm ) lower in the North Atlantic than the North Pacific , which lacks such a dense layer .
If the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet were to increase by 3 percent or 7 percent yearly , the additional fresh water could partially disrupt the northward conveyor belt .
This would reduce the accumulation of deep , dense water .
Instead , the deep water would be slightly warmer , expanding and elevating the surface across portions of the North Atlantic .
Unlike water in a bathtub , water in the oceans does not spread out evenly .
Sea level can vary by several feet from one region to another , depending on such factors as ocean circulation and the extent to which water at lower depths is compressed .
" The oceans will not rise uniformly as the world warms , " says NCAR scientist Gerald Meehl , a co-author of the paper .
" Ocean dynamics will push water in certain directions , so some locations will experience sea level rise that is larger than the global average . "

WASHINGTON --
The Obama administration 's new drug czar says he wants to banish the idea that the U.S. is fighting " a war on drugs , " a move that would underscore a shift favoring treatment over incarceration in trying to reduce illicit drug use .
In his first interview since being confirmed to head the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy , Gil Kerlikowske said Wednesday the bellicose analogy was a barrier to dealing with the nation 's drug issues .
" Regardless of how you try to explain to people it's a ' war on drugs ' or a ' war on a product , ' people see a war as a war on them , " he said .
" We 're not at war with people in this country . "
Mr. Kerlikowske 's comments are a signal that the Obama administration is set to follow a more moderate -- and likely more controversial -- stance on the nation 's drug problems .
Prior administrations talked about pushing treatment and reducing demand while continuing to focus primarily on a tough criminal - justice approach .
The Obama administration is likely to deal with drugs as a matter of public health rather than criminal justice alone , with treatment 's role growing relative to incarceration , Mr. Kerlikowske said .
Todd asked “ Why [ did Church choose ] lambda and not some other Greek letter ? ” .
Here are three answers :
1
Matthias :
The story is that in the 10s and 20s , mathematicians and logicians used ^ as a notation for set abstraction , as in ^i : i is prime .
Church used ^` ( i.e. , a primed version of this symbol ) for function abstraction , because functions are just sets with extra properties .
The first type setter / secretary read it as λ and Church was fine with .
True or not ?
I do n’t know but it ’s fun .
2
This paper ( link provided by Dave Herman here ) :
( By the way , why did Church choose the notation “ λ ” ?
In [ Church , 1964 , § 2 ] he stated clearly that it came from the notation “ xˆ ” used for class - abstraction by Whitehead and Russell , by first modifying “ xˆ ” to “ ˆx ” to distinguish function abstraction from class - abstraction , and then changing “ ˆ ” to “ λ ” for ease of printing .
This origin was also reported in [ Rosser , 1984 , p.338 ] .
On the other hand , in his later years Church told two enquirers that the choice was more accidental : a symbol was needed and “ λ ” just happened to be chosen . )
3
This paper ( link provided by Dave Herman here ) :
We end this introduction by telling what seems to be the story how the letter ‘ λ ’ was chosen to denote function abstraction .
In [ 100 ] Principia Mathematica the notation for the function f with f( x ) = 2 x + 1 is 2x ˆ +1 . Church originally intended to use the notation xˆ .2x+1 .
The typesetter could not position the hat on top of the x and placed it in front of it , resulting in ˆx.2 x +
1 . Then another typesetter changed it into λx.2 x + 1 .

Gallup is out with an interesting new survey showing where the Republican Party has lost the most ground over the past eight years , and conservatives are n't going to like what it reveals .
The narrative spun by the Rush Limbaughs and Sean Hannitys and Dick Cheneys of the world is that the GOP 's problem is that it has n't been conservative enough , and that rather than moderate its policies , the GOP should focus its rebuilding efforts on the party 's conservative base .
But the Gallup survey tells a completely different story .
According to Gallup , only 1 percent of self - described conservatives have left the Republican Party over the past eight years .
In fact , the only group more loyal to Republicans were those who attend church weekly .
Meanwhile , even as Republicans held their conservative base together , 9 % of moderates and 8 % of liberals left the party .
What this means is that virtually all of the GOP 's losses have come from liberals and moderates fleeing the party , leaving behind a party that is even more conservative than it was before .
It may please them to hear Cheney or Limbaugh say that turning right is the way out of the political wilderness , but sooner or later , they will realize that the only way back into the political mainstream is to jettison the extreme conservatism espoused by growing numbers of Republicans .
For now , however , they are stuck on conservatism , with party leaders like Michael Steele buying into the idea that all Republicans need to do is be more conservative .
They need look no further this Gallup survey to realize the foolishness of their approach .

Hall Wines , a Napa producer of a portfolio of wines ranging from $ 20 to $ 150 a bottle , has recently received some very big numbers from Wine Spectator and Wine Enthusiast for their 2006 Cabernet Sauvignons .
Some interesting quick facts about Hall :
Hall sources most of its fruit from about 500 acres spread across 6 vineyards in Napa Valley .
They have tasting rooms in St. Helena and Rutherford .
All of their vineyards have been organically farmed since 2007 .
They offer two levels of wines : The Napa Valley Collection and the Artisan Collection .
One of each is featured in this review .
David Ramey [ Chalk Hill , Dominus , Rudd , and Ramey Wine Cellars ] is a consulting winemaker at Hall .
Kathryn Hall , proprietor of Hall Wines , served as US Ambassador to Austria from 1997 to 2001 .
" Exzellenz " is the Austrian word of " Ambassador " .

Question of the Day : Have you tried Hall wines in the past ?
If so , what did you think ?
I was fortunate enough to receive pre-release sample bottles of the Kathryn Hall and Exzellenz Cabernets which presenting me with the enviable decision :
How should I enjoy these wines ?
Do I geek out and drink them on a week night analyzing them to the last drop ?
Or should I crack them open with friends over dinner ?
I chose the latter , and we had some of our favorite neighbors over who happen to be wine lovers as well .
We paired the wines with an assortment of Italian small plates made from ingredients procured from Tutto Italiano .
We had a great time enjoying these wines with wonderful conversation , delicious food , and four energetic kids running around the house .
Since the wines were so young ( 2006 Napa Cab and not yet released ) I was a little concerned that these wines might be austere and closed .
Those fears were quickly allayed with the first taste of the first wine .
$ 75/3,040 cases producedRelease Date : September 12 , 200996 Points Wine Spectator95 Points Wine EnthusiastAged 24 months in 65 % new French oak barrels 14.5 % alcohol
This wine screamed Napa Cab on the nose .
It was very expressive aromatically , filling the glass with blackberry and black currant along with savory components which are a hallmark of some of my favorite big red California wines .
This wine floods the palate with gorgeous dark berry fruit .
Imagine a spoonful of warm mixed berry pie filling on your tongue .
Perhaps most notable was the chewy , fleshy tannins .
Not harsh tannins - soft ones .
And definitely enjoyable .
The finish went on for a mile , and in a good way [ as opposed to an aftertaste kind of way ] .
For me , not a hint of excessive heat .
Probably one of the most enjoyable wines I 've ever had .
$ 150/200 cases producedRelease Date : February 1 , 201095 Points Wine Spectator97 Points Wine EnthusiastAged 22 months in 60 % new French oak barrels 14.5 % alcohol
This was the second bottle we tried .
Compared to the Kathryn Hall , this wine was similar , but it seemed just a bit more bashful aromatically at this point in time .
Still a wonderful nose , but just not quite as obvious as the Kathryn Hall .
On the palate - oh my .
This wine was even denser and with even " chewier " , sweeter tannins .
Wonderfully mouth filling , it too was a truly delicious wine .
Perhaps with some time , as the tannins soften a bit , this wine will rise to a level even higher than the Kathryn Hall , but if you 're wanting to find a wine to enjoy immediately I think the Kathryn Hall would be the better play ( especially given that it costs half as much as the Exzellenz ) .
I was thrilled and honored to get a chance to try such a limited production , high quality wine as this one .
Ironically , though the Exzellenz is labeled as a " Red Wine " it is 100 % Cabernet whereas the Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon is 99 % Cabernet Sauvignon and 1 % Cabernet Franc .
According to Alder Yarrow of Vinography , this was to allow for future flexibility in blending in other varieties into this wine .
Read Alder 's piece on the Exzellenz here Try a bottle a bottle of the entry level Hall Napa Cab for around $ 40 , or try it by the glass at The Capital Grille .
If you like what you see there , consider stepping up to the $ 75 Kathryn Hall - or- the $ 70 " Jack's Masterpiece " ( also 96 WS / 470 cases made ) .
Plugging a 96WS / $ 70 Napa Cab into the wwpQPR Calculator ( What 's that ? ) with a $ 45 baseline for outstanding Napa Cab , we get .
Gotta love a $ 70 value play .

The only general advice possible is to embed yourself as deep as you can in the belly of the beast , then use every means at your disposal to get your work read by the people with their hands on the purse strings .
Of course , this policy presumes that you have spent years honing your craft , know your market , and have produced a manuscript that showcases your skills firing on all cylinders .
Yes , the occasional purblind idiot may blunder across the minefield unscathed , but most will get blown to smithereens .
Think of talent as your insurance policy .
For all the supposed allure of the distant finish line , in my experience , writing a novel is a long , lonely path , lined with signposts pointing in contradictory directions .
I spent years working on an elaborate fantasy novel that did n't quite hang together , then lost my job , split up with my girlfriend , moved back in with my parents , and had a nervous breakdown .
For the next 18 months , I watched as my best mates started achieving things that , just a couple of years before , were nothing but whimsical fantasies .
I played video games , ate breakfast at two in the afternoon , and listened to my recently retired dad shuffling round the house like Marley 's Ghost .
Eventually , partly at the behest of my therapist , I began to write about what I was going through – the tight knot of jealousy in my stomach , my heart - to - heart chats with my father .
Writing about my feelings spurred me into action which in turn gave me more to write about , until soon I 'd wrestled some of my darkest demons and decided that I could live without the glory of being " someone who writes stories " .
At which point I showed what I 'd written to an agent , who showed it to a publisher , who said no and then my agent kept on showing it to publishers until one said : " This is very good .
I will give you money for it . "
Simple .
Tenacity and flexibility make a formidable team .
Take pleasure in creative failure – it's a sign you 're pushing yourself – but learn from it too .
I had to bash my head against a brick wall several times before I thought : " Hey , maybe I should change direction . "
Getting published is about practising until you 're really good , then persevering until you 're really lucky .

What not to do : A beginner 's guide
1 . Do n't believe you dilute your vision by reading others ' work .
2 . Do n't be afraid to lose faith in your original draft .
To edit is not to scorn your infallible muse .
3 . Do n't submit your work with supporting material .
Self - portraits in green crayon do not scream " I am creative " .
4 . Do n't approach editors somewhere they could not reasonably be expecting to field submissions .
Catching them off - guard will not get you a better deal .
5. The Writers ' Handbook and Writers ' and Artists ' Yearbook are both produced by publishers .
Ignore them at your peril .
Inquiring minds are noting IBM files for patent on offshoring jobs .
As IBM was firing thousands of American workers last week , the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office published Big Blue 's application to copyright a computerized system that calculates how to offshore jobs while maximizing government tax breaks .
Update : IBM withdraws its application , calling it an error .
In their application to patent a " method and system for strategic global resource sourcing , " five Hudson Valley IBMers describe how it weighs such plans as " 50 percent of resources in China by 2010 , " against such factors as labor costs , infrastructure and the " minimum head count to qualify for incentives . "
Lee Conrad , national coordinator for Alliance@IBM , a group trying to unionize Big Blue , was stunned to learn of the application .
" This is obviously outrageous — a patent on how to offshore U.S. jobs , " Conrad said .
" IBM is obviously doing all it can to decimate the U.S. work force , and it is all the more reason why IBM should not get any tax breaks or stimulus money .
They clearly are abandoning the U.S. work force . "
The application says the system weighs moving into or out of a particular country against criteria such as wages , political systems , " incentive contracts " and the economic impact of " violating and / or satisfying those incentives . "

Melatonin can slow down the effects of aging , according to a team at laboratoire Arago in Banyuls sur Mer ( CNRS / Université Pierre et Marie Curie ) who say that a treatment based on melatonin can delay the first signs of aging in a small mammal .
Better known as the ‘ time - keeping ' hormone , melatonin is naturally secreted by the body during the night .
It is therefore a kind of biological signal for nightfall , allowing an organism to synchronize itself with the day / night rhythm .
At Laboratoire Arago , Elodie Magnanou and her co-workers studied the long - term effects of melatonin on the Greater White - toothed shrew , small nocturnal insectivorous mammals they collected in the Banyuls - sur - Mer area ( Pyrenées - Orientales , France ) using non-baited pitfall traps .
Under normal conditions , this animal shows the first signs of aging after reaching 12 months , mainly through the loss of circadian rhythm in its activities .
By continuously administering melatonin via implants , starting a little before 12 months , the appearance of these first signs was delayed by at least 3 months , which is a considerable period in relation to the lifespan of this shrew .
The Greater White - toothed shrew has a lifespan of 12 to 18 months in the wild and up to 30 months in captivity .
Captivity does not change the time at which signs of aging appear , it simply lengthens life .
Melatonin is now known to play several beneficial roles .
These include being an antioxidant , an anti-depressant , and helping to remediate sleep problems .
The next step will be to understand the mode of action of the hormone on aging , so we can perhaps envisage its use on humans .

I ’m just reading a fascinating report on the psychology of why people fall for scams , commissioned by the UK government ’s Office of Fair Trading and created by Exeter University ’s psychology department .
It ’s a 260 page monster , so is not exactly bed time reading , but was drawn from in - depth interviews from scam victims , examination of scam material , two questionnaire studies and a behavioural experiment .
Here ’s some of the punchlines grabbed from the executive summary .
The report concluded that the most successful scams involve :
Appeals to trust and authority : people tend to obey authorities so scammers use , and victims fall for , cues that make the offer look like a legitimate one being made by a reliable official institution or established reputable business .
Visceral triggers : scams exploit basic human desires and needs ‚ Äì such as greed , fear , avoidance of physical pain , or the desire to be liked ‚ Äì in order to provoke intuitive reactions and reduce the motivation of people to process the content of the scam message deeply .
Scarcity cues .
Scams are often personalised to create the impression that the offer is unique to the recipient .
Induction of behavioural commitment .
Scammers ask their potential victims to make small steps of compliance to draw them in , and thereby cause victims to feel committed to continue sending money .
The disproportionate relation between the size of the alleged reward and the cost of trying to obtain it .
Scam victims are led to focus on the alleged big prize or reward in comparison to the relatively small amount of money they have to send in order to obtain their windfall .
Lack of emotional control .
Compared to non-victims , scam victims report being less able to regulate and resist emotions associated with scam offers .
They seem to be unduly open to persuasion , or perhaps unduly undiscriminating about who they allow to persuade them .
And here ’s a couple of counter - intuitive kickers :
Scam victims often have better than average background knowledge in the area of the scam content .
For example , it seems that people with experience of playing legitimate prize draws and lotteries are more likely to fall for a scam in this area than people with less knowledge and experience in this field .
This also applies to those with some knowledge of investments .
Such knowledge can increase rather than decrease the risk of becoming a victim .
Scam victims report that they put more cognitive effort into analysing scam content than non-victims .
This contradicts the intuitive suggestion that people fall victim to scams because they invest too little cognitive energy in investigating their content , and thus overlook potential information that might betray the scam .
Interesting , people who fall for scams often have a feeling that it ’s dodgy .
The report suggests we trust our gut instincts .
If it seems too good to be true , it probably is .
We like to think that only other people fall for scams , but as I ’m working my way through the report it ’s becoming clear that those things that we think make us resistant to scams ( a keen analytical mind ) are not what help us avoid being a victim .
A really fascinating read and a great example of applied psychology .

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told President Obama at a White House meeting Monday that he wanted to resume peace negotiations with the Palestinians , but he stopped short of embracing the U.S. view of a fully sovereign Palestinian state .
The Israeli leader said he wanted Palestinians to govern themselves , but without “ a handful of powers that could endanger the state of Israel . ”
Netanyahu has long insisted that any Palestinian state forgo the common trappings of statehood , including its own military , control over its borders and authority over electronic communications .
The first White House meeting between Obama and Netanyahu was much anticipated , in part because of expectations of possible friction between the conservative Israeli leader and the new U.S. president , who has said that bringing about a peace deal will be one of his top priorities .

Addressing reporters after their talks , the two leaders exchanged praise and described shared goals .
But it was clear after the four - hour meeting that they remained far apart on key issues .
For instance , Obama emphasized that Israel must halt growth of Jewish settlements in the West Bank in order to reach a peace accord .
But Netanyahu said nothing on the subject in an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office .
Speaking later with Israeli journalists , Netanyahu indicated that Israeli action on settlements would depend on Palestinian cooperation in other areas , the Ynet news organization in Israel reported .
Obama , whom Israel has been pressing to set a deadline for his outreach initiative to Iran , said for the first time that the administration would try to decide by the end of the year whether to continue the effort .
By then , he said , “ we should have some sense of whether these discussions are starting to yield serious benefits . ”
Advertisement
Still , Obama insisted that is only a general timetable .
“ That does n’t mean every issue would be resolved at that point , ” he said .
“ I do n’t want to set an artificial deadline . ”
The Israeli and U.S. governments allege Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons ; Tehran insists its nuclear effort is a civilian energy program .
After the meeting Netanyahu appeared to soften his insistence that the issue of Iran ’s nuclear program take precedence over talks with the Palestinians .
He said the two matters should be tackled at the same time , “ in parallel . ”
Obama , however , continued to say a Palestinian settlement must take precedence .
Settling that , he said , could help defuse any possible Iranian threat .

Obama prodded Israel to ease restrictions on allowing construction materials into Gaza , to enable rebuilding there after Israel ’s offensive in December - January .
Israel is limiting the flow of most goods , saying it fears some materials could be used by militants .
The Gaza blockade is a sensitive topic that U.S. officials have avoided discussing publicly .
But Obama said that if Israel ’s control of the borders was “ so tight that it is impossible for reconstruction and humanitarian efforts to take place , then that is not going to be a recipe for Israel ’s long - term security . ”
Netanyahu praised Obama as a “ great leader ” and in turn , Obama complimented Netanyahu , in a way that appeared designed to enlist him in his peace mission .
Obama said he had “ great confidence ” in Netanyahu ’s “ historical vision .
. . .
I have great confidence that he ’s going to rise to the occasion . ”

White House aides and Israeli officials said there was good chemistry between the two , evidenced by the length of their talk .
“ The president believes these were warm discussions and we ’re making progress , ” said Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary .
Avi Panzer , a Netanyahu advisor in Jerusalem who was briefed by colleagues in Washington , said the fact that the two leaders “ sat for so long without advisors denotes a serious attempt to reach common ground . ”
Saeb Erekat , the Palestinians ’ chief peace negotiator , said he was “ extremely disappointed ” that Netanyahu did n’t discuss the Palestinian state , the Jewish settlements issue or the validity of previous agreements designed to lead to a separate state .
Erekat noted that while Netanyahu had said he wanted to negotiate , he did not indicate the talks would be on the so - called final - status agreements to resolve the conflict .
Advertisement
Experts cautioned that the public statements of leaders frequently do not reflect their private meetings , and predicted that later disclosures could cast the meeting in a different light .
Daniel Levy , a former Israeli peace negotiator now with the New American Foundation in Washington , said one key question was what impression of Obama Netanyahu took away .
“ Did he see him as a rookie pushover . . . or as a serious guy who ’s determined to move forward ? ”

Are downloads really killing the music industry ?
Or is it something else ?
The music industry does like to insist that filesharing - aka illegal downloading - is killing the industry : that every one of the millions of music files downloaded each day counts as a " lost " sale , which if only it could somehow have been prevented would put stunning amounts of money into impoverished artists ' hands .
And , of course , music industry bosses ' wallets .
But we wo n't mention that .
Take the story that appeared in this paper last week :
At least 7 million people in Britain use illegal downloads , costing the economy billions of pounds and thousands of jobs , according to a report .
Shared content on one network was worth about £ 12bn a year according to the research commissioned by the Strategic Advisory Board for Intellectual Property .
David Lammy , minister for intellectual property , said : " Illegal downloading robs our economy of millions of pounds every year and seriously damages business and innovation throughout the UK .
" It is something that needs tackling , and we are serious about doing so . "
Well , up to a point , minister .
Ben Goldacre took apart the rather dodgy calculations behind the claims on Saturday .
But it left me wondering .
Why does the music industry persist in saying that every download is a lost sale ?
If you even think about it , it can't be true .
People - even downloaders - only have a finite amount of money .
In times gone by , sure , they would have been buying vinyl albums .
But if you stopped them downloading , would they troop out to the shops and buy those songs ?
I do n't think so .
I suspect they 're doing something different .
I think they 're spending the money on something else .
What else , I mused , might they be buying ?
Hmm ... young .. like the entertainment industry ... ah , how about computer games and DVDs ?
Thus began a hunt for the figures for UK sales of games and of DVDs and of music to see if there was any consistent relationship between them .
And since this was about filesharing , it seemed sensible to analyse it since 1999 - when Napster started and blew up the CD business model .
( It 's surprising how hard it was to find these statistics .
You 'd think someone like ELSPA , the European Leisure Software Publishers '
Association , would have them .
Nope : instead initially I had to track them via press releases .
The BPI , representing British record labels , said that it did n't have numbers going back before 2004 , which seemed a bit 1984 - ish to me ; it turns out the BPI does n't like to release those figures because it changed the methodology for recording sales in 2004 , effectively reducing the number .
At least DVD data are easily obtained from the British Video Association and the UK Film Council .
Thank you . )
The first clue of where all those downloaders are really spending their money came in searching for games statistics : year after year ELSPA had hailed " a record year " .
In fact if you look at the graph above , you 'll see that games spend has risen dramatically - from £ 1.18bn in 1999 to £ 4.03 bn in 2008 .
Meanwhile music spending ( allowing for that * of adjustment in 2004 onwards ) has gone from £ 1.94bn to £ 1.31bn .
DVD sales and rentals , meanwhile , have nearly doubled , from a total of £ 1.286bn in 1999 to £ 2.56 bn in 2008 .
If we assume that there 's roughly the same amount of discretionary spending available ( which , even allowing for the credit bubble , should be roughly true ; most of the credit went into houses ) , then it 's clear who the culprit is : the games industry .
By 2009 , the amount spent in games and music is almost exactly the same as 1999 ( though note that the music industry changed its methods from 2004 ) .
Yes , downloaders are n't spending money on the music industry , and in that way they are hurting it .
But I 'd argue that the true volume of " lost " sales is nowhere near the claims made .
Assume that music could n't be copied ( as many games can 't ) .
I do n't think that the volume of music sales would equate to all those downloads .
At best , it would be £ 600 m larger .
But the reality is that nowadays , one can choose between a game costing £ 40 that will last weeks , or a £ 10 CD with two great tracks and eight dud ones .
I think a lot of people are choosing the game - and downloading the two tracks .
That 's real discretion in spending .
It 's hurting the music industry , sure .
But let 's not cloud the argument with false claims about downloads .

I can point to George W. Bush and his administration and say that they are responsible for my current attitude toward U.S. military deployment , conflicts , wars , and Memorial Day .
The war of choice that is still Iraq --- its utter devastation and inhumanity --- brought into focus for my self what the Vietnam generation recognized decades ago .
Not only is the current Iraq
War brutalizing and tearing apart the lives of millions of Iraqis and squandering the lives of thousands of Americans but it is also an illegal war .
For me , the conflict with Iraq began on a sterile television screen in a spread - out cafeteria during a high school musical production of Anything Goes .
During breaks , I would occasionally venture out into the area to sit on a chair in the middle of the cafeteria and watch as CNN offered a glimpse into the bombings that were going on , bombings which I watched happen with a night vision green tint to them .
It would have been just another piece of U.S. history unfolding in the news for me except I became interested .
Maybe , intrigued is a better word .
I started to read books and inevitably , my taste for satire and humor led me to Dude , Where ’s My Country ? by Michael Moore .
No longer did the war only have a life on a television screen .
As Kerry ran for president , the war had a life on the message boards of MoveOn.org .
I would offer up my ideas on strategy and tactics for Democrats with the hopes that Kerry would win so that the wars could end .
Then , I had a blog on Blogger .
I was on Newsvine .
I was on OpEdNews.com and now , I attempt to post my writings everywhere I possibly can .
My writings ask questions .
I never claim to explicitly know what ’s best for America or anyone .
I do not offer policy or guidelines for a better future ( yet ) .
I am just picking away at the ignorance and hubris of so many people who live in America and the world .
I digress .
I have grandparents who served in World War II .
And , I have a grandparent whose brother died in World War II .
( I 'm sure many more of my relatives have loved one who were involved and who died too . )
While my two grandparents never saw much combat of any kind , family members could tell me about what it was like to be part of what Tom Brokaw termed “ the greatest generation . ”
But , was “ the greatest generation ” manipulated into serving the country ?
Were they deceived into deployment for U.S. Empire ?
The great historian Howard Zinn writes in Chapter 16 “ A People ’s War ? ” A People ’s History of the United States : from
Pearl Harbor was presented to the American public as a sudden , shocking , immoral act .
Immoral it was , like any bombing - but not really sudden or shocking to the American government .
Russett says : " Japan 's strike against the American naval base climaxed a long series of mutually antagonistic acts .
In initiating economic sanctions against Japan the United States undertook actions that were widely recognized in Washington as carrying grave risks of war . "

Surplus production of a cancer - suppressing protein may explain in part why people with Down syndrome seldom get cancer , a study in the May 21 Nature shows .
People born with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21 , instead of the usual two copies — one from each parent .
The third chromosome causes genetic aberrations that result in the mental retardation and telltale physical traits that define the condition .
But chromosome 21 carries 231 genes , including some that may well suppress cancer .
In the new study , researchers provide evidence that the protein encoded by the RCAN1 gene reins in the rampant blood vessel growth that a tumor needs to thrive .
Scientists theorized that having an extra copy of the gene would result in more protein being made and add to an anticancer effect .
Scientists have long suspected that such genetic benefits might accrue from having an extra chromosome 21 .
A recent study found that people with Down syndrome are only about one - tenth as likely to get a solid - tumor cancer as are people without the syndrome .
A tumor needs veins and arteries to nourish its rapid growth .
So tumors fashion a haphazard cluster of new vessels that mimic a legitimate body process called angiogenesis .
The late Judah Folkman of Harvard Medical School in Boston saw angiogenesis as the Achilles ’ heel of tumors and suspected that cancer suppression in people with Down syndrome could stem from extra copies of propitious genes on chromosome 21 that thwart angiogenesis .
In the new study , Folkman ’s colleagues tested the antitumor effect of RCAN1 , alsocalled DSCR1 .
The researchers compared two sets of mice , some with a third copy of the RCAN1 gene and some with the usual pair .
When the mice were surgically implanted with melanoma or lung tumors , animals making the additional RCAN1 protein had less than half as much tumor growth and substantially fewer blood vessels around those tumors as did mice with a normal RCAN1 complement .
Tests on human fetal tissues also showed that Down fetal tissues had nearly twice as much protein encoded by RCAN1 as did normal tissues .
The RCAN1 protein dampens vessel growth by inhibiting the actions of vascular endothelial growth factor , preventing it from instigating a cascade of vessel - growth orders , says study coauthor Sandra Ryeom , a cell biologist at Harvard Medical School and Children ’s Hospital in Boston .
Ryeom and her colleagues report that another chromosome 21 gene , called DYRK1A , also encodes a protein that can subvert this chain of events .
“ This is a very interesting study , ” says Kelvin Davies , a biochemist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles .
Davies ’ lab has found that people with the movement disorder Huntington ’s disease have a shortage in the brain of RCAN1 - 1L , a form of RCAN1 .
That finding suggests that increasing RCAN - 1L activity might ease the condition , he and his colleagues report in the May 1 Journal of Biological Chemistry .
Also , Davies ’ team reported in 2007 that brain cells of people with Alzheimer ’s disease have too much RCAN1 - 1L activity , he says , suggesting that gene may be implicated in that disease .
“ It seems we can now add cancer to the growing list of ailments in which RCAN1 is integrally involved , ” Davies says .
Perhaps the best - known gene found on chromosome 21 is Endostatin , which also thwarts angiogenesis .
Folkman saw Endostatin as a potential anticancer weapon , and a drug derived from its protein is currently being tested in cancer patients .
Meanwhile , another gene on chromosome 21 called ETS2 encodes a protein that seems to hinder cancer by other means .
Its role is still being deciphered , says Roger Reeves , a geneticist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore .
“ Chromosome 21 appears to contain a variety of genes that , when over - expressed , inhibit the growth of tumors , ” Reeves says .
Ultimately , the best therapeutic approach might be a cocktail of drugs derived from the proteins encoded by these genes , he says .

During a weekend discussion on the Perl 5 Porters mailing list , I volunteered to write a specification for Perl 5's support policy .
I believe in being explicit ( darn it ! ) about what a community is willing to support and what community members can provide to other community members and users .
I tried to reflect that when I wrote the first drafts of Parrot 's support policy .
My goals are simple .
I want to remove all magic and magical thinking from the release process .
I want to remove all potential ambiguity from the upgrading process .
I want to manage expectations so that the only surprise in a new release of the software is how well it delights users , and not that features have changed since the previous release .
That 's easier with Parrot than with Perl 5 , for several reasons :
Parrot is new software , with very few users who are n't already part of the vocal Parrot community .
Parrot has a regular release schedule which we can predict years in advance .
Parrot 's main users are compiler writers and distribution packagers .
Both groups are familar with and capable of managing change , if we communicate it effectively .
I have seniority on the project .
( Do n't underestimate that , if you want to influence a community . )
My goals for the Perl 5 support policy are to document current practices , to identify rough community consensus for future policies , and to encourage those policies toward modernization and sustainability .
Boring , right ?
Perhaps it is , until you consider several constraints :
Perl 5 releases are unpredictable in date and scope .
There 's no formal deprecation strategy .
Perl 5 's target users are developers , but not necessarily professional programmers .
The maintainers of dual - lived modules have tremendous leeway as to updates and upgrades and compatibility changes .
I do n't have commit access to the project .
I admit my motivations : I want to encourage p5 p to drop support for old versions and I want to see new major versions of Perl 5 released every year .
I want a one year deprecation cycle ( any feature announced as deprecated in a major release may be removed by the next major release ) .
I want support dropped for releases two years old and older ( barring a major security fix someone feels strongly enough to patch ) .
Mostly I want Perl 5 in 2010 to be better than Perl 5 in 2009 , and so on , and so forth , without always worrying about how Perl 5 did things in 1999 and 2000 .
That 's what I want .
Those are my goals and biases .
What do you want ?

Swine Flu
The United States has declared a public health emergency for the swine flu .
This is not a cause for panic .
It ’s what the government does when there ’s an impending catastrophe such as a hurricane .
There might be a pandemic , there might not .
The swine flu virus is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by Type A influenza viruses .
( See past blog post of March 26 , 2009 ) .
Symptoms for the pig include :
Coughing ( “ barking ” )
Discharge from the nose
Sneezing
Breathing difficulties
Going off feed
Pigs get infected from other pigs that have the swine flu , but they can also get it from birds with the avian flu and from human beings .
This crossing of species can lead to new viruses .
Interestingly , there is no evidence that humans can catch the swine flu from eating pork .
Be sure to cook pork to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F and that would kill bacteria and viruses .
Symptoms in humans include :
Fever ( 101 to 102 degrees )
Lethargy
Lack of appetite
Coughing
It can also include runny nose , sore throat , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea .
You should use a mask even when going to the doctor .
( Masks are for healthy people , too , so if you go to the doctor for say , a physical , it would be prudent to wear a mask .
Some doctors provide masks for their patients ) .
Diagnosis includes getting a respiratory specimen during the first four or five days of the illness when shedding the virus .
Children may shed up to 10 days or longer .
The swine flu is currently making headlines , but CNN reports that the regular flu has killed thousands since January .
They report the following :
Swine flu getting focus , but so far it ’s not deadly in the United States
Since January , more than 13,000 have died of complications from seasonal flu
Worldwide annual death from the flu estimated between 250,000 and 500,000
About 9 out of 10 flu deaths are among people older than 65
For the full article , see http://budurl.com/j9t6.
Seniors with a weakened immune system are especially at risk for any type of flu and this should serve as a wake - up call for seniors .
It ’s a time to be really pro-active to protect yourself .
Currently there is no vaccine that would take care of this particular strain of the swine flu .
Even if there were one to be developed , it would take time to get it out to the public .
Besides a healthy diet , adequate sleep , and exercise , take stock of your nutritional supplements .
Vitamark International , for example , has a drink called Limu Plus that does many things , but I take it specifically to boost my immune system .
It ca n’t prevent colds by any means , but it might shorten the recovery time .
Additionally , most people , including myself , who take superior quality vitamins also find that they have fewer illnesses or that the recovery time is shortened .
I ca n’t make any claims for the products , but I can only share what they ’re doing for me .
Take the standard precautions of washing your hands frequently and avoid rubbing your eyes .
Use alcohol - based hand sanitizers .
If you cough , cough into your elbow , not your hands .
Let your doctor know if you have flu - like symptoms and have been around pigs , been to Mexico , or around someone who has the swine flu virus .
I wish you the best of health !

In August 2001 , former professional cyclist George Mount was about to hop on his bike and embark on a leisurely ride in Northern California with his friend , three - time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond , when Mr. LeMond got a call on his mobile phone .
It was Lance Armstrong , America 's other legendary cyclist .
According to Mr. Mount , Mr. Armstrong had read comments Mr. LeMond had made about him in an article about doping allegations in the Guardian newspaper , where Mr. LeMond was quoted as saying he was " disappointed " with Mr. Armstrong 's association with a controversial Italian doctor .
When Mr. Armstrong was done ripping into Mr. LeMond on the phone that day , Mr. Mount recalled , Mr. LeMond looked " like somebody had walked up and slapped him . "

That moment , now eight years past , proved to be the beginning of what has become one of the most enduring feuds in American sports -- one that has spawned personal attacks and a lawsuit .
The battle between the two men has been playing out in federal district court in Minnesota , where Mr. LeMond is suing the bicycle maker
Trek alleging breach of contract -- claiming , in part , that Mr. Armstrong was responsible for Trek 's alleged neglect of Mr. LeMond 's signature line of bikes .
Awaiting Mediation
Next week , Trek and Mr. LeMond go to mediation .
If that fails , the case could go to trial next spring .
" I wish they 'd all kiss and make up , " says Mr. Mount , one of the pioneers of professional cycling in the U.S. , who says he is n't in contact with Mr. LeMond or Mr. Armstrong and considers himself an impartial observer .
" Guys are supposed to get over this stuff and move on with their lives . "
The feud has divided cycling into two distinct camps -- those who support Mr. LeMond and those who support Mr. Armstrong .
The fighting comes at a difficult time for the sport , which is still reeling from doping allegations and the departure of major sponsors and marketing dollars .
" When the biggest publicity the sport is getting is about doping accusations and former champions fighting current champions , it 's not a good thing , " says Mike Jacoubowsky , owner of Chain Reaction Bicycles in Northern California .
The Trek lawsuit , which was filed in the spring of last year , is essentially a contract dispute , but has been largely overshadowed by the feud .
In court filings , Mr. LeMond levels some explosive charges , alleging that Mr. Armstrong paid off cycling officials to avoid positive drug tests and worked with a doctor known for his blood - doping expertise .
Mr. Armstrong says he has never used banned substances .
The lawsuit also contends that Mr. Armstrong maliciously interfered with other LeMond business pursuits .
Mr. LeMond declined to comment for this article .
Mr. LeMond argues that Trek neglected his brand of bikes at the behest of Mr. Armstrong as a way to get back at him for making disparaging comments about Mr. Armstrong in the media .
A representative for Trek says that even though it tried to get Mr. LeMond to stop bad - mouthing Mr. Armstrong , the company fulfilled its end of the contract .
That left Trek caught in the middle of two of cycling 's biggest names .
Ex -Wife Subpoenaed
The lawsuit 's pre-trial discovery phase has widened recently , pulling in people closely related to Mr. Armstrong .
Just last week Mr. LeMond 's attorney subpoenaed Mr. Armstrong 's ex-wife , Kristin Armstrong , to testify about a dinner at which , the suit alleges , Mr. Armstrong said he would get Trek to go after Mr. LeMond .
Ms. Armstrong 's attorney says she has no knowledge of the case .
Her attorney has submitted a motion to keep her from being deposed .
In April , Mr. LeMond 's lawyers accused Trek in court papers of organizing an anti-LeMond smear campaign with the help of Public Strategies Inc. , a political consulting firm that has done work for high - profile political figures .
Public Strategies also employs Mark McKinnon , who sits on the board of Mr. Armstrong 's charity and has offices in the same building with Mr. Armstrong 's handlers at Capital Sports and Entertainment in the San Jacinto Center in Austin , Texas .
Trek says Mr. McKinnon did not work on the case .
Mr. McKinnon and Public Strategies did not return calls for comment .
A Period of Cooling
The feud died down once Mr. Armstrong decided to retire after winning the 2005 Tour de France .
But last year , at a press conference at the Interbike trade show in September -- in which Mr. Armstrong was announcing an anti-doping program run by UCLA 's Don Catlin -- Mr. LeMond showed up .
He called into question the testing procedures and offered his own method of testing .
After more than five minutes of back - and - forth discussion , Mr. Armstrong said , " It 's time for us , everybody in this room , to move on ... I appreciate you being here -- next question . "

In Italy artists and musicians have made a charity song to raise money for victims of the recent earthquake and over in Spain , artists have performed to raise funds for a seriously ill boy .
Both events , thanks to the involvement of music industry lobby groups , have been touched by copyright controversy .
In April hundreds of people were killed and tens of thousands left homeless after an earthquake hit L’Aquila in Italy .
The ongoing effort to help those affected is huge and includes various fund - raising events .
One of those is a collaboration of 56 artists and musicians who came together to record a song entitled “ Domani 21/4.09 ” ( Tomorrow 21/4.09 ) .
Recorded over three days , the proceeds of the 6 minute song will go to helping the victims of the quake .
There can be little doubt , considering the already - massive effort underway to help those affected , that the song will sell as quickly as it can be put into stores and that the result will be that much - needed funds will reach those that need it most .
However , elements of the Italian music industry simply could n’t resist getting in a strike against P2P , when the opportunity arose to do so .
Domani 21/4.09 , like any ( every ) other song , already made its way on to P2P networks and Italy ’s answer to the RIAA has wasted no time in taking advantage .
FIMI , the Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana , represents around 2,500 companies producing and distributing music in Italy and has been quick to condemn the leak , claiming that file - sharers are downloading the song while essentially trying to avoid giving money to charity , something which I find a little hard to believe .
People who want to give to charity and help a good cause , do so .
Those that do n’t want to give have made their choice too but of course there is clearly some propaganda value in claiming otherwise .
We ’ve all heard the untruth “ one download equals one lost sale ” but this is probably the first time i’ve heard “ one download equals one less donation to charity ” .
“ There are thousands of copies of the song and video made available on P2P networks with tens of thousands of illegal downloads every day , ” said the secretary general of Federation Against Music Piracy , Luca Vespignani .
In an attempt at escalation , Vespignani says he has reported the situation to Italy ’s Guardia di Finanza .
“ In this case , the damage goes beyond just music piracy , it is damaging a charity , ” he said .
Meanwhile , moving west to Spain , aggressive copyright group Spanish General Society of Authors and Editors has been up to its old tricks again and it clearly does n’t mind ‘ damaging a charity ’ .
In December last year we reported how SGAE illegally gatecrashed a wedding in order to gather evidence that the event was avoiding copyright fees due to them .
For their trouble , SGAE was fined around $ 82,000 but now the group has sunk to a new low .
Juanma López
Fenoy is a very sick young man who suffers from a degenerative brain disease called Alexander Syndrome .
In order to raise money so that Juanma can go to the US to receive treatment , a charity concert was organized , with artists waiving their fees to perform .
The concert took place April 25 and raised € 56,000 ( $ 75,000 ) through ticket sales .
Of course , SGAE wanted their piece of the pie – a 10 % piece to be exact – in order to cover their copyright fees .
After complaints were made against SGAE , the group issued a statement saying that its actions were entirely consistent with copyright laws , which do n’t allow anyone to get away with not paying the fees .
However , when SGAE ’s stance became known publicly , the opposition to their lack of compassion grew too loud for them to ignore .
SGAE issued a statement , saying that although it would still take its 10 % , it would make an equivalent voluntary donation back to the fund , effectively canceling it out .
Better late than never , but if SGAE wanted to make a charitable donation it would ’ve been in better taste to have done it willingly , rather than under pressure .
Here at TorrentFreak we have faith that people are still donating to the earthquake fund willingly too , P2P downloads or not , and they do n’t need to be demonized or put under pressure by some copyright group to do so .
Details about making donations can be found here .
You had to know we'd see a flurry of iPhone rumors and news as the Apple community reacted to the Pre 's official price and launch date , and right on schedule , we 've got whispers that Cupertino 's next handset will be announced at WWDC , feature an OLED display and a glowing Apple logo , and launch on July 17 .
There 's also a longer list of detailed specs , but for the most part they 're just a combination of that matte black casing leak from February and those Chinese specs from last week .
So are they the real deal ?
Well , the source and the site they 're on seem a little shaky to us , but the specs themselves do n't seem too far - fetched -- OLED screens are getting cheaper and more prevalent , and we 're almost certain to see bumps in camera resolution and storage , so even if they are totally made up , we 'd venture to guess they 're more right than wrong .
That 's just us , though -- check out the full spec list after the break and tell us what you think .

Religion , with its complex social , philosophical , and political ramifications is inextricably connected to the development of human society .
It 's no wonder then , that the aptly named Civilization series incorporates religion and spirituality directly into the gameplay .
At the same time , a game of Civilization is not meant to be a faithful model of human history , and so using the concept of religion is a bit of a gamble .
After all , how can something so directly connected to actual human history be represented in a game about changing the course of society ?
" Sid 's games always have several defining themes with the two most important ones being that the game is truly epic feeling and that the player gets the chance to be something awesome , " notes Barry Caudill , a long - time Civilization producer .
" Civilization epitomizes this because the player is the ruler of an entire civilization and the scope is all of human history from 4000 BC to the near future . "
However , trying to implement the entirety of human development is a rather daunting task , both from a technological and design standpoint .
" Of course , the computers were n't that powerful back when he made the original Civilization , so much of the ' epic - ness ' had to happen in the player 's imagination . "
The choice to simplify broad concepts was intentionally reflected in the design philosophy of the first game .
" It 's very intuitive that having food will make my population grow or that getting lumber from the forest will allow us to build things .
Having these relatively simple and easy to understand systems allow players from almost any background to jump in and play . "
Even so , religion was a special case .
" Topics like religion can conjure up many different experiences and expectations from various players and that makes the rules much harder for people to understand . "
As a result , the impact of religion in the first game was limited to placating an increasingly riotous population .
" The early versions have religion as an abstraction , with Temples and Cathedrals adding to [ the ] overall happiness of the population , but the rest is left to the player 's mind , " says Caudill .
" Sid accomplished the epic scope in the early games by abstracting certain things that the player 's mind could fill in and having more concrete concepts drive the play . "
When it came to religion , a more concrete implementation would have to wait for future games .
Civilization II was a massive expansion on the series ' original concept , adding more technologies , more units , and a new combat system .
As the gameplay became more complex , so too did the role of religion .
Caudill confirms that " with the significance of religion and spirituality in history , it was simply a matter of time before it ended up as a gameplay element . "
Early in - game religious elements like the Ceremonial Burial technology and Temple structure were retained , but the generic mid-game technology of Religion was replaced by the more gradual development of Polytheism , Monotheism , and Theocracy .
More importantly , the Fundamentalism government type was added , which granted civilization - wide bonuses to population happiness and penalties to scientific discovery .
It also enabled the Fanatic unit , allowing players to project military power onto the world map .
Where religion had previously been an abstract way to reduce domestic unrest in the earlier games , it was now a concrete tool that players could wield to gain an advantage over rival civilizations .
The ability for the player to use religion as an instrument for conquest was further expanded in the Call to Power games , a spin off of the Civilization core series , with the Cleric and Televangelist units .
Through unconventional warfare , a player was now able to directly proselytize within cities , conferring economic bonuses that could be used to strengthen the player 's position .
" I do n't regret it .
To tell you the truth , this has given me some publicity . "
Mr Toumanaintz is now said to have withdrawn his cash offer and said from now on he will get written consent from clients before he begins tattooing .
After seeing Swedish voters send the Pirate Party to the European Parliament , the German branch of the group has now gotten a seat in the lower house of that nation 's parliament , the Bundestag .
But the seat did n't come about through an electoral triumph ; instead a member of the Social Democrats , J�rg Trauss , changed allegiances , claiming his decision was driven by his former party 's support for a mandatory Internet filtering scheme .
But the situation is complicated by the fact that the filtering would target child porn , and Trauss is under investigation for possession of that material ( he claims it was for investigative purposes ) .
The legislation in question would implement a scheme that 's somewhat similar to the one under consideration in Australia .
The system would rely on a blacklist of sites , maintained by the German Federal police force , the Bundeskriminalamt .
Access to blacklisted sites would trigger the ISP to send the user to a warning page , indicating that the site contains illegal child porn .
Users will , apparently , still have the option of clicking through .
According to Fritz Effenberger , who runs a German Tech site , the bill has the backing of both the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democrats , making its passage in the upper house ( or Bundesrat ) all but a certainty .
The bill has been opposed by the Free Democrats , as well as the Greens and Socialists .
In general , Effenberger suggests that these latter parties have a younger constituency that cares more about Internet and technology issues , and this makes for a compelling issue for them .
Tauss was apparently caught in a somewhat awkward position .
As a member of the Social Democrats , his party was largely in favor of the filtering legislation ; at the same time , Tauss was his party 's primary resource for new media issues for the last several decades .
That apparently led to his decision to at least partially switch parties .
According to an English language news source , Tauss will continue to vote with the Social Democrats on most issues , but will follow the Pirate Party 's goals on Internet and legal issues .
Despite the guarantee of a degree of continued support , the Social Democrats , known as the SPD , are not amused by the switch , and have called for Tauss to resign from Parliament .
" He got it [ his seat ] through the SPD and therefore has to give it back , " said a party spokesman .
The Pirate Party , in contrast , was quite pleased , despite the fact that Tauss promised a degree of continued allegiance to the Social Democrats .
The whole situation , however , is complicated by the fact that Tauss has a rather unfortunate personal connection to child pornography .
According to both Effenberger and the press account , Tauss ' focus on Internet issues has led him to investigate child pornography , and he may have had valid reasons for possessing some ( he 's certainly not denied having it ) .
Nevertheless , the investigation into this possession has dragged on for over a year without any formal charges being filed .
All of this suggests that Tauss ' actions provide rich ground for political speculation .
Has he opposed the filtering plan because of his personal experiences , and is he really fleeing the SDP as a matter of principle ?
Has the investigation remained open for so long simply because it provides a nice implement with which to bludgeon an opponent of this bit of Internet regulation ?
In any case , Tauss ' decision is unlikely to derail the legislation and , without the SDP 's support , he 's unlikely to survive past the next elections , which occur in September .
But in the meantime , his switch gives the Pirate Party another success to boast about .
It may seem unseemly , given the apparent bloodshed in Iran today , to dwell on fallout among the media and bloggers about the Obama administration ’s selective process for taking questions at a presidential news conference .
But within the bubble of the Beltway , and along the sprawling information dashboards on the Web , a tangential issue to news coverage of the Iranian situation has been stirring a lot of discussion , stemming from the circumstances surrounding President Obama ’s decision at yesterday ’s news conference to call on Nico Pitney of the Huffington Post .
As background for those not following this media - centric debate , Mr. Pitney has been live - blogging the fallout from the Iranian elections , sifting through Twitter feeds and other available observations and reports for news about the situation for several days .
As our own staff knows at The Times , this has been an arduous task , partly because some reality is ungettable , some reports are questionable and others are downright fictitious .
But in a censored - world like that in Iran , the Internet , with all its access through sometimes circuitous routes , has empowered citizens on the ground and offered new , inventive avenues for getting information out to the world .
The latter touch - base seems to have been the motivation for the Obama communications staff to select Mr. Pitney as someone who could offer up a question solicited from Iranians to pose to President Obama on Tuesday .
As reporter heads swiveled in the Brady briefing room , Mr. Obama called out to Mr. Pitney and asked : “ I know that there may actually be questions from people in Iran who are communicating through the Internet , ” the president said .
“ Do you have a question ? ”
“ That ’s right , ” Mr. Pitney answered , standing along the sidelines , with access through a temporary White House pass .
“ I wanted to use this opportunity to ask you a question directly from an Iranian . ”
But this was not a spontaneous exchange .
Although Mr. Pitney and the administration have asserted in the intervening hours that neither knew the question to be posed — which means , in effect , the president ’s response could n’t have been rehearsed — Mr. Pitney was alerted by the administration that he might be called upon the night before .
So the perhaps noble mission of the Obama administration to address a genuine Iranian has gone awry — for reasons we ’ll now explore through several accounts and assessments by White House correspondents and netroots activists who are feuding online over the news conference Q&A process and this particular example of an extremely selective — and calculated — decision .
( And by the way , Mr. Obama really did n’t answer the posed question . )
How does the Obama administration choose which reporters to call on during a live presidential news conference ?
And are the rules — or at least the traditions — changing ?
It ’s quite fascinating , actually , and even a bit amusing at this juncture , given the takes of various high - profile players , who have been engaged in a schoolyard game of nyah - nyah .
We ’ll get to that soon .
At today ’s White House briefing , Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary , was hammered by the White House press corps in the aftermath .
He insisted that Mr. Pitney was n’t a “ planted questioner ” , despite the fact that the HuffPo blogger had gotten a rare heads - up the night before that he might be called upon .
That ’s the core issue , which has gotten lost in the gaming and bashing of an elite White House press corps , and criticism of Mr. Pitney ’s role , although we would n’t go so far as Matt Cooper has done at The Atlantic.com to call it the “ crucifixion ” of Nico Pitney .
My colleague , Jeff Zeleny , who was at the briefing today as well as at yesterday ’s news conference , told me when I asked about the kind of night - before heads - up from the administration like that afforded Mr. Pitney : “ That never happens .
I ’ve never been notified in advance of a question .
In some cases – like when the Detroit News was asked at the prime - time one – she got like 10 minutes heads up . ”
Early on , Mark Knoller of CBS News , who chronicles all big and small data about White House happenings , sent out his own alarm at the departure from routine through his Twitter feed , and then a post at his employer ’s site , titled : “ Obama to HuffPo Blogger : Tee One Up for Me . ”
At the briefing today , from the transcript :
Q : Is this going to become a regular feature of President Obama ’s news conferences , that you all are going to bring people in here that you select to ask questions ?
Mr. Gibbs :
Well , let ’s understand .
Let ’s be clear , Peter .
I think you understand this .
So , but I ’ll repeat it for your benefit .
There was no guarantee that a question — the questioner would be picked .
There was no idea of what the exact question would be .
I ’ll let you down easily .
A number of questions that we went through in prep you all asked .
Iran dominated the news conference not surprisingly .
But Peter , I think it was important , and the president thought it was important , to take a question using the very same methods again that many of you all are using , to report information on the ground .
I do n’t have — I wo n’t make any apologies for that .
The “ Peter ” asking the questions was Peter Maer from CBS radio .
Through persistent questioning at the briefing , Mr. Gibbs insisted the question was n’t planted .
And when someone posited that this picking and planting was akin to what occurred during the campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 2008 primary cycle , with planted questioners at her town - hall sessions , Mr. Gibbs went into a “ no , no , no , no ” rebuttal .
For his part , Mr. Pitney has taken to the airwaves all over the place today .
From a C - Span interview to CNN this afternoon , he has asserted that the administration had no clue what question he would ask .
His ultimate employer , Arianna Huffington , posted a bit of a defensive defense about coverage of Mr. Pitney ’s cameo at the news conference .
Her headline kind of captures a bit of the angst and the back - and - forth : “ Media Playground : Obama Calls on HuffPost , Michael Calderone Pouts , Ben Smith Calls Us Names , Dana Milbank Gets His Facts All Wrong . ”
Mr. Milbank offered a sendup in his sketch at The Washington Post : “ The use of planted questioners is a no - no at presidential news conferences , because it sends a message to the world — Iran included — that the American press is n’t as free as advertised .
But yesterday was n’t so much a news conference as it was a taping of a new daytime drama , “ The Obama Show . ”
Missed yesterday ’s show ?
Do n’t worry : On Wednesday , ABC News will be broadcasting “ Good Morning America ” from the South Lawn ( guest stars : the president and first lady ) , “ World News Tonight ” from the Blue Room , and a prime - time feature with Obama from the East Room . ”
Along the Interwebs , netroots activists are heralding Mr. Pitney ’s role as yet another example of breaking through that tired old MSM elitist routine .
They constantly deride what they consider the clubby atmosphere inside the briefing rooms at a presidential news conference , where citizens ’ questions seem to them to be excluded .
( Never mind that many of the questions asked reflect the public ’s pressing issues of the day , like health care reform that did indeed command serious attention from the president yesterday . )
At The Nation , Ari Melber , tried to make the Pitney issue a milestone for citizen - journalists given access to that sacrosanct place amid the White House press corps .
The problem is not just that Mr. Pitney , for just one day , was afforded a cherished seat in the room or given an airing for his question .
And no one is diminishing his work that has drawn accolades for his devoted attention to an issue .
Rather , the criticism is that he was cherry - picked , with a call - upon hours and hours beforehand , and handed a status that no one among the so - called elite of the press corps receives on any given day .
While that may indeed be a thorn in the feet of the corps who toil daily , the perception of a favored one who got exceptionally advance notice may send signals — far and wide — as to what lengths the administration will go to stage and control the message the president wants to send .
That is what has gotten lost in all the old vs. new media antagonisms .
It ’s not about Mr. Pitney ’s work or for that matter , the question he asked .
It ’s about how the administration finagled the position in which he became an actor for the president ’s agenda .
From now on Mexicans will be literally drawn to the ladies ’ feet .
This is possibly thanks to the recently released line of shoes , which , according to the shoe manufacturers , stimulate pheromone ( hormones , which help attract individuals of the opposite sex ) production .
The commercial manager Guillermo Sanchez explained to the journalists that the shoes start functioning upon walking , such that each step leads to another wave of pheromone release .
Special “ strategic ” insoles are placed in the shoes ; the insoles trigger release of those chemical compounds upon contact with nerve fibers .
The compounds , in turn , provoke subconscious attraction in those who are nearby .
Sanchez highlighted that , according to their information , his company is the only one in the world to produce such product .
According to him , they aim to find buyers among “ active ” women , ages between 25 and 40 , who need comfortable shoes for work .

Editor 's note : Mitt Romney is the former governor of Massachusetts and was a candidate for the Republican nomination for president in 2008 .
This commentary was adapted from remarks he made last week to the House Republican Conference .
( CNN ) --
These are extraordinary times , and like a lot of Republicans I believe that a well - crafted stimulus plan is needed to put people back to work .
But the Obama spending bill would stimulate the government , not the economy .
Mitt Romney says Obama 's spending bill would stimulate the government rather than the economy .
We 're on an economic tightrope .
The package that passed the House is a huge increase in the amount of government borrowing .
And we 've borrowed so much already that if we add too much more debt , or spend foolishly , we could invite an even bigger crisis .
We could precipitate a worldwide crisis of confidence in America , leading to a run on the dollar or hyperinflation that wipes out family savings and devastates the middle class .
It 's still early in the administration of President Obama .
Like everyone who loves this country , I want him to adopt the correct course and then to succeed .
He still has a chance to step in and insist on spending discipline among the members of his own party .
It 's his job to set priorities .
I hope for America 's sake that he knows that a chief executive can't vote " present . "
He has to say yes to some things and no to a lot of others .
As someone who spent a career in the private sector , I 'd like to see a stimulus package that respects the productivity and genius of the American people .
And experience shows us what it should look like .
First , there are two ways you can put money into the economy , by spending more or by taxing less .
But if it 's stimulus you want , taxing less works best .
That 's why permanent tax cuts should be the centerpiece of the economic stimulus .
Watch Romney make argument for tax cuts »
How to boost the economy Mitt Romney talks about the stimulus plan on " American Morning . "
Friday 6 a.m. ET see full schedule »
Second , any new spending must be strictly limited to projects that are essential .
How do we define essential ?
Well , a good rule is that the projects we fund in a stimulus should be legitimate government priorities that would have been carried out in the future anyway , and are simply being moved up to create those jobs now .
As we take out nonessential projects , we should focus on funding the real needs of government that will have immediate impact .
And what better place to begin than repairing and replacing military equipment that was damaged or destroyed in Kuwait , Iraq and Afghanistan ?
Third , sending out rebate checks to citizens and businesses is not a tax cut .
The media bought this line so far , but they 've got it wrong .
Checks in the mail are refunds , not tax cuts .
We tried rebate checks in 2008 and they did virtually nothing to jump - start the economy .
Disposable income went up , but consumption hardly moved .
Businesses are n't stupid .
They 're not going to invest in equipment and new hires for a one - time , short - term blip .
What 's needed are permanent rate cuts on individuals and businesses .
Fourth , if we 're going to tax less and spend more to get the economy moving , then we have to make another commitment as well .
As soon as this economy recovers , we have to regain control over the federal budget , and above all , over entitlement spending for programs such as Social Security and Medicare .
This is more important than most people are willing to admit .
There is a real danger that with trillions of additional borrowing -- from the budget deficit and from the stimulus -- world investors will begin to fear that our dollars wo n't be worth much in the future .
It is essential that we demonstrate our commitment to maintaining the value of the dollar .
That means showing the world that we will put a stop to runaway spending and borrowing .
Fifth , we must begin to recover from the enormous losses in the capital investment pool .
And the surest , most obvious way to get that done is to send a clear signal that there will be no tax increases on investment and capital gains .
The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts should be extended permanently , or at least temporarily .
And finally , let 's exercise restraint in the size of the stimulus package .
Last year , with the economy already faltering , I proposed a stimulus of $ 233 billion .
The Washington Post said : " Romney 's plan is way too big . "
So what critique will the media have for the size of the Obama package ?
In the final analysis , we know that only the private sector -- entrepreneurs and businesses large and small -- can create the millions of jobs our country needs .
The invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mitt Romney .

Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) confronted AIG CEO Edward Liddy during his House testimony today about a lawsuit involving many Ohio public employees ’ pension fund , which lost $ 96 million to AIG fraud .
The lawsuit has been dragging on since 2004 , and Kucinich demanded answers .
“ AIG cheated police , firemen , teachers and public employees in Ohio out of $ 96 million .
That may not seem like a lot of money to a company that is used to dealing in trillions .
But you cheated people who save lives and teach our children , and I want to know what you are going to do about it , ” Kucinich said .
The lawsuit revolves around practices that go back as far as 1999 .
It contends that AIG rigged bids , manipulated its own stock price , and is guilty of accounting fraud .
Kucinich pointed out that , “ corporations in England , Germany , France and South America are getting dollar for dollar for their losses .
Yet when it comes to police , firemen , teachers and other public figures it is ZERO , zero for the $ 96 million dollars they lost . ”
He also asked Liddy , “ Can you name one thing that you have done to get this matter resolved with respect to AIG defrauding police , firemen , teachers and other public employees in the state of Ohio ? ”

The clip that is getting played on television is of Kucinich promising to not be a member that would be rolled on this , but this is the story behind his anger .
This is also an example of what makes Kucinich great .
He asked a question about the losses suffered by real working people .
AIG has gotten tens of billions of dollars in government assistance , so I think that it is more than appropriate for the government to put pressure of the company to settle the lawsuit .
Every politician has expressed outrage over the bailouts , but this has n’t stopped them from opening up the government checkbook .
Real people have been hurt by the AIG fraud .
They should be the focus of the investigation , because AIG did cheat people , and it is not right that they have been rewarded for their misdeeds .
A lot of politicians talk about standing up for the little guy , but Dennis Kucinich actually does it .
This is why Kucinich is a one of a kind member of Congress .
This article was part of a project we ran to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy 2009 .
The project asked you to nominate the questions about the Universe you 'd most like to have answered , and this is one of them .
We took it to cosmologist John D. Barrow , Professor of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge , and here is his answer .
You can also listen to his answer in our podcast
Are the constants of nature really constant ?
Our units of weight , distance and time depend on human choice and therefore are not universal .
First of all you have to decide what those constants are .
If you pick the wrong quantities and believe that they are constants , then the fact that you find them to vary later on wo n't tell you anything except that you 'd made the wrong choice .
Physicists have had a long time to try to decide , both observationally and then on the basis of their theories , what things in nature they should regard as absolutely unchanging — the fundamental features of the Universe .
These are , perhaps , not some of the things you might have thought .
Who decides what is constant ?
We are used to all sorts of constants and standards in every day life , the quality of a rubber tyre , or the standard wire gauge — there are many of these supposedly unchanging quantities in ordinary and industrial life .
Most of these grew out of the industrial revolution in the nineteenth century , when there was a huge increase in manufacturing .
At that time there was a famous Irish physicist called George Johnstone Stoney , who became the vice - president of the Irish Academy .
He was well known for many achievements , in particular for predicting the existence of the electron , and he even gave the name to that particle before it was discovered .
Stoney was asked to chair a panel at a British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting to try and decide on a system of units which would handle all the industrial quantities that were springing up at that time .
He surprised everyone by coming up with a system which he called natural units .
Planck units
The Planck unit of mass is defined by where is Planck 's constant , is the speed of light and is Newton 's gravitational constant .
The Planck mass is equal to grams , or about the weight of a fly 's wing .
The Planck units for length and time , defined respectively by and are much tinier numbers : centimetres and seconds .
You can imagine the Planck length as the final size of an A4 piece of paper cut in half about 114 times .
The smallest measured period of time is still around bigger than 1 Planck time .

You can imagine the Planck length as the final size of an A4 piece of paper cut in half about 114 times .
The smallest measured period of time is still aroundbigger than 1 Planck time .
Stoney pointed out that we should n't worry about things like inches , or metres , or seconds .
Rather we should look to the so - called constants of nature , for example the gravitational constant , the speed of light , and of course the constant Stoney himself had introduced , the charge of the electron .
Stoney realised that if you juggle these constants around in the right way , you can make quantities that have units of length , mass and time , and these Stoney called natural or fundamental units .
These units do n't depend on human choice , rather they are defined by the nature of electromagnetism , or of light and gravity .
Today we use similar units in physics and cosmology , called Planck units .
They 're only very slightly different from Stoney 's units , but they are based on exactly the same idea .
The constants of nature define what the Universe is like in a way we could communicate to people on the other side of the Universe .
If we wanted to tell people in another galaxy how tall we are , and if they , like us were using fundamental units arising out of these constants of nature , then we could all agree on what we are talking about .
Ditch your dimensions
But what one has to worry about today is of course whether those quantities like the speed of light , the charge of an electron , Planck 's constant , or the mass of the electron , really are constant .
All these quantities have units .
The unit of the speed of light is distance per time , i.e. metres per second .
The mass of the electron is measured in grams , and so forth .
If you ask whether those quantities change in time you have to worry about the units in which you are measuring them .
If all speeds are changing , or all lengths are changing , or all times are changing , then it might be rather hard for you to decide whether the quantities measured relative to these speeds , lengths and times are also changing .
So in practice it's a good idea to focus attention on what physicists call dimensionless constants — quantities that do n't have any units .
For example , instead of the mass of the electron , you could look at the ratio of the mass of the electron to the mass of the proton .
That is just a number , because the units cancel out — it 's around 1/1836 .
Similarly in electricity and magnetism there is the dimensionless fine structure constant , which describes the strength of electromagnetic interaction .
Gravity also has a dimensionless constant , called the gravitational coupling constant , which describes gravitational attraction .
These unusual dimensionless numbers are what defines our Universe .
They make it different from other Universes we could imagine .
Why might the constants not be constant ?
One of the great paradoxes of theoretical physics is that although we can measure the constants of nature to a great degree of accuracy in experiments , we have no idea why they take the values they do .
Some people hope that one day we will find a great theory of everything , which will uniquely and completely specify all these numbers by showing that for our Universe to exist they must take the values they do .
No other Universe is possible .
I think that up to the early 1980s most people expected that such a theory would be found , certainly Einstein expected it , and he worked quite hard to develop such a theory himself in the last part of his life .
The German physicist Max Planck gave his name to the most fundamental units of mass , length and time in physics .
However , developments in string theory have shown that many of the constants of nature could take a range of different possible values , without causing any contradictions in the theory .
There could be universes where the constants take different values to the ones we see in our Universe .
These universes would satisfy the same laws of nature , only the forces would have different strengths and some might not even exist .
For example , in string theory you have theoretical universes with only a force of gravity , or only gravity and electromagnetism , but no radioactivity and no nuclear forces .
Or you might have all the forces we see but with rather different strengths .
So far , it seems that there are more than 10500 different possibilities , but we do n't yet fully understand if they all really are as possible as they appear .
An added subtlety is that in most of these possible worlds life cannot exist .
The other odd thing about string theory is that it seems to require the Universe to have many more dimensions than the three we walk around in .
The only way we can reconcile that prediction with the fact that we do just walk around in three dimensions , is that the other dimensions are fantastically small .
But this has an awkward consequence for the constants of physics .
If the Universe really does have ten dimensions , seven of them really tiny so that we can't see them , then the real constants of nature are all defined in ten dimensions .
The things that we are measuring in our laboratories are then just three - dimensional " shadows " of the real constants .
And there is no reason why the shadows should be constant — they 're not truly fundamental .
If these other dimensions in the Universe were to wobble slightly , or just a bit bigger , we would notice that because our three - dimensional constants would change at the same rate .
All this means that some years ago there was motivation for studying whether the constants might be varying .
Back in 1999 , the astronomer John Webb , of the University of New South Wales , Sydney , and I decided to initiate an observational programme to try to test whether some of these constants were indeed varying very slowly .
There were then new detectors on the best telescopes in the world which had a light detection sensitivity at certain wavelengths that was better than that of any laboratory experiment .
So astronomy provided a better way to test whether the constants were really constant than any laboratory experiment — this is rather surprising !
Measuring if constants are constant
An artist 's impression of a quasar .

Over many years we and our collaborators looked at the spectra of light from distant quasars .
We picked quasars because they are the brightest objects we can see in the distant Universe .
They are very far away , which means that the light we now see from quasars has spent many billions of years reaching us .
So when we receive that light and analyse it we are getting a snapshot of what the Universe , including the laws of physics and the constants of physics , was like many billions of years ago .
We developed a new way of analysing the absorption spectra of light coming from quasars when it had passed thought dust clouds .
This made it possible to compare features of quasar light to what we saw here in the laboratory .
It enabled us to test whether certain constants of nature were the same in the vicinity of a quasar as they are here in the laboratory .
We did this over many years for hundreds of objects and so obtained a very large data set .
To avoid a bias being created by a certain technique or instrument , the data was taken by different observers on different telescopes and then mingled together .
A non-constant constant ?
We were particularly interested in the fine structure constant , which measures the strength of electromagnetic interaction .
Our experiment did indeed pick up a tiny increase of about six parts in a million over 13 billion years in the value of the fine structure constant , a change that is too small to be detected in a lab experiment .
As a result , Håvard Sandvik , Joao Magueijo and I thought about what a Universe with a slowly changing fine structure constant would look like , and found that there would be consequences for gravity .
In a vacuum a feather accelerates at the same rate as stones do .
One of the laws of physics , known as the weak equivalence principle says that objects accelerate at the same rate in a vacuum , irrespective of their composition .
But it turns out that if the fine structure constant is changing very slowly , then the weak equivalence principle is n't quite true : there will be a tiny difference in the way an object made from iron will fall in a vacuum compared to one made out of carbon or some other material .
If the fine structure really is varying as detected in our experiment , then this difference is predicted to be one part in 1013 .
That is incredibly small .
We can't detect such a small difference on Earth because we run into fundamental limits of experimentation ( though we are not far off ) .
To get the extra accuracy we need to go back into space .
There are currently several proposals for space experiments that would seek to detect a violation of the weak equivalence principle , including one called STEP with an expected accuracy of about one part in 1016 , but they are still waiting to be funded .
In any case , here we have an interesting example of how a variation in a constant that is just about electricity and magnetism ends up having consequences for gravity which you might not have suspected .
So are the other constants changing too ?
At some level you can never know for sure .
There could always be variations that are smaller than what can be detected by the most accurate experiment you can do .
But the variations that we seem to have been seeing in quasars will probably be confirmed or refuted soon .
Using new atomic clock experiments and new astronomical detectors , we will find out whether these results are real , or whether there is something else going on that mimics the effect of a variation in the fine structure constant near quasars .
John Webb and his team have also been analysing a big new set of quasar spectral data that has been gathered over the last two years — maybe by the end of this year there 'll be more results .
Other observers are interested in the electron / proton mass ratio , about which it is easier to obtain evidence ( also from quasar spectra ) , and they are closing in on determining if this is varying to the same level of accuracy .
Gravity is so weak that flies can walk on the ceiling .
Something like a variation of the gravitational constant , however , is much more difficult to determine .
If you look at the back of your physics text book for the values of the constants of nature , you 'll see that lots of them , for example the charge of the electron , or the fine structure constant , are determined to a huge number of decimal places .
The exception which sticks out like a sore thumb is the gravitational constant .
It is very poorly determined because gravity is so weak on the scale of the laboratory .
The fact that a fly can walk around on the ceiling , and that you can suspend a heavy mass with a magnet shows just how weak gravity is .
The inaccuracy in our determination of the value of the gravitational constant means that we are also very poor at determining whether it is changing .
Moreover , as I said at the beginning , we do n't have any theories about why the constants of nature have the values that they do .
So we 're missing a very important ingredient in the story .
I suspect it is only when we know why they have the values that they do , or whether any of the values are actually randomly determined by events during the early stages of the Universe , that we will be able to say if we should expect any of them to change .
London Mayor , Boris Johnson has dismissed complaints about the way he dealt with the snowfall that took most of London 's buses off the roads as " complete tripe " and " nonsense " .
In a bad tempered session in front of the Transport select committee the Mayor repeatedly accused its members of party political bias .
Mr Johnson tried to walk out of the session after saying : " We created a lasagne of grit and snow " .
Heavy snowfall on 2 February severely disrupted London 's public transport .
I was reading an article today on Monster.com ( no , I ’m not looking for a new job ) that was talking about things that millionaires do that set them apart from those who are n’t successful .
It had some pretty keen insights that I thought were worth sharing .
A lot of people like to think that most millionaires are rich because they had things handed to them on a silver platter , or because they were born with a silver spoon in their mouth .
The reality is that most millionaires are self made , and had to work hard to get where they are .
The book “ The Millionaire Next Door ” says that fully 80 % of millionaires are first generation affluent .

What Are These People Doing That Allows Them To Be Successful ?
According to the article , millionaires in general have these traits in common :
They do n’t have an earn and spend mentality , instead they focus on saving and investing .
They are able to focus their efforts on a project and make it successful .
They ’re willing to do what it takes to make their ideas successful , even it involves making sacrifices .
They take calculated risks ( In other words , they take risks when they have a chance of paying off ) .
They are generous , and share what they ’ve earned and have been blessed with .
UPDATE : To listen to an in - depth discussion of this article and topic , check out the Wise Money Matters podcast !
Excerpt from the article :
1. Avoid the Earn - to - Spend Mentality : Michael LeBoeuf , author of The Millionaire in You , points out that to increase wealth , it ’s essential to emulate millionaires who view money as something to save and invest , rather than income to spend .
Many wealthy people live quite simply , he points out , choosing less pretentious homes than they could theoretically afford and opting for financial independence over material showmanship .
2 . Focus : LeBoeuf also counsels resisting the impulse to be scattered in your efforts and interests : “ Winners focus ; losers spray . ”
And goals that are clearly written down are easier to keep in focus .
3 . Do Whatever Is Necessary to Meet Your Goal : People who earn their millions are able not only to focus but persevere in the pursuit of their goals .
One single mom entrepreneur , Melissa Clark - Reynolds , started her first business , a health and safety consultancy , when she had a young son .
En route to her goal of being a millionaire by age 35 , Clarke - Reynolds and her son ate lots of pizza , did homework late at night and often slept at the office .
She is now a chief executive mentor for Empower New Zealand , a global business consulting firm headquartered in London .
4 . Take Calculated Risks :
You have to take strategic risks to earn and grow money .
And a little rebelliousness seems to help too .
One interesting study found a majority of male millionaire entrepreneurs had been in trouble with school authorities or the police during their adolescence .
5 . Be Generous :
And why does n’t it surprise us that millionaires are often very generous ?
Sometimes it ’s for the tax breaks , obviously , but often it ’s not .
One Jewish Swiss millionaire , for instance , flew to Israel to give $ 5,000 in cash to a waiter at a Jerusalem café who foiled a Palestinian suicide bombing .
Among the most generous of millionaires are those from North America , who are , according to a Merrill Lynch Cap - Gemini report , two to five times more likely to give to causes they value than their European counterparts .
These five habits are a pretty good prescription for living happily even if you ’re not a millionaire .
So millionaires are savers and investors , focused , dedicated , risk - takers , and generous to a fault .
I guess it ’s not exactly surprising that they ’ve found these things , it stands to reason that in order to be successful you need to be a dedicated hard working person who has integrity and focus .
Without it I think the only way you can be successful like these folks is to either be lucky , or extremely unethical .
And gaining wealth through ill means never seems to be as satisfying ( or lasting ) .
Dishonest money dwindles away , but he who gathers money little by little makes it grow .
Proverbs 13:11
Can you see some of those traits in yourself , and do you think that you ’ll be a millionaire one day ?
Do you think that becoming a millionaire without some or all of these traits is possible ?

Family of Winston Churchill slams BNP over far - right party 's attempt to hijack wartime leader 's legacy
Relatives of Sir Winston Churchill have denounced as ‘ monstrous ’ an attempt by BNP leader Nick Griffin to cloak himself in the mantle of Britain 's greatest wartime leader .
The far - right British National Party ’s election broadcast , which is screened nationwide this evening , features Mr Griffin quoting from one of Churchill ’s most famous speeches .
The BNP chief uses the broadcast to argue that modern Britain , with its record of welcoming immigrants , has betrayed the ‘ the blood , sweat , toil and tears ’ of those who fought for freedom in the Second World War .
BNP leader Nick Griffin ( left ) has provoked fury from Churchill 's grandson , Tory MP Nicholas Soames ( right ) , who claims the racist party is trying to hijack the wartime leader 's legacy
The advert , which features footage of Sir Winston and British war graves , provoked fury from descendants of Churchill , who have tried to ban the BNP from appropriating his image .
Tory MP Nicholas Soames , Sir Winston ’s grandson , revealed yesterday that he has tried and failed to get election watchdogs to ban the BNP from using Churchill as a vote winner .
Mr Griffin was also accused of ‘ sickening hypocrisy ’ after it emerged that he once praised the ' limitless courage and sacrifice ' , of Hitler ’s SS , and described the RAF ’s bombing of Dresden as ' mass murder ' .
Sir Winston Churchill :
His family have tried unsuccessfully to stop the BNP using the wartime leader to attract votes
Mr Soames told the Mail he has consulted lawyers and tried to get the Electoral Commission to step in and stop the BNP , but confessed he had been rebuffed .
He said he has received ‘ hundreds of letters ’ from his grandfather ’s generation distressed that the far right group is ‘ abusing their memory ’ and implying that Sir Winston would have backed the BNP ’s racist cause .
‘ It ’s a monstrous thing to do .
Most sensible people will be disgusted by the BNP ’s use of Churchill ’s face and imagery purporting to claim that my grandfather would have supported their policies .
‘ It is such a disgusting and outrageous suggestion .
They have no right to use Churchill ’s face in this way .
It causes tremendous offence to people of the wartime generation .
‘ They were a generous generation .
They were n’t a mean - spirited generation .
It is deeply offensive to his family and if the law were different we would take steps to stop it .
To suggest that he would have supported something as wicked as the BNP is beyond the pale . ’
' Our rights were won by the blood , sweat , toil and tears of our past generations ' - BNP leader Nick Griffin
' Most sensible people will be disgusted by the BNP 's use of my grandfather ' - Tory MP Nicholas Soames
Newly uncovered copies of ‘ The Rune ’ , a white supremacist magazine edited by Mr Griffin in the late 1990s , show that far from respecting Britain ’s war effort in the 1940s he was a fan of the SS units that committed countless war crimes against the allies .
Mr Griffin published one article stating : ‘ The tales of Waffen SS courage and sacrifices are almost limitless . ’
Another piece claimed : ‘ In an unbiased assessment of war - crimes , the Waffen SS were undoubtedly no worse that the troops of other nations – countless Allied war crimes are simply not publicised . ’
In 1996 he organised a demonstration on the steps of Coventry Cathedral in which he claimed RAF pilots who bombed Dresden in World War Two were guilty of ‘ mass murder ’ .
According to Griffin , the leaflets were written by ' veteran German patriot ' , Manfred Roeder , who fought for Hitler in the defence of Berlin in 1945 then founded a neo -Nazi organisation in the 1980s that was classified as a terrorist group by German authorities after it launched attacks against buildings housing asylum seekers .
A spokesman for the anti-fascist campaign group Searchlight said : ‘ Griffin ’s hypocrisy is sickening .
This man is on record as praising the SS and accusing RAF pilots of committing mass murder .
‘ For him to evoke the memory of fallen British serviceman to further his campaign of division and hate is beyond belief . ’
Jon Cruddas , the Labour MP for Dagenham , where the BNP hope to make gains , said : ‘ This exposes the fact that Nick Griffin is on record praising the SS and attacking the RAF .
It ’s only because there is an election on that he ’s pretending to be a supporter of the Armed Forces .
People will see through the sham . ’
MARSDAILY Spirit Healthy But Computer Reboots Raise Concerns
Four Drives Add to Progress - sols 1865 - 1871
Spirit has been busy making good progress around the western edge of " Home Plate . "
The rover drove four out of the past seven sols , making more than 40 meters ( 131 feet ) of total distance .
First , Spirit completed a science campaign on light - toned material unearthed the preceding week , then the rover resumed driving on Sol 1866 ( April 3 , 2009 ; no sol number for Spirit corresponded to April 2 , 2009 , using the criterion of the date in Los Angeles at local solar noon on Mars ) .
The Sol 1866 drive achieved only about 3 meters ( 10 feet ) of progress due to excessive slip .
On the next drive sol , Sol 1868 ( April 5 , 2009 ) , Spirit avoided the troubled terrain and completed about 17.5 meters ( 57 feet ) .
A pair of drives on Sols 1870 and 1871 ( April 7 and 8 , 2009 ) added another 20 meters ( 66 feet ) of progress .
As of Sol 1871 ( April 8 , 2009 ) , Spirit 's solar array energy production is 240 watt - hours , equivalent to what it takes to light a 100 - watt bulb for 2.4 hours .
Atmospheric opacity ( tau ) has improved slightly to 0.99 .
The dust factor is 0.304 , meaning that 30.4 percent of sunlight hitting the solar array penetrates the layer of accumulated dust on the array .
The rover is in good health as it makes progress around Home Plate .
Spirit 's total odometry is 7,726.78 meters ( 4.80 miles ) .
More Bright Soil Exposed by Driving - sols 1859 - 1864
Spirit is running under new flight software , version R9.3 , and all is working well .
The rover continued driving around the west of " Home Plate . "
A drive on Sol 1861 ( March 28 , 2009 ) achieved almost 23 meters ( 75 feet ) and something extra .
Light - toned soil was unearthed by the right - front wheel as the rover drove along this western portion of Home Plate .
The science team , suspecting that this may be more silica , developed a contact science campaign for this revealed material .
On Sol 1863 ( March 30 , 2009 ) , the robotic arm ( IDD ) was deployed and extended to the light - toned soil .
A microscopic imager ( MI ) stack of images was collected and then the alpha particle X - ray spectrometer ( APXS ) was placed right on the target soil .
Integration with the APXS continued through Sol 1864 ( March 31 , 2009 ) .
Observations of this light - toned material were also made with the miniature thermal emission spectrometer ( Mini - TES ) .
As of Sol 1864 ( March 31 , 2009 ) , Spirit 's solar array energy production is 223 watt - hours .
Atmospheric opacity ( tau ) remains elevated at 1.19 .
The dust factor on the solar array has worsened slightly to 0.297 , meaning that 29.7 percent of sunlight hitting the solar array penetrates the layer of accumulated dust on the array .
The rover is in good health despite dusty skies .

Pasadena CA ( SPX ) Apr 14 , 2009
The team operating NASA 's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit is examining data received from Spirit in recent days to diagnose why the rover apparently rebooted its computer at least twice over the April 11 - 12 weekend .
" While we do n't have an explanation yet , we do know that Spirit 's batteries are charged , the solar arrays are producing energy and temperatures are well within allowable ranges .
We have time to respond carefully and investigate this thoroughly , " said John Callas of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , project manager for Spirit and twin - rover Opportunity .
" The rover is in a stable operations state called automode and taking care of itself .
It could stay in this stable mode for some time if necessary while we diagnose the problem . "
Spirit communicated with controllers Friday , Saturday and Sunday , but some of the communication sessions were irregular .
One of the computer resets apparently coincided in timing with operation of the rover 's high - gain dish antenna .
The rover team has the advantage of multiple communication options .
Spirit can communicate directly with Earth via either the pointable high - gain antenna or , at a slower data rate , through a low - gain antenna that does not move .
Additionally , communications can be relayed by Mars orbiters , using the UHF ( ultra - high frequency ) transceiver , a separate radio system on the rover .
" To avoid potential problems using the pointable antenna , we might consider for the time being just communicating by UHF relay or using the low - gain antenna , " Callas said .
Spirit finished its three - month prime mission on Mars five years ago and has kept operating through multiple mission extensions .
The rover 's onboard software has been updated several times to add new capabilities for the mission , most recently last month .
The team is investigating whether the unexpected behavior in recent days could be related to the new software , but the same software is operating on Opportunity without incident .
" We are aware of the reality that we have an aging rover , and there may be age - related effects here , " Callas said .
In the past five weeks , Spirit has made 119 meters ( 390 feet ) of progress going counterclockwise around a low plateau called " Home Plate " to get from the place where it spent the past Martian winter on the northern edge of Home Plate toward destinations of scientific interest south of the plateau .
On March 10 , after several attempts to get past obstacles at the northeastern corner of Home Plate , the rover team decided to switch from a clockwise route to the counterclockwise one .
Subsequent events have included Spirit 's longest one - day drive since the rover lost use of one of its wheels three years ago , plus detailed inspection of light - toned soil exposed by the dragging of the inoperable wheel .
Halfway around Mars , meanwhile , Opportunity has continued progress on a long - term trek toward Endeavour Crater , a bowl 22 kilometers ( 14 miles ) in diameter and still about 12 kilometers ( 12 miles ) away .
Last week , a beneficial wind removed some dust from Opportunity 's solar array , resulting in an increase by about 40 percent in the amount of electrical output from the rover 's solar panels .

On Sol 1845 ( April 2 , 2009 ) , the rover 's robotic arm ( IDD ) placed the Mossbauer ( MB ) spectrometer on the outcrop target " Penrhyn " for a multi-sol integration .
On Sol 1850 ( April 7 , 2009 ) , a temporary stand - down on driving was provisionally lifted and Opportunity resumed driving .
The MB was retracted and the arm moved into the driving stow position .

The Internet Archive Joins the Fight Against the Google Books Settlement
Internet Archive Intervention : Google Book Search
The Internet Archive has filed a brief against Google hoping to challenge Google 's settlement with the " Author 's Guild " on the grounds that the Internet Archive has just as much right to protection from infringement claims on out - of - print " orphan " books as Google does .
The Internet Archive was founded in 1996 by Brewster Kahle to scan public domain books and take snapshots of the internet .
Kahle is an excitable , charismatic computer scientist who helped pioneer the first search engines and whose stated goal is " universal access to all knowledge .
" Kahle and the Internet Archive have requested a pre-motion conference on the case , asking to intervene as a party defendant .
From the Archive 's letter to Judge Dennis Chin who is presiding over the Author 's Guild settlement :
" The Archive 's text archive would greatly benefit from the same limitation of potential copyright liability that the proposed settlement provides Google .
Without such a limitation , the Archive would be unable to provide some of these same services due to the uncertain legal issues surrounding orphan books .
" The Archive is one of many Internet content providers that have an interest in opposing the proposed Settlement Agreement because it effectively limits the liability for the identified uses of orphan works of one party alone , Google Inc. , and provides for a Books Rights Registry ( " BRR " ) , the interests of which are represented solely by identified rightsholders , to negotiate their exploitation .
All other persons , including Internet content providers such as the Archive , would not be able to use orphan works broadly without being exposed to claims to infringement .
" The Archive believes that its interests and those of the public would best be served by its intervening in this case .
" Kahle joins " Consumer Watchdog " as an interested third - party to the case , exercising their right to pile on with grievances before the May 5th deadline .
" Consumer Watchdog " wrote a letter to the Justice Department earlier this month asking the JD to delay the settlement in order to give rightsholders a chance to realize that they are affected by the terms of the " Author 's Guild " Settlement and to find a lawyer before they lose their rights without knowing it .
I raise a fist in " tyrant 's envy " at Google for their truly spectacular bit of legal legerdemain .
First , since writers are n't organized , you have to set up a group with whom you can negotiate ( the " Author 's Guild " ) .
Then you get this puppet group to sue you , and you bribe them into a settlement that is not only favorable to your aims , but actually gives you exclusive access to work that any other sane individual would merely accuse you of stealing and demand that you stop -- in addition to seeking punitive damages .
"
Entrepreneurs are simply those who understand that there is little difference between obstacle and opportunity and are able to turn both to their advantage . "
-- MachiavelliKahle and the Internet Archive have been competing against Google for years , receiving a million dollars in funding from the Sloan foundation in 2006 to carry on its open - source efforts in an attempt to create a free platform that would render Google 's profit - based model irrelevant .
" Google is so good at the media being their PR machine , that you would not know there was an alternative out there , " Kahle said .
" We have brand name institutions going open and foundations like the Sloan are funding ( us ) .
It shows that the Open Content Alliance is viable , that there is support for public interest .
We do n't have to privatize the library system .
"
In 2007 , Kahle gave a TED talk at his alma mater MIT on the subject of " a digital library , free to the world " in which he details his experiments scanning and distributing all human information .
When it comes to displaying his scans , however , Kahle is Amazon 's man all the way : he 's a big proponent of the Kindle and he made his money in the first place by writing search software for Amazon .
Kahle 's point is not that Google is doing anything unethical or potentially damaging to the current publishing world , only that the Archive ought to be able to do the same thing : namely , scan out - of - print books and give them away without legal liability .
Most small publishers only received letters from Google last week asking them to contact their out - of - print authors and let them know that soon their rights will revert to Google unless they " opt out " immediately .
This gives small publishers two weeks to track down their writers , many of whom spend at least half the year in an alcoholic coma .
They will not succeed at this .
Many writers will not know what is happening until it is too late .
I want to know what deal the Internet Archive will offer to rightsholders in order to compete with Google .
Kahle wants everything to be free , does this mean that he will strip away even Google 's meager profit - sharing deal to authors if he can ?
Why can't we turn this into a two - year - long U.S. rights auction where anybody can try to outbid Google for these copyrighted works ?
I think Kahle is " a good man , " but his plan is essentially the same thing as solving the world 's poverty problem by printing more money and then giving it away .
For a few hours , everybody will be able to run out and buy food .
Everything will be free !
But then the world 's economy will collapse completely .
Who would write fiction without getting paid for it ?
Who would publicize fiction or edit it for free ?
Will all fiction soon only be slash fiction , fan fiction , and scripts for movies ?
Will this settlement mean that as soon as a book falls out of print , Google can scan it , and then they own it forever ' till the writer dies ?
Too many questions .
Too many uninformed stakeholders .
As dishwashers everywhere like to say : " too many cooks , not enough pot . "

CNN 's Jack Cafferty says " this country used to stand for something " before Cheney and Bush were in office .
( CNN ) --
It 's time for the Republican Party to tell former Vice President Dick Cheney to put a sock in it .
Here we are 100 days into the new administration of Barack Obama , and Darth Vader is still wandering around grumbling about why the new administration is all wrong .
Nobody is interested anymore , Mr. Vice President .
You and your gaggle of miscreants had your shot , and we are in the toilet because of it .
Do n't you get it ?
The election of this nation 's first African - American president and his massacre of John McCain in the Electoral College is because of you and President Bush and the myriad problems you left us all with .
Last week , you were predicting President Obama 's economic policies would have devastating effects in the long term .
This from a member of an administration that more than doubled the national debt in eight years and gave $ 700 billion to its buddies on Wall Street , no questions asked .
You 're a little short on credibility when it comes to the economy , do n't you think ?
We are reading about enhanced interrogation memos written by lawyers at the Justice Department that authorized the United States of America to behave like some Third World gang of hoodlums like the Taliban or al Qaeda .
Two members of al Qaeda were waterboarded 266 times in a single month in violation of the Geneva Conventions as well as other international agreements we are signatories to .
Who authorized those memos to be written , Mr. Vice President ?
President Obama has done an about - face and said he now favors an investigation into those memos .
Where will that investigation lead , Mr. Vice President ?
This country used to stand for something before you and President Bush got your hooks into it .
Now our reputation is shot , we are bankrupt , we continue to fight two wars that you started and the economy is in the worst recession since the Great Depression .
And you have the temerity to go around criticizing those who replaced you ?
How dare you ?
If the Republican Party has any hopes of redeeming itself in the eyes of the voters , they must distance themselves from the likes of Dick Cheney and the fundamentalist right - wingers who have become the poster children of political intolerance in this country .
Why do you think some members of your party are suggesting you embrace same - sex marriage ?
Because of a change of heart ?
I doubt it .
More likely , the wiser heads in the party recognize that without some nod toward inclusion of someone besides the extremists you represent , your party 's political chances going forward hover between slim and none .
Please , go quail hunting and leave the rest of us alone .

Two anti-gay preachers who have picketed soldiers ' funerals are banned
The names of some of the people barred from entering the UK for fostering extremism or hatred have been published for the first time .
Islamic extremists , white supremacists and a US radio host are among the 16 of 22 excluded in the five months to March to have been named by the Home Office .
Since 2005 , the UK has been able to ban people who promote hatred , terrorist violence or serious criminal activity .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said coming to the UK should be a privilege .
Ms Smith said " the public interest was against naming " the remaining six , for example on the grounds it could reveal the type of information being held about them .
The Muslim Council of Britain says the government should not act against people - whatever their views - unless they have broken the law .
' Against our values '
However , Ms Smith said granting free speech did not provide a licence to preach hatred and that those banned had " clearly overstepped the mark " with the attitudes they had expressed .
Pastor Fred Phelps had planned a protest in the UK before his ban " [ Naming them ] enables people to see the sorts of unacceptable behaviour we are not willing to have in this country .
" Coming to this country is a privilege .
We wo n't allow people into this country who are going to propagate the sort of views ... that fundamentally go against our values . "
Ms Smith had announced in October the tightening of rules determining who could come to the UK .
A " presumption in favour of exclusion " was introduced that meant it would be up to the individual concerned to prove they would not " stir up tension " after arrival .
On the list of those banned between October and March are Hamas MP Yunis Al - Astal and Jewish extremist Mike Guzovsky .
Also excluded are two leaders of a violent Russian skinhead gang , ex- Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard Stephen ' Don ' Black and neo -Nazi Erich Gliebe .
EXCLUSIONS Abdullah Qadri Al Ahdal Yunis Al Astal Samir Al Quntar Stephen Donald Black Wadgy Abd El Hamied Mohamed Ghoneim Erich Gliebe Mike Guzovsky Safwat Hijazi Nasr Javed Abdul Ali Musa Fred Waldron Phelps Snr Shirley Phelps - Roper Artur Ryno Amir Siddique Pavel Skachevsky Michael Alan Weiner
UK ' least wanted ' list in detail Send us your comments Fred Waldron Phelps Snr , a 79 - year - old American Baptist pastor , and his daughter Shirley Phelps - Roper are barred for their anti-gay comments .
Both have picketed the funerals of Aids victims and celebrated the deaths of US soldiers as " punishment " for US tolerance of homosexuality .
Talk show host Michael Savage - real name Michael Weiner - is also excluded .
His views on immigration , Islam , rape and autism have caused great offence in America .
Inayat Bunglawala , of the Muslim Council of Britain , told BBC Radio 5
Live that people should be free to enter the country , regardless of their views .
" If they step over the line and break the law , it 's at that moment the law should be enacted , not beforehand .
" If people are keeping their odious views to themselves , that 's their business .
We should not be in the business of policing people 's minds . "
He added that internet broadcasts meant that speeches could be screened from abroad into UK meetings anyway .
In recent years , individuals from a range of backgrounds have been prevented from entering the UK .
They have included animal rights activists , rap singers such as Snoop Dogg and even a lifestyle " guru " - Martha Stewart .
She was kept out after being jailed in the US for lying to investigators about a share sale .

How to Select Cucumbers for the Vegetable Garden
Do you like cucumbers ?
Some people do but others really do not and I have the most difficult time finding good homes for my over abundant cucumber crop every year .
Nonetheless , I continue growing them undaunted and heartily recommend growing them to anyone who asks because I find them a very rewarding crop .
So , what kind of cucumbers should you grow ?
If you decide to grow them from seed ( and you should because they are very easy to germinate ) you will probably find a huge number of seed packages in you local store .
The first thing to consider is whether to grow slicing or pickling cucumbers .
You will probably think immediately , “ slicing ” but do n’t make a snap judgment until you read further .
What do you really like in a cucumber ?
Few seeds ?
Thin skin ?
Then you really should consider growing pickling cucumbers and eating them instead of pickling them .
Pickling cucumbers have fewer seeds and thinner skins than slicing varieties ( so that the brine or vinegar can penetrate and flavor the body of the cuke . )
O. K. , so you always peel your cucumbers , right ?
Maybe you ought to reconsider because the peel has fiber and vitamin A , so why throw that away ?
“ Waxy ” , you say .
No , you are used to the cucumbers you buy in stores that have an edible wax coating that gives them a lovely , seductive sheen , and retains moisture so they will last in the market place .
If you have never eaten a cucumber with skin but without wax , try it , you will like it .
Someone out there will bring up the small size and bumps on pickling cucumbers .
Yes , I admit that both are possibilities but when I harvest my pickling cukes and use them in salads and dressings , neither characteristic is an issue .
I like the look of my pickling cucumbers sliced very thinly with their skins in salads or ground up for a salad dressing because the green of the skins gives eye appeal .
If I decide to pickle some cucumbers ( nothing I have considered in the last 30 years ) I can be confident that they will be crisp .
Slicing cucumbers , on the other hand , are not as versatile .
They can be put in salads and dressing but cannot be used for pickles , except the bread and butter pickles and relishes .
Their skins are thicker and they contain more seeds ( but they are not bumpy ) .
One last choice needs to be addressed : burpless or not .
I have grown both kinds but have never found much difference because cucumbers “ agree ” with me and I do n’t have a problem with either kind .
There are some good burpless kinds and I would certainly grow them and compare them if I could tell the difference .
If you are growing vegetable on a patio try the bush type .
They are small plants and produce nice cucumbers you will enjoy .
Here are my recommendations :
Pick one or two varieties you think you would like in any given year .
Cucumbers can be mega producers so experiment with two or three types at a time .
Here are my top recommendations ( but there are many more in the market place that may be good ) :
Pickling
‘ Carolina ’ ( medium sized plant with good disease resistance )
Pickling for Containers
‘ Bush Pickle ’
Slicing
‘ Marketmore 76 ’
‘ Poinsett 76 ’
‘ Straight Eight ’
Slicing for Containers
‘ Fanfare ’
‘ Salad Bush ’
Please remember , one cucumber plant can go a long way , literally and figuratively , so limit the number of plants you grow .
Your cucumber plants will probably start bearing fruit before your tomatoes , but once you have both , combine them in a simple salad with a touch of onion and olive oil .
Yummmm .
KATRINA REVISITED ….
I ’m reluctant to highlight just one anecdote from Robert Draper ’s GQ piece on Donald Rumsfeld , because there ’s an awful lot of information in the article that deserves to be read , but the story about Rumsfeld during the Hurricane Katrina crisis is remarkable .
As Draper explained , there were search - and - rescue helicopters available for New Orleans , but Rumsfeld refused to approve their deployment , despite the belief from the commander of Joint Task Force Katrina that they were needed .
[ T] hree years later , when I asked a top White House official how he would characterize Rumsfeld ’s assistance in the response to Hurricane Katrina , I found out why .
“ It was commonly known in the West Wing that there was a battle with Rumsfeld regarding this , ” said the official .
“ I ca n’t imagine another defense secretary throwing up the kinds of obstacles he did . ”
Though various military bases had been mobilized into a state of alert well before the advance team ’s tour , Rumsfeld ’s aversion to using active - duty troops was evident : “ There ’s no doubt in my mind , ” says one of Bush ’s close advisers today , “ that Rumsfeld did n’t like the concept . ”
The next day , three days after landfall , word of disorder in New Orleans had reached a fever pitch .
According to sources familiar with the conversation , DHS secretary Michael Chertoff called Rumsfeld that morning and said , “ You ’re going to need several thousand troops . ”
“ Well , I disagree , ” said the SecDef .
“ And I ’m going to tell the president we do n’t need any more than the National Guard . ”
After the president had returned to the White House , he eventually convened a meeting in the Situation Room to discuss the government ’s response .
Bush barked , “ Rumsfeld , what the hell is going on there ?
Are you watching what ’s on television ?
Is that the United States of America or some Third World nation I ’m watching ?
What the hell are you doing ? ”
When Rumsfeld mentioned his concerns about “ unity of command ” issues , Bush stopped talking to his Defense Secretary and directed all inquiries to Lieutenant General Honore , via video screen , who was on the ground in Louisiana .
But still the troops had n’t arrived .
And by Saturday morning , says HonorÃ© , “ we had dispersed all of these people across Louisiana .
So we needed more troops to go to distribution centers , feed people , and maintain traffic . ”
That morning Bush convened yet another meeting in the Situation Room .
Chertoff was emphatic .
“ Mr. President , ” he said , “ if we ’re not going to begin to get these troops , we ’re not going to be able to get the job done . ”
Rumsfeld could see the writing on the wall and had come prepared with a deployment plan in hand .
Still , he did not volunteer it .
Only when Bush ordered , “ Don , do it , ” did he acquiesce and send in the troops — a full five days after landfall .
And here I thought Rumsfeld was a nightmare at the Pentagon before reading the Draper piece .

Raw Story
from VoltaireNet Website
A recently proposed but little - noticed Senate bill would allow the federal government to shut down the Internet in times of declared emergency , and enables unprecedented federal oversight of private network administration .
The bill ’s draft states that ,
“ the president may order a cybersecurity emergency and order the limitation or shutdown of Internet traffic ” and would give the government ongoing access to “ all relevant data concerning ( critical infrastructure ) networks without regard to any provision of law , regulation , rule , or policy restricting such access . ”
Authored by Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Republican Olympia Snowe of Maine , the Cybersecurity Act of 2009 seeks to create a Cybersecurity Czar to centralize power now held by the Pentagon , National Security Agency , Department of Commerce and the Department of Homeland Security .
While the White House has not officially endorsed the draft , it did have a hand in its language , according to The Washington Post .
Proponents of the measure stress the need to centralize cybersecurity of the private sector .
“ People say this is a military or intelligence concern , ” says Rockefeller , “ but it is a lot more than that .
It suddenly gets into the realm of traffic lights and rail networks and water and electricity . ”
Snowe added ,
“ America ’s vulnerability to massive cyber- crime , global cyber-espionage and cyber-attacks has emerged as one of the most urgent national security problems facing our country today .
Importantly , this legislation loosely parallels the recommendations in the CSIS [ Center for Strategic and International Studies ] blue - ribbon panel report to President Obama and has been embraced by a number of industry and government thought leaders . ”
Critics decry the broad language , and are watchful for amendments to the bill seeking to refine the provisions .
According to opencongress.com , no amendments to the draft have been submitted .
Organizations like the Center for Democracy and Technology fear if passed in its current form , the proposal leaves too much discretion of just what defines critical infrastructure .
The bill would also impose mandates for designated private networks and systems , including standardized security software , testing , licensing and certification of cyber - security professionals .
“ I ’d be very surprised if it does n’t include communications systems , which are certainly critical infrastructure , ” CDT General Counsel Greg Nojeim told Eweek .
“ The president would decide not only what is critical infrastructure but also what is an emergency . ”
Adds Jennifer Granick , civil liberties director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation ,
What do Charles Freeman and Jane Harman have in common ?
Nothing , apart from the fact that they are both involved in the truly ugly side of the Israel lobby ’s activity in the United States and , for that reason , had their stories dropped by the mainstream media in record time .
Harman ’s story broke on April 19 and was on life support by the 24th .
Freeman ’s story had slightly more legs to it only because his withdrawal from his nomination to head the National Intelligence Council on March 10 was preceded by a three - week barrage of vicious ad hominem attacks from the media and the usual suspects in Congress .
After he resigned , his story was allowed to die , ending as far as the mainstream media was concerned on March 14 with a coup de grace from Republican Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia , who claimed in a Washington Post op - ed that the Israel lobby had nothing to do with his opposition to Freeman ’s appointment .
Wolf has reportedly received $ 72,000 from pro-Israel PACs , more than any other Virginia congressman except Eric Cantor , something that he chose not to mention .
If one were to ask a reasonably well - informed American citizen about either Harman or Freeman , one would most likely draw a blank .
This is because they have been airbrushed out of the collective political consciousness almost as effectively as the pictures of Stalin ’s rivals were removed from group photos in Red Square .
The mainstream media , which is where most Americans still get their news , has trivialized their stories and has no desire to grapple with issues like Israeli espionage and the establishment of a de facto Israeli loyalty test for the holders of high office .
Corruption of the U.S. political system by a small country 5,000 miles away is of no interest to Fox , NBC , CBS , and ABC , not to mention their newsprint counterparts .
It did not have to be so , and if there had been any spine or even a shred of conscience in the media , then all of this might have gone in another direction , leading to a serious inquiry into how a tiny foreign power has managed to create the most powerful lobby in Washington .
When Freeman went down and dared to complain about his treatment , there was considerable noise in the blogosphere suggesting that the Israel lobby had finally overreached itself and would pay the price because everyone would now know just how much it interferes in American politics .
That judgment proved premature , as did the suggestion by some that the victory over Freeman might prove Pyrrhic in nature , leading to future defeats .
Others , including Stephen Walt , were not so sure , noting that the basis for AIPAC ’s power in the media and within the government had not in any way been diminished .
That has proven to be the case .
A complaisant establishment media rolled over on the Harman story only weeks after Freeman .
So much for the Fourth Estate , where the only freedom of the press in evidence is the freedom to run as fast as possible from any story that is critical of Israel and its friends .
The American public should wake up to the fact that the Freeman and Harman stories are serious in their implications , whether or not the media is interested .
Freeman was appointed to head the National Intelligence Council , an essentially non-political position that is responsible for shaping the vitally important National Intelligence Estimates .
He was supremely well qualified for the position and was esteemed for his maverick qualities , which led to the expectation that he would head a team that would challenge assumptions on existing policies in such a way as to make a repeat of the bad intelligence on Iraq unlikely .
But when it was learned that Freeman had been particularly critical of Israeli settlement policies and had observed that the tie to Israel did not exactly serve the U.S. ’ national interests , his appointment was heavily criticized .
To be sure , the critics most often attacked Freeman by misrepresenting his views on China and links to Saudi Arabia , where he had served as ambassador , but everyone in Washington and the media knew that it was really all about Israel .
Bereft of any support from the White House , Freeman was doomed .
Also doomed was any expectation that Washington might benefit from sound intelligence providing a realistic assessment of the threats facing the U.S. , unadorned by the fake analysis dished out by interest groups like AIPAC .
Leaders in the media could have actually enabled a debate about a sound foreign policy that actually works in our national interests , but they chose to walk away instead .
If , as is likely , President Obama has learned his lesson from the Freeman affair and decides that it is better to go along with AIPAC than to resist it , business as usual will continue in Washington , with Israel ’s current crop of right - wing fanatics , headed by Bibi Netanyahu , protected to the last drop of American blood and treasure .
Harman ’s tale is somewhat different , but it also involves the Israel lobby as well as the considerable Israeli espionage effort directed against the United States .
If the leaked accounts of Harman ’s phone conversation with someone acting on behalf of Israeli intelligence are accurate , the congresswoman clearly knew her Israeli intelligence contact well and might have had similar conversations with him or her previously .
She agreed to attempt to influence a reduction in the charges in the trial of accused AIPAC spies Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman .
In return , Harman ’s contact promised to support her bid to become chairman of the House Permanent Committee on Intelligence by pressuring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi through threats to withhold political contributions from Israeli billionaire Haim Saban if Harman was not given the position .
Harman was later spoken of as a possible candidate to become director of central intelligence and , without the FBI wiretap , which became known to Pelosi , she might have obtained either position , or possibly both in succession .
Harman has denied that she did anything wrong , and she has tried to turn the tables by accusing the government of illegally recording her conversation , a red herring introduced by those trying to minimize the significance of the affair .
Make no mistake , Harman was on the receiving end of an intelligence operation .
Her phone conversation was recorded because she was talking to someone who was working with Israeli intelligence , which was the target of the investigation .
Intelligence officers highly prize an agent of influence , which is a well - placed politician or media figure who will do one ’s bidding , and they seek to obtain that cooperation by trading favors that both they and the target know are illegal .
It was illegal for Harman to promise to interfere in a court case , something that her contact clearly was aware of .
It was illegal for the agent of a foreign government to pressure the speaker of the House to promote Harman .
Once such favors are exchanged , the intelligence officer has leverage to demand more because his new agent will cooperate rather than have the illegal details of the relationship revealed .
That is how covert operations are taught at the CIA training center and every other intelligence school in the world .
There should be no uncertainty about what was taking place , even if the mainstream media and Harman ’s colleagues in government do n’t get it .
At last report , Harman is not being investigated , she has not been criticized by anyone in the government or in either party , and she just spoke at the AIPAC convention in Washington .
So much for equal justice under law .
If the Freeman and Harman affairs taken together do not provide convincing proof that Israel and its advocates are no true friends to the United States , then it is difficult to imagine what else can be used to make the case .
It is time to end the special relationship and treat Israel like every other country .
If Israel sends its intelligence officers to America to break the law , they must be caught , exposed , and punished , just as if they were Chinese or Russian .
If they spy on the U.S. and corrupt its politicians , they must pay a price .
It is almost certainly too late to give justice to Chas Freeman or to give Jane Harman the punishment she so richly deserves , but it is time for the United States to send a clear signal that while it is prepared to be a good friend to Israel , it will not stand for any more interference with our politicians and government officials .
On present trends India will pass the UK in the size of its economy in about 10 years ' time .
The world 's largest democracy may even do that a bit earlier if the elections just concluded enable further improvements in the way it is governed – as the financial markets now signal .
And of course the faster the Indian economy grows , the greater the impact on the rest of us .
It wo n't just be Land Rover and Jaguar that will be rescued by an Indian company ; the direct influence of its economic power will go far beyond the odd takeover .
The scale of the Congress Party victory in the election did more than just cheer up the share markets .
It raised the hope within India and abroad that the Indian economy might step up the pace from being a good economic performer to being , well , something markedly better .
For those of us who know and respect India , this is a thrilling possibility .
To see the significance of the election you have to go back to 1991 , when the present prime minister , Manmohan Singh , became finance minister .
He was faced with a catastrophe .
The country had a fiscal deficit of 8.5 per cent of GDP ( almost as large as the UK will run this year ) and the central bank had only a billion dollars of reserves – enough to cover only two weeks ' imports .
In the following years he turned the economy round , partly by cutting public spending but also by tax and regulatory reforms .

The reforms were , by and large , accepted when the rival BJP subsequently took power , and there has been some further consolidation since Manmohan Singh , now as prime minister , returned to office as head of what was a rather weak coalition in 2004 .
It would be wrong to portray the BJP as anti-reforms , for Indian politics are much more complicated than that .
But there is a general perception , and I think this is right , that a Congress - led government , and particularly one led by Manmohan Singh , will be more likely to take the next steps the country needs both to secure its growth path and do a rather better job at spreading the wealth down through to the people currently left behind .
So what needs to be done ?
It would be presumptuous to set out any set of past prescriptions to the country 's vast array of problems and opportunities , but there are some broad things that can sensibly be said .
One is that governance at every level remains a problem .
It would be naïve to think of the prime issue being corruption but it is partly that .
Let me try and explain .
Last year in Bangalore I had one of those eureka moments , when I suddenly understood why corruption was so much more of a barrier to development in India than in China .
I was talking with a group of prominent residents from the business and professional community about the delays and other difficulties in commissioning the new airport .
One of our group had worked in both countries and explained why he found it so much easier to get big infrastructural projects built in China .
In China you had to get the support of the local municipality and that inevitably meant that money in some form or other changed hands .
But then you had a deal .
In India the problem was that no deal was ever final ; you thought you had agreement but then some other blockage emerged and you had to square someone else .
Quite aside from any moral issues – for that was a whole separate argument – the practical effect was that everything took much longer than it needed to – and much longer than in China .
You can defend the Indian system by noting that if a project has democratic consent , that is a sounder basis for operation than the Chinese command and control system .
But democracy can be flawed , as the failure of Tata to commission its new Nano plant near Kolkata has shown .
If poor governance inhibits the building of infrastructure , it also impairs the provision of education .
At the top end , Indian education is excellent and there is huge demand at every level .
One of the most thrilling experiences I have had was seeing nursery schools in Mumbai , in Dharavi , the place now made famous by Slumdog Millionaire .
Beautifully turned - out children eager to learn and learn in English , for that was a path to a better future .
But there are huge gaps at every level , from nursery education to poor quality education at second - tier universities .
It is a huge task and a start has been made , but India does lag behind China in the quality of its education system .
Other reforms that the new government is keen to pursue include further financial liberalisation and increased trade with neighbours .
Indian banks have managed to avoid most of the tank - traps that their counterparts in the developed world have fallen into and deserve a round of applause for that .
But the banking sector remains small and underdeveloped .
Loans as a percentage of GDP are half that of China .
The needs for finance , particularly for infrastructure , are massive and it has been calculated that freeing up the financial sector could add more than 1 percentage point to annual growth in GDP .
But the ultimate test of this new government will be whether it can get the benefits of growth through to the poor .
As Manmohan Singh puts it : " India happens to be a rich country inhabited by very poor people . "
The ultimate purpose of all growth must surely be to improve people 's living standards and life opportunities .
So this growth must come through in a sustainable manner , sustainable in environmental as well as other terms , for it is the poor that suffer most from environmental degradation .
It may be that one of the reasons why Congress has done well in these elections is that the poor , particularly the rural poor , recognise that the new government will seek to make sure that more of the fruits of growth are pushed down towards them .
In the meantime , for the rest of the world , the big point is that the onward march of what will become the world 's third largest economy is secure for a while yet .

As they did in the past with Java and HTML ( just to cite two cases ) , Microsoft has now invested at least 12 months of work to try to fragment the ODF in the IT market : A shame .
I swear I was ready to publish this week a post praising Microsoft for finally released SP2 of Office 2007 with native support for ODF , but unfortunately after the initial tests of various users , what we see is an absurd attempt to mislead consumers ( who payed for the software ) and fragment ODF in the IT industry .
When I use the word fragment , I mean the known tactic of using ‘ creativity ’ during the implementation of a standard to make the implementation only compatible with your software ( people that had seen sites that only work in Internet Explorer already know what I ’m talking about ) .
Looking from outside , the documents appear identical but a most consistent inside look demonstrate that they are completely different , thus fragmenting the uniformity expected as a consequence of a standard adoption .
One of the first articles published about SP2 and for which I call the attention of everyone is from Rob Weir , chair of the OASIS ODF TC ( group that develops the ODF , to which I belong ) .
It is simply scary to see what Office 2007 does with existing ODF spreadsheets .
The technical details are all on Rob ’s blog , but in summary , when opening an ODF spreadsheet ( .ods file ) using Office 2007 , it simply removes all existing formulas without telling anything to the user , leaving only the values in cells ( results of formulas evaluation , previously stored in the document ) .
If a user wants to test the ODF support in Office , and without giving due attention , save an existing spreadsheet , will overwrite the document removing all the formulas ( as if you were writing a table ) .
I saw absurdities in life , but nothing compared to this .
When using Office 2007 to generate a new worksheet , the formulas will be stored in a way that only will be understood by Office 2007 ( or by CleverAge , an MS Office plug - in to support ODF , developed as Open Source and sponsored by Microsoft ) , eliminating the possibility that any other existing application could be used to usefully read the document .
While the first problem simply throw out all the business intelligence inside the spreadsheet ( formulas ) , the second locks in the user on Office 2007 forever ( we have seen this movie before … ) .
The justification that could be used by Microsoft about it , is the lack of spreadsheet formula definition in ODF 1.0/1.1 .
Interesting to note that in ODF 1.2 ( which is developed with the participation of Microsoft ) this problem has been resolved with the creation of OpenFormula ) .
The first comparative table of Rob ’s post , summarizes a test on the same subject that he did a few weeks ago , it is easy to see that even without any spreadsheet formula definition inside ODF 1.1 , interoperability between the tested set of existing applications ( KOffice , OpenOffice , Google Docs , Symphony and Sun ’s plug - in for Office ) really exists on the real world ( except for CleverAge that presented some problems ) .
This means that all other developers are not concerned only to ‘ comply with standard ’s requirements ’ ( conformance ) but also in developing a truly useful and interoperable application to users .
Rob also says that the set of formulas used by these applications ( based on OpenOffice ) was developed based on existing formulas from Excel ( at least ironic , huh ? ) .
I also highlight that the problems presented on OpenOffice when Rob repeated his tests with the new version of the suite , were caused because the developers of OpenOffice 3.0 decided to incorporate ODF 1.2 as default .
ODF 1.2 still under development in OASIS .
No question about what led to this decision , but I ’ve orientated all users of OpenOffice 3.0 that I know , to change the configuration of the office suite to use ODF 1.0/1.1 as the default file format ( in the Options menu of OpenOffice , there is a group called “ load / save ” where it can be done ) .
I admire the efforts of OpenOffice ’s developers to incorporate the ODF 1.2 to their software , but I think it should have been placed as an additional feature , not as its default format ( I ’m using OpenOffice 3.0.1 configured to work with ODF 1.0/1.1 and I ’ve had no interoperability problems at all ) .
I also enjoyed to see the comments that PJ ( Groklaw ) ( I think it was PJ ) made about MSOffice SP2 .
PJ is n’t a developer and therefore created a simple text document and find absurd results too .
PJ also wrote something very interesting , and I agree 100 % :
“ … Dear Microsoft , could you please do something about this ?
It ’s just code , which means it can be fixed .
But your code is proprietary , so we ca n’t fix it .
Only you can .
Like the old song says , could you please put on some speed ?
Others like Google Docs seem to be able to do ODF spreadsheets .
Why ca n’t you ?
No doubt there will be improvements , but when ? … ”
As I do n’t have a computer with Windows and I do n’t have MS Office 2007 to test , I did some tests with SP2 trough the exchange documents with friends who have Office 2007 with SP2 installed and here are my 2 cents for all the tests that are appearing ( and being published every second on the Internet ) :
Microsoft Office 2007 does not support encryption ( password protection ) in ODF documents !
I generated a simple text document ( .odt ) in ODF using OpenOffice and saved it with password protection .
I sent the document ( and password ) to several friends and the result was the same : MS Office cannot open the document because it is password protected ( some of those friends also have installed on their computers other tools that support ODF and on 100 % of those tools it worked ) .
I also asked them to generate a document in Office 2007 with password protection and send me , but they said that when trying to do this , MSOffice presented a warning message saying that you cannot use password protection using the ODF format .
I would really like to find a good technical explanation for this , since the encryption and password protection are fully specified in ODF 1.0/1.1 ( item 17.3 of the specification ) , and they are using existing algorithms , very familiar to any developer .
A comment from Rob in his post ( that not dealt with the encryption ) is able to comment with mastery the problem I found ( and I fully agree with him ) :
“ … I was taught to never assume malice where incompetence would be the simpler explanation .
But the degree of incompetence needed to explain SP2 ’s poor ODF support boggles the mind and leads me to further uncharitable thoughts … ”
It is impressive to see how Microsoft constantly shows disrespect for their customers , partners and the market in general and it is also impressive to see this clearly demonstration of their complete inability to change .
If anyone have more texts about ODF problems found on Service Pack 2 , please put the links on the comments ( we can use this post as a source for research about those problems ) .
Here is my recommendation : Do n’t use Office 2007 with Service Pack 2 for manipulating ODF documents .
If your decision is still using MS Office , install the Sun ’s plug - in , but I really recommend that you search for another solution that natively support ODF documents .
Do n’t loose time ( and money ) with those who disrespect you .
For people who wants to follow the news about ODF in the world , I recommend a daily visit to Planet ODF ( it indexes everything ) .

Should the Lions pass on No. 1 pick ?
There ’s a notion currently making its rounds on the net that the Lions should allow the time to expire on draft day and pass on the No. 1 pick , essentially relieving themselves of the financial burden that comes along with having the top overall selection .
Given how ridiculous the rookie salaries are these days in the NFL and the fact that it ’s a weak draft class , the idea makes sense .
If the Lions allow the Rams , Chiefs or Seahawks to select before they do , then they ’ll be on the hook financially for the No. 2 , No. 3 or No. 4 pick and not the top spot .
But while in theory it makes sense , realistically Detroit could lose more than it gains in the end .
First of all , the Lions have holes all over their roster and they need to address those needs by getting quality players .
And if they do strike gold with those selections , whether they pay now or later , they ’ll eventually have to pay .
To be clearer , if they allow the clock to expire and take Georgia quarterback Matthew Stafford at No. 3 instead of No. 1 and he becomes a Pro Bowler over the next couple years , his next contract is going to be hefty regardless of what he signed his rookie deal for .
So again , whether they pay now or later , they ’ll have to pay if they wind up getting a good player .
And let ’s say the Lions do draft Stafford , considering he plays quarterback ( the highest paid position on the roster ) , then he ’s probably going to become one the highest paid quarterbacks in the league regardless of if they take him at No. 1 or No. 3 ( or No. 2 or No. 4 , etc. ) .
Case in point , the Falcons selected quarterback Matt Ryan with the No. 3 overall pick last year , then signed him to a six - year , $ 72 million contract , which included $ 34.75 million in guarantees .
He became the third highest paid player in the NFL , ranking him behind only Peyton Manning and Ben Roethlisberger .
So if the Lions want Stafford , they ’ll have to pony up regardless whether they wait or not .
And if they truly want him , why would they risk not being able to select him if they let the clock expire ?
It makes little to no sense .
If Detroit is that concerned about saving money , then they should take linebacker Aaron Curry because he would not only address a need , but ‘ backers make significantly less than quarterbacks , regardless of where they ’re taken in the first round .
The Lions should worry less about how much they ’re going to pay a prospect and more about what prospect they ’re going to take .
GM Martin Mayhew has zero room for error after the disastrous 0 - 16 season that the team compiled last year .
( And I know that was n’t Mayhew ’s fault , but unfortunately he has to deal with the mess Matt Millen left behind . )
Forget about letting the time expire – just get the pick right , Martin .
Hospitals and insurance companies said Thursday that President Obama had substantially overstated their promise earlier this week to reduce the growth of health spending .
Mr. Obama invited health industry leaders to the White House on Monday to trumpet their cost - control commitments .
But three days later , confusion swirled in Washington as the companies ’ trade associations raced to tamp down angst among members around the country .
...
Health care leaders who attended the meeting have a different interpretation .
They say they agreed to slow health spending in a more gradual way and did not pledge specific year - by - year cuts .
" There ’s been a lot of misunderstanding that has caused a lot of consternation among our members , " said Richard J. Umbdenstock , the president of the American Hospital Association .
" I ’ve spent the better part of the last three days trying to deal with it . "
First , these groups are showing their true , dishonest colors .
AHIP , the main insurance industry lobby group , sent out this press release from their fake grassroots campaign after the announcement :
By reducing the rate of growth in health care spending by 1.5 % each year , the nation can achieve a savings of $ 2 trillion over the next decade .
This effort will have a direct effect on the budgets of individuals and families and will also go a long way in ensuring that every American have access to affordable , high - quality health care .
Stay tuned for more information on this important initiative in the weeks and months ahead .
Sounds like they made a commitment , right ?
Well , that commitment is now pretty soft ( emphasis on the softness added ) :
He and other health care executives said they had agreed to squeeze health spending so the annual rate of growth would eventually be 1.5 percentage points lower .
...
One of the lobbyists , Karen M. Ignagni , president of America ’s Health Insurance Plans , said the savings would " ramp up " gradually as the growth of health spending slowed .
David H. Nexon , senior executive vice president of the Advanced Medical Technology Association , a trade group for makers of medical devices , said " there was no specific understanding " of when the lower growth rate would be achieved .
" It ’s a target over a 10 - year period , " Mr. Nexon said .
So we 've gone from commitments to eventualities , targets , and non-specific understandings .
This just proves what the American people have known all along :
You can't trust the insurance industry with health care reform .
Why have these commitments gone soft ?
It 's about profits .
Every dollar of health care " waste " in the system , every dollar that goes somewhere other than to your health , that 's a dollar more in the pockets of a rich hospital administrator or insurance industry CEO .
For health care costs to come down , somebody 's profits have to come down as well .
Now , in a good reform plan , every player in the system would be squeezed a little bit to help alleviate the crushing cost on the patient .
Doctors , hospitals , and other providers would charge a bit less for care and be paid based on quality , not quantity .
Drug and medical device makers would be forced to sell their products at a discount in volume .
And the insurance industry would trim overhead and profits to keep costs in line .
Then , employers and government would pitch in to cover all individuals .
It would be a system of shared responsibility .
Clearly , the insurance industry , hospitals , and drug makers are n't interested in shared responsibility .
They do n't want to be squeezed a bit .
The want to protect their profits so much that they show their two - faced nature : Standing next to the President of the United States , promising responsibility , and then backpeddling as fast as they can four days later .
That 's why we need to make them do it .
Voluntary agreements are not enough .
We need regulation and we need real cost control , and that means a public health insurance option that will force these awful companies to earn their keep through stiff competition , something they 've avoided for far too long .
They 're liars .
They 're cheats .
They 're greedy .
They 're untrustworthy .
They can not be trusted to come up with a health care reform plan that works for you and me .
We must make them do it .

Scala ’s command - line interpreter ( its REPL ) is highly useful , but if you ’re accustomed to readline , you ’ll find it lacking and frustrating .
Scala 2.8 is enhancing the REPL , but in the meantime , here ’s a handy trick .
Instead of typing
$ scala
try this , instead :
$ rlwrap scala - Xnojline
By disabling JLine and invoking Scala via rlwrap , you get full readline capabilities in the Scala REPL .
On Windows , you can install the Cygwin version of rlwrap ; it seems to work just fine in my tests .
Thanks to Tony Morris for posting this tip to the scala - user mailing list .
From HaskellWiki
Purpose and Goals
The purpose of Boston Haskell is to provide a regular forum in which area people interested in Haskell can get together , meet each other , share skills , and grow the community
Join the meetup group for even more entertainment !
In particular , it is the most reliable source for meeting announcements and is where meeting - related polls ( time , location , topics , etc. ) are sent .
Next Meeting
We usually meet at thoughtbot .
Other Events
Once a year or so , we try to organize a hackathon , HacBOS .
Meeting Format
The Haskell Users ' Group is not a forum for academic talks .
The Boston area already provides plenty of opportunities for academics to give talks .
The Haskell Users ' Group is a forum for informal interactions and a place where you can show us the code .
The ideal meeting will include two presentations and a break :
A presentation of code that even a beginner will appreciate
A break ( which may also include Lightning Talks or other advertisements of interest )
A presentation of code that will make at least some experts say Ooh ! and Aah !
Demos are also encouraged , but we want to see at least a little bit of code , please .
Planned schedule
Based on feedback fron the June 2009 meeting , we 've switched to a monthly schedule .
We aim for a meeting on the third Wednesday of every month .
Call for volunteers
We need volunteers
To present
To twist other people 's arms to present
To provide refreshments at meetings
To help with general organizational matters ( advertising meetings , etc. ) .
If you want to volunteer , please join the BostonHaskell mailing list and let us know what you 're volunteering to do !
At some point we may be lucky enough to have a surplus of potential presenters .
In that case we may need volunteers for a selection committee .
A reasonable structure might be to have a committee of three who serve staggered six - month terms .
If we can't find enough presenters , those same people could try to find some .
In both cases people would be volunteering to help manage the program for three meetings .

OPINION : Why is nobody ever held accountable in Ireland ?
Why do we just go on accepting that we ’re being fobbed off ?
Why are we apparently prepared for ever and a day to accept mediocrity , writes BRENDAN LANDERS
ONE MORNING in 1999 , when I was living in Canada , I picked up my newspaper and there on the front page was a picture of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police raiding a house and taking away boxes of files .
The house was the home of the premier of British Columbia , a province on the Pacific coast .
The Mounties were investigating charges that the premier , Glenn Clark , had accepted free renovations to his home in return for the granting of a casino licence .
Clark was forced from office but was later exonerated of all charges .
I went to work , where the talk around the water cooler was all about the raid .
Remarkable to me the conversation revolved around the likelihood of Clarke ’s guilt or innocence and not one of my Canadian colleagues expressed an iota of surprise that the Mounties had raided the premier ’s house .
There was another Irish man working in the building and he joined in the chat .
The moment our eyes met we each knew what the other was thinking : that raid would never happen in Ireland .
My favourite TV show is Law and Order , an American series in which the first half - hour of drama depicts the men and women of the NYPD investigating a crime and charging a suspect and the second half portrays the district attorney ’s prosecution of the case .
I love those hard - nosed New York cops with their rugged individualism , their sense of duty and the carefully nurtured creative tension that dominates their relationship with figures of authority .
I savour how they relish taking on City Hall and bringing down the miscreant high and mighty .
Why ca n’t Irish cops be like that ?
Why do n’t our gardaí display the odd streak of independence and go after a big shot or two ?
I love the steely grit of Law and Order ’s Irish - American prosecutor Jack McCoy and the twinkle he gets in his eye when he sends another corrupt politician or bureaucrat to the Big House .
Where , I wonder , are the Irish equivalents of the likes of Jack McCoy – on the telly or in real life ?
Why are n’t our halls of justice teeming with righteous state attorneys who live to line their walls with the trophy heads of dodgy politicians , bent bank - board members , bribery - prone property developers and conspiratorial bishops ?
Why is it that , no matter how egregious or diabolical the behaviour of the great and good of Irish society , they are never brought to book and hardly anybody seems to really care ?
The attitude of the Irish citizen to the powers - that - be is bizarrely supine .
For a nation with a reputation for rebelliousness we ’re an extremely docile bunch .
This is a source of much frustration for many of us who have lived elsewhere and observed more assertive notions of citizenship .
It ’s getting so bad that we ’ll soon need a 12 - step programme for recovering returnees to rehabilitate us towards acceptance of the national culture of inertia .
We struggle to reconcile our sense of fairness with this apathy .
We have , however , learned to keep our mouths shut about it because , when on occasion we have given voice to our disquiet , we have met with one of three responses , none of them very positive .
The affable try to pacify us with the ubiquitous phrase : “ Ah , sure , this is Ireland . ”
The defensive ones go hostile and rebuff us with the well - worn words : “ If you do n’t like it here why do n’t you feck off back where you came from . ”
And the vast majority blanks us out and gives us the silent treatment .
Many moons ago , when I was in first year in secondary school and corporal punishment was still in vogue , I wrote a letter to the Irish Press to complain that a teacher had slapped a boy in my class for no apparent reason .
I was n’t complaining about the use of corporal punishment , mind , I was giving out about its application in this instance .
The more emotive sections of my epistle were scalped out and what I regarded as a relatively innocuous version of my diatribe was published .
Nonetheless , a major scandal ensued .
The head brother initiated an inquiry , there was talk of my expulsion and my parents were up and down to the school pleading for mercy .
The upshot was that I was demoted from the A stream down to D. Demotion was no great hardship for me because as far as I was concerned I met a far better class of person down in D .
What perplexed me was that , during the entire hullabaloo , there was precious little said about the substance of my charge that the teacher had hit the boy in the wrong , which was , of course , to my eyes the nub of the issue .
That evasion constantly finds echoes in the silence that greets my efforts to initiate conversation about certain aspects of the Irish national psyche .
The only time that I can recall the Irish people becoming so outraged that they took to the streets en masse in hot anger was in 1972 when British paratroopers murdered 14 civil rights marchers in Derry .
This so incensed us that we burned down the British embassy .
Can we only get mad at the Brits , I wonder ?
Is our sense of national identity so skewed that we think it ’s somehow all right for our own people to shaft us ?
It ’s not as if , God knows , we do n’t have just cause for indignation , especially nowadays as we gaze forlornly at the terrible consequences of our long silence .
Why do n’t we burn down the Department of Education headquarters when our children sit in rat - infested schools or freeze their little arses off in prefabs that have been temporary for decades ?
Why do n’t we burn down Hawkins House when our parents or grandparents live out their penultimate days in squalor on trolleys in hospital corridors ?
Why do n’t we burn down the Archbishop ’s Palace when our clergy abuse our children and the bishops protect the evil - doers ?
Why do n’t we burn down Leinster House when our Government squanders our wealth , impoverishes the country , plies its own members with money and privilege and then defies the wishes of the people and clings on to power without a real mandate ?
I ’m not advocating riot or arson ( at least I do n’t think I am ) but , gosh , some righteous indignation is called for .
So what will we do ?
We ’ll have an election and resort to the same old tribal shenanigans in which we ’ve been indulging ourselves since the foundation of the State .
It ’s like an ancient family feud that eclipses all other matters and has been carried from one generation to the next until the origin of the disagreement has become utterly irrelevant .
At a time when the nation is in dire need of leaders who can think outside of their own little boxes , all we get is the same tired old platitudes and rehashed rhetoric .
We ’ll vote for Fine Gael and Labour and they ’ll go into government for a few years and they ’ll tinker with the economy and maybe they ’ll balance the books .
Meanwhile , Fianna Fáil will regroup and make a comeback , and this mad carnival will go on and on and on like some medieval Celtic Twilight Groundhog Day .
This is nonsense .
Are we mad or what ?
Brendan Landers is a freelance writer
David Geffen is , pretty loudly , trying his darndest to acquire the New York Times , which has been ( just as loudly ) struggling as of late .
This , of course , has caused the journalists , sanitation staff , and execs to all freak the hell out about whether or not they ’ll still have jobs , coffee , Formula 401 , and the like .
Turns out he ’s got a really interesting idea about what the grey lady should be : a non-profit .
The Geffen sources NEWSWEEK spoke to are knowledgeable about his investment decisions and specifically about his overture to acquire a Times stake , but they declined to be identified .
“ The New York Times is a very special institution , ” said one of the persons .
“ It ’s essential to be preserved .
And David believes the correct model to preserve it is nonprofit . ”
…
The Geffen sources told NEWSWEEK that he envisions himself as the next Nelson Poynter , the late proprietor of the St. Petersburg Times and a legend in journalistic circles for his fierce independence .
The Florida newspaper ( where this reporter began his career ) is the widely recognized prototype of the nonprofit structure that is now generating growing interest in some quarters of an industry facing an existential crisis …
One of the nation ’s great daily reports , it snared two Pulitzer Prizes last month .
Notice I ’m not snarking on this , and I sha n’t ( in spite of Geffen ’s responsibility for popularizing The Eagles , a blight on the cultural landscape for which I have BARELY forgiven him ) .
Why no snark ?
I actually think this may be a seriously awesome idea .
The newspapers all over the country are hemorrhaging money anyway .
The nonprofit structure not only worked at the St. Petersburg Times , the freedom it allots does great things for PBS .
Imagine a news industry that owed nothing to advertisers .
It sounds like it would be a new kind of independent journalism , and one desperately needed in this Era of the Punditocracy / Blogosphere .
Of course , now we ’ll have to withstand the inevitable fund drives , but , hey , that ’s what fish markets were made for , right ?
In recent years the communion wafer has been made available in a variety of forms and soon it will become even more accessible with the advent of the " host in the post " .

Although the pre-consecrated wafer is free , there will be a charge for postage and packing .
The coolest star - like object ever found outside the solar system has been spotted around 40 light years away from Earth .
Professor Christopher Tinney of the University of New South Wales and colleagues will report their discovery of a new brown dwarf in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
" It 's certainly one of the coolest objects ever found , " he said .
Unlike Sun - like stars , brown dwarfs are too low in mass to burn nuclear fuel .
So in the world of stars , they are very cold , dim and hard to study .
Professor Tinney and colleagues struck it lucky while on a wider search for the coolest and dimmest bodies in the local galactic neighbourhood .
Using a small telescope in Hawaii , they noticed the brown dwarf tracking across the sky along with a well - known red dwarf by the name of Wolf 940 .
Red dwarfs are brighter than brown dwarfs , being big enough to burn nuclear fuel , albeit much more slowly than fully - fledged stars .
Professor Tinney and colleagues dubbed the brown dwarf Wolf 940B , after the red dwarf it orbits .
They believe the Jupiter - sized Wolf 940B formed like a star with an infrared spectrum strikingly similar to our solar system 's biggest planet .
But the brown dwarf is much denser being 20 to 30 times heavier , with a higher temperature of 300°C .
Professor Tinney says it is normally quite hard to measure the distances of brown dwarfs because they are so dim .
But in this case , the researchers were able to immediately work out the distance of Wolf 940B because they knew the distance of the red dwarf it was orbiting .
Extrasolar planets
Finding low mass objects like Wolf 940B is interesting to scientists because it sheds light on other cool - temperature low - mass objects like extrasolar planets .
" At the Anglo - Australian Observatory we have found 30 planets orbiting other stars , but we do n't actually see the planet itself .
We do n't see what its atmosphere looks like , " he said .
" Looking at systems like this gives us hints as to what the atmospheres of extrasolar planets might look like . "
The researchers now hope to point a much bigger telescope at Wolf 940B to get more details on its atmosphere , which can be used to help build more reliable models .
The team used the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope and Gemini-North Telescope on Mauna Kea , Hawaii .
Telescopes in Chile , the Canary Islands , Hawaii and the NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope have confirmed the findings .

The crew that brought you " Disco to Breakers " last year - a float complete with svelte go - go dancers and " a mind - boggling 27 kegs of beer " - is at it again for this year 's incarnation of the annual footrace and rollicking street party known as Bay to Breakers .
There 's just one problem .
This time , their plans are against the rules - rules that some say could help end the race as we know it .
The group , including three guys dubbed " The Godfathers , " said their float Sunday is going for a " college spring break " theme and promises that " beer and mixes will be flowing , " according to their posting on a social networking site .
They also said they plan to merge their float into the revelry more than a dozen blocks from the starting line .
Those plans run afoul of new regulations city leaders hammered out in February for this year 's event that ban kegs and glass bottles and require floats to only enter the course at the starting line behind all racers .
The changes came after a chorus of complaints last year about post - race debris , floats hampering runners and rampant public urination .
How revelers proceed under the new rules , and how race organizers and authorities handle the situation in the era of rapid organizing through wireless messaging , has city officials , pro-party groups and residents alike bracing to see what emerges from the 98th running of the legendary race .
" This is a pivotal year , " said Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi , whose district includes much of the race route .
" We 're trying to perform the fine pirouette of addressing any negative consequences from previous years while making sure we do n't thwart the fun and spirit of the Bay to Breakers . "
Race organizers hope to maintain the event 's signature whimsy but dial back the booze .
" We embrace the fun , the color , the atmosphere , but we need to have an event that 's safe and respectful to the city , " said Angela Fang , who manages the race for international sports and entertainment conglomerate AEG .
" We had to make some adjustments to keep this event alive . "
Tempering the fun
Critics say the restrictions are part of a " death - of - fun " trend in a city that has canceled Halloween in the Castro and banned alcohol at the Haight - Ashbury Street Fair .
" They are just going to continue to crack down on this thing ... until they 've homogenized it into a footrace , " said Ed Sharpless , one of the organizers behind the grassroots group Citizens for the Preservation of Bay2 Breakers .
The event began in 1912 as a cross-city race to the ocean .
It has morphed into a uniquely San Franciscan amalgam - serious fun and serious race - with everything from elite athletes to costumed families to naked seniors to partiers with kegs in shopping carts .
Fang and police officials maintain they do n't want to stop the party , just temper it .
" It is on television because it 's really fun , " said police Lt. Nicole Greely , who oversees security for the event .
" It 's just in the last couple of years , it got unsafe .
...
If we can just bring it back to the way it was four or five years ago , we 'll be fine . "
Registration is on pace to meet last year 's total of 33,000 paid participants .
The problem was , about twice that showed up , not counting spectators .
So many unpaid participants strained resources like portable toilets .
AEG strives to break even on the race , but last year it lost money while paying $ 350,000 just for city services , Fang said .
Race organizers had initially proposed banning all alcohol and floats after complaints surfaced of drunken participants trashing neighborhoods around Alamo Square and the Panhandle , including people urinating on houses , cars and around a playground with children on it .
After an outcry from Sharpless ' group , Mayor Gavin Newsom and Mirkarimi coaxed a compromise .
Testing new rules
Kegs and glass bottles are banned .
Float owners have to register , and floats can only enter the course at the starting line behind racers and walkers .
Floats can't be motorized or be used to transport or store alcohol .
Race organizers , with police help , will search and remove kegs and glass bottles from floats and participants .
Officials said they do n't intend to stop drinking on the 7.5 - mile course , but a police statement Wednesday said , " There will be zero tolerance for public drunkenness and public urination . "
Sharpless ' group backs the glass - bottle ban and has urged participants to register , not urinate in public or litter .
But it sees the keg and float crackdowns as misguided .
" They have all of these rules , but what are you going to do on race day , with people coming from every side , every angle , to get on this race course ? "
Sharpless said .
" Is this going to be a police state on Sunday ?
I do n't know . "
Greely said there will be about 260 officers on hand , the same as in years past , including one at every side street along the course to control traffic and prevent floats from entering .
" It will be very easy to stop them , " Greely said .
Race organizers say the keg ban is needed to cut the copious amount of readily available alcohol that they say fuels bad behavior .
Pro-partiers said it will have the opposite effect , driving people to get drunk quicker on liquor .
" People are going to start wearing CamelBaks with hard alcohol , " Sharpless said .
His group has set up text messaging and Twitter feeds to " stay connected and monitor injustice " during the race , and is urging participants to e-mail the group with photos if they see " long lines at Porta Pottis or floats being hassled by officials . "
Toilets are going to be more strategically placed in residential areas , with at least 705 along the course and 183 , plus two six - man urinals , at the after - party at the Polo Field in Golden Gate Park .
Last year , there were 453 along the course and 225 at the party , race organizers said .
How that stacks up for the likes of the " Disco to Breakers " crew , who declined to comment , remains to be seen .
" We guzzled down a mind - boggling 27 kegs of beer , two kegs of vodka cran , and a keg of JD and Coke last year ! " the group said in a Facebook posting that was changed after The Chronicle contacted them .
" This year , well , enough said ... "

Das Landgericht München 1 hat gestern die Klage der Rechtsanwältin Katja Günther auf Fortführung der Kontoverbindung bei der Stadtsparkasse München abgelehnt und auch die einstweilige Verfügung aufgehoben , das Konto bis zum rechtskräftigen Urteil weiter zu führen ( Aktenzeichen 28 O 398/09 ) .
„ Wir begrüßen es sehr , dass sich das Gericht für unsere Auffassung entschieden hat und wir endlich diese belastende Kontobeziehung auflösen dürfen , die dazu missbraucht wurde , ahnungslose Internetnutzer zu prellen und ihnen erhebliche Geldbeträge abzunötigen “ , so Harald Strötgen , Vorstandsvorsitzender der Stadtsparkasse München .
Leider hätten sich viele Betroffene einschüchtern lassen und die Mahnungen der Rechtsanwältin Günther beglichen , um sich weiteren Ärger zu ersparen .
Verschiedene Medien berichteten bereits vom Geschäftsgebaren der Rechtsanwältin , die bei der Stadtsparkasse München ein so genanntes Anderkonto , also ein Konto für Ansprüche Dritter , geführt hat .
Günther trieb mit Mahnungen Geldbeträge für verschiedene Anbieter von angeblich im Internet zustande gekommenen Verträgen für „ Nutzlos - Inhalte “ im Web ein .
Für die Stadtsparkasse München war das Geschäftsgebaren der Rechtsanwältin bei der Kontoeröffnung in keiner Weise ersichtlich gewesen .
Nach Hinweisen von Betroffenen und Geprellten hat die Stadtsparkasse die Konten sofort gekündigt , um den Missbrauch der Konten zur Schädigung weiterer Internetnutzer zu verhindern .
Gegen die Kontokündigung erwirkte die Anwältin zwei gerichtliche Verfügungen , durch die die Stadtsparkasse München gezwungen wurde , die Konten mehrere Monate aufrecht zu erhalten .
Diese Verfügungen wurden nunmehr aufgehoben und die Klage der Anwältin abgewiesen .

( Reuters ) - U.S. auto suppliers , who negotiated federal loans earlier this year , plan to ask the Obama administration ’s auto task force this week for $ 8 - $ 10 billion in loan guarantees , Bloomberg reported on Tuesday .
Industry trade groups plan to request the U.S. Treasury to back at least a part of loans for auto suppliers from banks to reduce risk and increase lending , the news agency said , citing Neil De Koker , president of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association ( OESA ) .
The banks may be part of a group of lenders who could choose the suppliers to receive loans , De Koker was cited by the news agency as saying .
Suppliers will need loans to start producing parts for General Motors and Chrysler when the automakers resume manufacturing , De Koker was cited as saying in the report .
“ We have very good companies that ca n’t get financing , ” Bloomberg quoted De Koker as saying .
“ It ’s essential to provide support to suppliers in order to ensure that the money already spent on GM and Chrysler does n’t go to waste . ”
The OESA and the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association will meet with the auto task force on Wednesday , and U.S. House and Senate members later in the week , according to the report .
U.S. posts ' highly confidential ' list of nuke sites on Web
WASHINGTON —
The government accidentally posted on the Internet a list of government and civilian nuclear facilities and their activities in the United States , but a U.S. official said today the posting included no information that compromised national security .
The 266 - page document was published on May 6 as a transmission from President Barack Obama to the U.S. Congress .
According to the document , the list was required by law and will be provided to the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Some of the pages are marked “ highly confidential safeguards sensitive . ”
While there is security at the facilities , the list could presumably be useful for terrorists or anyone else who would like to harm the United States .
An Energy Department official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the situation publicly , said none of the sites are directly part of the government ’s nuclear weapons infrastructure .
Included in the report , however , are details on a storage facility for highly enriched uranium at the Y - 12 complex at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee and some sites at the Energy Department ’s Hanford nuclear site in Washington state , this official acknowledged .
The publication of the list was first reported in an online secrecy newsletter Monday .
The document was posted on the Government Printing Office Web site , and has since been removed .
The document includes both government and civilian nuclear facilities , all of which have various levels of security , including details and location of nation ’s 103 commercial nuclear power reactors , information readily available from various sources .
The document details the location of the nuclear sites and what is being done there .
For instance , there are nuclear reactors at the Westinghouse Electric Company in Pittsburgh , Pa .
This facility is currently working on research into what happens when there are accidents with the nuclear reactors .
The project started in 2006 and is expected to end in 2012 , according to the document .
Damien LaVera , a spokesman for the National Nuclear Security Administration , said Wednesday the document is part of an agreement on nuclear material inspection under the IAEA ’s nuclear nonproliferation effort .
“ While we would have preferred it not be released , the Departments of Energy , Defense , and Commerce and the NRC all thoroughly reviewed it to ensure that no information of direct national security significance would be compromised , ” LaVera said in a statement .
There are “ zero ” national security implications to the publication of this document , said Steven Aftergood , director of the Federation of American Government ’s Project on Government Secrecy .
Aftergood found the document on the GPO Web site and highlighted it in his online bulletin .
“ I regret that some people are painting it as a roadmap for terrorists because that ’s not what it is , ” Aftergood said .
“ This is not a disclosure of sensitive nuclear technologies or of facility security procedures .
It is simply a listing of the numerous nuclear research sites and the programs that are under way , ” Aftergood said .
“ And so it poses no security threat whatsoever . ”

Japan wants the IWC to permit whaling in some coastal communities Moves to make a peace deal between pro and anti-whaling nations have stalled , with no chance of agreement this year .
Countries have been talking for nearly a year in an attempt to hammer out an accord by this year 's International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) meeting .
But a draft report seen by BBC News admits the process has " fallen short " .
A source close to the talks blamed Japan , saying it had not offered big enough cuts in its Antarctic hunt , conducted in the name of research .
Earlier meetings had raised the possibility that Japan might countenance annual reductions in its catch over the next five years , perhaps down to zero .
However , the source said that at a meeting held last month in San Francisco , Japan had offered to cut the haul to 650 minke whales per year , only 29 fewer than were caught last season .
This , the source said , " killed any prospect of agreement in Madeira " - the location for this year 's IWC meeting , which takes place next month .
In return for downscaling its annual scientific hunt , Japan has been seeking a small annual quota for four coastal communities which , it says , have whaling as an important part of their cultural background .
It should not come as a surprise that it has thus far not been possible to secure agreement
Report seen by the BBC on IWC working group ' peace talks '
This has drawn the ire of many environment groups , which say it would effectively contravene the 1982 global moratorium on commercial whaling .
The working group that has been discussing the proposed deal will ask the IWC 's scientific committee to investigate how quotas for such " small - type coastal whaling " might be regulated .
Japan is seeking a quota of 150 minke whales per year .
' Right spirit ' Informal discussions on the " peace process " started two years ago , and the formal process was instigated at last year 's IWC meeting in Santiago .
THE LEGALITIES OF WHALING
Under the global moratorium on commercial whaling , hunting is conducted in three ways : Objection - A country formally objects to the IWC moratorium , declaring itself exempt .
Example : Norway Scientific - A nation issues unilateral ' scientific permits ' ; any IWC member can do this .
Example : Japan Aboriginal - IWC grants permits to indigenous groups for subsistence food .
Example : Alaskan Inupiat Led by the US chairman , William Hogarth , the IWC established a small working group of countries to pursue discussions over the year .
The idea was to find a " package " of reforms that all sides could live with .
Its report is due for publication on 18 May .
The draft seen by BBC News says that given the complexities and the sensitivities , " it should not come as a surprise that it has thus far not been possible to secure agreement " on the key issues - scientific hunting , small - type coastal whaling and whale sanctuaries .
But , it says , " significant concrete results " have emerged from the process , citing " the greatly improved atmosphere and the spirit of respectful dialogue " .
' Nothing special ' Conservation groups have been divided on the merits of the process .
Some are opposed to any deal that would allow commercial hunting , on however limited a scale .
Iceland and Norway recently began exporting whale meat for sale in Japan
They are also concerned that other countries may seek to engage in small - type coastal whaling if the category were established .
A South Korean newspaper recently reported that the Seoul government would pursue such a request .
Other conservation groups have backed the process as something that could reduce the overall annual catch - now numbering about 2,000 - of species under the IWC 's jurisdiction .
The working group 's report suggests the process should continue for a further year , a notion that appears to command support in Washington and Tokyo .
Last month , a meeting of 32 IWC member nations from the " pro-sustainable use " bloc , held in Tokyo , agreed that the peace process should have their backing But , they declared , whales should not be placed in a special category of animals exempt from " sustainable use " .
They welcomed the recent trading of whale meat between Iceland , Norway and Japan , and rejected the creation of whale sanctuaries - all of which place them at odds with the aims of anti-whaling countries .
The BBC 's source suggested these nations might feel the peace process was not worthwhile , if Japan was not going to offer larger reductions in the annual Antarctic catch .
For an agreement to happen , the source suggested , " another level of the Japanese government " would have to be involved , rather than the Fisheries Agency which , critics say , benefits politically from the current situation .
The Japanese government is likely to give its formal reaction after the report 's publication .

Gordon Brown 's authority as Prime Minister was dealt a severe blow today , as Communities Secretary Hazel Blears quit the Cabinet on the eve of crucial European and local elections .
Conservative leader David Cameron said the fourth ministerial resignation in two days showed the Prime Minister had lost command of a Government which was " collapsing before our eyes " , while Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg told MPs : " Labour is finished . "
But Mr Brown rejected opposition calls for an immediate General Election , insisting he was focusing on cleaning up the parliamentary expenses system and helping Britain through the recession .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
However , he ducked Mr Cameron 's challenge to say whether Alistair Darling - tipped for the chop in the reshuffle expected within the next few days - would still be in the Treasury next week .
In a letter to Mr Brown confirming her resignation , Ms Blears said she was proud of her service to the Government over the past eight years and would " work tirelessly to see Labour elected at the next General Election " .
But she pointedly offered none of the usual expressions of support for the Prime Minister or his policies .
In response , Mr Brown praised the Salford MP 's achievements as a minister and said he hoped she would return to Government in the future .
Downing Street said Ms Blears , who told the PM she was going in a face - to - face meeting today , would be replaced as Communities Secretary " very shortly " .
Meanwhile , rumours swept Westminster of an email campaign by rebel Labour MPs seeking backbench signatures for a letter urging Mr Brown to stand down as leader , which could be delivered on Monday if the party receives the expected drubbing in tomorrow 's elections .
One former minister said there was " huge " desire in the party for a change of leadership , but MPs were waiting to see whether a " heavyweight " challenger would come forward .

Another backbencher suggested there could be an impromptu vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister when the Parliamentary Labour Party meets on Monday .
And senior backbencher Barry Sheerman warned Mr Brown was " in trouble " if he did not react swiftly to widespread disillusionment in the PLP .
The Guardian website said some Labour rebels believe they can persuade up to 80 MPs to sign a demand for his resignation .
Earlier reports said thy had drawn up a timetable for his removal by the first week of July .
But several key allies this afternoon stepped forward with unequivocal support for the Prime Minister , which some commentators said should give him a little breathing space .
The BBC reported that it had seen a copy of the letter but its political correspondent Iain Watson said he understood some backbenchers would be happy to sign any anti-Brown letter , but others who have criticised the PM would refuse to sign because they believed bringing forward a general election would be " catastrophic " .
Ms Blears ' resignation came less than two hours before Prime Minister 's Questions in the House of Commons and followed announcements yesterday from Home Secretary Jacqui Smith , children 's minister Beverley Hughes and Cabinet Office minister Tom Watson that they would leave Government at the reshuffle .
In a statement , Ms Blears said she wanted to return to grassroots activism , adding : " I never sought high office for the sake of it , or for what I can gain , but for what I can achieve for the people I represent and serve . "
In a comment seen by some as an indication she believes the Brown administration has lost touch with voters , she said she wanted to " help the Labour Party to reconnect with the British people " .
A former party chairman and one of the most prominent Cabinet Blairites , Ms Blears had come under increasing pressure over her expenses after Mr Brown said it was " totally unacceptable " for her to avoid paying capital gains tax on the sale of a property for which she had claimed the parliamentary second homes allowance .
Some saw the PM 's comment - which came after she repaid more than £ 13,000 to HM Revenue and Customs - as revenge for her earlier mockery of his appearance on YouTube .
In a stormy PMQs , Mr Cameron told Mr Brown the decision of the minister responsible for local government to step down the day before council elections was " a direct challenge to his authority " .
Britain now had " a dysfunctional Cabinet , a dysfunctional Government , led by a Prime Minister who can't give a lead " and needed an immediate General Election , the Tory leader said .
And Mr Clegg told MPs : " We can now see the Government is in total meltdown .
The Prime Minister is thrashing around , fighting for his own political survival .
" The country does n't have a Government , it has a void .
Labour is finished .
The only choice now is between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats . "
The Prime Minister sought to brush off the attacks , paying tribute to both Ms Blears and Ms Smith and accusing the Tory leader of ducking policy issues .
" At a time like this the House should come together to acknowledge contributions that have been made in the public interest , " he said .
" We have got two jobs of work to do .
One is to clean up the expenses system , where I think everyone in this House except ( Mr Cameron ) agrees that we have got to take action now to clean up the system .
The other is the recession . "
Speaking after PMQs , Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said Mr Brown and the whole Government faced " a challenge ... to keep our nerve at a time when we have got to go through a genuine crisis in our politics " .
Cabinet ministers Andy Burnham and Hilary Benn also took to the airwaves to insist Mr Brown should remain as Prime Minister .
And Jim Sheridan , chairman of Westminster 's group of Scottish Labour MPs , called for " cool heads " , telling the BBC : " This party has to stick together , we need discipline , and I think Gordon is the man to instil that discipline in people . "
But the normally loyal Mr Sheerman warned : " I think that , if the Prime Minister does n't realise that , across the party , there is a disillusionment with the way the parliamentary party has been consulted , treated and valued , he is heading for trouble .
" If you lose your base of support , and if even the Cabinet starts to feel unhappy with the leadership of the Prime Minister , then that is one indication of unhappiness and destabilises a regime .
" If you do that with a broader group of colleagues in the parliamentary party , right across the political spectrum , then you are really in trouble and you 've got to do something fast before it gets unstoppable . "
Former home secretary John Reid tonight issued a statement through his office insisting that he would not be returning to government .
However his office refused to comment on a report that Mr Reid had turned down an offer of his old job at a meeting last night with Mr Brown .
The brief statement said only : " John Reid will not be returning to government .
Any reports to the contrary are untrue . "
Meanwhile Health Secretary Alan Johnson , who is seen as Mr Brown 's most likely successor , said the Prime Minister was still the best man for the job .
" He is doing the job and there is absolutely no - one who could do the job better , " he told Sky News .
Asked if he could personally do a better job than Mr Brown , Mr Johnson replied : " No " .

" Everybody knows him to be a good dude .
He got a drug problem , " he said yesterday afternoon from his home on Wishart Street near Howard , a few blocks from where Jose Carrasquillo was attacked and arrested .
" If he was n't messed up , he never would have done it .
You ca n't only blame it on him . "
Rep . Alan Grayson asks Inspector General Coleman of the Federal Reserve some very basic questions of about various Fed programs and activities and gets nowhere .
And the worse is that the IG is n’t stonewalling , but instead is clearly completely clueless .
Watching the video , you get the impression that Coleman ca n’t name a program beyond the TALF .
But there is a possibly more important issue at stake .
The interview is with the Inspector General of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors .
The programs are actually at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
For reasons I cannot fathom , the Board of Governors is subject to Freedom of Information Act requests , while the Fed of New York has been able to rebuff them .
So I take Coleman ’s inability to answer key questions to be a feature , not a bug .
The Fed of New York probably can answer Congressional questions , is taking care to limit what it conveys to the Board so as to keep the information from Congress and the public .
Note in the questioning the emphasis on “ high level reviews ” .
Eeek !
Please do n't create a wrapper script / cmd when you do n't need to .
Go into your Registry or your File Type dialog box in Windows , and redefine the Perl default action to say :
" C:\path-to- perl-folders\perl.exe " " % 1 " %*
This will cause double - clicking the .
PL to launch perl.exe with the name of the double - clicked file ( %1 ) .
The %* stuff ( passing any filename arguments to the Perl script ) is trickier .
Go into the Registry again ( really , it 's not as scary as people think ) and find / create a " shellex " key under the Perl class , and then create a sub - key called " DropHandler " with a default string value of " {86C86720-42A0-1069 -A2E8-08002B30309D} " ( at least , that 's my DropHandler in the US version of Windows XP ) .
This allows .pl files ( actually , anything associated with the Perl class ) to have a drop handler that tells Explorer what to do when you drop file (s ) on the .pl script .
In this case , it just means " run the Perl script with the dropped file (s ) as arguments " .
Hmmm , I do n't think I explained that very well , but that 's how I 've set up Perl ( running off a network drive ) for a large engineering organization .
Google for Perl and DropHandler , and you should be able to get the .reg Registry script to do this for you .

One of the reasons the Mozilla Firefox Web browser is used by more than 270 million people is its extensive ecosystem of browser add - ons .
With the new Mozilla Labs Jetpack project , Mozilla hopes to make it easier for developers to build add - ons and for users to manage them .
Jetpack was officially announced last week and is already generating downloads and new add - ons for Mozilla .
Jetpack is intended to make add - on development faster and easier using common HTML Web developer skills .
While some might see it as potentially competitive with other mechanisms for building and manipulating add - ons , Mozilla sees Jetpack as a new way to extend the brower and the Web experience itself .
" With more than 25,000 downloads of Jetpack and nearly 100,000 watches of the tutorial movie , we 've seen significant interest in Jetpack , especially from the Web developer world , " Aza Raskin , head of User Experience for Mozilla , told InternetNews.com .
" In the few days since launch , we 've had over 20 Firefox extensions written by people who previously had only written Web sites . "
Raskin added that right now , Jetpack is a 0.1 prototype and is meant mainly for developers and testers .
That said , he noted that the response speaks to a deep , unmet need to allow creators on the Web to be able to participate in making the browser better for everyone , regardless of the depth of their technical ability .
There are more than 12,000 Firefox add - ons in the market already , with over a billion total installs .
Yet despite the success of Firefox add - ons , Raskin said Mozilla has only scratched the surface of its potential .
The idea with Jetpack is to lower the entry point for participation .
Raskin said as more people come online , anyone with an idea will need to be able to develop the innovation that will meet their vision .
" With Jetpack , what used to take hundreds of lines of code now takes tens of lines of code ; and what used to take carefully - cultivated domain - specific knowledge now simply requires standard Web developer skills , " Raskin said .
" On the user front , the Jetpack experience enables a tighter integration of third - party features with Firefox .
You no longer have to go through laborious restarts to try a new add - on .
You just click and go . "
Greasemonkey a role model
While Jetpack represents a new approach , it is not yet clear if Jetpack will one day be the default mechanism for Firefox add - ons .
" Jetpack is one potential future for what add - ons might look like , " Raskin said .
" Eventually , Jetpack could be a default mechanism for extending Firefox , but it is too early to tell .
We are looking to wider feedback to guide development and direction . "
At this early stage , Jetpack developed add - ons do not offer all the same capabilities as regular add - ons .
Raskin said the Jetpack API is currently limited , so not everything is yet possible , but over time he expects that more and more add - ons will be portable to Jetpack .
One of the most popular Firefox add - ons , Greasemonkey , which lets users modify pages they are on , could ultimately add more power to Jetpack too .
" Jetpack was informed by the success of Greasemonkey , " Raskin said .
" Greasemonkey is a fantastic add - on that makes it easy to modify the current page you are looking at .
In the roadmap , we plan on adding support for Greasemonkey scripts to Jetpack to allow them work even better together . "
What 's Next ?
Although Jetpack was just recently announced , Mozilla is already hard at work upgrading the platform .
" We 've already released four updates to Jetpack since the launch , adding a number of bug fixes and new API features , " Raskin said .
" You can expect a bigger release of Jetpack in the next week or so .
Releases will happen early and often , as we work closely with the add - on and Web developer communities to determine the highest priority directions to go . "

From a half billion kilometers away , the message was powerful .
In 1994 , fragments of the Shoemaker - Levy 9 comet slammed into Jupiter .
The earth - size fireballs ejected into space were captured and relayed back to be seen again and again in Internet replay .
The message : we need a foothold in space if our species is to survive .
The late Carl Sagan quickly seized on the importance of this event .
Sagan called again for a grand mission to colonize other planets , a bold step that would insure that the life found on other planets would be our own .
The asteroid 2009 DD45 whisked by weeks ago , traveling within 48,800 miles of Earth .
It is not the feared extinction rock .
A close shave to be sure , the flyby would have little impact on our collective consciousness .
The space ball measured about the size of three city buses and packed enough energy to level a major city and then some .
Another rock made headlines in recent days when it exploded over Africa .
This was the first that scientists were able to track as it came on a trajectory to earth .
Sagan might have remarked on the occasion of the more recent events , these are chilling reminders that a rock with our name on it might be out there gradually circling the solar system until …
An impact by an asteroid of size – say more than 7 miles wide – with an entry attitude of nearly 45 degrees is depicted in film carried on YouTube .
( List of YouTube selections follows story . )
Six times in the ancient past , earth was struck .
The consequence was extinction .
There has been in recent years discussion of nudging a meteor larger than 1 kilometer off its collision course .
In 2007 , the Deep Impact mission embedded a washing machine - size projectile in the interior of comet Temple and ejected comet material into space for study .
We possess the technology , it seems , to mitigate or possibly deflect certain annihilation .
As Voyager reached the rim of the Solar System , Sagan persuaded his team to turn a Voyager camera back toward the sun and snap that breathtaking view of the earth that is seen in his book Pale Blue Dot .
Barely a mote of dust , Sagan called earth .
It seems remarkable from that perspective , anything could find its way here .
But one day , we could be in the wrong place when another asteroid appears menacingly in the sky .
It could be one of the many city size rocks among the Near Earth Asteroids .
On that day , there will be no place to hide .
Sagan was the eloquent scientist who took the unusual career trajectory of public outreach while others toiled mainly in research .
His early career consisted of making models of the atmospheres of Venus and Mars .
He was a tireless spokesman for interplanetary exploration .
His books , his famous PBS series Cosmos , his many public appearances and his work with NASA largely came when space accomplishments had become routine .
Technological advances are still headlines , but nothing has approached the scale of heralded scientific feat that was the Apollo lunar landing .
Competition for technological superiority in the last century came at the point of a Cold War missile .
We were willing to take bold steps back in the days of Sputnik .
Perhaps the chill in the air on an October night of sky watching was really a nagging fear that U.S. leadership could not be taken for granted .
The frequent guest on late night ’s Johnny Carson show might have been as much showman as scientist .
He did with his musings stir up great passion for science .
The Cornell professor left us to ponder the measure of our existence , pointing us toward the stars and reminding us , too , that destruction was the other side of the cosmic coin .
Today , NASA ventures on , searching for life on Mars and sending cameras again and again into Jovian space .
Exploration continues , and men will return to the Moon .
As we take these first tentative steps , something seems to have gone missing .
Progress to other planets can’t occur fast enough for some .
Even in the midst of severe recession , it does n’t seem all that bold a declaration to think that Mars will soon show footprints of another astronaut .
Indeed , tomorrow ’s NASA is taking shape .
Surface - to - space shuttles will make the Discovery look like dad ’s Buick , right down to the thin skin made with material made possible with nanotechnology .
Arthur C. Clarke dreamed that an elevator made of diamond - like material would carry people and payloads into orbit .
The possible seems all the more probable today .
Impact : Shoemaker - Levy 9 comet , which appears on the NASA - Jet Propulsion Laboratory website : http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/sl9/.
Thinking small
The journey to the stars will take a path through the universe of the very small .
Missions to colonize other planets will depend on our ability to manipulate atoms .
Nascent sciences will answer the questions that have so far kept our feet firmly on the ground .
Everything from spacesuits to re-entry vehicles and optics can be dramatically improved with nanotechnology .
A cadre of entrepreneurs has taken up the task .
( See DaVinci Institute schedule information below . )
At this moment in history , the concern is not that we wo n’t have the skills , resources and knowledge .
The concern is for the collective will , which seems to be flagging .
There are conflicting signs to be sure .
As the U.S. education system prods youngsters to perform better in science and math , there is plenty of evidence that the public hungers for science , as the NASA Ames Research Center in California can attest .
More than a quarter million tour the facility in a year .
A muffled and huge explosion of articles on nanotechnology has occurred on the Internet .
Millions are drawn yearly to museums .
Even fans of the fledgling social media share photographs of Shuttle launches .
Interest in science might appear to some to have never been greater .
With his PBS series Cosmos , Sagan ’s enthusiasm has infected a billion viewers .
The series , based on Sagan ’s book of the same name , had Sagan dazzle us with astronomical facts and stir up our great need to wonder and to explore .
The television series is a brilliant tribute to an accumulation of knowledge – and now is mostly out of date .
Distrust of government and media
When political leaders have spent money , it has neglected communications that would more actively engage the public .
Funding for public broadcast has faded at a time when outreach may be more important .
As work on the nanotechnology R&D funding wrapped up eight years ago , concern was expressed the environment of increasing distrust of government and the media have put nanotechnology on a collision course with public opinion .
As some would note at the time , the communications work is inadequate .
The headline yesterday about nanotechnology ’s potential harm to the environment has an ominous ring .
Public distrust , fanned only a little , may bring some ambitions for nanotechnology crashing to earth again .
Nanotechnology ’s dreams could remain just that – dreams .
We need another Sagan , someone interested in explaining the view to the future .
That someone is the already well - known Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson , host of the NOVA scienceNOW PBS program .
Author and speaker Tyson is the recipient of the Space Foundation ’s 2009 Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award , which is to be presented today ( March 30 , 2009 ) at the 25th National Space Symposium in Colorado Springs , CO .
Tyson had Sagan ’s attention early on and Sagan tried recruiting him to Cornell , but instead chose Harvard and study of astrophysics .
Tyson also is president of the Planetary Society , which was founded by Sagan .
The final frontier
Tyson has taken up the mantle of educating and explaining science with alluring skill .
In one of the NOVA series , he says we should use transponders to increase the accuracy of tracking asteroids .
Apophis , a rock the size of the Rose Bowl , takes a perilous arc approaching earth in 2036 .
Would n’t it be great to know with precision exactly where that mass will be on its approach toward earth ?
NASA is studying a concept that still has its skeptics , Tyson among them .
In fact , NASA sponsored a contest that has produced , so far , at least one working prototype of a space elevator but no winner .
A Seattle area company is working on producing a model that can lift a payload into air traffic space – quite a bit shy of NASA ’s goal , but a start .
The makers are convinced that one day its work will marry with a propulsion system for a sea - based cable that would extend 64,000 miles into space .
Super - strong , super - light weight nanomaterials make a space elevator possible .
Tyson ’s skepticism is unrocked by the demo now available for viewing on YouTube .
( See information below . )
This project and projects like it could form the stepping stones for travel to Mars and then eventual colonization .
Tyson , President Bush ’s selectee to a commission that defined the future of the space industry , appears to be the defacto front man .
Perhaps yet another Sagan is staring into a telescope right now .
Maybe , just maybe the next Sagan will post a 3 - D YouTube video some day with musings for the billions tuned in to consider , maybe in the year 2036 when Apophis is nudged a degree to miss the Earth .
Inhabitants will stare breathlessly from Earth – and Mars – as a great mountain of rock whisks by and a future in space is assured .

A lot of people ask me , " Hey , why do you spend so much time denigrating pareidolia ?
What 's the harm in believing in a little nonsense ? "
This is the harm : 50 people in India damage their eyes looking at the Sun hoping to see the Virgin Mary .
They suffered photochemical burns to their maculae , a sensitive region in the eye .
All this apparently started when a hotelier , who has since moved , claimed statues of the Virgin Mother had been crying honey and bleeding oil and perfumes .
Yeah , caveat emptor , right ?
But at what point can you blame the believer for being foolish , versus the scam artist ( perhaps a true believer as well ) who started this ?
If people do n't know enough to know they do n't know enough , then it 's hard to assign blame to them .
The fault lies in the system , which sometimes actively fights against reality and truth getting to the masses .
I hear stories like this all the time , and usually they do n't amount to much individually except as as silly story .
But taken as a sum , they do in fact inflict damage : people believe in fantasies which can hurt them physically , financially , and emotionally .
It destroys their ability to think critically .
And then we get people like Jenny McCarthy , or the parents who used homeopathy and killed their child , or the proven fraud Peter Popoff making a comeback and bilking people out of millions of dollars .
That 's the harm .
So I will continue to point out nonsense like seeing Jesus in baked goods , and I will continue to poke fun at them and at other things which may at first seem harmless .
Because , at some point , this stuff is n't harmless any more .
THE HAGUE ( Reuters ) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Monday the Obama administration had dropped “ war on terror ” from its lexicon , rhetoric former President George W. Bush used to justify many of his actions .

“ The ( Obama ) administration has stopped using the phrase and I think that speaks for itself .
Obviously , ” Clinton told reporters traveling with her to The Hague for a conference on Afghanistan , which Bush called part of his “ global war on terror . ”
The term “ war on terror ” was coined after the September 11 , 2001 attacks against the United States , which were planned in Afghanistan by the militant group al Qaeda .
The phrase was strongly criticized by human rights groups who said it was used to justify many actions , such as the opening of the Guantanamo Bay prison for detainees held without trial at the U.S. Naval base in Cuba .
Internationally , the phrase was seen by critics as a “ with- us- or - against-us ” philosophy , overly dependent on military force and what many Muslims decried as an attack on Islam .
Since taking office on January 20 , Obama has moved swiftly to reverse some of Bush ’s practices , ordering the closure of Guantanamo within a year and an end to harsh interrogation of terrorism suspects .
“ I have not heard it used .
I have not gotten any directive about using it or not using it .
It is just not being used , ” said Clinton when asked whether the term had been officially dropped by the Obama administration .
Clinton has said one of her main roles as top U.S. diplomat is to improve the U.S. image abroad , particularly after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
She has embarked on aggressive public diplomacy during her visits to Europe , the Middle East and Asia , seeking to reach out to ordinary people .

I ’ve just submitted a paper , coauthored with Simon Peyton Jones , to the Haskell Symposium .
In this paper , we outline what we think is an interesting point in the design space of intermediate languages for a lazy functional programming language like Haskell , and show some cool optimisations that we can do with it that are hard or impossible to express in the intermediate language used by GHC today .
Although this mainly represents a potential improvement in GHC ’s internals , where I ’d really like to go with this is to push the ability to make a distinction between strict and lazy data into the type system of Haskell itself .
This would mean that you could , for example , write functions that produce element - strict lists , and document some of the strictness properties of your functions in their types .
If any of this sounds interesting to you , you can obtain the paper from my freshly - minted Computer Lab website .
You can leave any comments you may have on the corresponding Wiki page .
VICTORIA --
The B.C. government withheld information showing the number of welfare recipients had increased by 47 % until after the provincial election , documents released Monday by the New Democratic Party show .
The documents , obtained through a freedom of information request , show the numbers were initially supposed to be released in April .
In an e-mail exchange beginning on April 21 , a government web analyst sent a note to say he would post the new welfare numbers on the government Web site on April 30 .
The analyst was told by a member of the government 's Public Affairs Bureau to : " hold off on posting these updates until after the election . "
The employee agreed , and the numbers were not posted until May 15 .
Those numbers showed that more than 10,000 able - bodied British Columbians had been added to the welfare rolls since the recession took hold last fall .
The increase represented a 47 % jump from the previous September .
" These documents show that the highly politicized Public Affairs Bureau cancelled the routine release of these damaging welfare caseload numbers during the election , " NDP Leader Carole James stated in a news release .
" It 's clear the Campbell government put its political interests ahead of the public 's right to information about B.C. 's economy and fiscal situation . "
In a May 12 e-mail , Pete Lewis , the director of corporate operations for the Ministry of Housing and Social Development , was asked why the numbers were not posted .
In that e-mail he responded : " the caseload stats are not posted because of the requirement to not post information to the Internet during the interregnum period . "
He said the web analyst " requested approval to post from PAB ( the Public Affairs Bureau ) but was denied until after interregnum . "

Kevin Pietersen left a signed bat for the teenager A teenage cricketer is recovering after being floored by a drive from England batsman Kevin Pietersen during a practice session in Leicestershire .
Schoolboy Reece Topley , 15 , who attends the Royal Hospital School in Holbrook , Suffolk , was hit on the ear and knocked to the ground by Pietersen 's shot .
The youngster had been bowling at Pietersen when the England cricketer hit a drive straight back at him .
Reece needed stitches .
Pietersen left a signed bat for him .
' Bit of pain ' Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Reece , an emerging talent , had been invited to bowl at the England batsmen at Loughborough University , as part of the team 's preparations for the ICC World Twenty 20 competition .
The teenager 's father , Don , 45 , a former Essex cricketer , said : " Certainly there was a bit of pain and a bit of shock but it could 've been a lot worse . "
Mr Topley said his son , who had a " few " stitches inserted into his wound on Monday night , remained at the Leicester Royal Infirmary Hospital and was undergoing tests .
He said : " In a light - hearted moment last night in the hospital , I did suggest to Reece that he might have dropped a catch - to which he replied : ' I think I stopped it going for six . "
He added that Pietersen had been concerned about the injury and had left a signed bat for Reece to collect at the university .
" Kevin Pietersen has always been Reece 's favourite cricketer , I 'm sure that will remain the case if Reece gets this bat . "

According to Kevin Bristol , the president of “ Advance mold remediation ” is around $ 3000 , mold removal cost through a professional mold remediation specialist .
The fee comes with a professional mold inspection , sampling of mold right into a laboratory to ascertain the type of mold along with cleaning and removing of the Mold .
The $ 3000 dollars will further add the protective gears in the professionals , the different machines that are used to filter the infected air , and also al the chemicals and encapsulation coating .
How much mold removal costs depend on various factors .
If the mold impacted area is less than 10 feet which is around 3 feet by 3 feet , then probably you can remove the mold yourself using a hard brush and a detergent .
This is relatively a smaller area and it should not be difficult to remove the mold from such a small area .
In such cases , the cost of mold removal is minimal .
If the impacted area is more or it is having toxic or black mold , then it is recommended to use help from a specialized mold removal contractor .
You can search the internet to find a good mold removal specialist from your locality .
The attic as well as the basement are particularly excellent spots to target for mold removal .
You ’ll be able to do your component to prevent it from growing by fixing any leaky roofs as quickly as you can and creating sure to store items sensibly .
After all , mold can thrive on nearly any surface so long as it is damp and warm .
This indicates if your cardboard boxes get wet , it really is very best to acquire rid of them and replace them with plastic tubs rather .
Similarly be sure to maintain an eye out for water stains on the ceiling and check typically overlooked places , for example the insulation .
Do you ever wonder how to remove mold in your bathroom ?
Do you know that you may not even need to hire professional mold removal contractor to do this job for you ?
All you need is these easy cleaning tips to help you get the job done .
Follow these simple steps to make bathroom mold removal a success .
In fact , several Mold Remediation Malibu companies often pack a mold affected room with dry fog , which removes mold effectively .
The dry fog used by Mold removal companies is very effective in exterminating mold , since it contains a chemical , certified by EPA which is completely safe for humans as well as animals .
Mold Remediation Santa Monica companies generally try to avoid using improper methods of mold remediation , such as exposure to high levels of sunlight UV heat dry air ozone and spraying fungicides .
Mold is one of the most deadly moss plants which can cause serious health risks .
Not only does it cause a host of ailments but , it also leads to the damage of property .
So , in order to keep your property safe and in order to enjoy a healthy ambience , availing the varied mold removal services is an absolute necessity .
There are varied stages of mold removal , which the experts perform while making your home mold free .
The professionals offering you these services check the quality and the extent of the mold and then ensure the requisite steps for its removal .
Mold removal can be as easy as wiping up the bathroom or more complicated when dealing with water problems from a leak in the bathtub or roof .
In general the larger the area in question , the more it could negatively impact your house if you do n’t follow proper precautions .
For example , you notice mold thriving behind the toilet tank and between the toilet bowl .
This is an isolated area and there are no spread out mold areas in the house .
Just clean this up with the normal mold cleaner or bleach .
Even though many people find the discovery of mold to be embarrassing , there is something that can be done to put everyone ’s mind at ease and allow them to sleep better at night .
Instead of trying to discover effective ways to get rid of the mold yourself , contact a reputable mold removal company to do the job right once and for all .
Mold is practically everywhere in penicillin , cheese , decaying plants and animals and that moist area on your wall where the water leaked from your pipes .
Some of these molds are toxic and some are harmless that does n’t really affect us .
However , there are some people who are overly sensitive to molds and its spores .
Variable reaction from people from sneezing to deadly anaphylactic responses can ensue just because you have a breeding ground for molds .
Therefore , it is important that you detect them early and get mold removal done to protect your guests from being exposed .
I ‘d like to insert that homes with mold are “ Harmful Health Concerns ” as pointed out by the EPA .
Mold is a biohazard .
And , considering that health is the quintessential Green issue ; exactly what we are discussing here is a modestly Eco friendly career choice .
We understand that different Green specialists will certainly cleanse a house by replacing unpredictable cleaning chemical and other harmful items .
Would n’t mold removal fall into the exact same genre ?
Undoubtedly , we are taking a look at an Eco friendly program when health is at risk , and there is a way to remove the danger .
Old Charlie Krauthammer , the neocon who wo n't go away , is at it again .
Now he 's hammering at an old favorite target -- the Hamas party and its political leader , Khaled Meshal -- and its new accomplice , that scurrilously liberal newspaper , the New York Times .
The Times ' latest moral fault ( according to Krauthammer ) was to send two of its top Middle East reporters to interview Meshal and then actually report some of what he said ( though the five - hour interview was boiled down to a brief article and a handful of quotes ) .
" Hamas Says It Grounded Rockets , " the Times headline announced ; Meshal explained that firing rockets from Gaza is not now a useful strategy for pursuing Hamas ' goals .
But for Krauthammer the important news is Meshal 's endorsement of a two - state solution , with a Palestinian state only in the West Bank and Gaza , currently occupied by Israel .
" We are with a state on the 1967 borders , based on a long - term truce , " Meshal said .
Asked what " long - term " meant , he said , " 10 years . "
Actually , that 's not really news .
Hamas leaders have been saying for several years now that they want a two - state solution and a 10 - year truce , as everyone who follows the issue closely knows very well .
What 's new is that the oh - so - influential New York Times is willing to bring Meshal 's message to a much larger public and thus give it legitimacy for the masses in the U.S. -- which is precisely what has Krauthammer unnerved .
How does this message square with the infamous Hamas Charter that calls for the elimination of the state of Israel ?
Although Meshal still insisted that " he would not recognize Israel … he urged outsiders to ignore the Hamas charter , " saying that it 's 20 years old and , " we are shaped by our experiences . "
In other words , times change even if charters do n't ; watch what we do now , not what we said years ago .
Let us negotiate the 10 - year truce and live in peace alongside Israel .
Aha , cries Krauthammer ; there 's the wily devil 's trick : " After a decade of Hamas arming itself within a Palestinian state that narrows Israel to 8 miles wide -- Hamas restarts the war against a country it remains pledged to eradicate . "
And how do we know that 's their diabolical plan ?
" The Palestinians " -- apparently a monolithic bloc like the Borg -- " have never accepted the idea of living side by side with a Jewish state . "
For his " proof , " Krauthammer points to the famous negotiations that President Bill Clinton convened at Camp David in 2000 , between Israeli Prime Minister ( now defense minister ) Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat .
" No Israeli government would turn down a two - state solution in which the Palestinians accepted territorial compromise and genuine peace with a Jewish state , " Krauthammer claims .
" Barak offered precisely such a deal in 2000 . …
The Palestinian response ( for those who have forgotten ) was : No . "
Actually , it 's Krauthammer -- and all the AIPAC - ites so loudly supporting Israel 's hard - line government -- who have conveniently forgotten the essential facts .
Actually , the Palestinians ' response in 2000 was , " Let 's keep talking . "
A year later , when agreement was closer at hand , it was Barak who pulled the plug on the talks .
He turned down precisely a two - state solution in which the Palestinians accepted territorial compromise and genuine peace with a Jewish state .
And several times since , when Palestinians were close to uniting around a similar peace proposal , the Israeli government has managed to torpedo the process -- just as it largely ignored the ground - breaking Arab League peace initiative of 2002 .
What about the territorial compromise the Israelis tried to force on the Palestinians at Camp David , which most Israelis and their supporters ritually refer to as " the generous offer ? "
It was really territorial suicide for the Palestinians -- as Krauthammer would know if he read the Times ( or at least its Web site ) less selectively .
A Times blog -- called the Lede -- recently offered a bald statement of the truth that careful analysts of " the generous offer " have always known :
The Palestinian state as envisioned by Israeli leaders ( even so - called liberals like Barak , Ehud Olmert and Tzipi Livni ) is a patchwork quilt -- an " archipelago " of little blocs of land separated by innumerable Jewish settlements , security roads and checkpoints -- where economic prosperity , and indeed ordinary daily life , would be as impossible as it is now .
Imagine if someone suggested that the United States could get along fine with a bunch of disconnected states no longer part of the nation -- say , New York , Ohio and Indiana , Missouri and Kansas , plus all of New England and the Old South , and let 's throw in the Northwest and a big chunk of the Rocky Mountain West -- plus another country 's soldiers controlling most of the interstate highways .
That 's the kind of " generous offer " Barak made at Camp David , the same kind of offer that always passes in Israel for " genuine peace . "
As the Times ' blogger put it with such delicate understatement ( after all , this is still the New York Times , just tilting a tiny bit to the left ) , " since some degree of fragmentation is a feature of many of the maps proposed by Israeli governments in recent years for the shape of a Palestinian state , it seems important to ask what chance a country with this landlocked archipelago shape really has of becoming a viable nation - state . "
Not much chance , Palestinian leaders across the political spectrum have answered .
They know that if they accept the Israeli plan for an independent Palestinian archipelago , their own voters will reject them , and with good reason .
It 's an unrealistic plan because it would create a state that 's not viable .
Such a fragmented Palestine would have no chance of economic prosperity and every prospect of continued de facto Israeli control , with all the impossible conditions that imposes on ordinary Palestinians -- humiliating waits of many hours at checkpoints are commonplace , often ending with some well - armed Israeli teenager arbitrarily refusing permission to continue the journey .
Why would anyone vote for more of that ?
What Hamas wants now is essentially no different from what Arafat wanted and what Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas is still insisting on ( at least publicly ) : A Palestinian state that encompasses virtually the whole West Bank , as well as Gaza , so Palestinians can travel throughout the West Bank with no restrictions and create the commercial life the new state would need to survive .
If Krauthammer and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee crowd want to make a real case against Hamas , they could point to the ambiguity of Meshal 's words to the Times : " The central goal is the liberation of the occupied land and regaining our rights , ending the Israeli occupation , leading our people toward liberation and freedom , achieving the right of self - determination and living in a sovereign state on liberated land . "
What exactly is " the occupied land ? "
For many years , when Hamas leaders used those words , they clearly meant to include all of Israel .
In recent years , though , they 've made it clear that they are now talking about settling for a two - state solution , with the Palestinians getting only the West Bank and Gaza .
" The world must deal with what Hamas is practicing today , " Meshal told the Times .
" Hamas has accepted the national reconciliation document [ a joint program agreed to by Hamas and Fatah , often called ' the prisoners document ' because it was hammered by representative of both sides who were inmates of an Israeli prison ] .
It has accepted a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders including East Jerusalem , dismantling settlements and the right of return based on a long - term truce . "
Granted , those are hard terms for most Israelis , and thus for any Israeli government , to accept .
That 's why Israeli leaders have done their best to block united Palestinian peace moves .
But they are terms that most of the world now finds quite reasonable , or at least a constructive starting point for negotiations .
Hamas is a political party .
It 's leaders , like all politicians , practice the art of the possible .
Naturally , they ask for everything they want when the negotiations begin .
But , at the end , they settle for what they can get .
That 's precisely what Krauthammer and the AIPAC - ites refuse to accept .
Their whole worldview depends on turning political conflicts into moral dramas .
So they make Hamas stand for all Palestinians , and all Palestinians stand for evil incarnate .
To treat Meshal and the Hamas leaders as ordinary human beings with ordinary political ambitions and compromises -- and very real grievances -- would bring that moralistic worldview crashing down .
They would rather deny the facts and keep the conflict going , even though it perpetuates the horrors of daily life in Palestine , endangers the security of Israel and weakens the global position of the U.S .
Fortunately , they 're fighting a losing battle , and they know it -- which is why their emotional outbursts sound increasingly frightened , shrill and irrational .

MOSCOW ( AP ) – A Russian news agency reported Tuesday that the country plans to build five or six aircraft carriers as part of efforts to rebuild its once - formidable navy .
The Interfax news agency quoted an unidentified Russian navy official as saying construction of the ships should start in 2012 - 2013 .
The official was quoted as saying that plans to build the carriers are a top priority for the military , and they will not be derailed by the financial crisis .
Portugal 's drug decriminalization ' bizarrely underappreciated ' : Greenwald Rachel Oswald
Published : Monday April 6 , 2009
Print This Email This Champions of harsh drug criminalization laws as the best solution to curbing drug use will be chagrined to find that Portugals eight year history of decriminalization has led to lower drug usage rates .
According to a new report entitled ,  Drug Decriminalization in Portugal : Lessons for Creating Fair and Successful Drug Policies ,  while drug use across the European Union has risen steadily since 2000 , Portugal , which has the most liberal drug laws of any country , has actually seen its prevalence rates decrease in various age groups since it decriminalized all drugs in 2001 .
Prevalence rates measure how many people have consumed drugs over the course of their lifetime .
 I think its bizarrely underappreciated whats been done in Portugal ,  said Salon writer Glenn Greenwald , who authored the report .
Greenwald , who speaks fluent Portuguese , traveled to Portugal in 2008 to study the affects of drug decriminalization in the country .
Because drugs were not legalized outright in Portugal , violations of laws prohibiting drug possession for personal usage are now merely treated as administrative offenses and carry with them no criminal charges .
Drug trafficking , however , continues to be prosecuted as a criminal offense in the country .
Compared to the low to moderate levels of drug use in Portugal since decriminalization went into effect , the majority of EU states have drug use rates that are double and triple that of Portugal today , according to the report .
Greenwald , who presented his findings at a Friday event at the Cato Institute , which sponsored the writing of the report , noted that the United Kingdom and Estonia , EU nations with some of the harshest criminalization laws , also have the highest cocaine usage rates in the EU .
 None of the fears promulgated by opponents of Portuguese decriminalization has come to fruition , whereas many of the benefits predicted by drug policymakers from instituting a decriminalization regime have been realized , " writes Greenwald in the report .
" While drug addiction , usage , and associated pathologies continue to skyrocket in many EU states , those problems in virtually every relevant category have been either contained or measurably improved within Portugal since 2001 . 
Greenwald said the strongest evidence in Portugal that supports drug decriminalization is the declining usage of drugs in the crucial 15 - 19 age group .
In every single drug category , with the exception of the new drugs that have come into popular usage since 2001 , like ketamine and GHB , teen drug use has declined .
The biggest drug category declines were seen in marijuana , which saw teen drug use slip from just over 10 percent in 2001 to 6 percent in 2006 .
 Drug policymakers are ecstatic about this ,  Greenwald said .
Since decriminalization took effect in Portugal , deaths as a result of drug usage have declined significantly .
Opiate - related deaths experienced the biggest drop , falling from about 275 deaths in 2000 to about 125 in 2006 , according to information provided in the report from the Portugal National Institute of Legal Medicine .
The Portugal report , which also tracked drug usage rates outside of the European Union ( the region of the world that has gone the farthest in decriminalizing drug usage ) , found that by and large usage rates for each category of drugs continue to be lower in the EU than in non-EU states with a far more criminalized approach to drug usage . 
Tim Lynch , director of the Cato Institutes Project on Criminal Justice , said ,  For a very long time all of the academics , who studied drug policy , had to acknowledge one reality -- that the drug policy of the United States is the drug policy of the world . 
That premise , however , is now changing .
As evidence of this , Lynch pointed to a number of news bulletins calling for drug reform in recent months :  Canadian government tries anew to decriminalize marijuana ,  Argentine president calls for decriminalization of drug use ,  Mass .
voters OK decriminalization of marijuana ,  Obama administration to stop raids on medical marijuana dispensers  and most recently ,  Webb , Specter introduce bill to overhaul Americas criminal justice system . 
Advocates of drug decriminalization in the United States , should focus not on ideological or moral arguments in making their case , but rather , empirical evidence that shows decriminalization reduces drug usage , said Greenwald .
Greenwald said supporters of decriminalization in the U.S. have an ideal moment to talk about it as the political mood regarding decriminalization is now shifting in favor of reform .
According to Greenwald , much of the discussion on why drugs should not be decriminalized ( the primary argument being that it will lead to higher drug usage and higher assorted drug - related problems ) has been speculative .
He said it was up to drug reformers to refocus the drug debate away from moral and civil liberties arguments so that it ends up being an entirely empirical and pragmatic issue . 
Because there has been little debate on empirical grounds , which are verifiable and provable , on why drugs should stay criminalized , the extremely unexamined assumption that decriminalization would result in a massive increase of drug usage has become widespread and generally accepted , Greenwald said .
But with the decriminalization of drugs in Portugal , drug reformers can now point to empirical evidence that demonstrates that decriminalization has positive affects .
As Greenwald writes in the report ,  By freeing its citizens from the fear of prosecution and imprisonment for drug usage , Portugal has dramatically improved its ability to encourage drug addicts to avail themselves of treatment .
The resources that were previously devoted to prosecuting and imprisoning drug addicts are now available to provide treatment programs to addicts . 
 Those developments , along with Portugals shift to a harm - reduction approach , have dramatically improved drug - related social ills , including drug - caused mortalities and drug - related disease transmission ,  the report continues .
 Ideally , treatment programs would be strictly voluntary , but Portugals program is certainly preferable to criminalization . 
Peter Reuter , a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland , who supports the continued criminalization of drugs , provided a skeptical critique of Greenwalds report at Fridays event , though he did admit that  I think it is fair to say that decriminalization in Portugal has indeed achieved its central goals . 
While non-violent drug users are no longer dealt with as criminals in Portugal , Reuter speculated that because Portuguese police no longer have to put as much effort into making a criminal arrest against drug users , they are now more likely to issue many more administrative citations for drug use , which he said served to increase , rather than decrease , the intrusion of government into the lives of private citizens .
He added , that the higher rates of drug users seeking government treatment was more likely due to the aging of Western Europes heroin - using population .
According to Reuter , the large bulk of the population of heroin dependents first began using in the 1970s , 80s and 90s and so would be much older today and more likely to seek out medical help .
 Much of what is recorded here , I think , is consistent with what I see happening in many other Western countries ,  said Reuter of the number of drug users in Portugal seeking treatment .
Get Raw exclusives as they break -- Email & mobile Email - Never spam :
Russ , a Christian and Minister in the Missouri Synod of of the Lutheran Church , and I have been chatting with a certain frequency … for some reason it always lands on the subject of morality …we hit other subjects some times , but morality is one thing that we ALWAYS end up getting back to .
Maybe I am not authoritative enough on the subject of morals ( I do n’t know why not ) , but I ca n’t seem to say things in a way that satisfy Russ … so we chat and I explain my side , challenge his side a tad , try to explain why god is not necessary in the moral dilemma that we face daily … and for some reason it just never gets across , I have no doubt that I am using some sort of logic that seems circular but I just do n’t know any other way to put it .
The thing is , Russ knows that I am not an immoral person , he admits that …
He understands that a godless person like myself can still have morals but that they may not have a basis .
Usually after going over this a few times we start to do a bit of name calling and then kiss and make up , because Russ is a really nice guy and I am too if I must say so myself ( usually we only prod one another , I think he knows I am just picking with him ) .
I guess I just want to know from the Atheists and the Christians ( or anyone else for that matter ) where I am messing up my explanation of this thing .
So what follows is a portion of one of our more recent conversations ( edited to make it easier to read , no other edits made ) from Gtalk .
Afterward I am going to try to explain my view ( which as far as I know is well accepted , but I base it entirely on my own understanding of history and my observations of the human race )
Tell me what I can do to improve my understanding or explanation of this , is there a precedent on this argument that could help me ?
I do have to admit one thing though , I have a major advantage over Russ .
I have been the Christian before , I have seen the affect God can have on one ’s morals and beliefs so I understand the position he is coming from .
Russ gets frustrated with me because for some reason this pre-qualifier does n’t make it any easier for me to explain the dynamic nature of morality and ethical behavior to a person holding views similar to my own former view .
It frustrates me too , I always thought I might be a decent wordsmith , evidently when I am on a pro-tempo spiel sometimes the things I say and the things I think just do n’t line up .
So this really is n’t something I can blame on him , I have the precedent , he has never been an Atheist , His view has been fairly unchanging on this subject for his entire life , mine has gone from one extreme to another in roughly 10 years .
Now for the text below , assume that morality includes all ethics and morals that society as a whole holds as a part of a whole , if that makes any sense .
Also note that this is only a portion of our conversation which spanned about 6 hours ( which is probably why russ is set as busy on Gtalk now , because when he talks to me he does n’t get any work done…its ok Russ , I understand )
Russ : I still ca n’t get around the morality question – again , it ’s certainly not that i think atheists have no morals or that Christians are more moral than atheists – the only point is , even while Christians screw up , there ’s always something objective to look back to that shows us where we ’ve screwed up – a static target , if you will .
What I still do n’t understand is what you ’ve described sounds to Me like a morality that has a constantly moving target for it ’s basis and I can’t for the life of Me understand how that ’s sustainable .
Me : so you do n’t see how morality has changed throughout the ages at all ?
Russ : I do see how it ’s changed – and that ’s part of my point – because in my opinion , SOME of that ( not all ) is a result of abandoning God ’s Word – the abortion debate , for example
Me : when I say ages I Mean before there was a word of god
you know
how like , before 1930 ’s euthanasia , hereditary breeding , selective neutering and all were common practices in many countries … this included abortions … by far
That ’s a modern example
Eugenics ..
It ’ll make a come back
Russ : exactly my point
and that ’s a terrible thing
but with a relative morality – what ’s to stop it at all ?
who ’s to say it ’s wrong ?
you have nothing to appeal to
THAT is my point – not that Christianity / God ’s Word WILL stop it , but at LEAST you have a place to appeal to – does that make any more sense ?
Me : I know what you are saying
but it does n’t have to be wrong “ because god said so ”
it can be wrong because “ we value all life ”
or because “ we believe killing is bad and therefore it is ”
Russ : but WHO makes the final call ?
great – but if the majority says “ yeah for eugenics ” where do you appeal to ?
Me : the ever changing status quo
Russ : moving target
your appeal is GONE as soon as the status quo says it ’s acceptable
Me : not necessarily
my appeal probably would not change
that of society likely would
there will always be dissenters
Russ : but what is your morality based on ?
you – as an individual
if 99 % of the population says eugenics is a great thing and you keep crying out “ no way ! ” what ground are you standing on ?
your own thought and reason ?
what ’s it based on ?
certainly not the status quo , I ’d think – if you ’re a dissenter
I ’m really trying to understand , but I just do n’t see any point where the buck ultimately stops
Me : it does n’t stop
my morality is based on the facts as I understand them and my own ideals and opinions
Russ : and you think that ’s a good thing ?
Relative / subjective morality ?
Me : I do n’t think that it is good or bad
I think that it is reality
it just happens to be that way
So the real crux of what I am trying to explain here is that morality , no matter what religion is predominant in society always moves through ebbs and flows from Extremism to Moderate to an opposing Extremism .
Society changes it ’s views and preferences over time , the fact is Christians talk about this all the time and Russ brings it up too , that society is getting progressively worse ( he calls it moving away from god ’s word ) .
I would n’t necessarily say worse coming from an entirely objectionable view point , because once society has mad that transition what you and I think is moral will either be immoral or too moderate for the next generation .
Also , I am not defending the ebbs and flows , I think good is good and bad is bad , as defined by what I think is good and what I think is bad , but the change is happening all the time because facets of society ( herein called dissenters ) will always be pushing the boundaries in one way or another …there are always multiple suites of extremists that are diametrically opposed to one another , and a common people stuck in the middle that conform to some middle ground between the two ( or more ) factions in general .
I know it sounds incredibly simplistic but I think that history supports this .
Speaking on a modern front ; if we look at sexuality alone I think it is increasingly obvious that sexual activity is occurring in younger and younger generations , and I know Evangelical Christian society is trying to fight this in their own children so this has to appeal to those sensibilities .
When I was in High School 16 - 18 was a normal age to lose ones virginity , now I know 10 year olds that claim to be sexually active ( they represent an extreme ) , their peers at 12 - 14 are picking up on this and conforming to that standard .
Therefore the age that children begin to think about and pursue sexual activity is decreasing rapidly .
Now , since things are going toward one extreme we need to know if there has ever been a precadent for that extreme before … and the answer is YES there has .
2-300 years ago it was common place for a 14 year old to get married and start having children - marriage aside they were being subjected to sexual activity - the reasons now may be different as I am sure some will argue , but the fact remains that the standards are changing .
This model can be applied to all sorts of things :
Bloodsport : Gladiators in Greece – Boxing with gloves – Mixed Martial Arts ( UFC ) – Some more extreme bloodsport of the future ( think Death Race or something like that )
Racism : 1940 ’s American South still lynching blacks – 1970 ’s and 80 ’s Interacial Marriage becomes more common place – 2008 Barack Obama wins the US Presidency –this might sound silly because I think we are still on an extreme as far as racism goes … but eventually the Minorities might change places and the roles of oppressor and oppressed may change ( Dont shoot me here I ’m just speculating and certainly am not advocating common racism as I see every day in my small Georgia town … just theory folks … I am VERY pro civil rights for ALL people )
Nationalism : Nazi Germany ( Fascist Nationalism ) captivated Germans in overwhelming national and racial pride which made it OK to Euthanize entire races and religions , today in Germany most of this mindset has been set aside and those things seem abhorant , and now Isreal opresses a nation behind ghetto walls — what ’s next ????
I just think History and society back this view up , that societies morals change indefinately the extreme becomes common becomes extreme becomes common , over and over forever and ever .
And the most important part : Christianity has prevailed through most of this and even catalyzed parts of it — Islam too , religion is promoting the extremes on both sides as opposed to providing some moral standard .
God ’s
Word as an argument … well … burden of proof on that one , because the Bible is n’t perfect enough to be God ’s word ( if we hold Him to a higher standard ) .
Was that all rambling ?
I was afraid of that .
DUBLIN ( Reuters ) - Irish religious orders said on Wednesday they would address government demands to pay more compensation to people who were raped and beaten while attending Catholic - run schools .
John Kelly , who says he was abused while in Daingean Industrial School between 1965 and 1967 , reacts after being refused entry to the release of a government report into state abuse , in Dublin May 20 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Cathal McNaughton
Prime Minister Brian Cowen had said the orders had a “ moral responsibility ” to provide more funds to thousands of victims after a harrowing report which revealed endemic abuse in the nation ’s defunct network of industrial and reformatory schools .
“ We recognize the vital need to find new ways of addressing the extreme hurt being felt by so many people and we will do our utmost to this end , ” the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity said in a statement .
Other orders also agreed to respond .
In a 2002 deal , Irish religious orders ’ total contribution to a victims ’ redress scheme was capped at 127 million euros ( $ 177.1 million ) .
The total bill is now expected to top 1 billion euros .
The 18 orders at first refused calls to reopen the deal but there has been pressure from the public , politicians and church leaders , including the leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland , Cardinal Sean Brady .
The systemic abuse described by the report into abuse at institutions the orders ran between the 1930s and the 1970s has rattled Ireland .
The disclosures , including a string of scandals involving priests molesting young boys , have eroded the Catholic Church ’s moral authority in Ireland , once one of the most devout countries in the world .
PRIME MINISTER’S PROPOSALS
The Oblates of Mary Immaculate also said they would respond positively to Cowen ’s proposals .
The Oblates ran the Daingean Reformatory in central Ireland , which last week ’s report described as an anarchic institution , where “ ritualized beatings ” were inflicted .
Sex abuse scandals have rocked the Catholic Church around the world .
In 2007 , the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Los Angeles agreed to pay $ 660 million to 500 victims in the largest compensation of its kind .
The Christian Brothers in Ireland were the first to move this week , saying on Tuesday that they would review how much more they could pay .
Two other orders , the Sisters of Mercy and the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity , on Wednesday agreed to talks on the report , which did not name any of the abusers following a successful legal action by the Christian Brothers .
“ I am encouraged by the response so far from the Christian Brothers , by the soundings we are hearing from other religious orders , ” Minister for Defense Willie O’Dea said on Wednesday .
“ We are adamant that they will meet their obligations , ” O’Dea told public broadcaster RTE .
Fidel the cat spends his days at the library while his owners are at work A Kent library has been visited almost every day for two years by its own " puss in books " , the council has said .
Fidel , an eight - year - old black cat , turns up at Deal Library almost every day while his owners are at work .
He spends the day on his favourite blue chair , only leaving the building when he sees his owners arriving home .
Staff say they have never tried to encourage Fidel with food and even used to put him outside when he first began to visit them , but he always came back .
' Art critic ' Heather Hilton , district manager for Deal Library , said : " Fidel certainly seems to like coming here and he 's very popular with our customers .
" I think he 's a bit of an art critic too because we sometimes see him examining the pictures on the gallery wall , " she added .
A spokeswoman for Kent County Council , which runs the library , said Fidel was such a " dedicated customer " that he sometimes arrived before staff and could be found waiting at the front door .
Fidel is a rescue cat , whose owners chose him from a local sanctuary after he was found abandoned in a flat in Deal .

Citigroup is playing fast and loose with its shares and stockholders wo n't be getting a vote .
If you own
Citigroup
( C ) - Get Report
shares , you 're a chump .
It 's not your fault , mind you .
You 've been played by Citi .
And no one is calling them on it -- the
SEC
and the
NYSE
are playing along , in fact .
You 've been had .
Citigroup is playing fast and loose with its shares
and stockholders get no say in the matter .
It 's all spelled out in the bank 's press release today stating that it plans to dilute the holdings of common stock holders by converting preferred shares into common shares , and then it will conduct a reverse stock split to reduce the total number of outstanding common shares .
Now here 's the part of the press release that makes you a chump : " Shareholder approval to increase Citi`s authorized shares is not necessary . "
Citi goes on to say that the NYSE granted an exception to shareholder voting requirements .
The plans are on file with the SEC , and Citi 's release suggests it does n't anticipate any problems proceeding .
The plan to get the government and other owners of preferred shares to convert to common shares will first dilute the holdings of investors who currently own common shares .
Do n't like that ?
Too bad .
Then comes a reverse stock split that will convert some number of shares into a single share with the same relative value as the combined shares previously held .
Of course that assumes the shares hold onto that value .
Do you feel lucky ?
It 's not just common shareholders that are getting played here .
Citi also is cleverly pushing its bailout repayment risk onto the government with these initiatives .
If it all goes through , taxpayers will have to hope for a major rebound in the bank 's share price in order to recoup the " investment " the U.S. Treasury made .
For Citi , though , it might actually be better if the share price does n't rebound quickly .
If the price drops after the reverse stock split , the bank would be able to launch a buyback and get more shares for less money .
Ultimately , the government could be repaid for pennies on the dollar .
This is a great model for all of the other financial institutions that " sold " preferred shares to the government .
That 's a long list .
In addition to the $ 40 billion in preferred shares of Citi held by the government , other big government holdings include : $ 45 billion of preferred shares in
Bank of America
( BAC ) - Get Report
; $ 25 billion worth of preferred shares in
Wells Fargo
( WFC ) - Get Report
; $ 25 billion in preferred shares of
JPMorgan Chase
( JPM ) - Get Report
; $ 10 billion of preferred shares of
Goldman Sachs
( GS ) - Get Report
; and $ 10 billion of preferred shares of
Morgan Stanley
( MS ) - Get Report
.
All told , the Treasury 's list of preferred share holdings is nine pages long and totals $ 198.5 billion .
AIG
( AIG ) - Get Report
is listed separately under the heading of " Systemically Significant Failing Institutions " with $ 40 billion of preferred shares .
Why not convert all those preferred shares into common shares and let the market decide how much taxpayers get repaid ?
Heck , taxpayers might stand a better chance of seeing some money return to the Treasury .
As for common shareholders , well , too bad .
Citi clearly demonstrated no one cares what you think .

Regulators are taking a close look at the health of US banks
No US bank being screened by regulators is at risk of insolvency , US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has said .
The eagerly awaited results of " stress tests " on the financial health of 19 US banks are to be released after US financial markets close at 2200 BST .
The tests are expected to show that tens of billions of dollars are needed to bolster some banks ' finances .
Citigroup and Bank of America are widely expected to need to raise the biggest amounts of cash .
Reports said that Citigroup may need more than $ 50bn ( £ 33 bn ) , while Bank of America may require an extra $ 34bn .
Shares in the two firms have rallied ahead of the release of the tests , with Bank of America gaining 6 % , and Citigroup adding 5 % , as analysts said investors hoped it would mark the final conclusion of their recent financial woes .
US banks will now be divided into those who have " passed " the stress tests and those who have " failed " and need to raise new capital .
The question is - where will they get it ?
Greg Wood , BBC North America business correspondent
Have the tests passed the test ?
Q&A : What are bank stress tests ?
Wells Fargo and GMAC , the financial arm of General Motors , may also be required to raise extra cash , with the figure for GMAC being put at $ 13.1bn , according to the Washington Post .
The New York Times said that the 19 banks will need less than $ 100bn in total - less than some had feared .
Careful look US banks are being tested to see if they have sufficient cash reserves to cope should the recession worsen .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the test was a " truly remarkable effort " that was designed to determine " how much capital the banks need to stay well capitalised and to continue lending " .
" This is not a solvency test - all [ the banks ] are solvent , " he added .
He said the 19 banks being tested account for two - thirds of the total assets of the US banking system , and more than half of the total amount of credit in the US economy .
Mr Bernanke 's comments echoed those of Mr Geithner made earlier in a television interview with the US's Charlie Rose Show .
A small number , including Bank of America and Citigroup , will be instructed to raise billions of additional capital
BBC business editor Robert Peston
Read Robert Peston 's blog " We brought the nation 's financial supervisors together , and in an unprecedented step , asked them to do a careful look under the hood , to take a careful look at how much - how strong these institutions were in the event things got worse , " Mr Geithner said .
The results would bring transparency and improve confidence in the banking system , he added .
Mr Geithner said he believed that the majority of the banks would be able to raise money from private sources but if they were unable to do so the government may have to provide them with more taxpayer money .
" None of these 19 banks are at risk for insolvency , " he said .
He added that if the government 's stakes in any bank were to rise above 30 % as a result of extra capital injections , the government would consider taking a more active management role .
" If we face those situations , we 'll have to make judgements about whether the quality of leadership of those board is strong enough so that , again , our interest are met best , " Mr Geithner said .
Criticism
Some analysts have been critical of the stress tests .
Professor Nouriel Roubini and Professor Matthew Richardson of New York University say that the doomsday scenario that the banks ' books have been subjected to is actually no worse than the current economic situation .
And as such " the stress test results will not be credibly interpreted as a sign of of bank health " , they wrote in the Financial Times .
Others say that the tests do not take account of the banks ' varying business models .

While publishers like IDW and Dark Horse have had luck releasing digital versions of their comics for the iPhone recently , many publishers have wondered whether a one - stop digital comic store would ever be created .
And then Longbox was announced .
Advertisement
Longbox , which will be made available as a free download later this year by Quicksilver Software , was announced at this weekend 's HeroesCon in North Carolina .
Described as " a digital comics platform similar to iTunes , " the software will offer downloadable digital versions of comics by publishers Boom !
Studios and Top Cow for just 99 cents ( Discussions are being held with other publishers to add their lines ) .
Rantz Hoseley explains the thinking behind the new app :
Everyone 's been talking now for half a decade about the holy grail of digital comics , and how do you solve that problem :
How do you make something that everyone gets on board with ?
And rather than just kind of jump into it willy - nilly , we 've done a lot of research and actual development on the platform prior to even discussing it with any publishers ...
Three years ago , when we started doing development , publishers were very , very resistant to it .
The majority of publishers would n't even discuss the possibility of it : digital comics are the devil come to steal the milk from our children 's mouths [ but t]he difference is that now , every publisher realizes , especially with the increasing cost of monthlies and the declining sales of monthlies , that there has to be a way to expand the market .
With every other form of entertainment embracing digital distribution and sales medium , it is very foolhardy to not do likewise .

If you 're wondering whether Longbox would have a problem with your potentially not - incredibly - legal downloaded comics , you 're in luck :
While Longbox has a proprietary secure format , it also reads .cbr and .cbz files .
Now , we 're not advocating ( and I 'll be kind here ) ' grey market ' digital comic files , but it is ignorant to assume that there is n't a degree of crossover between people who currently read comics in a .cbr , .cbz file format and people who would want to read comics in a legitimate fashion — especially since so many of those individuals posit that they download .cbr and .cbz because there are n't ' legitimate ' versions of these files in digital format .
So if Longbox becomes the one stop for people to have their digital comics experience , it 's a very short hop , skip , and jump for people to purchase files there , especially at the price point given .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 " 8 K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Color us slightly concerned about talk of " proprietary secure format , " but interested nonetheless .
Initially , Longbox will be available for Mac , PC and Linux with a planned release date of September or October ; Quicksilver is already looking at adding gaming and mobile platforms .

United Nations , New York -
" If sexual violence is not fully addressed in ceasefires and peace processes , there will be no peace for women , " said former United Nations Under - Secretary - General for Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egeland at a United Nations high - level meeting on peace negotiations that convened this week in New York .
Egeland , along with eminent mediators , experts and women 's rights advocates , came together from 22 - 24 June to address , for the first time , one of the most neglected aspects of conflict resolution : how to address conflict - related sexual violence in peace processes and peace accords .
While Security Council Resolution 1820 on sexual violence as a tactic of warfare calls for conflict - related sexual violence to be addressed in confl ict resolution processes , such as peace negotiations , United Nations Development Fund for Women ( UNIFEM ) research shows that since the end of the Cold War , only 10 countries - out of approximately 300 peace agreements examined in 45 conflicts agreements - have mentioned sexual violence : Uganda , Sudan / Darfur , Nepal , Indonesia / Aceh , Sudan / Nuba Mountains , Burundi , Democratic Republic of Congo , Philippines , Chiapas and Guatemala .
In the case of ceasefires , sexual violence is rarely mentioned or monitored .
At the meeting held to coincide with the first anniversary of Security Council Resolution 1820 , UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon underscored the need for sexual violence to be addressed early and comprehensively in peace processes : " Our first priority must be to include women in peace talks as full and equal partners .
If we do not - if we ignore sexual crimes - we trample on the principles of accountab !
ility , reconciliation and peace .
We fail not just women but all people . "
In recent decades , sexual violence in conflict has increased in scale , organization and brutality around the world .
It has been used as a tactic of warfare by armed groups and , in some cases , organized by commanders as a means of terrorizing communities , forcing population flight and supporting genocidal policies .
This has been seen in conflicts ranging from the Balkans to the Democratic Republic of Congo ; from Liberia to Colombia ; Timor to Haiti .
According to former UN Force Commander Major General Patrick Cammaert , " It has probably become more dangerous to be a woman than a soldier in armed conflict . "
Failure to address sexual violence in peace talks is increasingly linked to the subsequent elevated levels of peacetime rape committed by demobilized fighters and ordinary civilians .
" Sexual violence thrives on impunity .
If peace processes do not clearly sign !
al that sexual violence is a prohibited feature of fighting , if prosecutions do not immediately prioritize trials of perpetrators , and if perpetrators move into government and army leadership positions , a climate of impunity is created , " said UNIFEM Executive Director Inés Alberdi .
Peace processes are an entry point to break this cycle of violence and impunity .
Peace talks can set in place plans for the future : for judicial responses to sexual violence , for reparations , for a new order of respect for women .
At the high - level colloquium on addressing sexual violence in peace negotiations , participants generated a few key principles for enabling mediators and negotiating parties to ensure that sexual violence is addressed in peace agreements and that they are consistent with Security Council Resolutions 1820 and 1325 .
These included :
1. Pre-ceasefire negotiations - including humanitarian - access and human rights agreements - to address sexual violence ;
2. Ceasefires to prohibit and monitor for sexual violence ;
3. Disarmament , Demobilization , Reintegration ( DDR ) and Security Sector Reform ( SSR ) to prevent sexual violence and ensure women 's security ;
4. Justice processes to ensure that issues of sexual violence are addressed with equal priority to other international crimes ; and
5 . Peace agreements to specify sexual violence victims as reparations beneficiaries , and to address their socio-economic needs in recovery and development frameworks .
While women have played a significant role in mobilizing for peace , they have had few opportunities to channel their own concerns into the discussions .
Liberian peace activist Leymah Gbowee , who led a large - scale women 's peace movement that helped bring a stalled peace process to a successful conclusion in 2003 , said : " I am proud of the role women played in advancing the peace process , but one of my greatest regrets is that we did not use this opportunity to raise our own issues and demand prosecution for perpetrators of sexual violence as a deterrent to post conflict rape .
This would not only have stopped the widespread impunity for this crime , but would also have helped send a message about how to deal with this issue in other conflicts in the region . "
UNIFEM is the women 's fund at the United Nations .
It provides financial and technical assistance to innovative programmes and strategies to foster women 's empowerment and gender equality .
Placing the advancement of women 's human rights at the centre of all of its efforts , UNIFEM focuses its activities on reducing feminized poverty ; ending violence against women ; reversing the spread of HIV / AIDS among women and girls ; and achieving gender equality in democratic governance in times of peace as well as war .

Fox ’s Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter are very paranoid when it comes to the possibility that the Obama administration could prosecute Bush officials for authorizing torture .
“ The president changed his mind after saying over and over and over and over again , and his top aides said over and over again that he was n’t going to do this , I want to know who changed his mind , because that ’s probably the real President of the United States .
Do you suspect as I do that somebody influenced him and got to him and said change your mind and he just did it ? ” Hannity asked Coulter .

“ I would like to know who the real President is because I do n’t think it can actually be the teleprompter , but I think what pushed him into this was the entire mainstream media screaming that this is torture , torture , torture , ” Coulter replied .
Coulter used claims that insects were used in interrogations to make light of the fact that detainees were tortured .
“ I do n’t think anyone should be able to talk about what happened at Guantanamo without there being a little picture of a small caterpillar maybe on the side of the screen , ” suggested Coulter .
“ That was one of the tortures .
One was supposed to be afraid of insects .
The CIA interrogators requested to put an adorable little caterpillar in his cell with him , ” she mocked .
“ This is the sort of insane , wussie interrogation procedures they are engaging in . ”
Coulter complained that interrogations were too mild since Obama banned harsh techniques .
“ We are being laughed at throughout the Arab world .
I mean , if they are actuall reading these memos , they can not be very afraid of being captured because it is such wussie stuff that is going on or was being permitted at Guantanamo , ” said Coulter .
Hannity equated the release of the torture memos to the outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame .
“ There was so much made over Valerie Plame and Valerie Plame putting her life and Joe Wilson ’s life [ in danger ] , ” he said .
“ The media is now going to release the names … does n’t that put their lives in jeapordy ? ”
Coulter agreed and continued to make light of the harsh interrogation techniques approved by President Bush .
“ They are using torture techniques , using implements that were manufactured by Fisher Price for things that people pay to have done to them at Six Flags , ” she said .

The human race is not only exhausting tangible resources such as oil .
The radiofrequency spectrum available for wireless communication is becoming the increasingly crowded , with virgin “ veins ” of frequency running short .
However , Swedish physicists say that twisting radio beams into a helical shape as they are transmitted could help ease the congestion .
Radio frequency encompasses electromagnetic waves between 3 kilohertz and 300 gigahertz , and as wireless communications technology advances much of that range is being used .

Satellite TV , wireless computer networks and cellphones are among the growing technologies vying for space up to 30 gigahertz , with some technology even beginning to extend beyond 100 gigahertz leaving a dwindling supply of virgin terrain to exploit .
Physicist Thomas Leyser at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics in Uppsala , Sweden , thinks he has a novel solution .
Along with an international team of physicists , he has demonstrated that it is possible to put a spin on radio beams during their transmission to produce a twisted beam .
“ Twisted laser beams have been researched since the 1990s , but it has only now become possible to create twisted beams at the much lower radio frequencies , ” he says .
Radio twister
That advance could prove important as it provides a new way to encode information into radio transmissions .
Leyser says that “ the information encoded in the twist is independent of the amplitude and frequency of the radio waves ” – the features of a radio wave more normally used to encode data .
“ It is a feature of radio waves that has not been utilised before . ”
Leyser and his co-workers created the first twisted radio beams at the HAARP facility of 48 radio antennas in Alaska , normally used to investigate the aurora borealis and other features of the atmosphere .
“ In order to transmit a radio beam , one needs an array of antennas , ” he explains .
The signal is twisted by firing antennas in sequence to describe a circle , instead of having all of them transmit the same signal at once .
“ What we did was to feed all the antennas in the array with slightly different currents , ” says Leyser .
Each antenna received an alternating current slightly delayed from the adjacent antenna in the circle .
The time delay ripples around the array so that the beam emerges to describe a helical wave front .
Digital bits
To confirm that the radio beam had this characteristic shape , the team studied the effects it had on the ionosphere above the array .
“ The twisted beams excited plasma turbulence in the ionosphere that was consistent with the ring - shaped beams and different from that excited by regular beams , ” Leyser says .
The twists remain coherent across vast distances – light years , even – and can store information in the form of digital bits ( 1s and 0s ) , encoded into the pitch of the twist .
What ’s not yet clear is how much extra information can be transmitted using twisted beams .
In theory , huge amounts of data could be sent , says Leyser .
It is possible to use a much smaller array to produce twisted signals , he adds , although most consumer technologies such as cellphones use dipole antennas that cannot produce twisted beams .
Larger tripole antennas that can twist their transmissions might be suitable for linking fixed points , though , for example between cellphone towers .

Editor ’s note : Robin Chase thinks a lot about transportation and the internet , and how to link them .
She connected them when she founded Zipcar , and she wants to do it again by making our electric grid and our cars smarter .
Time magazine recently named her one of the 100 most influential people of the year .
David Weinberger sat down with Chase to discuss her idea .
Robin Chase considers the future of electricity , the future of cars and the internet three terms in a single equation , even if most of us do n't yet realize they 're on the same chalkboard .
Solve the equation correctly , she says , and we create a greener future where innovation thrives .
Get it wrong , and our grandchildren will curse our names .
Chase thinks big , and she 's got the cred to back it up .
She created an improbable network of automobiles called Zipcar .
Getting it off the ground required not only buying a fleet of cars , but convincing cities to dedicate precious parking spaces to them .
It was a crazy idea , and it worked .
Zipcar now has 6,000 cars and 250,000 users in 50 towns .
Now she 's moving on to the bigger challenge of integrating a smart grid with our cars – and then everything else .
The kicker is how they come together .
You can sum it up as a Tweet :
The intelligent network we need for electricity can also turn cars into nodes .
Interoperability is a multiplier .
Get it right !
Chase starts by explaining the smart grid .
There 's broad consensus that our electrical system should do more than carry electricity .
It should carry information .
That would allow a more intelligent , and efficient , use of power .
" Our electric infrastructure is designed for the rare peak of usage , " Chase says .
" That 's expensive and wasteful . "
Changing that requires a smart grid .
What we have is a dumb one .
We ask for electricity and the grid provides it , no questions asked .
A smart grid asks questions and answers them .
It makes the meter on your wall a sensor that links you to a network that knows how much power you 're using , when you 're using it and how to reduce your energy needs – and costs .
Such a system will grow more important as we become energy producers , not just consumers .
Electric vehicles and plug - in hybrids will return power to the grid .
Rooftop solar panels and backyard wind turbines will , at times , produce more energy than we can store .
A smart grid generates what we need and lets us use what we generate .
That 's why the Obama Administration allocated $ 4.5 billion in the stimulus bill for smart grid R&D .
This pleases Chase , but it also makes her nervous .
The smart grid must be an information network , but we have a tradition of getting such things wrong .
Chase is among those trying to convince the government that the safest and most robust network will use open internet protocols and standards .
For once the government seems inclined to listen .
Chase switches gears to talk about how cars fit into the equation .
She sees automobiles as just another network device , one that , like the smart grid , should be open and net - based .
" Cars are network nodes , " she says .
" They have GPS and Bluetooth and toll - both transponders , and we 're all on our cell phones and lots of cars have OnStar support services . "
That 's five networks .
Automakers and academics will bring us more .
They 're working on smart cars that will communicate with us , with one another and with the road .
How will those cars connect to the network ?
That ’s the third part of Chase 's equation : Mesh networking .
In a typical Wi-Fi network , there 's one router and a relatively small number of devices using it as a gateway to the internet .
In a mesh network , every device is also a router .
Bring in a new mesh device and it automatically links to any other mesh devices within radio range .
It is an example of what internet architect David Reed calls " cooperative gain " - the more devices , the more bandwidth across the network .
Chase offers an analogy to explain it .
" Wi - Fi is like a bridge that connects the highways on either side of the stream , " she says .
" You build it wide enough to handle the maximum traffic you expect .
If too much comes , it gets congested .
When not enough arrives , you 've got excess capacity .
Mesh takes a different approach : Each person who wants to cross throws in a flat rock that 's above the water line .
The more people who do that , the more ways there are to get across the river . "
Cooperative gain means more users bring more capacity , not less .
It 's always right - sized .
Of course , Chase points out , if you 're trying to go a long distance , you 're ultimately forced back onto the broadband bridge where the capacity is limited .
But for local intra-mesh access , it 's a brilliant and counter - intuitive strategy .
Mesh networking as a broad - based approach to networking is growing .
A mesh network with 240 nodes covers Vienna .
Similar projects are underway in Barcelona , Athens , the Czech Republic and , before long , in two areas of Boston not far from the cafe we 're sitting in .
But the most dramatic examples are the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Today in Iraq and Afghanistan , soldiers and tanks and airplanes are running around using mesh networks , " said Chase .
" It works , it 's secure , it 's robust .
If a node or device disappears , the network just reroutes the data . "
And , perhaps most important , it 's in motion .
That 's what allows Chase 's plural visions to go singular .
Build a smart electrical grid that uses Internet protocols and puts a mesh network device in every structure that has an electric meter .
Sweep out the half dozen networks in our cars and replace them with an open , Internet - based platform .
Add a mesh router .
A nationwide mesh cloud will form , linking vehicles that can connect with one another and with the rest of the network .
It 's cooperative gain gone national , gone mobile , gone open .
Chase 's mesh vision draws some skepticism .
Some say it wo n't scale up .
The fact it's is being used in places like Afghanistan and Vienna indicates it could .
Others say moving vehicles may not be able to hook into and out of mesh networks quickly enough .
Chase argues it 's already possible to do so in less than a second , and that time will only come down .
But even if every car and every electric meter were meshed , there ’s still a lot of highway out there that would n’t be served , right ?
Chase has an answer for that , too .
" Cars would have cellular and Wi-Fi as backups , " she said .
The economics are right , she argues .
Rather than over - building to handle peak demand and letting capacity go unused , we would right - size our infrastructure to provide exactly what we need , when we need it , with minimum waste and maximum efficiency .
" There 's an economy of network scale here , " she says .
" The traffic - light guys should be interested in this for their own purposes , and so should the power - grid folks and the emergency responders and the Homeland Security folks and , well , everyone .
Mesh networks based on open standards are economically justifiable for any one of these things .
Put them together - network the networks – and for the same exact infrastructure spend , you get a ubiquitous , robust , resilient , open communication platform – ripe for innovation – without spending a dollar more . "
The time is right , too .
There 's $ 7.2 billion in the stimulus bill for broadband , $ 4.5 billion for the smart grid and about $ 5 billion for transportation technology .
The Transportation Reauthorization bill is coming up , too .
At $ 300 billion it is second only to education when it comes to federal discretionary spending .
We are about to make a huge investment in a set of networks .
It will be difficult to gather the political and economic will to change them once they are deployed .
" We need to get this right , right now , " Chase says .
Build each of these infrastructures using open networking standards and we enable cooperative gain at the network level itself .
Get it wrong and we will have paved over a generational opportunity .

Adobe Flash Player has always been quite the controversial service .
While it has become the worldwide standard many years ago and it has held on to that position until relatively recently , Adobe ’s Flash Player has been the subject of severe scrutiny .
Upon losing all its favor with users all around the world , many point back at that moment in time when the late Steve Jobs said that Flash is no good and prevented his iPhone devices from using the service .
Now , many years later , people are starting to agree with what the Apple founder had in mind regarding Flash .
Still , Adobe remains focused and wants to make sure that its remaining user base for Flash , no matter how small , gets the best service possible .
New vulnerabilities discovered and fixed
While Flash might be heading towards the end , Adobe is still making sure that it ’s fixing what can be fixed .
Security issues and vulnerabilities have plagued Flash for the longest time , but some of the most important vulnerabilities have just been discovered recently .
Adobe has deployed two patches which deal with these issues and fix the problems , thus providing a much safer experience for those who have decided to support Flash onward .
The latest issues were related to memory corruption and malicious code execution .
There was another problem regarding cross site scripting , but according to Adobe this vulnerability was not exploited before the company had a chance to patch things up .
Now , both aforementioned threats have been resolved , making Flash safer for its remaining consumers .
A slew of minor concerns have been fixed
It ’s not just big security vulnerabilities that have been handled , but also smaller concerns that summed up the amount to quite a big problem .
A problem concerning URL validation was solved , thanks to the cooperation between Adobe and the CNSI ( Center for Tech and Innovation , which has managed to spot these problems before they had a chance to get out of hand .
Flash is still going away
Despite the most recent efforts by Adobe , the company has stated on multiple occasions that the service will no longer be available starting with the year 2020 .
It might seem like a long time before we get to 2020 , but completely removing Flash from the internet is going to be a lengthy and tedious process .
Adobe will be working with parent companies which are recognized as the leading figured in tech , like Microsoft , Google or Apple , but also Facebook and Mozilla .
Adobe has also stated that Flash will not just simply disappear , but instead will be replaced with a better solution , a similar technology with far more reliable standards and features .
El hombre que no podía morir finalmente se murió de un tiro en el Bajo Flores .
Pero el veterano cirujano de guardia lo recuerda como el baleado más reincidente de la historia .
Lo atendió cuando llegó al hospital con una bala en el abdomen .
Lo salvaron por muy poquito , pero tuvieron que sacarle un riñón porque el plomo había llegado demasiado lejos .
A los pocos meses , el tipo regresó con un proyectil en el tórax .
Era un muchacho chileno , de 18 años , que se dedicaba a ir de caño .
Convaleciente aún de su antigua desventura renal , había vuelto a las calles con un revólver y se había tropezado con otro disparo .
El cirujano recuerda también que , a los pocos días , logró huir del hospital dentro del carro de comida .
La policía lo persiguió , lo encontró a las quince cuadras , le gritó que se detuviera y le metió un balazo en el colon .
Luego lo devolvieron a la guardia del Piñero , donde David Eduardo Eskenazi atiende desde hace veinte años , y tuvieron que intervenirlo por tercera vez y hacerle una colostomía , es decir , un colon contra natura .
Era un tipo bravo ese chileno : pateaba , escupía e insultaba a todos , incluyendo a los médicos que le estaban salvando la vida .
Más tarde fue a parar a la cárcel , pero salió rápido , vaya a saber con qué argucias , y alguien le dio el tiro del final .
Es así como el hombre que no podía morir finalmente se murió y como Eskenazi explica ahora , con frialdad quirúrgica , las cosas que pasan si uno trabaja en las proximidades de la Villa 1.11.14 .
Esa gigantesca barriada en la que viven miles de trabajadores pauperizados de la Argentina moderna ganó triste fama por culpa de la mafia de narcotraficantes peruanos que opera en ella , y de una frecuente guerra de bandas que angustia a los pacíficos pobladores de la villa y que produce todo el tiempo muertos , heridos y contusos .
A esas víctimas y victimarios se suman delincuentes comunes envalentonados por la cocaína y el paco de otros asentamientos , vecinos que ejercen justicia informal a punta de pistola , o pibes que zanjan diferencias a navajazo limpio en una bailanta .
Casi todos ellos terminan en la Morgue o en la Guardia del Hospital Piñero , donde Eskenazi lo ha visto todo .
El trauma , su especialidad
Un miembro de la Sociedad de Medicina y Cirugía del Trauma me lo recomendó cuando le dije que quería conocer a un " cirujano de combate " .
Un verdadero tiburón blanco .
Eskenazi es un médico de gran reputación por su trabajo alrededor del concepto del " trauma " , una enfermedad quirúrgica que se relaciona precisamente con las heridas de cuchillo , armas de fuego , choques automovilísticos y otras secuelas de la fatalidad y de la violencia física .
Este médico fue uno de los primeros en adaptar a la Argentina el famoso curso del Comité de Trauma del American College Of Surgeons , y es instructor de cirujanos alrededor de las destrezas y cuidados de urgencia del " paciente traumatizado " , principalmente en la llamada " hora de oro " , donde los artesanos del bisturí toman decisiones de vida o muerte .
Tiene 48 años y un hijo pequeño , es corpulento y se destacan sus manos enormes pero delicadas y sus ojos traslúcidos pero cansados .
A pesar de ser un héroe social , que lidia con los peores momentos del ser humano , Eskenazi ni siquiera parece un idealista .
Hay una vieja teoría según la cual si cada uno realizara bien su trabajo no harían falta revoluciones ni grandes políticas de Estado .
No se lo pregunté , pero me imagino que el cirujano de la guardia del averno adscribe instintivamente a esa manera de pensar .
Eso no le evita señalar , por supuesto , que el sistema de hospitales públicos está colapsado en la Argentina y que a nadie parece importarle .
Pasan los gobiernos y pasan los discursos oficiales , pero crece la población , aumenta el delito y ralean los médicos jóvenes con vocación suicida .
Los lunes el cirujano hace guardias de 24 horas y duerme con un ojo abierto , esperando entrar en acción .
Durante la mañana de este mismo lunes en que nos encontramos , un hombre que no se resignaba a guardar su turno hizo un escándalo en la sala de espera .
En hospitales públicos y exhaustos no hay más alternativa que esperar .
" ¡ Me duele el estómago ! - gritaba el impaciente - .
Acá te tenés que morir para que te atiendan .
¡ Te tenés que morir y yo me estoy muriendo ! "
Una y otra vez gritaba poniendo nerviosos a todos , mientras el médico clínico se encargaba de una verdadera urgencia .
Fue entonces cuando Eskenazi apareció en escena : salió despacio al corredor con andar pesado y rostro endurecido , y lo hizo pasar con un gesto .
Lo revisó a conciencia y le dio secamente una buena noticia : no tenía nada serio .
" Ahora salga - le ordenó el cirujano de manos enormes - .
Salga y dígale a todos que era mentira lo que estaba gritando , que de esto no se va a morir " .
Tiene buenas maneras , pero tiene también cara ojerosa de pocos amigos .
No puede o no quiere recordar los hechos extraordinarios que presenció a lo largo de dos décadas de heridos , muertos y resucitados .
Pero puede dar una lección sobre balística .
Me la da mientras nos tomamos un café .
Hablamos de revólveres y de pistolas .
Me asegura , por ejemplo , que la 9 milímetros no tiene mucho poder de choque ni gran efecto destructivo .
Que la 45 destroza mucho más .
Y que las balas calibre 22 , que son paradójicamente las más chicas , rebotan por todos lados y hacen un gran daño .
Recuerda una mujer embarazada casi a término que ingresó con un balazo en el pecho .
Estaba inconsciente y trataron de hacer dos cosas a la vez : salvarla a ella y a su bebé .
No era posible , así que tomaron en un segundo la decisión de practicarle allí mismo una cesárea : la mujer murió , pero el chico nació milagrosamente de ese cuerpo terminado .
No hay milagros - me corrige - .
No vi ningún milagro en veinte años de profesión .
Sólo buena y mala suerte .
A pesar de eso , Eskenazi salvó a varios hombres a los que les había penetrado una bala directamente en el corazón , y a muchos más con heridas gravísimas en la cabeza .
A un paciente en especial , un proyectil le había pegado en la frente y se le había quedado ahí alojado , haciéndolo sangrar a chorros , pero sin producir un hematoma interno que lo hubiera mandado directo a la tumba .
Con el barbijo y el bisturí , el cirujano extirpa siempre esas balas imposibles , se cambia y se va a su casa como si hubiera arreglado un calefón .
También atiende , claro está , apuñalados de toda estirpe y todo color .
Al principio , los coreanos se abrían la panza los unos a los otros con catana , una especie de alfanje oriental .
Y ahora Eskenazi cuenta las salvajadas de los narcos peruanos como si estuviera relatando un partido tedioso de la primera C. Aunque , por supuesto , no le resulta nada fácil salir del quirófano y comunicarles a los hermanos de un agredido que el paciente se ha quedado en la operación .
En ocasiones , escucha que los familiares salen corriendo con sed de venganza , mientras gritan en un llanto : " ¡ Lo voy a matar , lo voy matar ! "
Y el cirujano les comenta entonces a sus compañeros : " Preparemos el quirófano porque en cualquier momento viene otro " .
A veces , operados y encadenados por la policía en las camas del hospital , tuvo al homicida y a su propia víctima , o a dos enemigos enconados que querían seguir matándose .
El hospital está en el centro de los traumas y la guardia del Piñero es noticia casi todos los días .

Mécanico de cuerpos
Es evidente que tiene un yelmo de acero inoxidable el cirujano del trauma .
Una segunda piel que le permite sobrevivir , con humor negro , a todas estas asperezas de trinchera .
A veces , de noche y en su casa , Eduardo Eskezani mira Dr. House y se ríe de su personalidad cínica .
Comprende que los hombres que han decidido vivir al borde del fuego necesitan trajes de amianto psicológicos para mantener la cordura .
Ha viajado a otros países y sabe que no existen diferencias sustanciales entre esos médicos de película y los médicos argentinos .
La única diferencia es el presupuesto , que permite más personal auxiliar , mejor aparatología y más instrumentos al alcance de la mano .
Eskenazi se crió en un país donde los médicos trabajan sin elementos y con sueldos módicos , pero con enormes dosis de vocación y creatividad .
El mismo tiene varios trabajos para parar la olla , a pesar de ser uno de los más grandes cirujanos del país .
La falsa idea de que los cirujanos se hacen ricos , sin embargo , lo lleva a un diálogo irónico .
Dice que un mecánico le explicaba una vez a un cirujano que él también abría y revisaba el corazón del auto , cambiaba válvulas , obturaba caños , reparaba pequeñas piezas y luego volvía a cerrarlo .
" ¿ Por qué entonces gano menos que usted si yo hago lo mismo ? " , le preguntó .
El cirujano le respondió suavemente : " ¿Y usted intentó alguna vez hacer todo eso con el motor encendido ? "
A Eskenazi no se le puede parar el motor .
No hay segundas oportunidades en la " hora de oro " .
Y la analogía con el mecánico no le parece nada mal .
De hecho se ve a sí mismo como un mecánico que arregla cuerpos .
La mayoría de las veces , los cuerpos de pacientes combativos que están enojados con el mundo y lo insultan en su delirio cocaínico , bajo el shock de la droga y de la violencia .
" Tranquilo que estoy acá para curarte " , les dice de buena manera .
Pero a veces no hay caso , y tiene que imponerse con su vozarrón temible .
Ha pasado su vida entera en esas salas dolorosas de la crispación : cumpleaños , feriados , navidades .
Pero no tiene fantasmas ni estrés , ni quiere ser un héroe ni busca el chantaje del sentimentalismo ni la compasión bienpensante .
Solo es un profesional en un país donde esta palabra no tiene ni siquiera buena prensa .
Me pide que no cuente cien chistes de humor negro que se hacen los médicos para sobrevivir al pesar de la guerra .
Porque ahí afuera hay una guerra diaria que nadie puede detener .
Le pregunto si padece el síndrome de Dios .
" ¿ Me preguntás si me lo creo ? - quiere saber -.
Para nada .
Hay una gran diferencia entre Dios y un cirujano .
Dios no sabe operar " .
Y sonríe .
Me sonríe con sus ojos cansados .

In the study of University of Helsinki and Sibelius Academy , Helsinki , the neurobiological basis of music in human evolution and communication was evaluated using candidate genes associated in the earlier studies with social bonding and cognitive functions .
The data consisted of 343 family members from 19 Finnish families with at least some professional musicians and / or active amateurs .
The musical aptitude was assessed using three music tests : the auditory structuring ability test ( Karma Music test ) and Carl Seashore 's pitch and time discrimination subtests .
Additionally participants filled in an extensive web - based self - report questionnaire and blood samples were collected from the study subjects over 12 years of age .
One part of the questionnaire was devised to chart the participants creative functions in music –composing , improvising and arranging of music .
In the study high music test scores were significantly associated with creative functions in music ( p< .0001 ) , suggesting composing , improvising and arranging music demands musical aptitude .
Creativity is a multifactorial genetic trait involving a complex network made up of a number of genes and environment .
Here was shown for the first time that the creative functions in music have a strong genetic component ( h2 =.84 ; composing h2 =.40 ; arranging h2 =.46 ; improvising h2 = .62 ) in Finnish multigenerational families .
Additionally the heritability estimates of the musical aptitude were remarkable .
To elucidate the neurobiological basis of music in human evolution and communication the researchers demonstrated an association of arginine vasopressin receptor 1A ( AVPR1A ) gene variants with musical aptitude .
In the previous studies the AVPR1A gene and its homologies have been associated with social , emotional and behavioral traits , including pair bonding and parenting .
The results suggest that the neurobiology of music perception and production is related to the pathways affecting intrinsic attachment behavior .
— Music is social communication between individuals .
Darwin proposed that singing is used to attract the opposite sex .
Furthermore , lullabies are implied to attach infant to a parent and singing or playing music together may add group cohesion .
Thus , it is justified to hypothesize that music perception and creativity in music are linked to the same phenotypic spectrum of human cognitive social skills , like human bonding and altruism both associated with AVPR1A .
We have shown for the first time in the molecular level that music perception has an attachment creating impact , says Liisa Ukkola .

We created a bean bag chair with a removable , storable artificial vagina that hides away right inside the chair itself .
And the Velcro that keeps the fake pussy in place becomes the self - closing seal on the storage compartment when the unit is removed .
While there ’s no award ( that we know of ) for excellence in furniture sex toys design , if there was , we think this chair deserves a nomination .
Before we got started on the chair , the first step was to assemble the “ fake pussy ” unit .
Taking a tip from various reader submissions we ’ve received , we used a rubber glove for the main “ receptacle ” .
If you have a latex allergy , of course , you ’ll want to use a vinyl or nitrile glove instead .
A toilet paper roll , with most of the TP still on it , is used for the “ holder ” .
Using a TP roll means you can custom size the roll to fit whatever type of glove or bag you ’re using by unrolling more or less paper from it .
The unit is meant to be replaceable in case it gets mucked up with extended use , and TP is cheap and readily available .
If toilet paper roll is too snug a fit , you can try using a paper towel roll .
First we wrapped the TP roll in duct tape to help hold it together and give it more substance , and to create a bit of a moisture barrier .
We wrapped vertical straps of tape around the roll from one hole to another .
Each piece of tape had a two - inch vertical cut in each end , making two flaps that could be crisscrossed and overlapped so the tape would lie more smoothly against the inner curve of the tube .
To prepare the glove , we inserted the fingers through the middle of the tube and turned the outer cuff down around the outside of the roll , then marked the glove at the top of the roll to get the position for the Velcro strips .
The glove was removed from the TP roll and we glued two equal length strips of hook Velcro and loop Velcro to each side of the glove .
We used Gorilla Glue and clamped it per the instructions .
After it was dry , the glove was replaced on the TP roll with the Velcro in position .
The first step in preparing the chair was to rip out a small opening in one side seam , about 5.5 inches long and about halfway along the bag .
Since the sides of the opening are going to wrap around the TP roll / pussy unit , we calculated the necessary length of the slit by finding the circumference of the TP roll and dividing by 2 .
We carefully tore the stitches out with a utility knife ( a seam ripper is easier if you have one ) , and then reinforced the ends of the opening with a few hand stitches so the opening would not unravel and enlarge further .
We wanted to put a plastic bag inside the opening for several reasons .
First , to keep the Styrofoam pellets from escaping when the pussy unit was removed or replaced ; second , to create a moisture barrier for any leaking lube or , uh , other fluids ; and third , to create a stowaway compartment where the pussy unit could be stored when not in use .
A quart - sized Ziploc bag happened to fit inside the opening perfectly .
After inserting the bag , we folded the edges of the fabric over into the inner edge of the bag and glued it in place .
Sewing the plastic bag to the fabric would be more appropriate if you expect to put a lot of strain on the unit or use it frequently .
When the plastic bag liner was secured , we cut two strips of Velcro – one
hooks and one loops – to fit along either side of the opening .
We glued
the Velcro strips onto the inside fold of the fabric so they faced each
other , clamping them while the glue dried .
The edge of each strip was just
slightly below the top of the opening so the Velcro would not be visible
when the opening was sealed .
Once the glue was dry , all we had to do was insert the pussy unit with the Velcro matched to the appropriate sides , and the bean bag was ready to rock and roll .
When you ’re finished you can disengage the Velcro and just push the fake pussy inside , then reseal the seam .
However , we recommend you take the unit out and clean it before storing it away , or you ’ll find a funky surprise the next time you open it up .
The Velcro recloses the seam securely , and if you turn the bag around , it can be used for seating with no one the wiser to its other purpose .
Bonus Project !
Here is a low - budget alternative to our fuckable bean bag chair .
You might want to try this design if you do n’t want to buy a bean bag chair to fuck , or do n’t want to cut your bean bag chair up .
This toy is also very quick and easy to make , since it requires only scissors and duct tape for assembly .
The materials you ’ll need are :
A rubber or nitrile glove
A roll of toilet paper
Duct tape
Scissors
A large ( 30 gallon ) heavy - duty trash bag ( the new “ stretchy ” kind works best )
Styrofoam packing peanuts ( enough to fill the trash bag )
The artificial vagina unit for this project is basically the same as that used in the bean bag chair , minus the Velcro .
Remove TP from the toilet paper roll until it ’s the right size for the glove cuff to fit over it snugly .
Reinforce the TP roll with vertical layers of duct tape , insert the fingers through the hole , turn the cuff inside out and pull down the outside of the roll .
Cut an X in the center of one side of the trash bag , making it just large enough for the TP roll to fit through .
Turn the bag inside out and insert the glove / TP roll unit fingers first from the other side .
Make sure the triangular flaps are all folded inward so they encircle the TP roll evenly .
Secure each flap with a small piece of duct tape , then wrap tape all the way around the cylinder to tape all the tabs down .
Make sure the tape overlaps some onto the glove cuff .
Turn the bag right side out and fill with Styrofoam peanuts .
You can “ shape ” it if you want by stretching out the bag in places to form “ breasts ” , or insert small pillows or balls as breasts in addition to the Styrofoam pellets .
Pack the filling in tightly and tie the bag off at the top .
Cepheid stars in galaxies such as M81 , shown here .
The stars could offer a new way to measure distances to objects in the universe .
Image courtesy of Ohio State University . ” width = ” 580 ″ height = ” 535 ″ class=” size - medium wp-image-32187 ″ />
Using a rare type of giant Cepheid variable stars as cosmic milemarkers , astronomers have found a way to measure distances to objects three times farther away in space than previously possible .
Classical Cepheids are stars that pulse in brightness and have long been used as reference points for measuring distances in the nearby Universe .
But astronomers have found a way to use “ ultra long period ” ( ULP ) Cepheid variables as beacons to measure distances up to 300 million light years and beyond .
Classical cepheids are bright , but beyond 100 million light years from Earth , their signal gets lost among other bright stars , said Jonathan Bird , doctoral student in astronomy at Ohio State , who discussed his findings at the American Astronomical Society conference on Monday .
But ULPs are a rare and extra - bright class of Cepheid , which pulse very slowly .
Astronomers have also long sthought that ULP cepheids do n’t evolve the same way as other cepheids .
In this study , however , astronomers found the first evidence of a ULP cepheid evolving the same way as a classical Cepheid ..
There are several methods for calculating the distance to stars , and astronomers often have to combine methods to indirectly measure a distance .
The usual analogy is a ladder , with each new method a higher rung above another .
At each new rung of the cosmic distance ladder , the errors add up , reducing the precision of the overall measurement .
So any single method that can skip the rungs of the ladder is a prized tool for probing the universe .
Krzysztof Stanek , professor of astronomy at Ohio State , applied a direct measurement technique in 2006 , when he used the light emerging from a binary star system in the galaxy M33 to measure the distance to that galaxy for the first time .
M33 is 3 million light years from Earth .
This new technique using ULP cepheids is different .
It ’s an indirect method , but this initial study suggests that the method would work for galaxies that are much farther away than M33 .
“ We found ultra long period cepheids to be a potentially powerful distance indicator .
We believe they could provide the first direct stellar distance measurements to galaxies in the range of 50 - 100 megaparsecs ( 150 million – 326 million light years ) and well beyond that , ” Stanek said .
Because researchers generally do n’t take note of ultra long period cepheids , there are few of them in the astronomical record .
For this study , Stanek , Bird and Ohio State doctoral student Jose Prieto uncovered 18 ULP cepheids from the literature .
Each was located in a nearby galaxy , such as the Small Magellanic Cloud .
The distances to these nearby galaxies are well known , so the astronomers used that knowledge to calibrate the distance to the ULP cepheids .
They found that they could use ULP cepheids to determine distance with a 10 - 20 percent error — a rate typical of other methods that make up the cosmic distance ladder .
“ We hope to reduce that error as more people take note of ULP cepheids in their stellar surveys , ” Bird said .
“ What we ’ve shown so far is that the method works in principle , and the results are encouraging . ”
Bird explained why astronomers have ignored ULP cepheids in the past .
Short period cepheids , those that brighten and dim every few days , make good distance markers in space because their period is directly related to their brightness — and astronomers can use that brightness information to calculate the distance .
Polaris , the North Star , is a well known and classical cepheid .
But astronomers have always thought that ULP cepheids , which brighten and dim over the course of a few months or longer , do n’t obey this relation .
They are larger and brighter than the typical cepheid .
In fact , they are larger and brighter than most stars ; in this study , for example , the 18 ULP cepheids ranged in size from 12 - 20 times the mass of our sun .
The brightness makes them good distance markers , Stanek said .
Typical cepheids are harder to spot in distant galaxies , as their light blends in with other stars .
ULP cepheids are bright enough to stand out .
Astronomers have also long suspected that ULP cepheids do n’t evolve the same way as other cepheids .
In this study , however , the Ohio State team found the first evidence of a ULP cepheid evolving as a more classical cepheid does .
A classical cepheid will grow hotter and cooler many times over its lifetime .
In - between , the outer layers of the star become unstable , which causes the changes in brightness .
ULP cepheids are thought to go through this period of instability only once , and going in only one direction — from hotter to cooler .
But as the astronomers pieced together data from different parts of the literature for this study , they discovered that one of the ULP cepheids — a star in the Small Magellanic Cloud dubbed HV829 — is clearly moving in the opposite direction .
Forty years ago , HV829 pulsed every 87.6 days .
Now it pulses every 84.4 days .
Two other measurements found in the literature confirm that the period has been shrinking steadily in the decades in between , which indicates that the star itself is shrinking , and getting hotter .
The astronomers concluded that ULP cepheids may help astronomers not only measure the universe , but also learn more about how very massive stars evolve .
Some of these results were reported in the Astrophysical Journal in April 2009 .
Since that paper was written , the Ohio State astronomers have started using the Large Binocular Telescope in Tucson , Arizona to look for more ULP cepheids .
Stanek says that they ’ve found a few good candidates in the galaxy M81 , but those results have yet to be confirmed .

While the PSPgo and its removal of the UMD drive is considered a godsend to developers and consumers alike , European retail outlets are n’t the biggest fans of the PSPgo since they are n’t able to receive any profit from software sales for the device .
A solution to this dilemma would be wider support of PSN Cards ( which are n’t even available in Europe ) for retailers .
Hopefully this problem is remedied before the launch of the PSP Go this Fall .
With the bigger push on digital distribution , it ’s more than likely that SCEE will roll out the European distribution of PSN cards in order to retain retail support .

Dickie may be a little panicked because Obama plans to release the Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) report this summer , maybe even next month .
If the cumulative findings of misconduct in this report show that the torture lawyers acted as advocates rather than advisers , then the memos did not constitute appropriate OLC legal advice .
Thus , the Lizzie / Dickie campaign may be their preemptive strike to make their case before the OPR report is publicly released .
The stakes are high for Dickie because if the legal advice defense is eliminated , then he will have the impossible burden of proving that the prisoners were not tortured unless he has a Plan B defense .
We have already seen hints of Plan B : Bush was the Unilateral Decider and I just followed orders in my subordinate role !
Cheney and Rice have already shifted gears , pointing fingers at Bush and the " administration " , respectively , as having authorized the torture rather than relying on the torture memos as " authority " provided by advice of counsel .
The Advice of Counsel Defense
In 2005 , Bush succeeded in obtaining a major CYA law of advice of counsel defense that applies to any civil or criminal prosecution against government officials based on " specific operational practices " ( or torture , etc ) that were " officially authorized and determined to be lawful at the time that they were conducted " involving the " detention and interrogation " of terrorist suspects :
[ I ]t shall be a defense that such officer , employee , member of the Armed Forces , or other agent did not know that the practices were unlawful and a person of ordinary sense and understanding would not know the practices were unlawful .
Good faith reliance on advice of counsel should be an important factor , among others , to consider in assessing whether a person of ordinary sense and understanding would have known the practices to be unlawful .
So , Bush Team figures that they can just whip out the torture memos as advice of counsel .
After all , the OLC is authorized to provide " advice and opinion on questions of law when required by the President . "
The OLC opinions are " authoritative legal advice " and binding precedent on what the President " can and can not legally do . "
As Bush told Larry King one week before leaving office , the torture was legal because it was backed by legal opinions :
No .
No . Everything we did was -- you know , it had legal -- legal opinions behind it .
Look , you 're sitting there , you 've captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
He 's the guy that ordered the September the 11th attacks .
And we want to know what he knows in order to protect the United States of America .
And I got legal opinions that said whatever we 're going to do is legal .
Bush Team had every right to be cocky and confidant before because " questionable conduct backed by a favorable OLC memo will almost always pass muster " because the OLC memos " serve as law in the executive branch . "
However , AG Holder stated in confirmation hearings that " favorable OLC opinions " would not shield government officials from liability if the op was not " appropriately and in good faith drafted . "
More and more facts show that the torture memos do not constitute valid legal advice .
Therefore , this defense should not be applicable to the very persons who twisted the process to reach a predetermined outcome contrary to law .
(1) The lawyer ’s role as adviser versus advocate show torture lawyers did not provide legal advice to Bush .
The OPR conducted an investigation of the torture lawyers to answer several issues , including whether Bush ’s torture lawyers issued an opinion of legal advice to Bush or engaged in legal advocacy to create a " roadmap to committing crimes and getting away with it . "
Among the questions it is expected to consider is whether the memos were an independent judgment of the limits of the federal anti-torture statute or were deliberately skewed to justify the use of techniques proposed by the C.I.A .
This issue touches on the distinction between the two primary roles that lawyers have with clients of adviser or advocate and how the lawyer ’s work as adviser is different from advocacy work .
When lawyers advise clients by preparing legal opinions , lawyers conduct objective analysis .
When a client asks , can I do X , the lawyer often does not know the answer even in a specialized practice because there are so many statutes and judicial opinions to analyze in the context of the facts of a client ’s particular case .
So , lawyers are charged with a research mission to find the governing statutes and relevant cases and then analyze that law with the particular facts presented by the client .
This objective analysis is designed to protect the client by advising of potential risks as well as enable the client to reach a fully informed decision .
As noted in a Congressional hearing on the OLC , it is the " objective analysis of the controlling law " that should have been presented in the torture memos .
However , the torture memos are based on subjective analysis or advocacy that is not the role of OLC lawyers .
In subjective analysis , the lawyers are essentially in battle - station mode .
The lawyer has already performed legal research to determine the law , the client has agreed with the legal theories presented by the lawyer , and now is the time to persuade opposing parties or the courts that our legal argument should prevail .
Subjective advocacy is used when writing legal briefs , for example , where the goal is to create ethical and legal arguments to reach a desired outcome for our clients .
However , subjective advocacy is generally limited to those situations where other parties can question and challenge the legitimacy of the arguments .
The OLC lawyers used an unethical form of subjective advocacy when they twisted the statutory law and ignored relevant judicial opinions to jam a square peg into a round hole in order to " authorize " torture .
Thus , one issue the OPR investigators focused on was " whether the memo 's authors deliberately slanted their legal advice to provide the White House with the conclusions it wanted . "
(2) The failure to cite and analyze torture precedent .
It is precisely because the " OLC opinions are controlling on questions of law within the Executive Branch " that the DOJ best practices for OLC opinions issued in 2005 by Bradbury mandates that the " opinions be clear , accurate , thoroughly researched , and soundly reasoned . "
Thorough research and analysis is part of the objectivity governing a lawyer ’s role as adviser .
This requires doing legal research to find the published judicial opinions that have discussed whether certain methods constitute torture or whether government officials may be held liable for torture .
However , one apparent finding of the OPR report is that the torture memos did not cite torture case law precedent from the US or internationally .
For example , it only took a few minutes on Google to find a 1936 US Supreme Court case holding that murder convictions based on confessions forced by physical torture were constitutionally void .
There is also the 1983 federal court case upholding the convictions of a county sheriff and deputies for interrogating prisoners with water torture to compel confessions .
These cases should have been discussed , and distinguished to show that Bush Team had legal reasons why the cases did not constitute controlling authority .
Instead , the torture memos simply left relevant cases out of the opinions , rendering the opinions neither " thoroughly researched " nor " soundly reasoned . "
(3) The OLC does not issue opinions on the " legality of past conduct . "
The OLC best practices states " opinions of the Office should address legal questions prospectively ; OLC avoids opining on the legality of past conduct . "
However , the CIA requested and obtained " authorization to torture prior to the issuance of the DOJ memos that are the claimed " authority " for torture .
The CIA requested approval to torture Abu Zubaydah in May 2002 or 3 months before " authorization " was provided by the DOJ torture memos in August 2002 .
Rice " personally conveyed the administration 's approval for waterboarding of Zubaydah , a high - level detainee , to then - CIA Director George Tenet in July 2002 . "
It was Gonzales who provided the " authorization " for torture .
Another little problem arises because Gonzales was not the AG then but only Bush ’s lawyer who did not have authority to " authorize " torture by the CIA .
(4) The OLC lacks authority to issue policy decisions .
The Bush Team continually cite the torture memos as the document that " authorized " torture as legal .
However , the OLC performs a " purely advisory role " of legal advice and analysis to " inform the decisionmaking of its clients , the legal advice is not itself dispositive as to any policy adopted by an agency " because the OLC " lacks the authority " to make " any policy decision . "
The Bush Team simply wanted the torture memos as a CYA shield to protect them from prosecutions .
However , not even Mr. Unitary Executive believed that a DOJ memo was needed to vest him with " authority " to order the torture prior to the issuance of the torture memos .
Thus , all roads lead back to the rule of law : Can a president unilaterally order torture that violates US and international law .

Dr. Jared Strote at the University of Washington Medical Center led a group that examined the medical records of nearly 900 patients subdued by the Seattle Police Department with a Taser over a six - year period .
Less than one percent required hospital admission for an injury related to the restraint incident .
No deaths occurred , even when patients exhibited signs of excited delirium .
Meanwhile , a separate study led by Dr. Strote looked at every use of force by the Seattle Police Department in one year .
Again , despite nearly 900 incidents , injuries related to the use of force were rare .
Just over one percent required hospital admission for an injury related to the use of force by police .
There were two deaths , both due to firearms .
The researchers conclude that injuries inflicted by police officers in the process of subduing suspects are relatively rare .
Other related findings include a high incidence of drug and alcohol use and psychiatric history among those being restrained .
The presentations , entitled “ Injuries Associated With Law Enforcement Use Of Conducted Electrical Weapons ” and “ Injuries Associated With Law Enforcement Use Of Force , ” will be presented in the Trauma forum at the 2009 SAEM Annual Meeting at the Sheraton New Orleans on May 17 , 2009 .
Abstracts are published in Vol. 16 , No. 4 , Supplement 1 , April 2009 of Academic Emergency Medicine , the official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine .

WASHINGTON — Amazing what happens when you cast aside the testosterone .
I know bristling Dick Cheney believes America ’s enemies now perceive “ a weak president , ” as do sundry Republican senators , but the truth is that foes of the United States have been disarmed by Barack Obama ’s no -drama diplomacy .
Call it the mellow doctrine .
Neither idealistic nor classic realpolitik , it involves finding strength through unconventional means : acknowledgment of the limits of American power ; frankness about U.S. failings ; careful listening ; fear reduction ; adroit deployment of the wide appeal of brand Barack Hussein Obama ; and jujitsu engagement .
Already the mellow doctrine has brought some remarkable shifts , even if more time is needed to see its results .
The Castro brothers in Cuba are squabbling over the meaning of Obama ’s overtures .
Venezuela ’s Hugo Chávez has gone gooey - eyed over the Yanqui president .
Turkey relented on a major NATO dispute , persuaded of the importance of Obama ’s conciliatory message to Muslims .

The economic downturn and a high debt load have dragged the stock price to below $ 9 as of Friday , down from the October 2007 high of $ 148 .
The company has had to halt construction of a condominium tower in Las Vegas and more than one new hotel - casino in Macao because of tightening credit .
Also delayed are a 300 - room hotel and a mall in Bethlehem ; their frames stand next to the casino .
But Mr. Adelson said he expected to be able to restart most of this construction by year ’s end .
“ Early on , you would look at the quarterly reports and the Bethlehem Steel facility would barely get a mention in the overall strategy of the corporation , ” said Bethlehem ’s mayor , John Callahan .
“ Now , it ’s become clear this facility has become critically important to the survival of the company . ”
It is also critically important to the city .
The mayor said he expected the casino , the largest in Pennsylvania , to draw more than 4.5 million visitors a year and provide about $ 9 million to the city ’s general fund , which this year stands at $ 55 million .
Mr. Callahan sees this as the entertainment part of a redevelopment that also includes plans for an arts center and television station , a museum focused on American industrial history and condos to be built in a former steel plant building .
But while opening day may be promising , the resort has significant competition from casinos in the Poconos and Atlantic City , among other places in the general region .
“ I do think this is quite lovely , but it ’s not as close to me as the casinos I already go to , ” said Francine Andrews , 55 , of Lawrenceville , N.J. “ I might come back , but only for a special occasion . ”
Here in Bethlehem , what delighted people like Ms. Corroda and Rich Fenstermacher , who worked for Bethlehem Steel for 34 years and is now a casino security officer here , were the homages to the company whose product helped build skyscrapers , railroads and military armament for a century .
Exposed piping and a turreted ceiling were built to resemble the style of some of the buildings , and brick walls match the look of the structures that housed the factories .
“ Just walking around in here , they do n’t even have to pay me , ” gushed Mr. Fenstermacher , 65 .
“ I mean , this is Bethlehem Steel .
Just look around you .
You see the lighting that makes it look like dripping metal .
The glow in those windows , that ’s how the windows lit up in the evening .
They are preserving a legacy here . ”
AIKEN , S.C. , April 22 ( UPI ) -- Former Chicago Bears defensive back William " The Refrigerator " Perry is reported in serious condition at a hospital near his home in Aiken , S.C .
Perry , 46 , was diagnosed last June with Guillain - Barre syndrome , an inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nerves outside the brain and spinal cord , the Chicago Tribune reported Wednesday .

At the time , Perry spent six months in the hospital because of complications related to the illness .
His agent , Adam Plotkin , says Perry developed chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy , which is a cousin of Guillan - Barre .
" He is improving every day and they hope he is released in a week or two , " says Plotkin .
Perry played 10 seasons in the NFL , eight of them with the Chicago Bears and two with the Philadelphia Eagles , the Chicago Sun -Times reports .
He earned the nickname " The Refrigerator " for his 6 - foot - 2 , 350 - pound frame .
Median # of tweets = 1 June 3 , 2009

Fascinating study in the Harvard Business Review about twitter .
It looks at 300,000 users and covers differences in behavior between men and women , # of followers and # following .
But most interestingly , it looks at usage :
Twitter ’s usage patterns are also very different from a typical on - line social network .
A typical Twitter user contributes very rarely .
Among Twitter users , the median number of lifetime tweets per user is one .
This translates into over half of Twitter users tweeting less than once every 74 days .
At the same time there is a small contingent of users who are very active .
Specifically , the top 10 % of prolific Twitter users accounted for over 90 % of tweets .
On a typical online social network , the top 10 % of users account for 30 % of all production …
This implies that Twitter ’s resembles more of a one - way , one - to - many publishing service more than a two - way , peer - to - peer communication network .
The fact that half of twitterers have tweeted once or less , and that 75 % of twitterers have tweeted four times or less is quite astonishing .
It is consistent with Nielsen ’s finding that 60 % of Twitter users do n’t come back the next month .
With Facebook apps we have sometimes seen amazing growth driven by virality , followed by a dip towards a more sustainable level of usage .
When you are viral , a good portion of unique users are going to the site to sign up for the first time .
But if they do n’t stick , then you can see a “ shark fin ” shaped curve , as Andrew Chen has posted about in the past .
Twitter is not just another Facebook app .
Unlike many of the “ flash in the pan ” apps , Twitter is a verb , and has entered the popular consciousness .
The very high usage of the top users ( 90 % of tweets from 10 % of users ) also suggests a different model .
But it will be interesting to see how twitter usage continues to grow over the next few months

The Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services is considering prosecuting and banning some Scientology practices , in particular the use of the Scientology personality test to sell courses .
State Secretary Rigmor Aasrud said that the activities in question might be prosecuted as fraud or as violations of existing healthcare regulations .
A Norwegian Member of Parliament ( MP ) whose daughter killed herself after taking such a test , supports the idea of prosecuting illegal practices rather than trying to ban the movement as a whole .
Olav Gunnar Ballo ( left ) in the Norwegian Storting .
File photo by Lars Røed Hansen .
Also stupid or clearly false expressions must be allowed as free expressions in a democracy , as long as individuals are not harmed by the expressions .
The questionable thing about the Scientology cult is , however , that their operation is harmful for individuals .
— Olav Gunnar Ballo
The statement was made after three journalists from the online edition of the newspaper Verdens Gang ( VG ) took the test .
The journalists wore hidden recording devices , and did not disclose that they were journalists ; VG put the recordings on its website .
Scientology staff members told all three that they should buy a course to handle psychological issues .
Two of the journalists filled out the 200 questions with honest answers , while the third gave answers consistent with being depressed .
The " depressed " journalist was told that he should avoid traditional medicine , while one of the " normal " journalists was told that the course was her only hope for improvement unless she wanted to start taking " chemicals " .
Matthias Fosse , spokesperson for the Church of Scientology in Norway , said that the staff members in question were acting individually .
He said that the Church of Scientology does not give medical advice , but that it encourages people to focus on the side effects of medications , and is critical of the " over- medication " of psychiatric patients .
Olav Gunnar Ballo , a Norwegian MP and medical doctor whose daughter Kaja suddenly killed herself after a negative experience with the Scientology test in France in March 2008 , released a book about Kaja Ballo 's life in April 2009 .
The book debuted on 2nd place in the Norwegian best seller list .
Ballo listened to the recorded test result sessions from VG and said that he found the practice " horrible and harmful " .
He told the newspaper Dagbladet that Norway could have something to learn from the current French prosecution of Scientology corporations and individuals , by prosecuting specific harmful practices rather than banning Scientology as a whole .
Matthias Fosse said that France is a far more secular society than Norway , and that France were going too far in their prosecution .
He said that France has a list of 165 organizations considered to be " sects " , which not just included Scientology but also covered Baptists such as former U.S. president Bill Clinton .
The list which Fosse referred to is a list from the 1995 Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France .
Fosse said that the OSCE , the U.S. State Department and the UN had criticised French " violations of human rights " .

Iowa is the third US state to legalise same - sex marriages Iowa 's Supreme Court has ruled that a ban on same - sex marriages in the US state was unconstitutional .
The judges rejected an appeal against a lower court 's 2007 ruling that the ban violated the rights of gay men and women in the state .
The case stems from a 2005 suit filed by a New York - based gay - rights group on behalf of six gay and lesbian couples .
Iowa becomes the third US state to allow same - sex marriages , joining Connecticut and Massachusetts .
Other states allow civil partnerships or other unions , but these do not carry the same legal weight as marriages .
In its summary , the Supreme Court said the ruling " reaffirmed that a statute inconsistent with the Iowa Constitution must be declared void , even though it may be supported by strong and deep - seated traditional beliefs and popular opinion " .
Go get married , live happily ever after , live the American dream
Dennis Johnson
Lawyer
It said the ruling would remove language from Iowa 's legal code which limited marriage to being between a man and a woman .
Remaining statutes must also be " interpreted and applied in a manner allowing gay and lesbian people full access to the institution of civil marriage " , the court said .
Dennis Johnson , a lawyer for the plaintiffs , said it was " a great day for civil rights in Iowa " .
" We have all of you courageous plaintiffs to thank :
Go get married , live happily ever after , live the American dream , " he said .
No appeal Polk County Judge Robert Hanson had ruled in 2007 that Iowa 's 1998 Defense of Marriage Act , defining marriage as solely between a man and a woman , violated the couples ' constitutional rights .
California briefly legalised same sex marriage in 2009
But on the same day , Polk County Attorney John Sarcone filed an appeal arguing that the issue should be left to the legislature - that appeal has now been rejected .
The Associated Press reported that Mr Sarcone would not ask for a rehearing , meaning the court 's decision should take effect in three weeks ' time .
Lambda Legal , which filed the case , said the couples cited had been together for between five and 16 years and three of them had children .
The group had said the couples wanted " the responsibilities of marriage and the protections only marriage can provide " .
It said the couples ' children and any future children should have the right to " have their families treated fairly " .
Iowa is the first state to legalise gay marriage in the US Midwest - traditionally a more conservative area of the country .
Analysts said the ruling showed acceptance of same - sex marriage was becoming more mainstream .
The state of California briefly legalised same - sex marriage in 2008 .
Thousands of couples were married before the ruling was overturned by a referendum in November .

Oceanographers have long known that the 20 - year - old paradigm for describing the global ocean circulation– called the Great Ocean Conveyor – was an oversimplification .
It 's a useful depiction , but it 's like describing Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony as a catchy tune .
The conveyor belt paradigm says the Gulf Stream - warmed ocean releases heat to the atmosphere in the northern North Atlantic , leaving ocean water colder and denser as it moves north .
The cold waters sink and flow southward along the " deep western boundary current " that hugs the continental slope from Canada to the equator .
To replace the down - flowing water , warm surface waters from the tropics are pulled northward along the conveyor 's upper limb .
But while the conveyor belt paradigm establishes the melody , the subtleties and intricacies of the symphony of global ocean circulation largely remain a puzzle .
Now , research led by oceanographers at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) and Duke University have teased out a new piece of that puzzle , expanding our understanding of this circulation model .
Using field observations and computer models , the study shows that much of the southward flow of cold water from the Labrador Sea moves not along the deep western boundary current , but along a previously unknown path in the interior of the North Atlantic .
The study by co-principal authors Amy Bower , a senior scientist in the WHOI Department of Physical Oceanography , and Susan Lozier , a professor of physical oceanography at Duke University 's Nicholas School of the Environment , will be published in the May 14 issue of the research journal Nature .
" This new path is not constrained by the continental shelf .
It 's more diffuse , " said Bower .
" It 's a swath in the wide - open , turbulent interior of the North Atlantic and much more difficult to access and study . "
And since this cold southward - flowing water is thought to influence and perhaps moderate human - caused climate change , this finding may impact the work of global warming forecasters .
" This finding means it is going to be more difficult to measure climate signals in the deep ocean , " Lozier said .
" We thought we could just measure them in the Deep Western Boundary Current , but we really can't . "
Lozier and Bower first conceived of this program eight years ago .
Studies led by Lozier and other researchers had previously suggested cold northern waters might follow such " interior pathways " rather than the conveyor belt in route to subtropical regions of the North Atlantic .
But testing the idea meant developing an elaborate WHOI - led field program involving the launching of 76 special Range and Fixing of Sound " RAFOS " floats into the current south of the Labrador Sea between 2003 to 2006 .
The ambitious program would have been prohibitively expensive had it not been for a collaboration with Eugene Colbourne of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Center in St. Johns , Newfoundland .
Colbourne regularly conducts hydrographic surveys around the Grand Banks , and agreed to deploy the team 's RAFOS floats in groups of six every three months for three years .
Bower worked with a team at WHOI to build the floats and develop the plan for their deployment .
The " RAFOS " floats were configured to submerge at 700 or 1,500 meters depth – within the layer of the ocean where one constituent of the cold southward - flowing water , called Labrador Sea Water , travels .
They drifted with the currents for two years , recording location information as well as temperature and pressure measurements once a day .
After two years , the floats returned to the surface and transmitted all their data through the ARGOS satellite - based data retrieval system and downloaded to scientists in the lab .
To communicate with the floats and to track their position , the team deployed anchored low - amplitude sound beacons in the general area of the experiment , which were set to " ping " automatically every day .
The RAFOS floats 's onboard hydrophones detect the sound from the beacons , enabling scientists to determine the distance from the float to the beacon , based on the time delay between when the ping went off and when it was detected .
But only 8 percent of the RAFOS floats ' followed the conveyor belt of the Deep Western Boundary Current , according to the Nature report .
About 75 percent of them " escaped " that coast - hugging deep underwater pathway and instead drifted into the open ocean before they get around the Grand Banks .
Eight percent " is a remarkably low number in light of the expectation that the DWBC is the dominant pathway for Labrador Sea Water , " the researchers wrote .
Since the RAFOS float paths could only be tracked for two years , Lozier , her graduate student Stefan Gary , and German oceanographer Claus Boning also used a modeling program to simulate the launch and dispersal of more than 7,000 virtual " e- floats " from the same starting point .
Subjecting those e-floats to the same underwater dynamics as the real ones , the researchers then traced where they moved .
" The spread of the model and the RAFOS float trajectories after two years is very similar , " they reported .
" The new float observations and simulated float trajectories provide evidence that the southward interior pathway is more important for the transport of Labrador Sea Water through the subtropics than the DWBC , contrary to previous thinking , " their report concluded .
Next , Bower and Lozier hope to extend their research to study the southward flow of cold water originating even farther north in the Greenland Sea .

How many articles on the merits of disco can any self - respecting music lover tolerate ?
I ’d say probably two or three , which means that Splice is almost at its max .
Good disco is a balancing act .
The inherent cheesiness has to be offset by a danceable beat , nuanced musical arrangements , and a blistering horn section .
Of course when I say “ good ” disco , I ’m referring to the kind that retains any shred of relevance in 2009 , songs that can still be played without cringing and might even light up a dance floor .
From my experience mixing music in France , I can assure you that these songs do exist .
My friend Jon and I are trying to cultivate our very own soul music DJ set during our limited time here in Montpellier .
At our first gig , we noticed that the pure soul and mod sounds that inhabit most stateside and U.K. soul clubs failed to produce the same body - flailing enthusiasm as some of our electro cuts .
I think this was due in part to the venue ’s clientele and also because our French friends have a higher threshold for electronic sounds ; they actually crave them .
This made us explore more disco music than I ’d like to admit .
But some of our finds have elicited an overwhelmingly positive response and are now in heavy rotation , proving that disco not only bridges soul and electronic music , it sometimes sounds good doing it .
T.O.C Band “ Hand It Over ”
I do n’t know anything about this band except for the fact that they seemingly recorded on their own label — T.O.C Records — and that this single was released in 1983 .
The intro to the song hits you with that guitar jangle and the crazy horn breakdown that ’s begging to be sampled .
It ’s this next moment that usually makes or breaks the majority of disco tracks .
Disco vocals tend to define whether a track is palatable or not .
And they have killed many otherwise fine instrumentals .
The vocal melodies on “ Hand It Over ” are fresh and actually improve on the song ’s instrumentation .
Just listen to the awesomeness of that two - tiered chorus .
When the vocal coos peak alongside the horns and upbeat percussion you might even find yourself asking how this song is not actually Beyonce or Amerie .
Carl Carlton “ Dance With You ”
Detroit native Carl Carlton is a little - known legend in funk and disco circles .
He began his career as “ Little Carl ” Carlton , capitalizing on his near identical vocal delivery to Stevie Wonder .
Even if he did n’t prove to be a unique artist , he did posses a chameleon - like dexterity that spawned this classic number and this should - have - been classic .
“ Dance With You ” is clearly in disco territory with the voice modulations and synthesizers .
There ’s also the lyrical subject matter that pretty much explains the song ’s desired effect , from the opening line , “ I ’m hot , hot , hot , hot , ” to the spouting standard dance - centric lingo like “ … foxy lady drive me crazy ! ” in the verses .
Patrice Rushen “ Have n’t You Heard ” ( Larry Levan Edit )
You ’re already familiar with Patrice Rushen .
But in addition to inspiring Will Smith , she has accomplished many other musical feats .
She was the first female composer for the Grammy Awards , Emmy Awards , and the People ’s Choice Awards .
She won the Monterey Jazz Festival at age 18 .
Her background as a classical and jazz pianist is noticeable in a lot of her work and certainly in “ Have n’t You Heard . ”
Legendary DJ Larry Levan barely tweaked the number but gives it some teeth and more gorgeous synth - strings .
Sylvia Striplin “ Give Me Your Love ”
This song by the sweet - voiced Sylvia Striplin is universally understood as one of the best songs to come out of the disco era .
The two - line chorus just repeats and repeats .
Meanwhile , while the musical elements continue to surge forward , the bass line slides up and down , urging body movement .
Even though this track was released in 1980 , do n’t think for a second that this forward - thinking , string - swooping brand of disco is irrelevant today .
Call me freak , but i actually use a combination of various tools .
First Step : Tag& Rename - can't beat it when it comes to flexibility .
Second Step : Mp3Tag -
Check if all files have year , genre and that there is no mixed case in between ( like R&B and r&b , since iTunes handles it differently ) .
Format also the track # and make the text casing to Title Case .
Third Step : iTunes -
Here i check if all tags are now alright , correct the ones that might still be not ok .
Fourth Step : Media Monkey -
Once again revalidate the tags and use it to build the directory structure .
After this i have a clean and organized mp3 collection .
It 's a lot of hard work but at the end it looks beautiful in any player .
So at the end they all win ;-)
Apple may put News International 's nose out of joint with its definition of ' obscene ' , after rejecting a newspaper - reading iPhone app for reasons of rudeness .
Newspaper(s ) , an application that renders content from the world 's newspapers , was rejected by iTunes because it included the UK's Sun newspaper - complete with topless Page Three girl - on the grounds that it violates the iTunes policy on " obscene content " .
But the Sun reckons it 's a " family " paper , and takes accusations of pornography - pushing very seriously indeed .
According to a report on iLounge the publisher of Newspaper(s ) was recommended to resubmit the application once OS 3.0 is released , after which a suitable category will be available , but instead decided to remove the offending newspaper from the app .
Many years ago , when one UK mobile operator started putting Page Three girls into an " adult " section of their WAP site , they received swift rebuttal from News International .
The owners of the Sun advised that the topless lovelies were not pornography , but just fun , family content .
The operator swiftly created a " glamour " section of the site , which was acceptable to the tab , just about .
We contacted the Sun for comment , but other than expressing incredulity at Apple 's position and promising to look into it they declined to comment further .
Still , you can be sure that News International will be having a few choice words with the boys in Cupertino . ®
Birmingham police beating video
A group of Birmingham police officers beat an already - unconscious suspect with fists , feet and a billy club , a battering caught on videotape until a police officer turned off the patrol car camera .
Authorities believe the video , taken in January 2008 after a chase by several area law enforcement agencies ended when the fleeing suspect 's van flipped , has been seen by numerous Birmingham officers and as many as a half - dozen supervisors over the past year .
But top city and police officials were n't made aware of the taped beating until they were contacted by the district attorney 's office three months ago .
In fact , investigators say , the suspect , Anthony Warren , did n't even know he'd been beaten until the tape surfaced in March .
Warren was ejected from the vehicle and knocked unconscious , and thought all of his injuries were sustained in the wreck .
Police Chief A.C. Roper called the video " shameful . "
Mayor Larry Langford said it was " disgusting . "
After an internal investigation into the five officers shown in the video ended Monday , Langford and Roper are scheduled to announce disciplinary action this morning against those officers .
" Police brutality changed Birmingham , " Langford said in an interview .
" We are not going back . "
Langford noted that Warren was " knocked out cold before they even got there .
...
We are not going to tolerate that . "
Roper said the video shamed the Police Department and the citizens served by the department .
" It was also troubling because these are seasoned , veteran officers , " Roper said .
Roper said Tuesday there will be additional disciplinary action against supervisors who failed to report the incident to higher - ups .
He has demanded the Internal Affairs Division track down every supervisor who saw the videotape , including those who have since retired .
The chief has also called in the Alabama Bureau of Investigation to probe possible criminal charges against the officers involved in the incident .
Four of the five officers worked in the department 's Vice and Narcotics Unit .
The other was a North Precinct patrolman .
The 22 - minute chase on Jan. 23 , 2008 , involved nine police cars , and included officers from Birmingham , Hoover and the Jefferson County Sheriff 's Department .
It began near the downtown Police Department , when a North Precinct officer tried to question Warren about suspicious behavior .
The video , taken from inside a Birmingham Police patrol car , follows the chase from downtown Birmingham on Interstate 59 to Trussville , down I -459 to Hoover and around the Riverchase Galleria , where on U.S. 31 the Ford van driven by Warren struck and injured a Hoover police officer on foot .
Throughout the chase , the video shows Warren weaving through heavy traffic , cutting off motorists and crossing multiple lanes at speeds Langford said exceeded 100 mph .
The chase ended on a ramp back onto I -459 when a police cruiser nudged the van , causing it to flip .
Warren , 38 , was thrown out of the driver 's side window , landing face down and apparently unconscious .
Officers converged on him , beating him even though he never moved .
On the video , Warren makes no defensive moves as he is beaten with billy clubs , punched and kicked .
The beating on the video lasted 12 seconds before officers stepped back and the camera was turned off .
At the time of his arrest and beating , Warren , of Vestavia Hills , had a string of felony arrests and convictions dating back to 1989 for crimes including theft , receiving stolen property and escape .
UAB Hospital officials said Warren was released from the hospital five days after the incident .
He was booked into the Jefferson County Jail on Jan. 28 , with his bond set at $ 1 million .
Warren was charged with attempted murder as a result of the chase but pleaded guilty in March 2009 to first - degree assault .
He was sentenced to 20 years in prison .
Top police officials became aware that the tape showed Warren being beaten the day Warren 's trial was to begin .
Because he pleaded guilty there was no trial .
Prosecutors notified top police officials of the tape .
" No doubt this guy was a menace to society , but he did n't deserve what happened to him , bottom line , " Roper said .
" I fully support our officers and fully believe in officer safety , but this video speaks for itself . "
Roper , who took office just a few months before the beating and since has made major changes in his command staff , emphasized that the incident is not reflective of the majority of Birmingham officers .
" We handle over 7,000 calls per week and receive very few use of force complaints because the vast majority are extremely professional in carrying out their duties , " he said .
" This tape shows a problem , and it 's our job to fix it . "

The final chapter from The Dollar Crisis
Richard Duncan published his revised edition of The Dollar Crisis in 2005 .
It is a remarkably prescient analysis of the the problems now facing the global economy .
I reproduce the short and somewhat chilling final chapter from the book below .
Chapter 20 : Bernankeism
Anticipating the Policy Response to Global Deflation
“ Like gold , U.S. dollars have value only to the extent that they are strictly limited in supply .
But the U.S. government has a technology , called a printing press ( or , today , its electronic equivalent ) , that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost . ”
Fed Governor Ben Bernanke , 2002
The Fed would already be faced with its worst nightmare , deflation in the United States , had the price of oil not risen above US $ 50 a barrel following the U.S. invasion of Iraq .
Globalization is exerting tremendous downward pressure on the U.S. cost structure that can only intensify in the years ahead as service sector jobs follow manufacturing jobs offshore .
A correction in the U.S. current account deficit will cause the floor to drop out from under global prices and threaten the world with a 1930s - style deflationary depression .
The following paragraphs will consider how policymakers in the United States are likely to respond to that event .
America ’s free trade policy , which it has pursued for decades , is obviously flawed .
Free trade between countries with enormous wage rate differentials , and within an international monetary system entirely lacking in any mechanism to prevent large - scale , persistent trade imbalances , is untenable .
However , U.S. policymakers are afflicted by the collective hypnosis of conventional wisdom which has taught them that free trade is good and must always be good under any and all circumstances .
It is anyone ’s guess as to how much longer those in charge of economic policy in the U.S. will cling on to this strange idea .
Meanwhile , it is almost certain that they will respond to the approaching crisis by applying the two great economic policy tools of the last century : Keynesianism and monetarism .
The abuse of those tools will prolong and exacerbate the death throes of the dollar standard .
The first recourse will be to employ more fiscal stimuli .
With prices falling and in light of the extraordinary amount of paper that has been created in recent years , interest rates will be very low and there will be little difficulty in paying interest on a much larger amount of government debt .
It would not be surprising to see the U.S. budget deficit surpass US $ 1 trillion by 2007 or 2008 if the U.S. current account has come down significantly by that time .
[ Note : the U.S current account deficit has started to fall significantly in the last few months and the budget deficit is likely to exceed US $ 1 trillion in 2009 ]
If , at that point , the U.S. current account deficit has been reduced , foreign central banks would not have a sufficient inflow of dollars to finance such a large deterioration in the U.S. budget deficit , even assuming that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have ceased issuing any new , competing , debt of their own .
The Fed , however , as Governor Bernanke explained , has already put considerable thought into how to deal with such a contingency and stands ready , in Bernanke ’s opinion , to support “ a broad - based tax cut ” through “ a program of open - market purchases to alleviate any tendency for interest rates to rise . ”
How long could such “ cooperation between the monetary and fiscal authorities ” underpin the global economy ?
For quite a number of years , most probably .
Economic cycles play themselves out over very long periods of time .
Moreover , U.S. policymakers will use every last tool at their disposal to prevent , or at least delay , a global depression .
An economic system underpinned by large - scale fiscal stimulus financed by central bank monetization of government debt could hardly be described as capitalism ( perhaps the term “ Bernankeism ” would be appropriate ) but , with any luck , it could stave off disaster for a considerable length of time .
Nevertheless , despite the best efforts of policymakers to keep the dollar standard alive and to stave off the depression that would most probably follow its collapse , ultimately , one of the following scenarios is likely to overwhelm even Bernankeism :
1 . A protectionist backlash against free trade , resulting in a trade war similar to that which occurred during the Great Depression .
2. A U.S. asset price bubble ( as interest rates fall toward zero ) that drives property prices so high they ca n’t be financed even at very low interest rates .
This is similar to what occurred in Japan at the end of the 1980s .
3 . A meltdown of the under - regulated US $ 200 trillion derivatives market .
( Two hundred trillion U.S. dollars is roughly six times global GDP . )
4 . A loss of nerve on the part of policymakers that deters them from undertaking ever more unorthodox economic policies , resulting in a “ deer in the headlights ” kind of policy freeze .
5 . A decline in interest rates to 0 % , or very near 0 % , as in Japan at present .
Any one of the first four scenarios could undermine the dollar standard , but the final scenario , where interest rates fall very near 0 % , would certainly deal it a fatal blow .
From that point , the only option left to stimulate aggregate demand would be to drop paper money from helicopters .
That too would fail , however , for who would accept paper dropped from helicopters in exchange for real goods and services ?
Hyperinflation would quickly set in .
Economic transactions would then be conducted through barter rather than via the medium of a debased script .
Eventually , a gold standard would re-emerge .
Exactly how these events will unfold is impossible to forecast ; nevertheless , the eventual outcome is within sight .
The dollar standard is inherently flawed and increasingly unstable .
Its demise is imminent .
The only question is , will it be death by fire — hyperinflation — or death by ice — deflation ?
Fortunes will be made and lost , depending on the answer to that question .
Are we clear on this ?

The World As It Was
Imagine a world of green , ferns and evergreens , from shrubs to trees that tower into the sky like redwoods .
The conifer forests stretch on as far as the eye can see .
A river lazily meanders through the fields .
The climate is warm , but comfortable .
Everywhere you look animal life flourishes and fills the land with abundance .
The air is filled with dragonflies and the ground crawls with beetles , centipedes , spiders and scorpions , some much larger than anything we see today .
Images of late Permian animals from wikimedia commons
Even more amazing are the amphibians and reptiles .
They are everywhere and range in size from tiny scampering lizards to vast herds of Hummer size giants grazing on the greenery .
Smaller plant eaters scamper here and there , disappearing into burrows and popping up elsewhere .
Even more amazing are the predators – think giant hairless reptilian werewolves with saber teeth – some reaching almost fifteen feet long .
It seems that everywhere you look there are more new plants and animals .
The world is bursting with diversity of flora and fauna .
We have travelled back in time , 252 million years to the last days of the Permian period .
At this time plate tectonics have gathered together all the continents of earth into on giant landmass , a supercontinent called Pangaea .
Map of the earth at the end of the Permian period 250 million years ago .
We must now visit the oceans , where life itself began .
All of the world ’s oceans have been combined into an ocean of unbelievable proportions : Panthalassa .
Spanning three quarters of the globe , it contains uncharted depths .
This ocean is a mystery ; we do not know what life prowled its waters .
The imagination fills with images of massive sea serpents and alien squid .
A very slow conveyer belt of hot and cold currents carry nourishing oxygen into the deepest trenches before the oxygen depleted waters return the surface where gas exchanges take place that replenish the oxygen and life goes on .
Unlike modern oceans , these oceans are stratified with layers of warm water remaining mostly at the surface and cold water sinking to the depths .
The deepest , oxygen poor parts of Panthalassa are the home and breeding ground to bacteria that consume sulfur to produce energy and do not need oxygen to survive .
There is also a vast but shallow sea almost surrounded by Pangaea – the Tethys Sea .
Plunge into this sea and discover a massive reef system that rivals the complexity of any system today .
Trilobites crawl through the waters as alien looking crabs , clams , corals and sponges cover every available square inch of space .
Fish dart in and out of the safety of the corals and sharks patrol the open waters .
Ammonites , secure in their spiral shells hunt with probing tentacles .
End Permian sea life .
Like the modern world , the ecosphere of the Permian is complete .
The same webs of interdependence between plant and animal , between predator and prey that we observe today existed then .
This mature , complex ecosystem thrived and prospered just like ours .
But as these plants and animals lived out their lives , volcanoes in Siberia spewed out massive amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere .
These volcanic eruptions set off a chain reaction that almost ended complex life on earth .
Aftermath on land
Let us move one million years forward in time ; to 251 million years ago and visit those same forests and plains we stood upon .
Stretching in all directions , as far as the eye can see is barren land , sandy here , rocky there .
Not a trace of green remains , no plants live here .
Nothing remains of the forests we saw , not even rotted tree trunks .
Plants cannot survive here .
Where the river had meandered there are dried , braided stream beds partially filled with sand .
Sometimes there are massive dust storms of catastrophic intensity and duration , but rock and sand remain to see them .
The merciless sun bakes the ground in temperatures reaching daytime highs of up to 154 ºF ( .pdf warning ) .
In places the ground is cracked and buckled , parched beyond all recognition .
There is no rain here , ever .
Decades pass without even the smallest amount of moisture intruding .
The air reeks with a bitterly pungent mixture of sulfur and methane .
But worse than that , little oxygen is present .
Here at sea level is equivalent to standing on top of a 5.3 kilometer tall mountain – 17,000 feet high ( .pdf warning ) – in today ’s world .
A human here might die rapidly from high altitude pulmonary edema or high altitude cerebral edema .
Welcome to the world of runaway global warming .
The aftermath in the waters
From the surface , the oceans look deceptively normal .
The tidal action of the moon stirs the surface .
But plunge beneath and the truth is revealed .
There is nothing alive .
The massive ocean that encompasses 75 % of the entire world is dead .
No plankton , no fish , no jellyfish , no recognizable life at all .
There remain only trillions upon trillions of gallons of apparently lifeless water .
Even the algaes that produced the majority of oxygen for the world have died .
The surface water is much warmer than before but just below this surface layer lays an unfathomed icy crypt of darkness .
There are no currents .
The conveyer belt that brought cold water down to the depths has broken and apart from the very surface of the ocean , there is no oxygen .
Despite appearances , life continues .
The anaerobic bacteria do not need oxygen to thrive .
They have fed upon the countless corpses of marine organisms who drowned in anoxic water .
Now the bacteria use inorganic sources of energy to feed and reproduce .
Others use the energy of the sun to feed themselves .
Cyanobacterial mats
In some places the surface of the ocean is coated by tens of thousands of square miles of cyanobacterial mats – slime algae .
Primitive , single celled organisms are the only life in this ocean .
As these organisms thrive and reproduce they release Hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) as a byproduct of their metabolism – and hydrogen sulfide poisons organisms that require oxygen , both plants and animals .
The waters grow more inhospitable to complex life with each passing year .
Reentering the Tethys Sea is we discover much lies buried under layer after layer of monotonous bacterial mats .
Mile upon mile of once beautiful thriving reef is lifeless ...
Scenes of mass death of marine life as a result of the anoxic zone off the Oregon coast ; the fish , crabs and starfish washed on shore and were photographed there .
The reef structures themselves are largely gone .
As the CO2 levels in the oceans increased , the pH of the oceans dropped - CO2 is acidic .
Once the pH levels dropped low enough the reef building organisms were no longer able to use calcium carbonate to make shells or reef structures .
Crabs , clams , oysters , corals all suffered .
The existing structures began to erode as the acidic waters eroded their very components away .

How and why complex life almost vanished from the earth
This is the Permian – Triassic ( P – Tr ) extinction ; the largest mass extinction known in the history of the earth .
On land up to 80 % of all living organism died ; entire biological families vanished .
Even insect populations , spared by all other mass extinctions , have taken a brutal hit .
But land dwelling animals and plants fared much better than their marine counterparts .
In the ocean over 90 to 95 % of all life died .
Scientists call it the Great Dying and for one brief moment it looked as though all multicellular life might be extinguished .
While there are competing theories out there ( including the ever popular massive asteroid impact ) scientific consensus centers on global warming as the culprit in the almost successful eradication of complex life .
A graphic illustration of the loss of diversity : the Permian ocean life before the mass extinction - then after .
Very late in the Permian massive – truly massive volcanic eruptions took place .
These eruptions in the Siberian Traps lasted around 700,000 years and poured CO2 and other gases into the atmosphere .
It is likely that during this time there were periods of global cooling – caused by the ash in the atmosphere reflecting the sunlight .
But overall , CO2 levels , much as they are today , trapped heat in the atmosphere , gradually raising global temperatures .
At some point the global temperature increase reached a critical level and methane clathrates ( methane hydrates ) stored in the ocean were released .
A methane clathrate is essentially a methane molecule trapped inside a cage of water molecules by a combination of low temperatures and high pressures .
If the temperature of the water surrounding the methane increases past a certain level , the methane is released .
It appears that the modern ocean floor contains significant amounts ( millions of gigatons ) of methane hydrate and this would likely have been true in the past .
A clathrate releases bubbles of methane gas
Methane ( CH4 ) , like CO2 , is a greenhouse gas – it traps heat in the atmosphere .
But Methane is at least 20 x more powerful than CO2 as a greenhouse gas .
Once methane clathrates began to destabilize the atmospheric heating increased which in turn destabilized more clathrates and on and on .
The massive release of methane caused a rapid , sharp spike in global temperatures .
The Permian oceans ( the Tethys Sea and the Panthalassic Ocean ) started at a warmer temperature than our oceans today ( .pdf warning ) .
Thus , rather than the conveyer belt system we have today where cold , highly saline water near Greenland and Antarctica takes in massive amounts of oxygen and then sinks and keeps the conveyer belt in rotation , a much weaker circulation system existed in the Permian .
There were few glaciers to create the cold , saline water and the oceans started out stratified with high oxygen levels near the surface and low oxygen levels below .
Oxygen is consumed as part of the decomposition of organic .
As plants and animals die due to increased temperatures and lack of oxygen , their bodies decay which further depletes the oxygen poor waters until the only organisms left are single celled bacteria which consume sulfur compounds and produce hydrogen sulfide – which is lethal to organisms that breathe oxygen .
The hydrogen sulfide levels in the ocean increase rapidly and rise to the surface , killing off the marine organisms still surviving .
This includes algaes that produced the majority of the oxygen for the planet .
Above the water , oxygen levels worldwide begin to plummet .
Hydrogen sulfide levels increase .
The increasing temperatures worldwide begin to kill off terrestrial plant life .
As the deserts of central Pangaea expand , less and less and less plant life is left .
Land animals begin to die as well .
Many species can no longer exist near the equator .
The increased temperatures , the lack of vegetation and water drive them to higher latitudes – but not higher altitudes .
In fact , animals which previously thrived in the low oxygen high altitude environments have moved to low altitudes where the oxygen concentration now resembles what used to only be found in mountaintops .
The low altitude animals , adapted to a high oxygen environment , die .
Some scientists estimate that this process took only 80,000 years from start to finish .
This was not a steady rate of death ; there were pulses where more death occurred than at other times .
However , current evidence suggests that virtually all the marine deaths happened in one amazingly brief moment in geologic time .
The Recovery
We are here today so obviously complex life survived .
But the recovery was a long and tenuous process .
During other mass extinctions it appears that plant and animal life rebounded fairly rapidly , often in less than a million years .
The Permian – Triassic extinction took five times that long .
Some researchers think that it took as long as one hundred million years for the planet to reach its previous oxygen levels .
This had a direct effect upon the course of terrestrial life on the planet .
The reptiles that were flourishing just before the Permian extinction were called “ mammal - like reptiles . ”
Biologically similar to modern mammals some may even have had fur .
These animals almost disappeared during the Permian extinction ; lucky for us a few survived .
Another reptile family did pretty well after the Permian extinction .
The diapsid reptiles took control of land and sea .
Their descendants include the dinosaurs .
Recent fossil discoveries indicate that dinosaurs may have had complex lungs – similar to their descendants , the birds .
Did the dinosaurs achieve domination of the earth because their lungs were more efficient than our ancestors ?
Can it happen again ?
It is important to note that there are massive differences between the world today and the world of the Permian – Triassic extinction .
Our landmasses are split into seven continents , not one giant one .
We have several distinct oceans , each with their own currents and conveyor belts .
We do n’t have the problem of massive volcanic activity .
Our base temperature is lower than it was in the Permian ; we have polar ice caps which did not exist at that time .
Another factor is the distorted and incomplete picture from peering backwards into time – the gaps in the evidence , the risks if misinterpreting the data that does exist .
There is persuasive supporting evidence for this theory but there are also gaps and inconsistencies .
That ’s the nature of science when you peer this far back into the past .
But there is no reason to think that the biosphere of earth has changed so fundamentally that the events of the Permian extinction could not be repeated .
The atmosphere does not care if the atmospheric carbon which causes the warming comes from volcanoes or coal fired power plants .
One hundred million cars and trucks on the roads for ten years might have the same effect as a Vesuvius on global warming .
The rules still apply .
Disturbing similarities exist between our world and the end Permian :
• Our biological systems are stressed – worldwide ecosystems everywhere are suffering .
Many scientists believe we are already in the midst of a mass extinction .
• Atmospheric CO2 levels are steadily increasing , as are global temperatures .
• Weather systems and patterns are changing ; adding additional environmental stress to already strained ecological chains .
• The arctic is warming dramatically .
This weakens the Atlantic Ocean conveyor belt which oxygenates our oceans .
• Methane is leaching out of the defrosting permafrost .
• It is estimated that at least 50 gigatons of methane under the Arctic Ocean can potentially be released at any time – enough to almost immediately double the carbon levels in the atmosphere .
It is unlikely but not unthinkable that we – human beings – can literally precipitate a mass extinction which would result in the death of all multicellular life on earth , leaving the planet where it was 2 billion years ago : a rock covered with stagnant water , populated by mats of slime .
Or we can take action against global climate change .
The choice is ours to make .

General Motors ( GM ) took another $ 4 billion out of the ATM we call the U.S. Treasury .
It plans on getting another $ 7.6 billion from after June 1 from that very same ATM .
Reuters : General Motors Corp on Friday borrowed another $ 4 billion from the U.S. Treasury and won a cost - cutting deal from Canadian auto workers as a showdown with bondholders set the stage for a bankruptcy filing by the end of the month .
The latest emergency funds extended by the Obama administration take the total government funding to keep GM afloat since the start of the year to $ 19.4 billion .
GM said it expected that total to rise to $ 27 billion after June 1 , a government - imposed deadline for the embattled automaker to achieve a sweeping restructuring analysts say will require bankruptcy to complete .
The tentative agreement with the Canadian Auto Workers union , if ratified , would reduce hourly compensation costs by about 28 percent after including a round of concessions the union agreed to give in March .
A day earlier , GM won similar concessions from the United Auto Workers to reduce operating costs and pay the union in stock instead of cash to fund a retiree healthcare trust .
There was a moment when Jock Boyer realised just how much cycling talent there is in Rwanda .
Boyer , once the first American to ride the Tour de France and now the first coach of the Rwandan national cycling team , was leading his team of professionals up a steep , winding hill .
The cyclists were kitted out in their official sky blue and banana yellow Team Rwanda shirts .
They were riding brand new $ 4,000 bikes .
As they climbed the hill , the group sped past men and women carrying plates of fruit or stacks of banana leaves on their heads .
They overtook old , creaking lorries weighed down with goods bound for Congo .
And they passed other cyclists : young men on rusting single - speed Chinese - made bikes huffing and puffing their way up the hill , often with loads of coffee or charcoal on the back .
One of the cyclists they passed was called Leonard , 6ft 6in tall and carrying 150 lbs of potatoes .
A couple of minutes after Boyer and the team passed him , Leonard reappeared at their side , keeping pace , " cranking away " , as Boyer put it .
The coach found Leonard the next day and invited him to a trial .
Rwanda has always been a country of cyclists .
It is known as the land of a thousand hills , and every day each hill seems to hold a thousand cyclists delivering food and firewood , coffee and cassava .
The bikes are rudimentary , some even made of wood .
They are for business , not pleasure , and until recently certainly not for racing .
Like most African countries , Rwanda has never taken professional cycling seriously .
Outside of South Africa there are just a handful of African cyclists on the professional circuit and not one has competed at the highest level , the Tour de France .
That may be about to change .
Team Rwanda is this tiny central African country 's first ever professional cycling team , and it has grand ambitions : competing in the 2012 London Olympics and , eventually , securing a place in Le Tour .
The Rwandans , who climb the country 's thousand hills with ease on a diet of nothing but carbohydrates and fresh mountain air , could be just the team to polish the image of a sport tarnished by drug scandals .
First , Boyer needs to get them out of bed .
We 're in Ruhengeri , a small town about an hour and a half 's drive north of the capital , Kigali .
It is one of Rwanda 's main tourist spots , a place of volcanoes and gorillas .
Dian Fossey set up her gorilla sanctuary here , and early every morning small groups of tourists leave their hotels and begin trekking up the side of a hill ( everything here is either up or down a hill ) in search of gorillas .
It is a cloudy morning .
The peaks of the volcanoes are hidden and it is threatening to rain again .
We had arranged to set off early the day before from Kigali with five members of Team Rwanda , but the rain was torrential .
The riders are scattered across the country , but always meet in Kigali to ride up to the training camp together .
Only two riders , 21 - year - old Rafiki Uwimana and Nyandwi Uwase , 25 , made it to Kigali to begin the ride .
They both turned back , while Boyer and I drove on to Ruhengeri , the team 's base .
The following morning , Boyer is keen to get going with the training camp to prepare for three races in Africa : the Tour of Egypt , the Tour de Cameroon , and the Cape Epic in South Africa .
The five riders - Obed Ruvogera and Abraham Ruhumuriza , both 29 , and 21 - year - old Nicodem Habiyambere , as well as Rafiki and Nyandwi - were supposed to meet each other in Kigali at 8 am and ride to Ruhengeri .
It 's 8.30 am and Boyer has only just reached Rafiki on the phone .
Boyer hangs up and grins .
" He 's still in bed . "
The idea for Team Rwanda was born in 2005 .
It was the year Tom Ritchey , a professional American cyclist in the 1970s and the man viewed by many as the inventor of the mountain bike , made his first visit to Rwanda .
Ritchey was stunned by the number of cyclists and the vital role the bicycle seemed to play in every day life .
Most of the bikes he saw were basic " coffee bikes " , with a long back seat built to carry bags of coffee beans from fields to factories .
The design was poor , Ritchey believed , and the quality of the manufacturing even worse .
He set up Project Rwanda , a charity that would provide new coffee bikes designed by Ritchey to thousands of Rwandans .
Ritchey also established an annual race , the Wooden Bike Classic , for which hundreds of Rwandans would come to race their wooden coffee bikes .
Professional cyclists from Europe , the US and across Africa would also compete in a traditional road race on the same day .
The first race took place in September 2006 , and Ritchey persuaded Boyer to help him organise it .
Thousands of people turned up to line the streets and cheer the cyclists on .
The level of interest and amount of Rwandan talent took the two Americans by surprise .
Within a month they had decided to set up a national team .
" We did n't really have a plan , " says Boyer , " or much money . "
But within six weeks they had held trials , selected riders and formed a team that was ready to enter the nine - day Cape Epic , the biggest mountain bike race in the world .
In the three years since , Team Rwanda has become an established fixture in African cycling .
Two of its best riders , Adrien Niyonshuti and Nathan Byukusenge , have been picked up by the MTN team in South Africa , one of the strongest outfits in the continent .
For the riders though , success in the saddle is only one part of the story .
" If I go outside the country and I am wearing this shirt , " Rafiki says , tugging at his Team Rwanda jersey , " people will know about Rwanda for something else . "
To most outsiders , Rwanda is little more than a byword for horror , a country known only for its genocide .
More than 800,000 people were slaughtered in just three spring months in 1994 .
Tutsis and moderate Hutus were hacked to death by well organised and well financed machete - wielding mobs of Hutu extremists .
Husbands killed wives .
Priests killed those who sought sanctuary in their churches .
Radio stations exhorted Hutus to exterminate the " cockroaches " .
It was a holocaust carried out under the noses of a United Nations peacekeeping mission .
The UN force was too small and its mandate too weak .
Despite the best efforts of its Canadian commander , the UN force was unable to persuade the security council and the major powers - Britain , France and the United States - to send more troops .
Rwanda is a changed country today .
President Kagame , who led the Tutsi rebel forces which eventually drove out the Hutu government , has transformed Rwanda into one of the growth economies in East Africa , as well as one of the most stable countries in an often volatile region .
Kigali is a city with smart cafes , shiny shopping malls and busy restaurants .
Identity cards , once used to distinguish Hutus from Tutsis , now just label everyone Rwandan .
Like everyone in Rwanda , all of the Team Rwanda riders were affected by the genocide .
All were children at the time but many still have strong memories .
Six of Adrien 's brothers were killed .
Nathan lost his father , as did Nicodem .
Two of Obed 's uncles and three of his brothers died .
When the genocide began , on 6 April 1994 , Rafiki 's parents decided to split the family up .
If they stayed in one place they might all be killed ; if they went their separate ways there was more chance that some would survive .
Rafiki , then five years old , was sent from Kigali to live with his grandmother in a small village in eastern Rwanda .
In the confusion following the end of the genocide , his parents heard that Rafiki and his grandmother had been killed .
It was five years before the family was reunited .
Rafiki , slight and baby - faced , with the wisp of a goatee hanging off his chin , was in school , cycling for fun , when he tried out for Team Rwanda .
" I never thought I could do this professionally , " he says .
His heart , he says , belongs to his bicycle - something he agrees his girlfriend may not want to hear .
They have a child together ; news of the birth was announced on a local radio station .
" In Kigali everyone knows me .
I am a star , " he insists with a laugh .
A star he may be but , the occasional lie - in notwithstanding , Rafiki also says he understands what it takes to become a champion .
He trains for three hours every day , up to five hours on Saturdays and Sundays .
On his wrist he wears the yellow LiveStrong bracelet worn by Lance Armstrong .
The return of the American to competitive cycling has got Rafiki excited .
He daydreams about racing alongside Armstrong .
In his dreams he can beat him .
" When you want something you must be strong in your heart , " Rafiki says .
" You must be sure and I am sure . "
Boyer is not so sure .
The current six - man team is doing well , recording high finishes in African races , but Boyer doubts they are good enough yet to compete at the highest level .
He expects stronger riders , perhaps including Leonard the potato delivery man , to come through .
He is already trying to prepare his riders for the moment when they are replaced by younger , fitter , better cyclists .
Everyone will remain a part of the team , even if they are not racing .
Some may open bicycle shops , others may become team drivers or coaches .
A place has already been found for one rider who did n't quite make the grade : Rambo , the security guard at the Team Rwanda compound in Ruhengeri .
A picture of Rambo sits on the mantelpiece in the team house .
He is wearing army fatigues , is holding an AK - 47 , and has a bullet belt slung over his shoulder .
It is not for show .
Before working for Team Rwanda , Rambo was a soldier in the Congolese army .
Rambo , you might have guessed , is a nickname .
He was n't a good enough cyclist to make the team but considering his army background , Boyer thought he would make a good enough security guard .
By mid-morning the clouds have cleared and five members of Team Rwanda have begun the long and steep climb out of Kigali .
We ride back from Ruhengeri on motorbikes and meet them halfway .
Around 90 per cent of Rwandans earn their living from subsistence agriculture , and its importance , as we ride back towards the team base , is obvious .
Every conceivable spot of land appears to be farmed .
Slopes that seem almost vertical are terraced and ploughed .
Fields are full of men wielding hoes and women planting seeds .
Everyone we pass is working on the land : a man placing dried banana leaves on the roof of a brick - built hut ; an old woman , in need of a walking stick , yet balancing a sack of sweetcorn on her head ; a mother carrying firewood on her head and a sleeping baby wrapped in cloth around her back .
The riders arrive at the team base , a four - room single storey brick house with a veranda and front garden , peppered with small trees and bushes .
A couple of old wooden coffee bikes are propped up against the tree next to the small outhouse by the gate where Rambo stays .
As they shower ( " the first proper shower they 've had since the last training camp , " says Boyer ) , a cook prepares lunch .
Training camps like this are one of the few opportunities Boyer has to bring the riders together to train properly .
The six members of the A team and five juniors in the B team are scattered across Rwanda , most still living at home with their families .
While Boyer knows they train every day , what he does n't know is how much they eat .
The $ 100 - a - month salary Team Rwanda pays each rider is by far and away the largest income in each family .
That money goes towards school fees for younger brothers and sisters , hospital charges for a sick aunt , and food for everyone .
Boyer would like to be able to pay them more , but money is tight .
The entire operation is paid for by donations from foreigners , mainly Americans , and by a small amount of government funding .
The Rwandan cycling federation has given its full support to the project - the team has even been invited to dinner with President Kagame - but funds are still limited .
Air travel to continental races eats up most of the money .
Flights are expensive in Africa - outside South Africa there are no budget airlines .
To take a team of five riders , coach and mechanic to the Tour of Egypt will cost Team Rwanda around $ 10,000 .
Joining Team Rwanda has been something of a culture shock for the riders .
Some of them had never been out of their own towns or villages before .
Boyer , too , has had to adjust .
He admits to knowing little about Africa , let alone Rwanda , before he came here three years ago .
He is still getting used to his team 's elastic concept of time .
Planes have narrowly been missed , riders ambling towards the airport with less than half an hour before take - off .
" I got them all watches , thinking that might make a difference , " Boyer says .
" It made no difference at all . "
Lunch is served .
The riders pile their plates high with spaghetti , huge chunks of potatoes , tomatoes , onions , carrots and an omelette .
I ask Rafiki how this compares to his normal lunch .
He just giggles and shoves another potato in his mouth .
After lunch , Nyandwi and Rafiki sit in the shade on the step of the veranda and listen to American hip - hop , while the others take a nap .
Nyandwi grew up not far from here , 60 km up the road in Gisenyi , a town on the Congolese border .
He still lives there but has been able to rent his own house , a simple two - room hut with dirt floors , not far from his mother 's home .
Nyandwi left school at the age of 10 when the genocide started .
He did n't go back once it ended .
Instead he started working .
By the time he was 13 he had raised enough money to buy a cheap bicycle , so he became a bicycle taxi rider .
He would take people and goods back and forth across the border between Rwanda and Congo , earning around 7,000 Rwandan francs a week ( then about £ 13 ) , decent money for someone who left school so early .
His competitive streak , on display when he boasts to me that he is the best rider in Team Rwanda , was evident at an early age .
Gisenyi held an annual race for taxi bikes .
The first year Nyandwi entered , he won .
He went on to win the next four before saving up to buy a proper road bike and entering the Tour de Rwanda .
The first year , he came 20th , then eighth , and then third .
That was the year Boyer came to Rwanda .
Nyandwi was one of the first cyclists he tested .
" It has changed everything for me , " he says .
It has changed things for his family , too .
Nyandwi's mother used to work , but following an illness that put her in hospital , she has been unable to support the family .
Nyandwi's $ 100 - a - month salary is spread across his five brothers and two of his sisters ( the other three are married ) .
" Everything in the family is me , " he says .
Nyandwi , like the others in the team , struggled in a recent race in Gabon .
The climate in Rwanda may be good for training ( mountains , cool weather ) , but it is not the best preparation for races elsewhere in Africa .
The heat and humidity of Gabon did not suit Team Rwanda .
" It was hot , " says Nyandwi .
" No , it was very hot , " emphasises Rafiki .
None of the riders was happy with his performance in Gabon .
Rafiki and Nyandwi were the highest finishers , 29th and 30th respectively .
They expect to do a lot better when the conditions better suit their strengths .
That chance will come in November .
The national cycling federation has succeeded in getting the Tour de Rwanda on to the international schedule this year , lending much - needed credibility to the race .
Riders from Europe and the US are expected to compete , giving Team Rwanda the opportunity to test themselves against some of the world 's best on their home turf .
Boyer is also hopeful that the Olympics qualification race for London 2012 will be held in Rwanda , something which will surely help his riders .
One of the original Team Rwanda cyclists , Adrien Niyonshuti , narrowly missed out on Beijing , finishing just outside the top five in the African qualification race .
The Olympics dream is achievable , Boyer insists .
Getting a rider in the Tour de France will be a lot harder , but Boyer believes it could happen in the next five to 10 years .
" The talent here is unbelievable , " he says .
" I know there are champions out there .
I just need to find them . "
Malaria , family illnesses and logistical problems affected Team Rwanda 's performances in Cameroon , Egypt and South Africa .
In the end the cost of flying the team to Cameroon proved too much and they had to cancel .
Then two members of the team caught malaria right before the Tour of Egypt and the trip to South Africa for the Cape Epic .
Despite the problems the team still managed to put in good performances .
Abraham finished 5th and 10th in two of the stages in Egypt , while Adrien , racing for MTN , came 12th in the Cape Epic .
" We are making good progress , " says Boyer , " but it is frustrating . "
All the major teams have enough funding to train full - time - something that Team Rwanda can only dream of .
" If I could get them at a training camp for a whole month before a race , " says Boyer , before trailing off .
As the three - day training camp before Egypt came to an end , Rafiki and Nyandwi were sat on the veranda gently ribbing each other about who is best .
The two men think Boyer has found his champion already - they just can't agree on which one of them it is .
What they do agree on though is how to define " champion " .
Neither is satisfied to be seen as the best rider in Rwanda , or even in Africa .
" I want to be champion everywhere , " said Nandwi , " not just in Rwanda but outside .
Why not ? "
They both grinned .
Geeking out on the guitar since 1867 .
The U.S. Army is investigating allegations that eight male soldiers took pictures and video of as many as 21 female soldiers in their unit as they showered .
The photos allegedly were taken late last year , before the 266th Military Police Company of the Virginia Army National Guard shipped out to Iraq in December .
Lt. Col. Christopher Garver said Friday the Army is conducting a criminal investigation .
No charges have been filed .
Spokeswoman Carolee Nisbet at Fort Dix , New Jersey , says the allegations are disappointing because most soldiers who train there before deployment " live up to the Army values . "
The 266th is serving in Basra .
A spokesman for the Virginia Guard did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment .
GitHub is a very popular repository hosting for open source ruby projects .
Git is a version control system similar to ( but a lot better than ) SVN .
I use git hosted on GitHub for my current project , MakePlans - a booking / reservation system .
But for many is GitHub not a viable alternative since it is not free for non open - source projects and while it is great for many to outsource backups and repository management , it is not an option for those who needs to host it in - house due to security or other internal guidelines .
Enter Gitorious !
Johan Sørensen from Shortcut , a ruby on rails company here in Oslo , made this amazing free open - source " GitHub - clone " ( update : Gitorious was launched the same week as GitHub . ) .
It has been available as a open - source project for awhile but recently Shortcut made a free public site available for those who do not want to install Gitorious themselves .
Gitorious boost most of the features that GitHub has :
Host git-repositories .
Visual source browser .
Teams .
History of the commit log .
Clone / fork projects , download zipped file .
Comments .
Notficitation system .
On a day to day basis the source tree browser is what I most often use with GitHub .
It is ajax - based and loads commit messages after the rest of the page is loaded .
This is often a slow process in GitHub and something that works much better in Gitorious where no ajax is used .
There is not much I miss from GitHub , but I can not see a way to constantly watch others repositories as is possible in GitHub .
I follow various rails - projects in GitHub but I use it mainly as a form of bookmark so it is not a very important feature for me .
QT announced today that they will use Gitorious as their public repository for their cross-platform UI framework .
Hopefully more will follow so Gitorious can gain the attention it deserves compared to GitHub .

Vote details
The licensing update poll was conducted for three weeks ( from April 12 to May 3 , 2009 ) in 32 languages , and was announced via a site notice displayed to all logged - in editors .
The poll was open to any individual who had a registered account on a WMF project with at least 25 edits prior to March 15 , 2009 , and who was neither blocked at that account nor flagged as a bot .
Individuals not meeting these criteria were automatically prevented from submitting a ballot .
Certification
History of votes cast during the three week voting period .
A total of 18692 ballots were submitted .
After review , the licensing update committee certified 17462 of these as valid .
Nearly all of the rejected ballots were due to individuals attempting to vote multiple times .
In the case of a single individual voting multiple times , their most recent ballot is considered valid and any earlier ballots are rejected .
This included 930 cases where a single account at a particular wiki was used to cast multiple votes .
A further 256 votes were discounted due to individuals voting multiple times under the same account name from different wikis ( confirmed as linked accounts via single user login or other technical evidence ) .
The final 44 rejected ballots were eliminated for other reasons , including abusive sockpuppetry .
All vote review was conducted solely based on the voter 's account identity and associated technical evidence .
Ballot choices were encrypted and not released until after the collection of valid votes was certified .
Rejected ballots were never opened .
Demographics
193 Wikimedia projects were represented by at least one vote .
Did you honestly ask that question ?
No it is not okay to have an affair regardless of lack of discovery .
If you are having an affair , you can not be happily married .
Second , threatening your daughter only guarentees that your daughter will dislike you for your actions .
You have proven to her that you are doing something that you know is wrong , and are going to continue doing it .
Additionally , you are teaching her that morals are not necessary if you hold the power .
And finally , by threatening her if she does not keep your horrendous secret , you are showing her that your lack of morals extends to include her .
How can you ask a child to keep a secret from someone who she loves so much ?????
Where is your loyalty ?
Where are your morals ?
Where is your respect for your family ( both your wife and your daughter ) ????
K
P.S. Just in case I left anything to question , NO AFFAIRS ARE NEVER OKAY .
If you are so unhappy with your spouse , then at least have the common courtesy and respect to end your relationship with her honestly before beginning another relationship .
NEW YORK ( AdAge.com ) -- Michael Vick is in talks to become the new spokesman for PETA .
Yes , you read that correctly .
The disgraced one - time NFL superstar serving prison time for funding an illegal dog- fighting ring is primed to do public - service ads for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals upon his release later this month .
According to three people with knowledge of the matter , the proposed endorsement is part of a comprehensive PR scheme aimed at rehabilitating the quarterback 's image and gaining him readmission to the league that banned him from playing .
" I'm familiar with [ the plan ] , " said Dan Shannon , director of youth outreach and campaigns for PETA .
" We have been in discussions with Michael Vick , with his management team , about the possibility of him putting out a public - service announcement with PETA when he 's out of jail .
We want him to discourage people from taking part in dog-fighting .
I can do it until I 'm blue in the face and it might not convince anybody .
Michael Vick sure can .
He can say , ' Look , I did it , I was wrong , and it ruined my career . ' "
Other image - changing moves
That 's not all Mr. Vick will do to try to rehabilitate his image .
People with knowledge of his comeback plan said it will also include mea culpa TV interviews , PSAs and charitable donations to other animal - rights organizations ( or perhaps the formation of his own foundation ) , along with the possibility of working with PETA .
But this might be the mother of all PR jobs .
Mr. Vick 's obstacles are many : a hard - line NFL commissioner who wants to see " genuine remorse " before reinstating Mr. Vick to the league ; individual franchises who might be wary of the backlash and potential damage to their brands from signing Mr. Vick ; and an incredulous public that remains shocked by the story .
And what a grisly tale it is .
Mr. Vick , who in 2004 signed a seven - year , $ 130 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons , funded the Bad Newz Kennels in Virginia , which participated in the fighting of pit bulls and also admitted to participating in the sometimes torturous deaths of dogs that underperformed , including death by drowning , hanging and electrocution .
Mr. Vick is due to be released from federal prison on May 20 and will serve the remaining two months of his 23 - month sentence under home confinement near Hampton , Va. , where he will be working a 40 - hour - a - week construction job .
Mr. Vick 's camp includes a multitude of PR and legal handlers .
His Atlanta - based attorney , Daniel Meachum , did not return several requests for an interview .
Mr. Vick 's Washington - based lawyer , William " Billy " Martin , declined to comment .
It is not known if Mr. Vick 's team has hired a strategic - communications or crisis - management firm to handle the PR efforts .
But PETA confirmed it has talked with his handlers .
Before doing a deal , however , PETA wants Mr. Vick to undergo a psychological evaluation for antisocial personality disorder .
" We 're suspicious this may come from a place of simply wanting to repair his public image , rather than genuine remorse , " Mr. Shannon said .
" He was dishonest all the way up the line until he finally had to admit to what he did , which is a hallmark of [ antisocial personality disorder ] .
If he can't tell the difference between right and wrong , we can't get in bed with this guy .
At this point , he has n't chosen to submit to an evaluation .
We hope the NFL will require that evaluation as a precondition of reinstatement .
The bottom line is : Everybody knows he 's going to apologize , go on Oprah and Larry King and say he did wrong , that he learned his lesson .
But there 's no reason for anybody to take his word for that based on the pattern of dishonesty and the severity of cruelty he took part in . "

Software moves on at a break - neck pace these days–version numbers clock up ever quicker as vendors try to market their apps as the latest and greatest .
Software generally ages badly , falling into a state of looking grossly out of date , lacking new functionality that we ’ve come to depend upon as well as compatibility problems .
Dear OSNews readers , what old software ( 5+ years ) do you still use , why , and what problems do you come across in sticking with it ?
Read More for my own contribution to the list
Despite now using Mac OS
X as my main OS , and being completely up to date on all of my software , there is one old program I still use : Visual Basic 6 .
Visual Basic 6 arrived on the scene in 1998 â€ ” 11 years ago .
To put this in perspective , Windows 98 had only just been released , most developers would have been running Windows 95 on a 400 MHz Pentium II with 32 MB of RAM .
The browser of choice was Netscape 4.0 ( Microsoft had been late to the game but were now bundling IE4 with Windows 98 ) , Netscape had announced the browser was going free and open source in January of the year and the Mozilla project was started .
You would n’t even imagine using Netscape or Windows 98 now !
Too old , too incapable , too unstable and no longer even compatible with anything .
Why use Visual Basic 6 ?
For a piece of software so old , and so outdated when I sit in front of it I feel like it ’s home to me .
I ’m familiar with the ins and outs of the software and to me , its simplicity is a benefit compared to the more flash Visual Studio .
NET .
It ’s like a really good text editor , more than it is a swank IDE .
Notepad with a play button .
I can spend my thinking on the solution rather than managing the wealth of pop up panels and toolbars in newer versions .
For an 11 year old piece of software , I can be every bit as productive with it as I can be with TextMate on Mac OS X ( an awesome text editor ) .
The executables I can compile with it still run in even Windows 7 so I do n’t feel any disadvantage using old software when it still gets the jobs I need done .
Backwards compatibility here has n’t been so side - swept like it has with web browsers .
Microsoft ’s radical switch from Visual Basic 6 to essentially an entirely different language Visual Basic .NET alienated a lot of people .
Yes , .NET provided real Object Orientated programming and solved all the shortcomings of Visual Basic 6 , bringing it essentially onto par with C# , but that was n’t the reason people used Visual Basic 6 .
Visual Basic 6 , for all the hate it receives , allows you to throw something together quickly to get complicated tasks done in a UI fashion that a batch script could n’t handle .
You could write code as good or as crap as you wanted , and just as I always strive for code as art , so I did with VB6 too .
I ’ve seen people of all skill levels use Visual Basic 6 to do various tasks , including office automation .
People who do n’t know the first thing about programming building database front ends .
. NET just made Visual Basic more like Java – requiring so much formality that you had to learn to do things properly from the start , rather than learning that as you went along .
Over time , VB6 has been left behind , and the software has aged somewhat .
There ’s a couple of things I have to do to keep my code up to date with modern operating systems .
The VB6 IDE did n’t have mouse - wheel scrolling as the scroll mouse was a new invention at the time .
Thankfully an add - in for VB6 called MZ - Tools solves that .
The second main complication is that Visual Basic 6 executables cannot use a 32 - bit Icon .
Again , hacks can be done to resolve this .
To provide high quality icons for Vista users I created a batch script that used ResHacker to replace the EXE icons after compilation with 32 - bit versions up to 128×128 .
Visual Basic 6 to me is one of those rare oddities of software that does n’t age too badly and still remains practical to use despite a computing environment inconceivable at the time it was released .
So what old software do you still use ( and love ) ?
Segway and GM unveiled their egg shaped urban transporter this morning .
And now they unleashed a promo video showing it off , which we 've embedded .
We have n't had a chance to embarass ourselves by riding around in one yet , but the auto nerds over at Jalopnik took a test drive in it and are digging it :
When we first saw the PUMA last night we did n't really know what to make of it .
It looks like a cross between a mobility scooter and a roller coaster car .
But appearances can be deceiving , as this is just a rough chassis serving as an engineering prototype ( we 're told the final version will include a few more amenities like doors ) , but hopping in for a ride ( we 'll be able to drive it in the Fall ) reveals anything but an unfinished product .
... Riding along in complete silence , sliding fore and aft is a bit eerie .
The seats are n't connected to the floor plan , meaning your feet slide out from under the seat when the cabin shifts foreword and vice versa in reverse .
That feeling of connection to the movement helps orient passengers to what 's going on beneath them .
The simplicity of the control system - immediately intuitive - hints at the intended use of the PUMA .
You would n't need to be competent behind the wheel of a car to use one , it 's more like operating a video game .
Perfect for today 's youth gone wild .
And importantly , while we think it would n't work in a city like New York , Jalopnik points out that it could work in cities like Los Angeles that are wanting for public transit .
If Segway and GM could team on some sort of car - share program , then it might work .
Of course there 's a large gap between an idea possibly work and actually working .
Sport hurts .
And if these clips are anything to go by ?
it hurts a hell of a lot .
Even compiling this list of the worst sports injuries hurt ?
so God knows what it must have been like for the people involved .
Put it this way , broken legs are only the tip of the iceberg when compared to having your throat cut , being impaled by a javelin and having your eye gouged out .
Seriously , they are all on this list .
It 's enough to put you off playing sport for good .
So if you have a weak stomach , please look away now .
13 . Kickboxer breaks his leg
First rule of kickboxing ?
do n't kick anyone whose legs are stronger than yours .
Ouch .
12 . Djibril Cisse is given a crunching tackle
The Sunderland striker must have legs made out of wood .
It would certainly explain why he can't hit a cow ? s arse with a banjo and why his legs can't withstand tackles .
This tackle was when he was playing for Liverpool .
He broke it again not long after making his comeback while playing for France .
11 . Matt ?s life for Eduardo
Sky Sports refused to replay this tackle on Arsenal striker Eduardo in February 2008 by Birmingham ?s Matt Taylor because it was so horrific .
10 . David Busst gets Bussted up
Ask any football fan about former Coventry defender David Busst and they ?ll wince .
Yeah , he was that bad .
But his name has also become synonymous with horrific sporting injuries .
This injury , which occurred during a match against Manchester United in 1996 , was so bad that United keeper Peter Schmeichel had to get counselling after the match and was seen vomiting on the pitch .
It took stewards and match officials 10 minutes to clear up the blood and Busst never played again .
9 . French long jumper gets the point
French long jumper Salim Sdiri was minding his own business at the Olympic Stadium in Rome in July 2007 when Finland ? s
Tero Pitkamaki stray javelin impaled him through his side .
Unbelievably , he was released from hospital the next day .
Being hit by javelins is not as uncommon as you might think .
Czech decathlete Roman Sebrle was hit in the shoulder earlier that same year .
He was told by doctors that he was 20 cm from death .
8. Joe Theisman ?s big career break
This leg break in 1985 against the New York Giants ended Washington Redskins ?
quarterback Joe Theismann ’s career .
The injury was voted the NFL’s “ Most Shocking Moment in History ” by viewers in an ESPN poll , and the tackle was dubbed “ The Hit That No One Who Saw It Can Ever Forget ” by The Washington Post .
7. LA Clippers star Shaun Livingston has a lumpy landing
Is that really his knee ?
Damn !

Running back Willis McGahee ?s knee is decimated during the 2003 National Championship game between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Miami Hurricanes Amazingly , he played again .
5 . Ibok is given the elbow
Michigan State sophomore Idong Ibok fell awkwardly during the first half of the Spartans ’ NCAA Tournament game against Marquette back in 2007 and soon realised he was not double jointed .
We are sure he can laugh about it now .

This horrific injury on Villanova guard Allan Ray during a 2006 Big East tournament against Pittsburgh at Madison Square Garden should only be viewed if you have a strong stomach .
1. Clint Malarchuk finds himself skating on very thin ice
We knew ice hockey was a brutal game , but this really does take the biscuit .
Blues ’ Steve Tuttle collided with Sabres goalie Malarchuk at the goal and his skate accidentally severed his throat .
It looks like something out of a horror movie , but thankfully , he survived to tell the tale .
He said : ?
I thought I was dying then , I really did .
I thought I did n’t have long to live .
All I wanted to do was get off the ice .
My mother was watching the game on TV , and I did n’t want her to see me die .?
Chilling stuff .

Before Édgar fell ill , another person in San Diego may have been affected , said Dr. Miguel Ángel Lezana , Mexico ’s chief government epidemiologist .
Even now , Édgar ’s mother , María del Carmen Hernández , said she received conflicting accounts of the exact illness that kept her son in bed for three days .
No one has explained what she should be doing to keep him and the rest of the family healthy , she said , signs that Mexico ’s response effort may be spotty , especially in rural areas .
“ Some people are saying my boy is to blame for everyone else in the country getting sick , ” said Mrs. Hernández , 34 , a blank stare on her face as she recounted the family ’s ordeal .
“ I do n’t believe that .
I do n’t know what to think . ”
There was a modest increase on Tuesday in new cases of swine flu reported around the world .
In the United States , the number of confirmed cases rose to 64 , from Monday ’s count of 50 , according to a news briefing by Dr. Richard E. Besser , acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The total includes 45 cases in New York State .
There have been no deaths from the disease in the United States , but five people have been hospitalized for treatment .
Mexico remains the hardest hit .
Late Tuesday , the Health Ministry put the number of suspected cases at 2,498 , and the suspected number of deaths at 159 .
In La Gloria , a town that has a major pig farming industry , two children died of the flu in March and early April , though the authorities said they had yet to determine whether it was the same strain that infected Édgar and spread widely to other locales .
That and other questions have left residents here unnerved and confused .

Not only that , he was also able to actually tether his iPhone 3G to his laptop over USB .
Based on the preference panel , it appears that you will be able to tether via USB or Bluetooth .
Tethering is a feature that allows you to share your iPhone 's internet connection with your laptop , but has not been an allowed feature up until iPhone 3.0 .
Even with iPhone 3.0 , mobile carriers generally charge an extra fee in the U.S. to allow tethering access .
Apple admitted that they had built in tethering support into the 3.0 release but had not yet coordinated with mobile carriers .

Seven weeks ago , the Subversion project team size doubled .
We hired a very smart fulltime undergraduate from Imperial College called Andrew Lim , and he ’s been working on Subversion for the past few weeks as a Summer Placement .
This is quite a big development for Subversion , and I must say it ’s quite a relief to not be alone on this massive and epic project any longer .
Andrew Lim ’s job is funded by a research and development grant from the Technology Strategy Board – a UK government body set up to promote innovation and research in the commercial world .
Part of their mandate is to strengthen the bonds between industry and academia , and we ’ve always maintained strong ties with our university of Imperial College London .
We ’re doing so much R&D in Subversion that we were able to think of several really interesting research areas right away , and the TSB agreed to help fund the project with us , with Dr Simon Colton acting as our liason at Imperial College .
So Andrew has been working on the project of Data Driven Generation .
What this means is that he ’s working on ways to specify the generation of content ( specifically for Subversion ) through data files rather than hard coding .
Currently the city and building generation is written as a number of C++ generator functions , which makes it difficult to expand , especially for people who do n’t work for Introversion ( ie modders ) .
Once Andrew has finished , we ’ll be able to specify the generation rules for a city , the buildings in the city , and the areas within the buildings , all using generic data files .
We ’ll be able to expand the generation simply by adding more data files that specify more content in further detail .
Here you can see an example of his initial work , replacing the standard building generation rules with a general - case data rule that generates Pyramids .
The Pyramid is pretty much the simplest hierarchically defined shape you can make ( you Contract , then Extrude , then Repeat ) , and an obvious starting point .
I ’ve got high hopes for this project .
On top of that , Gary spent his first day on Subversion this week .
He ’ll be working on the editor that we use to make all the custom hand - made content .
His ultimate objective is to craft a tool that will mix the best of procedural generation with the uniqueness of hand - made content – so for example you might generate a 30 storey empty building , then manually edit the 29th floor with some really cool stuff , then tell the editor to fill in the rest using the existing Geometry Generator .
These two systems combined have a lot of potential .
Continuing on from Part 14 , I ’ve been attempting to write a generic Forces simulation system for the game world .
My aim has been to handle all the basic collisions and forces that you naturally find in a game world – ie I want to stop people walking through walls , or each other , and I want people to be able to walk into Elevator cars and be lifted up when the car lifts up , that kind of thing .
There is a ton of work already done in the area of real time physics , and I ’ve no intention of writing a full physics simulation system – it ’s not required for Subversion , and it ’s the kind of job I could just vanish into for a year and emerge at the other end with some software that pretty much every other games company under the sun has already written .
I believe a simpler solution is appropriate for Subversion .
Nevertheless , I ’d always been curious how hard it would be to bring some rigid body physics to the game world , and I ’d been investigating a free 3d physics library called BulletPhysics .
Integrating the BulletPhysics library into Subversion took less than two hours .
I ’m actually very impressed .
The set up is very simple – you tell the library the basics like the ground plane and the force of gravity , and then you feed in your static geometry .
In the case of Subversion , I simply fed in the entire triangle mesh for the ten storey building I ’ve been using as a testbed .
No organisation required , no hierarchy of data , just a giant pool of triangles .
You then attach BulletPhysics simulation data to your world objects , and tell the library what shape they are , how heavy they are , etc. Bullet Physics supports basic cubes ( which I ’m using in this test ) , but also loads of other primitive shapes like Cylinders , Spheres etc , and even complex triangle mesh models .
Every frame you call the Bullet Physics update command which progresses the physics simulation a small amount , and then you simply read the positions and orientations of all your world objects directly from the Bullet Physics API .
This is my kind of API design .
I spent less than a day on this in total , and got some pretty exciting results even from that brief investigation .
I ’m not entirely sure how it fits into Subversion yet – I still do n’t actually want real physics simulated in the game world – but for visual effects , explosions , dropped objects etc , this might be an extremely useful capability for the Subversion engine to have in its back pocket .
In this video , all of the large red boxes that you see tumbling over each other are being handled by the Bullet Physics library .
All the rest of it - the tiny bouncing particles , the gun shot simulation and the opening and closing doors , are all using Subversion 's internal engine .
In case it ’s not obvious to anyone reading these blogs , Subversion is a really massive project .
I think it ’s fair to say that it ’s too big for us , beyond our scope as just the next game launch .
There just is n’t going to be time to complete Subversion to the 100 % Gold Plated solution that we have in our minds .
So one of the things I ’m really keen on is making Subversion very expandable , and thinking of the game launch as the start of the process .
I find the Dwarf Fortress project to be fascinating and hugely inspiring .
These guys released the first version of this game years ago , and they continue to add new features and capabilities to the engine as the years go by .
They deepen the quality of their simulation with every new version , expanding their game inwards .
It looks terrible and the interface is appalling , but the depth of their simulation is staggering .
If we could make the business model work , this gradual release and improvement over several years could be a huge winner for Subversion .
Does Mathematics Count ? Brian Alspach Poker Digest Vol. 1 , No. 1 , July 31 - August 13 , 1998
Several weeks ago I was talking with Bib Ladder , a colorful Vancouver area poker player , at one of the local cardrooms about a home game he regularly inhabited twenty years ago .
``Well , ya see , professor , it was my first introduction to 3 - card monte .
Several of the players regularly dealt it .
As time went on I observed that three - card flushes seemed to occur more frequently than three - card straights , but they played that a flush beats a straight .
I did n't know what to think , so I asked a friend of mine what he thought .
He was rather surprised and told me without blinking an eye that a straight beats a flush .
Well , them old geezers in the game would have none of my contention that they were doin ' it wrong so I just gave up tryin ' to set things straight .
I 've often wondered about it and was thinkin ' you might explain it to me even though I 'm not much of a numbers man . ''
``Bib , let 's go sit at one of the tables and I 'll give you a first lesson in counting , '' thinking to myself as I said this that there are probably more than a few poker players like Bib who do n't really understand why hands are ranked as they are .
Retrieving my ubiquitous pad of paper , I continued , ``Bib , I presume it is clear that when we count the number of types of hands , the fewer there are of a given type , the higher that type of hand is ranked . ''
``I know that , '' he replied .
``Counting objects is a branch of mathematics that students find difficult because there is no universal machine that answers all problems .
The methods are somewhat ad hoc and to some people seem magical and without form .
There is almost an art to solving counting problems .
Still , there are several basic principles to keep in mind .
Primarily , you have to know when to add and when to multiply .
A rule - of - thumb that works reasonably well is to multiply when the word ``and '' is involved , and to add when the word ``or '' is involved .
Finally , you must use common sense .
All of these points are illustrated nicely in counting three - card poker hands , but first let 's consider your particular question that deals with straights and flushes .
Let 's count three - card straight flushes first .
We 'll see why we need to do this in a few minutes .
So , Bib , is there some unique card that completely determines any particular three - card flush ? ''
`` Sure , '' he replied .
`` Once you know the smallest card in the three - card straight flush , you know everything . ''
`` Right !
You have discovered a unique marker that determines the objects being counted .
In this case , the smallest card .
We could have used the middle card or largest card as well .
Now all we have to do is count the possible number of smallest cards .
A king is the only card that cannot be a smallest card in a three - card straight flush so that there are 48 possible smallest cards .
Thus , there are 48 three - card straight flushes .
We now move to three - card straights which have the form x , x+1, x+2 .
How many cards can appear as x ?''
``Well , it can be any of 48 cards since a king is the only card that cannot begin a three - card straight , '' Bib answered .
`` Right !
And once x has been determined , x+1 can be any of 4 cards as can x+2 .
We multiply because we are choosing one card and a next and a next , that is , the word `and ' is involved .
Multiplication yields 768 straights .
Now is when we use common sense by realizing that three - card straight flushes have been included in the latter count so that they must be removed .
Therefore , there are 720 straights .
Note that there are 15 times as many straights as there are straight flushes .
This lets you know just how much stronger a straight flush really is .
Let 's consider three - card flushes next and see if you can do it .
How many three - card heart flushes are there ? ''
Bib thought for a moment and then said , `` The first card can be any of 13 cards , any of the remaining 12 cards can come second , and any of the remaining 11 cards for the last card .
Since we are performing successive actions , we multiply and obtain , well , you work it out ' cause you 've got the paper . ''
``Multiplying gives ways .
But now I must issue the first , and most important , warning about counting .
Always ask yourself if you have counted objects too many times !''
``I see what you 're gettin ' at , professor .
I can get any particular hand dealt in six different orders .
So I 've got to divide that number by six , right ? ''
`` That 's correct , Bib .
And you told me you were not much of a numbers man .
You have some hidden mathematical talent .
Upon dividing we obtain 286 heart flushes .
But a three - card flush could be hearts , spades , diamonds or clubs .
So we have to add 286 together four times and obtain 1,144 three - card flushes .
Again we must remove the 48 straight flushes giving us 1,096 three - card flushes . ''
Bib grunted and finally said , ``1,096 three - card flushes compared to only 720 three - card straights certainly explains why I noticed many more flushes than straights in three - card monte . ''
Next time we shall consider all three - card poker hands .

The hardcore Christian morons over at Rapture Ready have got it pretty bad .
Obama the Antichrist won the presidency pretty handily .
Gay marriage legislation is passing in more and more states .
To these people , the world has gone to shit and they would rather die than live in it .
Of course they 're also all giant pussies so instead of just offing themselves , they 're gonna wait for THE RAPTURE instead .
In case you 're not up to speed on Biblical folklore , the Rapture is when Jesus comes rolling up in this motherfucker to the tune of some trumpets and takes all the Christians back up to Heaven .
Until that time comes though , they 're gonna sit on their forums and entertain us as much as possible with their rampant stupidity .
No conspiracy theories and we mean it !
Look at what you gays have done now .
I 'm gonna go with option 2 .
Ha ha , you are clumsy as hell God !
Does Dwyane Wade ’s future depend on LeBron ?
The short answer is …maybe .
Have you noticed how all of this LeBron - to - the - Knicks talk has died down as the Cavs put up the best record in the NBA this season ?
That ’s because Cleveland is a favorite to make the Finals , and with the way the Lakers are struggling against the Rockets out West , the Cavs are looking more and more like an NBA champion .
If they do manage to win a title this year ( or next ) , it will be very difficult for LeBron to jump ship without looking like a total a -hole .
So he wo n’t .
If he wins a ring , he ’ll stay in Cleveland .
So the Knicks will have to look elsewhere for their superstar — enter Dwyane Wade .
As Dave Hyde of the Sun-Sentinel writes , the Big Apple would be an attractive destination for Wade .
The Knicks have the money .
They have the allure .
They have coach Mike D’Antoni ’s fun style .
They can tell Wade he would revive Knicks basketball and get the kind of spotlight only New York offers such stars .
Who would n’t be tempted by all that ?
So Hyde advocates that instead of waiting for 2010 and trying to add a star big man like Chris Bosh or Amare Stoudemire while at the same time re-signing Wade , the Heat should go ahead and trade Michael Beasley to Toronto for Bosh this summer .
So there ’s the Armageddon scenario for the Heat :
It advances only slightly next year , misses on Bosh , has the Knicks singing a siren song to Wade … and loses him .
If you ’re Riley , do you risk that ?
All for Beasley , who , much as I like him , posed as many questions as answers this season ?
Even Wade , who measures his words , allowed as to how Beasley frustrated him at times with the immaturity .
The best way to sign
Wade this summer is to offer concrete evidence he can win big here .
That means landing his friend , Bosh .
They were Olympians together .
They share the same agent .
They respect each other greatly .
That ’s why the smartest move to make is trading the salary - matching pair of Beasley and Mark Blount to Toronto for Bosh .
It ’s an attractive scenario to wait until 2010 and add Bosh to a lineup that includes Wade and Beasley .
But there ’s a good chance that Bosh could sign with Cleveland or that the Knicks could come in and steal both Bosh and Wade away from the Heat .
Why risk a future with Wade for the promise of Beasley ?
While it sounds a little crazy to trade a young player with a ton of upside for a guy you might be able to sign outright the next summer , it ’s risk versus reward .
A Wade / Bosh combo would guarantee the Heat would compete in the East for the next five years .
Throw in the steady Udonis Haslem , a more mature Mario Chalmers and a small forward to be named later , and Heat would have a nice lineup .
But the biggest reason the Heat should acquire Bosh is that it will almost guarantee that Wade re-ups as well .
Now the question is — will the Raptors go for it ?
" It is better to know some of the questions than all of the answers . "
James Thurber
A while ago I discussed the nine fundamental structural sub-systems of any game .
These elements are a good starting point for defining your game concept , but there 's a lot more to be said .
As a reminder , the structural elements are :
1 . Theme / History / Story / Emotion / Image .
2. Player Interaction rules .
3. Objective / victory conditions .
4. " Data storage " ( Information Management ) .
5. Sequencing .
6. Movement / Placement .
7. Information availability .
8. Conflict resolution / interaction of game entities .
9. " Economy " ( resource acquisition / conversion ) .
The following are questions , or " decision points " , for a designer to consider after he or she has established a framework .
It should be most useful to people who are learning to design games .
This list has grown as I 've tried to come up with a set of questions that can be used to define and refine the nature of a game ( whether non-electronic or electronic ) , once we have settled on the structural choices .
What 's the difference between the structural elements and these questions ?
A designer must choose something within each of the structural elements , or there is no game yet ( not consciously choosing is itself a default choice ) .
On the other hand , he or she can ignore any of the following questions , but other elements in the game will create some answer to each as the game is developed .
Yet many of these questions are as important , in the long run , as those fundamental structures .
As a designer , I 'd prefer to answer the questions initially rather than stumble into an answer , but others may have a different point of view .
Many of these questions are primarily of interest in non-race games with more than two sides .
Races are n't unusual in video games ( Mario Kart is a well - known recent race game ) , yet they are a very specialized version of multi- sided games because in most such games there is little you can do to hinder the opposition .
Many board games and most card games are " multi " - sided ( more than two sides ) .
A trend in video gaming is toward multi-sided games , a way to have several people participate and compete directly , rather than indirectly via high scores or times , with one another .
Over time , then , some of these questions will become very important for many video game makers .
Here in summary are the twenty " questions " I 've identified so far , followed after the question list by a brief discussion of each .
" Distinct " Questions ( Yes / no , or just a few possible answers ) ( " digital - style " questions )
What is the genre of the game ?
Is it competitive or cooperative ?
Is it Symmetric or Asymmetric ?
Is it Zero-sum ( ZS ) or Non-zero -sum ?
How many ( human ) " sides " ( generally , 1 , 2 , or many ) and ( human ) players ?
Is this an " emergent " / rules - dominant game or a " role- assumption " / story - dominant game ?
Spectrum Questions ( a wide range of possibilities along a spectrum , " analog - style " questions )
How " big " and how long will the game be ?
How complex is the game ?
What is the level of action or " granularity " ?
What is the role of chance , how much does chance play a part in the game ?
How strongly will the decisions of the players influence the outcome of the game ?
Which kind of skill does a player need to use , adaptability , or planning ?
Which kind of skill does a player need , quick reactions ( typical in shooters , for example ) , or careful deliberation ?
What is the level of Fluidity or Chaos ?
Is the game largely " mechanical " or " psychological " ?
Other Questions
What is the outstanding mechanism involved ?
What are the dynamics of being ahead or behind in the game ?
What phases does the game naturally fall into ?
Is the game " serious " or " just for laughs " ?
Is the game " ruthless " or " nice " ( a competition or an entertainment )
" Distinct " Questions
What is the genre of the game ?
This is related to theme / story , and is very important in electronic games , less so in non-electronic .
Genres might be " sweep of history " game , " shooter " , role - playing game , real - time strategy game , resource management game , etc .
But a designer may not think about genre to begin with , and may end up with a game that defies standard genre - categorization .
Is it competitive or cooperative ?
Most of the time the game will be competitive , but occasionally , all ( or almost all ) of the players will cooperate with each other .
" Co-op " , to an electronic gamer , means two or more players cooperating against the computer , say in a " shooter " game .
On the non-electronic side we have Reiner Knizia 's Lord of the Rings game , where all players cooperate , and Days of Wonder 's Shadows Over Camelot , where there might be a traitor amongst the players ; in both cases the game system provides the opposition .
Is it Symmetric or Asymmetric ?
Symmetric -- similar starting positions / forces ( typical of abstract games )
Asymmetric -- different starting positions or forces , and sometimes different objectives , typical of historical simulations
AAA electronic games are often symmetric from player to player , except that there may be asymmetry coming from different starting characters .
StarCraft ( as many other RTS games ) is asymmetric because the three races are functionally different .

Premise : Rules should be applied consistently within a system .
Explanation : Inconsistency in the application of rules results in both a lack of clarity for the observer and an inherently self - contradictory system — in short , it is n’t a valid system at all .
Premise : A sentence is a system .
Explanation : Sentences are systems of words which , in relationship to one another according to rules of grammar , conveys the emergent property of meaning .
Premise : A paragraph is a system .
Explanation : Paragraphs are systems of sentences which , in causal and elaborative relation to one another , give rise to greater detail and more ability to elaborate upon abstract concepts .
Premise : A document is a system .
Explanation : Documents are systems of paragraphs which , in relation to one another as focus discoursive divisions of the document , mutually support the purpose of the document ’s composition .
Given the rules of grammar , where referring to something in the past tense and in the present tense in two separate clauses without implying separate chronological contexts , one does not construct a valid system by composing a sentence that employs an inconsistent sequence of tenses .
That is to say that “ I will did that ! ” is an example of an invalid grammatical system , simply because the sequence of tenses ( “ I [ future tense ] [ past tense ] that ! ” ) is inconsistent .
While it is easier to shift chronological context within a paragraph , and even easier within a complete document , so that a valid sequence of tenses can be observed without always using the same tense , there are still definite requirements for a valid sequence of tenses that can be violated .
Similarly , subject - verb agreement is a matter of consistently applying grammatical rules to construct a valid system .
Such consistency is most often violated when someone fails to make the inflected forms of a noun and a verb match up for plurality .
An example of a failure of subject - verb agreement would be a statement suck as the following :
The national budget is $ 3.5 trillion , which are a lot of dollars .
That should say is , not are .
This is because “ $ 3.5 trillion ” is a measurement , which is a ( collective ) singular noun .
By the same token , one says “ three hundred miles is a long distance to walk , ” rather than “ are a long way to walk ” .
Now consider the case of a company or band , or some other organization .
A radical descriptivist interpretation of subject - verb agreement suggests that this is a reasonable use of the language :
Exxon Mobil Corporation are n’t very popular any longer , thanks to the 1989 oil spill .
The use of “ are n’t ” here implies that “ Exxon Mobil Corporation ” is a plural noun .
Let ’s try making it a more generic reference :
The corporation are n’t very popular any longer , thanks to the 1989 oil spill .
Okay , that might sound a little clumsier , and raise arguments that I ’ve changed the subject from one type of noun to another .
Let ’s use the second type of noun , though , in a formulation that is often used in this manner by the aforementioned radical descriptivists :
The band are n’t going to the after - party for their own CD release .
Consider , however , that the same organization could be referred to using a less particular particle :
A band are n’t going to the after - party for their own CD release .
That sounds like a load of grammatical hash .
It does n’t work .
It ’s clumsy and obviously wrong .
Even those radical descriptivists would probably agree .
Let ’s examine two adjacent sentences that could appear in a paragraph , though :
A band made an announcement .
They are n’t going to the after - party for their own CD release .
In this example , a band ( treated as singular ) is referred to in the first sentence , and a pronoun for the band ( treated as plural ) is referred to in the second sentence .
These radical descriptivists probably do n’t see any problem with this , but other , similar grammatical disagreements within a single paragraph would drive many of them up the wall .
Somehow , to such radical descriptivists , the rules are inviolably set in stone , except that when “ everybody does it ” it suddenly becomes okay .
Given the progression from sentence as grammatical system , through paragraph as system of sentences , to document as system of paragraphs , consistent application of the rules of grammar is necessary to construct a valid system .
This should , in principle , apply not only to the actual manifestations of grammatical rules within the system , but the potential uses of rules .
Because there are cases where a collective singular noun such as “ Exxon Mobil Corporation ” or “ Motörhead ” must be referred to using singular pronouns and verbs , plural pronouns and verbs used in the same way are less correct — because they imply an inconsistency in the application of rules within the system .
The real fun , of course , comes when the radical descriptivists ’ position on something like this — the position that a valid system is not a requirement for “ good ” grammar — becomes the normative position .
Particularly in certain regions , such as England ( ironically the home of people who use phrases like “ the Queen ’s English ” and other look - down - the - nose descriptors to imply nobody else does English correctly ) , the use of a collective singular noun with verbs and pronouns implying plurality is popularly regarded as perfectly acceptable .
That does n’t make it correct , though .
No number of Google hits , no equivocations by descriptivist linguists , and no amount of hand waving will change the fact that a system constructed via inconsistent application of rules is an invalid system .

( This is an important subject but I do n’t have time to write a full article on this so here ’s my quick take on two new studies — Steve )
77 lucky Harvard student volunteers experienced a nearly 70 percent increase in urinary levels of bisphenol A ( BPA ) , a plastics component and synthetic estrogen linked to cancer , after drinking cold beverages from baby bottles for ONE WEEK .
— Research by Harvard University and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published May 13 .
The bottles were made of made of polycarbonate , a common hard plastic often used to make reusable bottles / containers among other things .
BPA is used to make most polycarbonate and evidently leaches into the water or whatever is in the container .
Another study published May 12 shows that very small amounts of BPA affects the growth of tadpoles : “ Bisphenol A stifles thyroid hormone and slows frog development ” — this is an easy to read summary from Environmental Health News .
Bottom Line :
“ The study confirms past research showing BPA interferes with thyroid hormone ( Goto et al. 2006 , Iwamuro et al. 2006 ) .
It is also consistent with studies that show BPA slows and alters development . ”
What you can do :
1. Use Glass or Steel Containers – all liquids taste much better in these
2. Insist that plastic containers for water - pop - soda are banned in your workplace , community , district .
3. Lobby for bottle return deposit systems —
These are still in place in much of the world and they work fine .

California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has unveiled a plan to save money by phasing out school textbooks in favour of internet aids .
Gov Schwarzenegger wants to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in state spending each year .
He says converting to online study will also help keep pupils more up - to - date .
California is facing a state budget gap of $ 24.3bn and Gov Schwarzenegger on Monday scrapped funding for contracts entered into after 1 March .
' Every penny '
The BBC's Rajesh Mirchandani says Gov Schwarzenegger believes internet activities such as Facebook , Twitter and downloading to iPods show that young people are the first to adopt new online technologies , and so the internet is also the best way to learn in classrooms .

From the beginning of the next school year in August , maths and science students in California 's high schools will have access to online texts that have passed an academic standards review .
The governor says digital textbooks can be updated easily - so learning keeps pace with progress .
But our correspondent says the real reason Gov Schwarzenegger wants the change is money .
Last year California spent $ 350 m on textbooks and can no longer afford it .
Authorities are making deep cuts to tackle the budget deficit .
On Monday , Gov Schwarzenegger signed an executive order to scrap funding on contracts from 1 March and bar state agencies from entering into new ones .
He said : " Every state agency and department will scrutinise how every penny is spent on contracts to make sure the state is getting the best deal for every taxpayer dollar . "
The Republican governor has ruled out imposing higher taxes to meet the shortfall .
Last month voters rejected a raft of Gov Schwarzenegger 's proposals to tackle the deficit .

Hi everyone .
I am Shenasaee .
Welcome to my blog , I will share everything in my life to this blog . :)
It ’s gratifying to see that Gliese 581 e lands right on a trend line that ’s held up for over two decades and a factor of two thousand in planetary mass .
It ’s amazing that within a year , we ’ll be in possession of genuinely Earth - mass planets orbiting nearby stars .
Exoplanetary science has been in high gear now for fifteen years ; the first Earth - mass planets are a big - picture milestone , on par with the discoveries of 51 Peg b , Ups And c and d , HD 209458 b and Gliese 876 d. Even more significantly , I think that an Earth - mass planet on the books is going to catalyze a huge shift in emphasis from planetary detection to planetary characterization .
The first Mars - mass exoplanet will be met with considerably less acclaim than the first Earth - mass planet .
In coming years , the marquee goal of planet hunting will be to locate both representative and particularly unusual planets around the brightest stars possible …
Demand for Ammo Depletes Stores ' Stock
Gun shops nationwide say they can't keep ammunition on the shelves .
ATLANTA , April 19 , 2009  --
Where have all the bullets gone ?
That 's the question many gun shop owners across the nation are asking in the wake of an ammunition shortage .
At Georgia Arms , an ammunition and reloading supplies company outside of Atlanta , the machines that make bullets spit out 4,000 rounds of ammo every hour , and that 's not nearly enough .
" We have been running pretty much around the clock for the last two or three months , " Georgia Arms co-owner Curtis Shipley said .
Shipley has been in the ammunition business for three decades .
He 's never seen a shortage like this .
" We literally have got folks come up and just hand me $ 200 and say , ' How much ammo can I get . '
I 've never seen that before . "
Shipley said .
The demand has been so huge that Georgia Arms can't keep up .
Shipping for new orders is being delayed by five to seven weeks .
It 's not much different at gun stores , where the ammo aisles look just like grocery store shelves before a hurricane .
Gun owners like Dennis Cantrell have been looking for ammunition , but can't find any .
" We 've called several places to try to find some .45 ammunition and no luck . "
So why are the shelves empty ?
Gun shop owner Jay Wallace said it is largely because of the election of Barack Obama .
Fear that the president will change gun laws is prompting many gun owners to store up as much ammo as they can , as fast as they can .
" They are afraid they are not going to be able to get ammunition anymore , " said Wallace .
" So they are buying it and stockpiling it . "
According to Wallace , it 's a flashback to the seventies when there was supposedly a sugar shortage .
When people heard there was a shortage , they came in and bought up all the sugar there was , in effect creating it .
Consumers are n't the only ones to blame , however .
Years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan have also depleted the supply of ammunition because suppliers are required to give the military first choice .
The shortage of ammunition is also putting the squeeze on local police departments .
At the firing range in Cobb County , Ga. , officers simply cannot afford to take as many practice shots as they once could .
Police Told to Bring Own Ammo
" It 's no longer you can shoot what you want to shoot on an open range day , " Cobb County Police Department Sgt. Dan Ferrell said .
" You only get 50 rounds and that 's it and they go home . "
Ferrell said some departments are even encouraging officers to bring their own ammunition for training sessions .
To conserve even more , the department is also doing more training in a simulator to keep from wasting a single bullet .
US Gen Stanley McChrystal said Nato troops must make a " cultural shift " away from being a force designed for high intensity combat and instead make protecting Afghan civilians their first priority .
The newly arrived four - star commander said he hopes to install a new military mindset by drilling into troops the need to reduce the number of Afghan civilians killed in combat .
Gen McChrystal is expected to formally announce new combat rules within days that will order troops to break away from fights - if they can do so safely - if militants are firing from civilian homes .
One effect of the new order will be that troops may have to wait out insurgents instead of using force to oust them , he said .
" Traditionally American forces are designed for conventional , high - intensity combat , " Gen McChrystal said during a visit to Camp Leatherneck , a new US Marine base housing thousands of newly deployed Marines in southern Helmand province .
" In my mind what we 've really got to do is make a cultural shift . "
Because the military is such a big organisation , the new message will take " constant repetition , " he said .
President Hamid Karzai has pleaded with Nato forces for years to reduce the number of Afghan villagers killed in combat .
Mr Karzai has long said that such deaths turn civilians away from the government and international forces and toward the Taliban , a point Gen McChrystal underlined .
" When you do anything that harms the people you just have a huge chance of alienating the population , " he said .
" And so even with the best of intentions , if our operation causes them to lose property or loved ones , there is almost no way somebody cannot be impacted in how they view the government and us , the coalition forces . "
Gen McChrystal , who took command of all Nato troops in Afghanistan last week , is making his first visits to regional commanders to outline the new combat rules .
Brig Gen John Nicholson , the Marine commander at Camp Leatherneck , said his forces were already following Gen McChrystal 's new commands .
" Our focus from the very beginning has not been Taliban .
It 's been civilians , " he said .
" We 've paid a lot of attention to avoiding civilian casualties .
...
We have a lot of combat vets , a lot of Iraq vets .
And I think we learned early on the importance of trust and support of the locals . "
He added : " There will be plenty of opportunities to kill Taliban , and we 're pretty good at that .
Bur the focus here , the reason we 're here , is the people , not the Taliban . "
The Pentagon has asked Gen McChrystal for a 60 - day review of the Afghan war , a review that could result in a recommendation to shift troops to new locations in Afghanistan .
Gen McChrystal said he did n't yet know if he would request more troops .
The Pentagon abruptly pulled McChrystal 's predecessor - Gen David McKiernan - out of Afghanistan one year into a two - year assignment .
Gen McChrystal said his deployment did not have a timetable to it , and that he would stay in Afghanistan as long as the Pentagon wanted him there .
He refused to give even an estimate of how long that might be , saying : " My wife would kill me if she read something too long .
I do think continuity is key , though . "
Belfast Telegraph
A woman pleaded no contest last week to prostitution charges , accused of agreeing to be paid for services with a box of chips by a man who said he was a Frito - Lay employee .
Lahoma Sue Smith , 36 , was ordered to pay a fine of $ 1,142 in municipal court from charges from a February arrest .
According to the police report , undercover officers noticed Smith " trying to catch a date ” by flashing her headlights at SE 33 and Robinson .
Officers said they followed Smith ’s car and found her with her blouse open and found a man in the passenger seat pulling his pants up .
The man told police he was having marital problems and knew he could pick up a prostitute there .
Smith told police the man told her he was looking for company but he did n’t have any money , so she agreed to be paid with a $ 30 case of Frito - Lay chips he had in the back of his car .
When asked if she had ever been arrested for prostitution , Smith told police " Yes .
Two or three times , ” authorities said .
Smith was arrested on complaints of prostitution and suspicion of driving with a suspended license .
The man was not arrested .
A police spokesman said the man was not arrested based on " officer discretion . "
The current crisis in Iran is not 4GW .
It is a struggle for control of a state , not an attempt to replace the state with something else .
However , it could prove a harbinger of 4GW in Iran , because what is at stake is the legitimacy of current Iranian political system .
In a manner that was cynical , blatant , and remarkably stupid , the Khamenei / Ahmadinejad regime in effect toyed with its own legitimacy .
Nightwatch for June 19 quotes Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei as saying in his Friday public sermon , " There is an 11 - million - vote difference .
How can one rig 11 million votes ? "
The answer is , " Not without people taking notice . "
Stalin , whose cynicism was legendary – one of his remarks was , " The death of one man is a tragedy ; the death of a million men is a statistic " – also said , " What is important is not who votes .
What is important is who counts the votes . "
But throughout the history of the Soviet Union , the Communist Party was careful to seem to take elections with the utmost seriousness .
It knew the pretense was important for its legitimacy .
In contrast , the Iranian regime in effect laughed as it rigged its election ’s outcome , saying to the Iranian people and the world , " Rig the elections ?
Of course we rigged the elections .
What are you going to do about it , sucker ? "
The fact that the outcome was announced within three hours of the polls closing suggests they did not count the votes at all .
The Interior Ministry was just told what numbers to put down on the tally sheets .
Now it has blown up in the regime ’s face , in the worst kind of crisis any government can face , a crisis of legitimacy .
The Iranian opposition is able to say , " You did not play by the rules you wrote . "
That is a powerful rallying cry anywhere in the world .
The Iranian people have rallied , by the millions , to the opposition .
Iran is in the midst of the greatest upheaval since the revolution that overthrew the shah .
Like governments everywhere , Khamenei seems unable to grasp that he faces a crisis not merely of leadership but of legitimacy .
Had he grasped that essential fact , he would have professed to be " shocked , shocked " by the electoral fraud , dumped Ahmadinejad , and devoted himself to showing Iran ’s political system works .
Instead , he has decided to keep himself and Ahmadinejad in power by force .
Monday ’s Washington
Post quotes the opposition ’s leader , Mir Hossein Mousavi , as saying , " Shooting at the people , militarizing the city , scaring the people , provoking them , and displaying power are all the result of the unlawfulness we ’re witnessing today . "
Force may keep the current regime in power , but it also completes the destruction of its legitimacy .
Fourth Generation theory warns that when a government loses its legitimacy and attempts to retain power by naked force , it weakens the state itself .
Iran has been a relatively stable state .
But there is no guarantee it will remain so .
Iran includes many different ethnic groups , not just Persians .
If the opposition , which is loyal to the Iranian state , is suppressed by force , Iranians may start to transfer their loyalty away from the state .
The current crisis in Iran also reveals a fracture Fourth Generation theory sometimes overlooks , a break on urban / rural lines .
Ahmadinejad is genuinely popular in much of rural Iran .
His rural strength might have allowed him to win an election where the votes were actually counted .
The opposition , in turn , appears to be almost entirely urban .
Its urban strength is what has allowed it to contest the announced electoral results with mass marches .
Urban /rural splits were common before the state arose .
They sometimes led to bloody wars , usually in the form of peasant revolts .
Exactly how they might play out in a Fourth Generation world is difficult to guess .
Iran may offer an interesting test case .
But the larger lesson from events in Iran is one this column has harped on : few if any governments are able to perceive a crisis of legitimacy .
Any governing system in time becomes a closed system , into which the question of legitimacy is not allowed to penetrate .
To raise it is lèse - majesté .
So long as that remains the case , the state system will grow more fragile .

In researching a sequel to The Man Who Fell to Earth , director Sam Bozzo ran across Maude Barlow 's and Tony Clarke 's Blue Gold : The Fight to Stop the Corporate Theft of the World 's Water , and decided that his efforts would be better spent making a documentary to alert the world to the ongoing and increasing global water crisis .
The result is sort of a meld between Godfrey Reggio 's 1982 documentary Koyaanisqatsi and Al Gore 's An Inconvenient Truth .
It has the frenetic pacing and gorgeous filming of the former , and the onslaught of increasingly alarming information of the latter .
It 's a formula that is effective , but has some pitfalls .
The film is divided into essentially four parts .
The first presents " The Crisis , " and provides the essentials of the water cycle and how human activity affects and is affected by that cycle .
Second is " The Politics , " which introduces the transnational corporate players in the privatization and commoditization of water and the popular resistance around the world to keep it 's water .
Next is " The Water War , " a short history of the ancient and bloody history of water and the control of it .
Finally , " The Way Forward , " a gratifying end to the story .
The first three parts of the story are in fact where the film is the weakest by virtue of being so frenetic .
At least three films ' worth of information is provided in these sections , and the shortcuts in presenting the information start to accumulate and become glaring .
The largest problem : many very provocative statements , like " Much of the world 's fresh water is polluted beyond human use , " or " Every single drop of fresh water will be privately owned and controlled , " are presented without documentation and without rebuttal .
In cramming so much information in , in jumping from country to country , threads are lost .
When many statistics are presented they are given without qualification -- are we talking about the U.S. , Kenya , India , or the globe ?
There 's often no timeframe presented -- are the figures for water usage monthly , annual ?
This sloppiness can set off small alarm bells in the critical viewer 's mind that have the potential of undermining the larger message .
Without sourcing for many of the scientific claims , you have to wonder about some of the other claims made and how that colors the film 's political message .
It 's clear to any disinterested observer that that the large corporate interests exposed in the film -- Coca Cola , Suez , Nestle , Bechtel - - are n't in the water business for the public good .
They see the tremendous profitability of holding the rights to one of the most basic human necessities -- they can't lay claim to oxygen ( though undoubtedly some corporate lawyer somewhere has been trying to work that one out ) , but they can water , and where they can , they will .
So when the filmmakers stretch certain facts , independently verifiable facts , it weakens their case .
For instance , the film implies that a handful of multinationals either own or control the water supply for some major American cities .
One city they included is my own , Seattle , where they said that RWE / Thames controls the water , which is not true .
Checking this claim , I found another reviewer , a freshwater expert from Oregon State University who clued into this problem , too , and called the water departments in some of the cities mentioned ( Seattle , Las Vegas , New York ) and determined that the claim was not true .
It also delves lightly into real tinfoil territory , tying George Bush 's interest in buying property in Paraguay to the Guarani aquifer , which underlies Brazil , Uruguay , Paraguay , and Argentina .
It 's here where you really wish you had Al Gore and his PowerPoint slides .
The water issue deserves the same kind of passionate , but very factually - based , presentation that An Inconvenient Truth provides .
Interestingly , this is another area in which the film is lacking : drawing a connection between global warming and water resources .
One almost gets the sense that the water people , in this case Maude Barlow , founder of the Blue Planet Project in Canada , Tony Clarke , founder of the Polaris Institute ( Barlow and Clarke are coauthors of the book that inspired this documentary ) and Michal Kravcik , a Slovak scientist and founder of the NGO People and Water , are in competition with the " climate change " people for who has the most critical crisis .
Kravcik , in fact , argues that climate change is a result of water mismanagement , and that solving the water problem will end global warming .
On the other hand , there is tremendous inspiration in the film when it shows the stories of the water activists .
Oscar Olivera is a Bolivian industry worker , who led the popular uprising in Cochabamba in 2000 against Bechtel , which had taken over their water systems as an IMF - imposed condition for debt relief .
Ryan Hrejlac is a Canadian teenager who raised 470 when he was 7 years old to buy a well for an African village .
He turned that one well into a non-profit , the Ryan ’s Well Foundation , that has thus far raised $ 2,000,000 to build 319 wells in 114 counties and has provided nearly half a million African people fresh water .
Then there 's the Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation , a group that has been fighting a multi-million dollar law suit against a Nestle water bottling plant that would set precedent for Great Lakes water export law .
There are other , smaller stories -- the townspeople of Fryeberg , Maine , who take Poland Springs water , bottled from their own watershed , and pour it back into the source .
Finally , there 's 3rd grader Noah Cottrell in Michigan , whose story is told over the credits .
He got his school district and local stores to stop selling Ice Mountain bottled water when he learned how the bottling plant was draining the local watershed .
The film also talks about the very real limits to some of the solutions that have been forwarded so far , particularly desalination which has extremely high energy costs in its current form .
The same is true for water export in the form of " bagging " water , huge bladders that are filled with fresh water and towed over the oceans .
The documentary in turn makes a strong case for community - based actions and solutions .
These include Kravcik 's Blue Alternative project , sort of a CCC that puts young people to work creating microbasins to catch and store water , slowing runoff , recharging aquifers , and restoring wetlands .
It talks about cities experimenting with replacing concrete sidewalks and asphalt with cobble stones and systems that filter rainwater back into groundwater systems , rather than running off into storm drains and eventually out to sea .
It shows the fascinating hydroponic farm at Epcot Center , where water is cycled from ponds growing talapia through the crops and back again .
It talks intelligently about the need for agricultural reform , for growing what 's sustainable in any given watershed and recognizing the limits to growth that water supply should dictate .
It talks about the very basics of living within the limits of watersheds .
The simple things of low flow appliances , conservation , turning the water off when shaving or brushing teeth , or using dual flush toilets .
And it demands that the viewer think about their water and " become the water guardians of the 21st century . "
In doing so , Helen Sarakinos , Director of River Restoration for the River Alliance of Wisconsin , gives the four questions that every person needs to think about and find the answers to :
What water is in my backyard ?
What 's the name of the watershed I live in ?
Where does my drinking water come from ?
Where does my waste water go ?
If the film does nothing other than make the viewer think about the water they use every day and where it comes from , it 's worth seeking out and spending 90 minutes of your life watching .
If it further makes the viewer realize the absurdity of spending $ 2.00 for a plastic container of the stuff they could get out of their tap for something like $ 0.005 , then it 's really done its job .
To that end , here are some things to think about the next time you 're reaching for that plastic container of water :
• The energy used each year making the bottles needed to meet the demand for bottled water in the United States is equivalent to more than 17 million barrels of oil .
That 's enough to fuel over 1 million cars for a year .
•
If water and soft drink bottlers had used 10 % recycled materials in their plastic bottles in 2004 , they would have saved the equivalent of 72 million gallons of gasoline .
If they had used 25 % , they would have saved enough energy to electrify more than 680,000 homes for a year .
•
In 2003 , the California Department of Conservation estimated that roughly three million water bottles are trashed every day in that state .
At this rate , by 2013 the amount of unrecycled bottles will be enough to create a two - lane highway that stretches the state 's entire coast .
•
In 2004 the recycling rate for all beverage containers was 33.5 percent .
If it reached 80 percent , the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions would be the equivalent of removing 2.4 million cars from the road for a year .
•
That bottle that takes just three minutes to drink can take up to a thousand years to biodegrade .

People around the world are dying over this stuff that has landed on your grocer 's shelf .
This documentary really does force you to ask if the social , environmental , and political cost of paying Coca Cola , or Nestle , or Bechtel , for that water is worth it .
Date : 2 Jan 2003 06:32:23 - 0000 Dear Ms. Tarzian : I 'm writing to you to ask for clarification of UIC 's policies regarding a recent idea of mine .
I just read your office 's web pages advertising the Online Measurement System ( CR18 ) invention .
My new idea involves a level of creativity similar to the level displayed by that invention , and has a much wider potential market .
Perhaps UIC is interested in obtaining a patent on this idea , and promoting transfer of this technology to an industrial partner , for the benefit of both UIC and the general public .
The invention is a Soap Saver Dish .
The Soap Saver Dish is a plastic holder for soap .
It has several prongs reaching up out of a tray .
Soap can sit on top of the prongs , while soapy water collects in the tray .
The prongs reach higher than the edge of the tray , so that water collected in the tray does not touch the soap .
The prior art includes two types of soap holders : * A soap dish is a tray .
It holds soap in place , and collects soapy water , keeping the soapy water off the underlying surface ( unless the soap dish overflows ) .
It does not prevent the soap from resting in water and turning to mush . * A soap saver has several prongs reaching up from a flat surface .
It holds the soap in place above that surface , preventing the soap from turning to mush .
It does not collect soapy water .
The Soap Saver Dish combines the advantages of soap dishes and soap savers .
It appears to be new .
The closest prior art I have found in my market research is a soap dish with prongs at the same height as the top of the tray ; this fails to keep the soap out of the water when the tray is full .
The Soap Saver Dish avoids that problem .
Specific questions : 1 . Does this idea constitute ``intellectual property '' under the University of Illinois Policy on Patents and Copyrights ?
Please explain your answer in enough detail that it can be independently verified .
2 . As I recall , I came up with this idea in the shower one morning .
Am I correct in concluding that , under the University of Illinois Policy on Patents and Copyrights , the university does not own this idea ?
Please explain your answer .
3 . Am I correct in concluding that I am under no obligation to report this idea to the university ?
Are there any relevant factors here other than the location in which I came up with the idea ?
Please explain your answer .
4 . Whether or not disclosure is required , I could assign patent rights in this idea to the university .
Is UIC interested in this idea ?
How does your office make these decisions ?
Date : 3 Jan 2003 08:29:24 - 0000 Dear Ms. Tarzian : I am writing to you regarding another recent idea of mine .
I have the same questions here that I had regarding the Soap Saver Dish .
The idea is a Two - Person Cookbook .
A normal recipe is a sequence of instructions for one cook to prepare a dish ; when two cooks want to work together , they have to figure out which instructions can be carried out in parallel , how to fairly divide the labor among the cooks , etc .
The Two - Person Cookbook already contains all this information in novel two - person recipes .
I should note that I received your previous message .
While I appreciate your statement of enthusiasm for the Soap Saver Dish , I cannot accept that statement as a substitute for clarification of UIC 's patent policies .
Does UIC require , or desire , disclosure of these ideas ?
Please explain your answers .
Date : 4 Jan 2003 05:14:10 - 0000 Dear Ms. Tarzian :
You said in your second message that works are ``outside the patent policy '' if they are not ``within the scope of your UIC employment in the Math Department . ''
But this begs the question : exactly what items are ``within the scope '' of my employment ?
Here 's another recent idea of mine : Shared Exam Creation .
I 've noticed that professors often teach courses similar to courses taught before or taught at other universities .
Instead of repeating all the effort of course creation from scratch , they can combine efforts .
In particular , there 's tremendous redundancy in the creation of thousands of similar exams on a single topic ; a fraction of the effort would produce a pool of exam questions that everyone could use .
The pool could include answers , grading scales , statistics on student performance , etc .
Does this idea constitute ``intellectual property '' under the patent policy ?
Is this idea ``within the scope ' ' of my employment ?
If so , why ?
If not , why not ?
Date : 5 Jan 2003 09:52:08 - 0000 Dear Ms. Tarzian :
Here 's another idea I 've had : the Unkillable Alarm Clock .
I have the same questions about the Unkillable Alarm Clock that I had about the Soap Saver Dish , the Two - Person Cookbook , and Shared Exam Creation .
The Unkillable Alarm Clock makes noise for a preset amount of time .
It can not be turned off .
It has a battery backup so that it can not be usefully unplugged .
It comes with a security cable so that it can be locked to an unmovable piece of furniture .
It is built from reinforced steel so that it cannot be destroyed by a baseball bat .
In short , unlike a normal alarm clock , the Unkillable Alarm Clock ensures that the user does not simply turn the alarm off and go back to sleep .
Date : 6 Jan 2003 09:38:14 - 0000 Dear Ms. Tarzian :
Here 's another idea I 've had : Luggage Key Escrow .
As I 'm sure you 've heard , the government often needs to open luggage checked on commercial planes .
The Luggage Key Escrow idea is to deposit copies of luggage keys with the government , so that luggage can be safely locked without interfering with the government 's need to open the luggage .
Of course , electronic locks will allow simpler key management than traditional pin-tumbler locks .
Date : 7 Jan 2003 14:55:06 - 0000 Dear Ms. Tarzian :
Here 's another idea I 've had : Multiple TV Guide Channels .
Right now , a typical cable TV service has only one TV Guide Channel , which takes several minutes to present a complete TV listing .
With Multiple TV Guide Channels , the TV viewer can see the complete TV listing much more quickly .
The listing can be organized by channel , by time , by type of show , etc. ; with enough TV Guide Channels , listings organized in several different ways can be presented simultaneously .

Here 's another idea I 've had : Frequent Flyer Belt Buckles .
Airports have turned up the sensitivity on their metal detectors at security checkpoints .
Common metal belt buckles are now setting off the detectors , so passengers are forced to take their belts off .
Frequent Flyer Belt Buckles solve this problem : they are made of materials that do n't set off airport metal detectors .

Here 's another idea I 've had : AspiTonin .
Many people take daily doses of aspirin .
Many people take daily doses of melatonin .
An AspiTonin tablet contains both aspirin and melatonin , so that people who want both drugs can take a single tablet .
AspiTonin is also suitable for occasional use .

Here 's another idea I 've had : Internet Bus Locators .
It can be rather frustrating to plan bus travel , because buses almost never run on time .
An Internet Bus Locator is a web site that shows the current locations of buses and , possibly , updated estimates for the arrival times of the buses at subsequent stops , allowing passengers to adapt their schedules accordingly .
Date : 11 Jan 2003 09:45:28 - 0000 Dear Ms. Tarzian :
This is the tenth message I 've sent you on this topic .
Your responses so far really have n't been of any help in clarifying UIC 's policies .
Is there some reason you are n't answering my questions ?
Anyway , here 's another idea I 've had : Coin -Operated Elevators .
With Coin-Operated Elevators , instead of pressing an elevator button , the passenger inserts a coin into an appropriate slot .
Coin-Operated Elevators help shift the costs of running an elevator to the passengers who use the elevator .
They also discourage pranksters from annoying legitimate users by casually pressing random elevator buttons .

Here 's another idea I 've had : Surround - Sound Telephones .
Current telephones transmit a single sound channel .
Surround - Sound Telephones transmit several sound channels , allowing the listener to hear separate sounds from different directions .
Surround - Sound Telephones are particularly convenient for conference calls .
Date : 13 Jan 2003 19:46:41 - 0000 Dear Ms. Tarzian :
Here 's another idea I 've had : Weight Beaters .
Weight Beaters are a method of encouraging participants to lose weight .
A participant who does not lose the desired number of pounds in a month is beaten up .
This negative feedback can , of course , be combined with more traditional positive - feedback weight - loss mechanisms .

Here 's another idea I 've had : Cellular Clock Service .
My cell phone requires manual setting of the current time .
With Cellular Clock Service , the current date , time , time zone , etc. are transmitted by cell towers , for automatic use by cell phones .
Date : 15 Jan 2003 09:49:52 - 0000 Dear Ms. Tarzian :
Here 's another idea I 've had : Triple Toilet - Paper Rolls .
You may have noticed stores carrying packs of double rolls of toilet paper .
Each double roll carries twice as many square feet of paper as a single roll , typically 50 square feet instead of 25 square feet , with not much increase in the diameter .
Hey , if double is better , why not triple ?
A Triple Toilet - Paper Roll has three times as many square feet of paper as a single roll .
The relative increase in diameter from a double roll to a triple roll is even smaller than the increase from a single roll to a double roll .
Toilet - paper - roll holders can easily be selected to accommodate Triple Toilet - Paper Rolls .
Date : 16 Jan 2003 08:40:43 - 0000 Dear Ms. Tarzian :
Here 's another idea I 've had : Instant Balance Transfers .
Today , credit - card balance transfers typically take days to be debited by the new company , and days more to be credited by the old company .
There is no reason , in this age of modern communication technology , for balance transfers to take so long .
Instant Balance Transfers are debited and credited within minutes of being requested .
Date : 17 Jan 2003 12:13:32 - 0000 Dear Ms. Tarzian :
Here 's another idea I 've had : Count - Every - Last - Stride Elliptical Runners .
I noticed today that a Precor EFX 546 elliptical - runner exercise machine did n't count all my strides .
It showed 6006 strides at 32:59 ; I did a few more strides ; it reached its time limit of 33:00 and continued to show 6006 strides , ignoring the strides I had done in the final second .
I would have found this quite frustrating if it had made the difference between , say , 5998 and 6001 strides .
A Count - Every - Last - Stride Elliptical Runner is just like a Precor EFX 546 , but it counts all the strides performed by the user , including the strides performed in the last second .
Date : 18 Jan 2003 11:39:20 - 0000 Dear Ms. Tarzian :
Here 's another idea I 've had : Optional Library Book Tracking .
Sometimes I need to briefly consult a book that one of my colleagues has checked out of the library .
If I knew who had the book , I could simply drop by the right office and look at the book , with a minimum of fuss .
For privacy reasons , libraries normally do n't reveal who has checked out a book .
Optional Library Book
Tracking means that someone checking out a book can tell the library that this disclosure is okay .
Of course , the same information could be maintained on a third - party web page , but having the library publish the information is more convenient and more reliable .
Date : 19 Jan 2003 09:59:39 - 0000 Dear Ms. Tarzian :
Here 's another idea I 've had : Google Caller ID .
Normal Caller
ID reveals the phone number of a caller , and in some cases the name of the caller .
Google Caller ID reveals much more information : the results of a Google search for the phone number .
Like normal Caller ID , Google Caller ID can be performed automatically while the phone is ringing .
Date : 20 Jan 2003 11:29:33 - 0000 Dear Ms. Tarzian :
Here 's another idea I 've had : Internet Laundry Completion Notices .
Typical home laundry facilities include buzzers that alert the user when a load of laundry is done .
Buzzers do not work , however , when the user is far away from the laundry : for example , when the user starts a load in a laundry room in a typical high - rise apartment building and then goes back to his apartment .
With Internet Laundry Completion Notices , each washer and dryer sends email to the user when a load finishes .
Date : 21 Apr 2003 08:02:57 - 0000 Dear Ms. Tarzian : Several high - priority tasks over the past few months have forced me to delay some disclosures of patentable ideas .
Please accept my apologies ; I will endeavor to catch up as soon as possible .
I am , of course , aware of UIC 's budget cuts ; I hope that your office will , sometime soon , be able to successfully commercialize an invention , and thus help the university survive these difficult times .
Here 's the first item in my backlog : Raisin Bran Shipment Flipping .
As you are probably aware , raisins and bran have different densities .
Vigorous shaking of a box of raisin bran , such as the shaking that happens naturally during a truck shipment , will eventually separate the raisins from the bran , to the annoyance of the eventual raisin - bran consumer .
Raisin Bran Shipment
Flipping means periodically changing the orientation of a raisin - bran box : for example , shipping the box for an hour right side up , then an hour upside down , then an hour right side up , then an hour upside down , and so on .
Each change will reverse the direction of raisin flow through the bran , so that the raisins do not collect at one end of the box .
Date : 22 Apr 2003 04:32:59 - 0000 Dear Ms. Tarzian :
Here 's another idea I 've had : Caffeinated Mango Juice .
As the success of Mountain Dew ( sweetened caffeinated orange juice with other ingredients ) demonstrates , many caffeine users like to take their caffeine with large doses of sugar .
Surely some of these users are fans of the sweet taste of mangoes , and would switch to Caffeinated Mango Juice as their preferred morning drink if it were readily available .
